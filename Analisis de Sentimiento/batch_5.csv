154.Advance Wars,"Truly a standout title from the GBA era. This turn based strategy game has lots of content and hours of gameplay. A must have title for GBA collectors.. One of my favorite games of all time. I discovered my love for military strategy thanks to this wonderful game.. Military-style strategy game that's easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. Engrossing, addictive and the turn-based format lends itself perfectly to portable gaming. One of the very best strategy titles you can buy.. While appearing to be a strategy game on the surface, Advance Wars frequently devolves into trial and error. In maps with fog of war, enemy unit locations are expected to be memorized through repeated playthoughs of the same map. Repetitive and unrewarding, Advance Wars pads out a small modicum of content with clunky and slow missions, bafflingly full of lifeless storytelling and cringeworthy writing. A poor effort all around.. A wonderful tactic tank troops game, I really liked it, has so many types of units and the game is challenging, worth to play, the game is kinda addictive, but really knows how to handle situations.. I like this game more than Fire Emblem, although some failing in the AI and how unbalanced it is, it brings it down a little bit, also I think the game thinks it's funnier than it actually is, except with the interactions of Olaf and Grit, those were consistently hilarious.. One of the best strategy games ever made, and a timeless classic. The playtime and the amount of enjoyment you can get out of all of the featueres is insane.. Legendary game. Sadly it's just a bit worse that AW2 and DS, so there is no reason to play this game anyomore (Except for Advance Campagin, but seriousely, you should enjoy your live). Advance wars is an enjoyable if a little monotonous strategy game. The art style and general presentation still holds up 20 years later. And the music while good gets way over used and kind of lacks variety. The gameplay is fun and I really enjoyed the strategic elements that go into playing it. But the game I feel does tend to get very repetitive after a while of playing but as a handheld game it does work for just picking up and playing for short bursts. And while I liked the many characters in the games campaign the story is rather barebones and underwhelming. But still a fun experience non the less. The 1st real tactics game that got me into tactic game. So great and also has awesome sys link play.. One of the best game ever And we should have a sequel please please please.. Couldn't be any more satisfied with a video game. Hand helds are great and this game is one of the reason it was so.. The art style always scared me away, but wow I love this game. Even more than the sequel, but that's probably because I sank all my time into this one and replayed it and gave it that investment. It's a fun turn based strategy, but the real downfall is the mandatory tutorial.. A cute and simple strategy game which presents a variety of intriguing challenges alongside a fun learning curve. Advance Wars is especially notable for its unique ""round table"" multiplayer which is executed very well, especially for friendly and informal groups. Advance wars is a little bit slow-paced and built around some very old, tired grid-strategy game-design principles, but it is still fun nevertheless.. Such an excellent game that you will love playing if you like turn based strategy games.... one of the finest GBA games i have ever played in my life. the controls work perfect, there is much taught put into the story and the music is one of the best one the system. i love it!. WiiU owners: get it now! The game is great, simple but it works so well. Many different modes, in depth strategy. If you love the genre, you'll love this game.. Look i love fire emblem and this is just fire emblem but with tanks and war it has a battle sister so deep that i just kept loosing units because i didn't know it very well but after learning the tutorial that has a story yes a tutorial with story i didn't know what to do i checked vs mode but i didn't liked it it is really good the game has a fire emblem style but it lacks things like a story mode. a good game but needed more modes.. Very addicting game.. First time I chose to play a game with a different genre in a while; IGN made me get this game for giving it their highest score for a GBA game (9.9/10), and I thank them; the first time I played this, I was hooked; the tutorial mode is definitely essential; what really makes this game worthwhile is it's so long, and has so many maps to play on; you can play multiplayer in one system, taking turns, which is great; it is definitely an intense game and one of the best games ever made. oh t joy on my face when it arrived from amazon, yay i have it. Well worth it as you will probably spend hours on end figuring out the later puzzles. I enjoyed it even more as i picked it up for a fiver!","military-style strategy game that's easy to pick up and play but challenging to master . clunky and slow missions, bafflingly full of lifeless storytelling and cringeworthy writing . sadly it's just a bit worse than AW2 and DS so there is no reason to play this game anymore ."
155.Vagrant Story,"This game was decades ahead of its time. Probably one of the best game for the PS1.. From the makers of Final Fantasy and one of the greatest games ever made. I hope that one day it gets remastered. Gamers these days may find the puzzles and combat difficult. It doesn't hold your hand and play the game for you like many modern games do. But a little perseverance and it becomes amazing. The combat is incredible. The story is epic. This is an adult Final Fantasy set in a fantastic fantasy dungeon.. One of the greatest PS1 games ever made, this was Squaresoft at its best. Yes, its difficult but this is one of the reasons I really liked it. I remember there was a boss duo that was extremely difficult but could only be accessed in NG+ which was almost unheard of at the time. I put this game right up there with Parasite Eve.. First off, the story is like delving into a rich, dark novel. It's not your typical plot; it's intricate, mysterious, and keeps you hooked at every twist. The atmosphere is this perfect blend of eerie and captivating, drawing you right into the heart of the **** let's talk gameplay – and oh boy, does VS deliver. The risk system adds this intense edge to combat that's both thrilling and rewarding. This isn't mindless button-mashing; it's a thinking gamer's paradise. And the weapon customization? Pure brilliance. Crafting your arsenal to suit your style adds a satisfying layer of personalization.Graphically, it's not pushing the PS1 to its limits, but the art style is a visual feast. The gritty, medieval aesthetic perfectly complements the game's tone. And the music? It's like a symphony of atmospheric brilliance. Each note enhances the mood, making every moment ****, the learning curve is something to reckon with. This isn't a casual stroll; it's a challenge, and it might take a bit to master. But once you do, it's pure gaming **** summary, ""Vagrant Story"" isn't just a game – it's an experience. For those who appreciate a deep storyline, strategic combat, and atmospheric brilliance, this PS1 classic deserves a spot in the hall of gaming greatness. Grab your controller, prepare for a challenge, and dive into a world that's as mysterious as it is mesmerizing.. Just impossible to play. Even if you endured the absurd difficulty, you only play with one character for some reason, which makes it repetitive and boring. I never understood the fame this game has, its barel playable.. Yet another incredible game from Square during the PlayStation era. They were on fire.. First of all, I wouldn't say this game has aged particularly well. The games that try to push the limits of their hardware in terms of gameplay and graphics tend to age the worst - see Golden Eye as an example - and Vagrant Story fits that. At the time I'm sure its graphics and gameplay were revolutionary but they havent aged well. On top of that, the game is very gameplay heavy - theres no towns or NPCs to interact with, its a straight up dungeon crawler. So its kind of a chore to play today. That said, I try to keep in mind how a game would be like when it released. And I can see how brilliant this was. The combat system might be somewhat tedious today, but there is still nothing like it. I love the ideas here and when it works its quite engaging and fun. What really sells this game is the art style, the dialogue, the characters and the story. Right from the start it blew me away with how tight the writing was. There's simply nothing on the PS1 that rivals the quality of the dialogue and writing here. Thats not to say that the story is the best I've come across, it isnt, that it has some cliches that I've experienced too many times. But its solid and its presented very well through great dialogue and excellent art style that really shines in the cutscenes. I usually think the writing in JRPGs is the weakest link, so its quite refreshing to come across a game like this. Its very mature and complex. I'd say its ahead of its time but in terms of combat complexity and narrative quality JRPGs only went downhill from here. I'd give an 8 for its time and 6 now, so lets call it 7.. Oh what a unique game. I never beat this game as a kid and now i see why, this game is hard and there's no holding hand here, the game expect you to learn and explore by your own. That's just so good and rare in today's industry. The story is mature, cryptic, convoluted and is presented with a strangely good camera work for PS1 generation. Only two things I would have liked to be better: first, I would have liked the armor changes to be reflected in Ashley appearance, just like weapons do. And more important, this game NEEDS a quick weapon swap! The game demands you to have the right weapon for the right enemy, you need at least 3 different affinity weapons at all time and it's a pain to be changing weapons on the normal menu, this game needs a d-pad quick weapon swap. Can believe Square just forgot about this gem, it totally deserve to have a sequel.. This is the best game ever, I've played this so much in my childhood,the combat system is so good, I hope someday get a remake.. It has a deep story full of twists and characters hidden agendas, a great battle system and exploration elements from a Metroidvania. Atop of this for its time it has excellent graphics and a really memorable soundtrack. It is a mixture from action RPG with a lot of strategic elements and a Dungeon Crawler. It is set in Ivalice the same world as Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy 12. However I think it is far later in the timeline as many the fantasy elements are missing and magic is something that is not common knowledge if I remember correct. You are playing as Ashley Riot who is a Riskbreaker. Those are special agents deployed only at really dangerous missions. Like a fantasy “Mission Impossible” squad but with the expected death toll. If I remember correctly the game sources say that 50% of all Riskbreaker’s do not survive their first mission and later missions have still a double digit death risk. Ashley however is one of the few veterans that survived many assignments. Shortly before the games story Ashley was sent to investigate Duke Bardorba’s estate as he has ties with the mysterious Müllencamp cult. There he meets briefly their leader Sydney Losstarot who has incredible magic abilities and Sydney abducted the Dukes son before he escapes. The story starts when Ashley together with fellow Riskbreaker Callo is set to the abandoned city of Lea Monde which is on a dangerous to reach Island of the coast and holds many secrets to find Sydney Losstarot and free the Dukes son. However others also have intention to find him. With this the story starts. It has a lot of depth. Nothing is as easy or direct as it (firstly) seems as there are hidden layers and plots or agendas at play. With each twist and reveal you unlock more and more of the truth. At the end of the story I was deeply impressed. The gameplay is excellent but definitely something you have to put attention to as it can be a bit overwhelming at first. Lets start with the battle system. It has elements from Parasite Eve 1. You move in real time through 3D rooms until you tap the attack button. Now a dome / spherical grid appears displaying the range. Now you can attack an enemy and with the correct timing make a long chain of attacks if you hit the corresponding attack button (A ! mark is shown as help and you can use different types of attacks out of the available once and some have additional effects). Many say it is like a rhythm game and I agree. Beware that long chain have a negative effect. There is the “Risk” system. Long chains add risk points (the longer the more). With these your defense, accuracy and evasion is lowered which can be devastating. There are also defensive abilities that decrease damage or avoid status effects. Each weapon has some proficiency or elements. There is the type like slash, piercing or blunt, an element like fire, earth, water etc. and its usefulness against an enemy type like humans, lizards etc. The higher the rating the better the damage. Also using it against a type increase a value but can decrease the opposite too (Fire decreases water and vice versa for example). There is more to it as there are different materials, gems that can be inserted and special abilities for each of the many types of weapons. It is quite interesting to make or improve new weapons but can be overwhelming first. I use multiple weapons for different types of enemies. Then there is the exploration which is like a Metroidvania game. Lea Monde is huge and there is a lot to explore. There are optional areas, hidden secrets and shortcuts to unlock. It was already marketed with a slogan like “Your second problem is fighting this man and your first is finding him”. It is really enjoyable to explore the world but remember not everything can be found in the first playthrough. All this together make a remarkable gameplay experience. Maybe a bit to overwhelming for some would be my warning. The presentation looks amazing for its era. It was well done and the art style is so great done that I would buy an artbook. The locations have also a European medieval style and I read that they studied French architecture for inspiration for the game. Lastly the soundtrack is a hidden game that works amazingly well. Overall this is a somehow forgotten masterpiece that never got a sequel. I say it is still worth playing and should be recognized as classic game of its time.. A story for the ages. Absolutely amazing cutscene direction, script, graphic design, model design... everything about the game is perfect. Even the weapon system which I was initially wary of became something i looked forward to, desperate for my next upgrade!. I wanted to give this game a 10/10. Believe me, but as a child playing this game, I HAVE NO IDEA what to do. The game has a ton of puzzles. I believe there wasn't much tutorial either. It's difficulty is set for a man. Honestly, the graphics in this game may be even better than some PS2 titles. It was one of the most memorable PS1 games in my life.. its the best action RPG made EVER. yes, some clunky menus,but, as today, no action RPG comes close to the refinement, the aesthetic, and the story.. An absolute diamond in the gaming industry. Like no one deserves a remake or sequel. The best game from these developers, which surpasses the famous series Final fantasy.. Hands down best gamer ever. Period! Every gamer should play this gem of a video game. If you call **** and haven't played this game yet, then you are in for a world of hurt and disappointment.. Vagrant Story is a great game and even though I give it a 8, it is overrated by most people. The stages of the game look atrocious even for a PS1 game. There were better games coming out in 2000 with better graphics. The story is overrated and needlessly complicated. Very little light is shed on the main character. He is basically on a mission and things happen around him. The battle system is novel and unique but not without its flaws. First, there is a substantial chance you may not understand the battle and customization system at all. Secondly, the fact that you can spam a move with timing for eternity makes the customization basically useless. Once you learn the combos and their timing, you can continue to destroy things with the equivalent of 1 attack for the most part. Heal, attack, repeat. Virtually none of the other magic in the game is actually useful. You can chain your attack and quickly chip the enemy's health away without worrying about element they are weak to. Every boss fight is like every enemy fight, get close and spam the attack; heal if necessary, repeat for 40 hours. While it is a great game, it is one of the most overrated games ever.. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Control/Voice Acting: GOOD.. An absolute masterpiece, worthy of being on a par with Chrono Trigger and Xenogears, having awesome mechanics and a great story, coated with excellent graphics and great sound.. was replaying it in 2019 on emulator what a awesome game, what a soundtrack and story , that you also can replay in NG+ just like DS the only problem it has it's inventory management, switching weapons and items and etc can be pain in the ass, other than that it's perfect. Wast that impressed when it came out and just power thru it but as i revisit it again years later and coming in with more patience and more maturity in handling the story and its gameplay mechanics. This is a must play for me. Hoping SE wake the f up and remaster or make a sequel out of this. Imagine this game in our current graphics.. One of the best arcade games ever has a strong story and characters as a package and a beautiful and amazing world of a previous game of its time by all standards. Also hope to see Vagrant Story follow up to compete with this again.Probably the best game I've ever played.. Brilliant masterpiece. Cutscenes in this game are better than many fantasy movies. Characters are believable and complex, so is the story that you could write a bestseller novel based on it. Music is just perfect match that blends everything together in a unique experience that you won't find in any other game to this date.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Played this game some time in late 2000. Arguably it has the (or among) best graphics and artwork for the PS1. The story is very intriguing, dark and mature, with a variety of complex characters. As an old gamer in this PS4 era, VS gameplay has more complexity compared to most current gen games. Its battle system is still very much unique, immersive and one's understanding of the gameplay mechanics will define how you will succeed in the game, it's a combination of good reflexes, comprehension, strategy and wit.. I won't use technical writing to describe this game because it's a game beyond anything I've ever experienced. It's like the developers knew how to enter our brains and how to hook people up, with challenging situations, requiring constant critical thinking, through either puzzles or combat. I was instantly grabbed by this game, every minute I've spent with it in absolute awe, desperate to explore every single bit of content it offered, from the first time I've turn the game on to the last piece of equipment I've perfected, hundreds of hours later. It was the pinnacle of game design of it's time and it didn't aged a single day in terms of gameplay. Even today, when I replay it (as I do every year or so) I still feel greatly challenged. It's the kind of game that makes you feel bad when you realize what we used to have compared to what the gaming industry has become.. Vagrant Story is a painful and clunky attempt at an action RPG, with barebones story The level design is almost non-existent because every area is a generic dungeon of some sort, and enemies are all generic monsters. There are few characters you interact with at all outside of cutscenes and the story is pretty drab, relying heavily on obfuscated, contrived plot twists that the player could never possibly have predicted but are absurd. I can understand liking the story but this again lacks the depth you'd expect out of a Square-Enix RPG of this era, it's just so desperately trying to be different but comes up short in every respect compared to the turn-based games of its time. I'm not sure an action RPG on the PS1 was truly possible considering the console's limitations, but I would not be surprised if one existed far better executed than Vagrant Story. As you roam around the empty and vacant world of Vagrant Story, enemies will chase you down if you come within their scope - think Metal Gear Solid - and then you or they can initiate the battle. Once the fight starts, both the player and the enemies are frozen in place for the duration of either's attack, a weird, clunky hybrid of turn based and action. You can move around the stages but once either you or the enemy tries to attack, then everything comes to a grinding halt. This is very frustrating when you're trying to get away from an enemy then because they got in range of an attack, they freeze and attack you. The way the combo system works is pretty asinine too. You simply string together combos by timing them right like a QTE one after another, but there's a meter that goes up every time you do this. This punishes you heavily for the longer combos you do, and means your attacks do no damage. What to do to bring down this negative mechanic meter? You have to wander around the stage hiding from the enemy for a ridiculous amount of time until the meter goes down. This meter has an absolutely ridiculous cap that makes all your attacks do 0 damage, and combos are an absolute necessity to ever win the more challenging fights of the game. From every standpoint, the combo system is flawed: overly simplistic, aggravating when you do it successfully and hopelessly shallow. I wish I could say the art or the design was particularly inspired, or the music stood out as many of Square-Enix's games do in this era. Instead the main characters looks like a rejected concept for Edward Scissorhands with his idiotic costume and hair, while the other characters are about what you'd expect from the average anime-flavored JRPG. Nothing remotely original besides the plot's attempt at cheap plot twists. The level design as mentioned is incredibly generic, flat and lifeless, while the enemies are your stock wolves and bats at the beginning, evolving to generic RPG fare as the game progresses like lizardmen and skeletons. Nothing as inspired as the enemies in your typical Final Fantasy, SMT or Dragon Quest game, that's for damn sure. Ultimately what made me get this game in the first place and why it annoyed me enough to make me write this scathing review is that it has an obnoxious fanbase who sings its praises for being so different from the other Square-Enix games of the time. Guess what, this game and its ""action"" hybrid gameplay is now all the rage at Square-Enix in recent years, and it ****. This game is meant to be super difficult, but this is not a good thing because the combat in this game is awful. It's not like it's a proper action game where player skill is involved, it's a weird kind of waiting game where you vaguely want to position yourself, but not exactly because once you're in range it becomes a pure numbers game. It's not like it's Dark Souls and you can outwit the AI or other players, you're still locked in a rigid JRPG system, but with the pain in the ass of having to navigate a boxed in dungeon at all times. I think what actually pisses me off the most about this game is the lack of towns, NPCs and other characters to interact with. It's positively soul crushing to wander around in this dreary and boring game world with no one to talk to or interact off, just waiting to get past the next generic enemy so maybe you can see a cutscene or any semblance of the charm you'd expect out of this era of Squaresoft. Instead you get the slow drip drip drip of a very boring story travelling at a snail's pace. There's nothing to interpret from your surrounding, it's just dull. I feel absolutely robbed paying just £10 for this game. I feel sorry for any poor saps who picked up this game in the 90s new and couldn't get a refund. Take my advice, do not buy this game and do not assume it gets any better after the start, it's just like this throughout the entire game and there is never any pay off for all the busy work and pain involved. Do not feel bad for failing to overcome the ""difficulty"" of this game's poor design.. I gave this game a 10 because it was either that or a 9. And to me, the score that more closely represents this game is a 99/100. Before I go in-depth, I will tell you a few things you should know about Vagrant Story. It is a dungeon crawler, you play lone ranger Ashley Riot has he explores the ruins of Leá Monde searching for the antagonist of the game. This game's combat relies on combos executed through a rhythm mini-game, where you press a button of your choosing to execute another attack upon seeing an exclamation mark pop up above Ashley's head. I can't emphasize this enough: the game is HEAVY no the dungeon crawling. There are no NPCs for you to interact with: it is you, Ashley Riot, against the monsters inside the city of Leá Monde. Still interested? Okay. You should also know that the game heavily relies on equipment to defeat your enemies. Your stats only increase by defeating the bosses scattered throughout the game, all of which you will encounter as you advance through the main storyline. In addition to these increases, you may or not find stat increasing items, though this are rare. Because of this heavy emphasis on equipment, you will need to use every weapon at your disposal. Use the wrong weapon, and you may find yourself doing laughable damage to your enemy, or no damage at all. Even in the early game the ""good"" weapons still won't do much damage to the opponents. This is one of the frustrating aspects this game has for most players, made even worse by the fact the game lacks a proper switch-weapons hotkey. This is the only reason why I give this game a 99 out of 100. Still with me? Fine. I've already told you the reasons you may dislike this game: - Lack of NPCs. - Heavy emphasis on combat and dungeon crawling. - Dependence on equipment and the combo system. So now you will probably want to hear what is so good about this game, why is it a 99 out of 100? Before I say that, I want to mention a few things. - This is my first Metacritic review, and probably my only one. - I have played Morrowind, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, Planescape: Torment, Fallout. Of these, none of them, I repeat, NONE of them, deserve anything higher than a solid 90 out of 100. Fallout 3 and Skyrim, to boot, deserve no score higher than a solid 70 out of 100. I say this because those two are some of the most popular RPGs ever made, so it is important that you have an idea of what I think of these ""acclaimed"" videogames. - I don't like JRPGs as much as I did when I was a teenager. All of that out of the way, here's why, if you don't mind about the disadvantages mentioned above, you should get this game: - Vagrant Story has the most engaging combat I've ever experienced in a videogame, bar tactics/strategy videogames. It has definitely the most engaging combat I've ever experienced in an RPG, and one of the most rewarding to boot. As you acquire new skills, your combos get progressively stronger and more interesting. These abilities can range from ""do extra damage"" to ""drain some of the enemy's HP"". - Your reliance on equipment is made more meaningful through the equipment combination mechanic. You can go to specific workshops littered throughout Leá Monde to combine your different swords, axes, spears, shields, armor, etc. and acquire better (or worse) pieces of equipment. The game also has a ""material"" system: the better the material, the better your equipment will be. But it is not as simple as ""higher tier = better"", as some equipment, particularly wooden protection, actually makes your magical skills better than the equipment that offers better protection against physical attacks. - Enemies have a good variety of skills and tricks, meaning you won't feel like you are battling the same enemy over an over again. This is in contrast to games like Skyrim or Fallout, where enemies pretty much differ from each other by how much damage they deal to you, and little else. - The dungeons have their own invisible traps (which you can make visible through a spell), and block puzzles, which you need to move around to access different sections of Leá Monde. - The musical score is exquisite. Moreover, the sound design is great as well, and you actually feel inside a long abandoned, cursed city. It's something to be experienced for sure. - The game is very well written, and uses ""Shakesperian"" english to great effort. - If you are a Final Fantasy Tactics fan, there are tons of references around through item descriptions. Vagrant Story actually shares its setting with FFT: Ivalice. - And the story... I'll keep it simple: my two favorite stories in videogames are Vagrant Story and Planescape: Torment, in that order. I can't say anything more without spoiling VS' memorable narrative. Overall, the best game I've ever played, and finally one japanese RPG that lives up to the ""JRPGs have great stories!"" moniker.. Without doubt one of the best PS and one of the best RPGs ever made. Makes many recently developed 'masterpiece' RPGs look like certain crap. Trully a great experience for every fan of the genre. Really nice game for ps 1 play in 2000-2001 and i m playing it right now!Square plz Make Vagrant story 2 because final fantasy is die ((( Waiting for second game !. I just don't know what to say about this game... I bought it back in 2001mainly because the cover's artwork caught my eye, I used to be more of a Silent Hill, Resident Evil or Metal Gear player but then that year I saw this game and bought it although I played it some years later mainly because I was busy playing many other action titles Legacy of Kain, Parasite Eve ect ect. Well after some time I decided to give this game a try it was probably 2003 so I was like ok time to play it... wow the moment it started playing and all the story and everything was like watching a movie, the more I played the more I was mesmerized by the beautiful dungeons and amazing story. The game is a little complicated so it took me some time to understand everything, after all this was my first dungeon crawling game I had ever played, this game is what made me want to play other titles such as diablo, darkstone, dungeon siege and even Final Fantasy games etc etc. It's been nearly 15 years since I first bought this game and 13 years since I finished it and in that time I have played many many titles new and old for PC and every possible console up to this moment 2016 that are hack and slash and dungeon crawlers but truth is I have never found in all these years a game so perfect as this one. I just don't know where to start about this game and I could make a whole book praising this gem ****, the music is just perfect it fits every dungeon and place perfectly on par with Final Fantasy's music the ambience is soo beautiful makes me wish there was a place in this world as beautiful as Lea Monde, the story oh boy the story worthy of a novel and movies and a whole series. The gameplay is a little confusing but once you understand it, it's smooth sailing from there, the game has a very good build up in every possible way and I mean storywise and also game wise, it's very well balanced in work and reward I would say perfectly balanced, it's not senseless grinding with unbalanced rewards like almost every other dungeon crawling title out there. The story is just so intriguing and it has an excellent pace. This game also has replay value since new areas are accesible in a replay and you get to save stats and some items. I wish I could forget I finished this game 20 times and enjoy it like it was the first time, sadly I already know every corner of this game so I can't play it anymore without getting a little bored, just a little. What else can I say about this game? It's simply perfect and it's what I use to measure any other game of it's type even to this day, Vagrant Story will always have a place in my mind and in my heart till the end of my days for whatever time is left, this game in my humble opinion is just the best game ever made and boy have I played and (finished) thousands of games. 11/10 gift from god. Easily my top 5 games of all time. The amount of effort that went into refining every aspect of this game is just astonishing. Even in 2016 it's storytelling, music and script are top notch. Don't let the old PSX trick you, if you love epic rpgs - this is one of the best ever created.. This game is awesome! - Deep Storyline - Good Combat System - Beautiful Graphics (for the time, of course) - Deep Strategy System - Epic Bosses This game is really good, it's worth playing even in an emulator.. True piece of art from the console world of PS1. Feels like a Dark Souls predecessor to me. Serious, dark and atmospheric fantasy rpg. Fallout style combat with complex weapon mechanisms. Beautiful art design, amazing music and a really good story on top of that. There is only one complaint from me and that is quite bad and clumsy inventory management, which is a huge minus since you're gonna spend a lot of time in there, changing weapons, crafting, comparing equipment etc. this along with overly long save/load system prevents from giving this a full score. But other than that Vagrant Story is one of those gems from gaming history that shouldn't be missed. 9/10. A rare gem, that doesn´t get the recognition it so much deserves. The plot is genius with unexpected turns and a strong cadre of characters. The battle system, being on par with the story shows incredible depth with much variety and possibilities. The decision, not to make FMVs for the story sequences but instead using the in game graphics greatly helps the immersion, making smooth transitions from cutscenes and gameplay possible and with that offering a on top presentation. Easily on of the best games ever to be made.. The ultimate dungeon crawler. It might be a bit confusing and hard when you begin, but it will eventually grow on to you. Perfect story and dialogue. A cool combat system. A soundtrack that reminds me of the classic RE. The save system and the high difficulty level early on are holding this epic game back. And maybe the dungeon crawler setting for some as well Vagrant Story is a must for every collector. 9.0/10: EPIC!!!. I first played Vagrant Story a number of years after its original release and so perhaps my judgement was clouded by more recent games in the RPG genre but I really struggled to get into the games traditional elements.. ""Blown away"" is an understatement for this game. When I criticize and RPG, Vagrant Story is one of the metrics I use to compare. GraphicallyMusically: The game was developed to push the very limits of the original PlayStation, and it did just that without compromising anything; especially game length and content. The engineering for the music and sound effects has a place in my heart especially. The musical score is wonderful. Content: The story is enveloping. One becomes entranced at the dialogue, plot, and twists. Nothing is predictable. Nobody's part is fully understood till the very end; even then it leaves you debating the integrity of what you see (in the best possible way). The characters are unique and the style of presentation is just perfect. Gameplay: Vagrant story made you play it twice. It wouldn't let you ""finish"" until after you beat it the first time. The battle system was amazing and very strategic, the puzzles made you think pretty hard, the crafting and equipment system is totally unique, the atmosphere was perfect, and the challenge of the game was very real. In fact, it makes me think of the much newer games Dark Souls and Demon Souls in its lack of forgiveness with many of the parts. Finally the balance of the game brought on by the ""Risk"" system as well as every conceivable detail taken into account by the team that made this game served the utmost justice to my expectations. The game as a whole, in my mind, has no equal on the PS1. If you are a fan of what a ""good"" game is, regardless of the console system or age, then this game comes extremely high on my list of recommendations.. Story, dialog, combat, customisation, grafics (for it's time), replay walue, atmosphere... It got it all! One of my all-time favorite games. Maby a bit to hard core for everybody, but that just mean",this is an adult Final Fantasy set in a fantastic fantasy dungeon . the risk system adds this intense edge to combat that's both thrilling and rewarding . the music is like a symphony of atmospheric brilliance .
156.Team Fortress 2,"For all the people that are seeing reviews about rampant cheaters and bots: They have been fixed! The game is now entirely playable and also super fun. Amazing game by Valve, just **** that the game has basically abandoned by the developers.. This game has (mostly) balanced weapons, a welcoming community, (mostly) great maps, great lore, great humor and much more. I highly advise it. This game is relaxing cool and fun i laughed so much with my friends and the players. The biggest waste of time you could ever indulge in.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. Still the most enjoyable and (most importantly) most relaxing PvP experience I've ever had in any multiplayer video game. Just hop on to a private, fully populated 32/64-player server and pewpew the other players for as long as you want, where absolutely nobody will ever care about what ""ranking"" you are, what's your ""K/D ratio"" is, whether you're playing the ""right class/hero"" with the ""current meta loadout"" or whether you're even going for an objective or just standing around and doing silly emotes. This is how every ""team-based PvP"" game should be.. A Good game that everyone should try at some point; a cornerstone of every Steam library.. I've been playing this game for a long time and still play it today. I think realistically every PC gamer should try it out. It's iconic and has an infinite potential to generate moments of fun and hilarity. I think, content wise, it's gotten quite bloated over the years with all the obsolete game modes. There have been some questionable balancing decisions made over the years.. The Spy is so hot, He can bang my mother any day; The Scout and I have that in common I hope a Red Spy intrudes on my ""Base"" if you know what i mean >:3. Truly an amazing shooter with great caricatures, contributing to internet culture 20 years later; not just any game can do that. Just has balance issues, and lacks of major updates... But tis' the plight of a videogame from 2007. Only 9 because of the community, some people are just intolerable. It's so bad that I've completely stopped playing.. Very epic video game, has the most replayability out of any game I've played. Also just funny 2fort go brrrrrrrr. The Administrator: ""Intruder Alert! A RED Spy is in the base!""Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base!?""Soldier: Hut hut hut hutThe Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""Scout: ""Yo, a lil' help here!?""Soldier: ""All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!""Scout: Let's go, let's go-Heavy: ""INCOMING!""[Heavy charges and destroy the door]Scout: ""AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!""Heavy: ""-AAAAalright then.""Spy: ""Ahem.""Spy: ""Gentlemen.""Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""Soldier: ""Safe and sound, mm-hmm.""Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""Spy: ""Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""[He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back]Soldier: ""...and a knife.""Scout: ""Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!""[cuts with the spy knife]Scout: ""Ow! No offense.""Spy: ""If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me."" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] ""And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.""Scout: ""What're you? President of his fan club?""Spy: ""No... that would be your mother!""[PORNOGRAPHY]Spy: ""Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""Soldier: ""Oh!""Scout: ""Gimme that!""Spy: ""This Spy has already breached our defenses...""[The most epic sap of a sentry]Engineer: ""Sentry Down!""[Headshot to the engineer]Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""[Backstab for the sniper]Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us...""[medic vs spy}Medic: ""Raus, raus!""[Disguise medic]Medic: [gasps] ""Nein...""Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-"" [Spy´s head explodes brutally from a shot from the Soldier's shotgun]Scout: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!""Heavy: ""Oh!""Soldier: ""What? It was obvious!"" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] ""He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...Soldier: ""Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.""]Heavy: ""So, we still got problem...""Soldier: ""Big problem... all right, who's ready to go find this Spy?""Spy: ""Right behind you.""Spy: ""Ahh... ma petite chou-fleur. Game Simulator, This game actually deserves a 10/10 but valve lack of care for its cheating problem have really hurt the game in the long run, its the community that keeps this game alive nothing else.. Very fun and funny game, fan base and game play. I will admit that the tutorials are horrible but it kinda forces you to interact with the fan base which I kinda like.. This game is a MUST PLAY. Ever since the bot crisis was fixed the game has become more fun than ever, it has beautiful graphics, art styles, gameplay and more. It's the whole shebang. All those who hate on this game are just BAD or they have outdated reviews. #1 Game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Genuinely one of the greatest games ever created. This is one of the only games I can confidently say is a work of art. Incredible.... Absolute masterpiece, lovable, iconic characters, fun gameplay, outlived OW. They fixed the bots, but we still haven't gotten the Heavy update. ITS BEEN 7 YEARS VALVE PLEASE!!!. This game is and will be the best and the most influential Hero Shooter of all time.. The game is great. A diversity of characters, each with their own personality, playstyle, and hundreds of different items for each class. Some are fast, some are bulky, others can deal huge damage, and each one fills a completely different hole in your team. The only real problem is an ongoing botfest that Valve refuses to solve. Blame it on the devs.. Despite having a very long and hard life, Team Fortress 2 remains one of the greatest Valve games. It was one of the games that revolutionized the concept of hero shooters with their own weapons. I have made so many friends on this game. I highly recommended this game to anyone who enjoys Overwatch. But the boys were in issue for a while. 9/10. Never had that much fun with this game. It was just an alternative to the more popular games from this time.. This game is so much better than overwatch and has more variety despite ow having more characters only thing keeping it from a 10 is I **** at this game. Very fun game to play, but the community is... something. If you meet a fan of Team Fortress 2, they will make sure you know it, and they can be quite annoying at times, but in general its a fun game.. I love this game,from the fact that you can choose your role in the battle and you can choose your play style. The world this game has created, including the community, is truly amazing. The game itself is ok. Om nom nom sandvich make me strong, MEDIC! I am heavy weapons guy spy over there pootis Spencer here. Undoubtedly one of the greatest multiplayer games I have ever played. VALVe mastered the hero shooter years and years before any of these companies started trying to, and yet they all mostly failed. The characters are balanced exactly as they should be, and each character has multiple play styles. The maps and design for the game is phenomenal. I have over 1,800 hours clocked into this game, I’ve done Mann vs Machine, competitive, casual, you name it.. and the best way to play is a solid community server on your favorite map. Absolutely solid title, with fun, funny, and interesting characters. Simply watch the “Meet the..” videos to get a taste of their personalities. Much better than most of the thirst traps of Overwatch.. they hashtag fixed tf2 no way i can play lime scout in casual again woohoo hip hip hooray. I think it's the greatest Shooter game of all time, case and point. it's crazy after all of these years of unacknowledgement from valve and the abuse from the bots this game is still going strong and even surpassing itself every once in a while.. Great game Best soundtrack in the world So goooooooooooooood 10/10 ever, always and forever Best cinematics every time Recommended to play Best shooter 2007 year. A monumental faliure of the highest caliber, terrible balance, terrible gameplay, boring aesthetics, visually unimpressive, its just insane how bad this game is. This is one of the best and most magnificent games I've seen.This is an iconic game.. This is the BEST FPS Shooter game i have ever played in my whole entire life, literally better than Apex Legends or Overwatch!!! I wouldve been bored every day if this game didnt exist.. please don't give bad reviews on Metacritic, do it on Steam because that's where it hurts Valve the most: their wallets.. The bot crisis is really ruining the entire game and Valve's don't care about it, #FixTF2. What was once an amazing 9/10 for what it had offered at the time, that has now turned into a boring and unplayable game with the bot problem and lack of updates.. Absolutely unplayable with all the bots. Without them I wouldbe great.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Valve, what the f*** is THIS? A game that was abandoned, by it's own creators? A game that was left to rot by the developers? A game that was released 16 years ago on Oct 10th, 2007, loved since release, and is a huge profit for Valve earning them tens of millions of dollars each year? Have you checked your game store page and saw that ""Overwhelmingly Negative"" with that metallic brown color for the first time in your 17 year run? with 12% of the 43,000+ reviews being positive since 3rd of June? Have you scrolled down and read every single review of players expressing their experience with the current state of your game? I bet no right? Your game is on the #1 worst rated game and we thought Overwatch 2 was gonna be the #1 forever but seems like the tables have turned. I have been playing this game for over 6 years now and althought I joined late, I had a really great and fun time playing this game, that was until the sniper bots with aimbots came and ruined the game making it almost unplayable.. This was problem since ""Meet your Match"" released, we are talking since 𝗝𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝟳𝘁𝗵, 𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟲 ALMOST 8 YEARS. Cheating software will keep getting better and better overtime so if you wanna make history that will revolutionize online games make a good anti-cheat. There are over 276,000+ players, HUMANS (still going up) are signing the petition, praying, hoping, wishing for a fix, an actual working anti cheat that bans bots and ends this once an for all! Is just a matter of minuted that we reach the 279,499 petitions that World of Warcraft had and because of that Blizzard DID what the COMMUNITY ASKED FOR. THIS BOT CRISIS IS A [𝗛𝗨𝗚𝗘] PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING AS FAR AS ILLEGAL CRIMINALS. • Not only they are breaking your 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁"" TERMS as you said ""You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process"" But this **** are also doxxing, swatting and also sending death threats to people who have tried bringing attention to the crisis in the past by this 𝗕𝗢𝗧 𝗛𝗢𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗦. • They also have farm bots setup to get cases, cosmetics, weapons drops and even tho it cost a few cents like $0.03USD after a defined time just remember they are in their own VAC-secured server with 𝗧𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗘𝗡𝗗𝗦 of bots so now imagine how much money they are making and farming in this game. • They have 𝗙𝗔𝗟𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗬 and 𝗜𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗬 filed a 𝗗𝗠𝗖𝗔 takedown impersonating you guys, VALVE on the **** website wish is the page that the petitions are signed, this is how far these kind of criminals would go to try and shut down a call from the community to do your job as developers of your product. • And lastly the worst one yet bot hosters have started to make their bots to advertise 𝗖𝗛𝗜𝗟𝗗 𝗣*** AND YOU THINK THAT'S OKAY TO LET IT HAPPENED? NO! THIS IS YOUR GAME VALVE YOU ARE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR LETTING THIS HAPPEND NOT ONLY THIS CAN MAKE THE GAME SHUT DOWN BUT YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY CAN SHUT DOWN BY U.S LAWS BECAUSE OF THIS BOT HOSTERS AND IT 𝗪𝗜𝗟𝗟 MAKE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE GAME INDUSTRY. So basically what this criminals are doing is: • Possession/Distribution of CP • Swatting • Extortion • Doxxing • DDoSing • Scam • Impersonation • And much more.... WHAT WILL THE NEW PLAYERS, FUTURE GENERATIONS THINK WHEN THEY JOIN TF2 FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE FIRST THING THEY SEE IS THIS BOT INFESTED UNPLAYABLE GAME? DO YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPENED? DO YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY FOR THIS? DO YOU WANT THAT TO BE RECORDED ON YOUR IP AND IMAGE OF YOUR COMPANY? OH SORRY YOU JUST DID BY REFUSING TO ANY EFFORT IN MAINTAINING THEIR GAMESBUT YOU GUYS ARE PERFECTLY FINE MONETIZING IT THOUGH! FIX YOUR F****** GAME ALREADY! - YOU CAN'T IGNORE US, YOU CAN'T AVOID US! - Enough is Enough! - Actions speak louder than words! - It's time to put an end to this! - Why keep lying!? - OVER 6 YEARS OF AIMBOT TERROR, OVER 2 YEARS SINCE VALVE PROMISED TO FIX IT! - Make our voices heard! - LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY! And for the person reading this review that's right 𝗬𝗢𝗨 the player please, go to the 𝘀𝗮𝘃𝗲.𝘁𝗳 page and sign the petition to contribute to our call, ask your friends, loved ones and family to sign to let valve know how much people really want to play this game freely without worrying about the existence of 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗦. And also stop spending your money on Valve, by giving them money you are basically accepting that the current bot crisis in TF2 is okay but is 𝗡𝗢𝗧. """"𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱"" with new game modes, maps, equipment and, most importantly, hats!"" You should be ashamed of yourself, why do you make a game of huge success and community with 9 years of development just to literally stab us on the back and let us die on the fire? Valve 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 to step in. #𝗙𝗶𝘅𝗧𝗙𝟮 And that wraps exactly 5,000 characters written on this review.. The late TF2 was an amazing game, former 10/10. It's a shame that bots that commit literal CRIMES were allowed to kill the game.. Too many bots its unplayable. Despite the steam page saying 70,000 people are playing there are only about 24,000 real players. #FixTF2. valve is profiting off the game even when its basically unplayable thanks to cheater bots that instantly headshot you. These bots have also started to promote CP and the bot hosters threaten anyone who speak badly about them with doxxing and other horrible things. valve wont stop these illegal things in their game, but they also wont shut it down because it makes them money. #FixTF2 #SaveTF2 I went into casual and got a headshot from the bot Loaded onto the map - headshotted by the bot Chose a class - headshot by the bot Left the base - headshotted by the bot Left the server - headshotted by the bot Turned off the computer - the bot took a headshot Went outside - headshotted by bot. This game is good enough to have the fanbase it has over the years, Valve has no reason not to fix it's ****.. Fix your game Valve! Fix the bots! Fix the community! Fix your reputation! #FIxTF2 #SaveTF2 ****. A beloved classic that has now turned into a bot cesspool. It pain me to say this, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I type this knowing full well that I've spent over 3000 hours into this game. This game used to be good, but the curent aimbot crisis and the lack of any involvement from Valve to put in a proper anti-cheat would turn away any hopeful newcomer. #FixTF2. unplayable for everyone and bots have ruined literally everything about the game. terrible. i grew up with this game and always loved watching people play it so im heartbroken seeing it in this state #SaveTF2 #FixTF2. Literally unplayable. The game gives an error when attempting to launch about the first executable not being found.. Game is now a mess and is filled with bots in valve servers and has not gotten a real update for 6 years, valve have only been profiting of the cosmetic updates in the game and has not fixed any issues like they said they would making it from top 5 to top trash. Would recommend it if they fix and give some real updates.. The Best game ever i played. I hope valve can fix tf2 cause tf2 is the most overrated game ever. This may very well be the most overrated and over-appreciated game ever churned out by Valve. Spend any time around PC gamers, and they'll bring up Team Fortress 2, along with some kind of praise. This game is downright terrible. It's not fun - you'll find yourself in a lobby full of bots who kill you instantly most of the time. The community servers are garbage, and filled with the most unfunny people you'll ever listen to. The last point is a theme in Team Fortress 2, the community is filled with the worst excesses of society: under-socialized recluses, transvestites, and scrawny autists with high-pitched voices. Even typing all this out gives this game more time than it's worth. I should be paid for having played this trash.. Easily one of the best multiplayer shooter gaming has ever seen. The gunplay is precise and fun, the artstyle is wacky and charming, and the movement is top-notch. If you haven't alreadyplayed this game, do it now.. I love this game soooo much even as a girl I love it!! It's funny, cool, very unique, and fun!!!. I never understood the hype for this game, it's crap and repetitive.gamemodes are bad and often full of cheaters.. It might not get updates (only patches and bug fixes), but this game lives on as a war-themed hat simulator. It has unique game modes, cosmetics, characters, stories, weapons and more. From a game coming from 2007, it is worth it's love.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A masterpiece that continues to warm our hearts through the ages. In its glory days, this game was definitely a 10/10. The only negative point about this game is poor direction and decisions by the developers. For example, competitive games and casual games. Replacing community servers with a game that relies heavily on the community was a huge mistake. The bot problem that plagued Team Fortress 2 for so long and went unnoticed by the developers was also a very sad sight. Even after that, I can't bring myself to give a bad review to this great game. Because every class is unique, each one has a lot of creative weapons, and the game itself has some great humor.. Timeless classic honestly. Im not someone that’s been playing since 2007, but seeing the amount of people that have done so and are still playing is honestly kinda cool. SFMs are pretty freakin sick too. Posting this at 500hours played :). Truly a precursor of it's genre. With his broad load of community content, such as cosmetics, maps, fan-animations, this videogame has a permanent mark on the gaming industry and gaming in general.. In this class-based game, you can choose the weapon combination you want and play on countless maps. It's worth giving a chance.. This game gets very frequently updated by the rate of 1 update/10 years. In these updates new, optionally neon pink and green hats appear, which completely destroy the art style, while nothing else is done to bugs or game-play or balance or weapons, besides maybe a port to 64bit for an extra 20 fps, but the core game-play is fun and they couldn't break it so bad that it becomes unbearable so its a 10/10 by modern standards.. Coolest game ever, better than most popular shooter games, but there are bots. Everywhere. So, 9.. fix the bots and this game is the best shooter ever made. leave the bots in and this game is the best pve game ever made. there is no losing when it comes to tf2.. team fortress 2 is a classic from valve sure Mabey valve abandoned us but it is still amazing hundreds of ways to play for example demoknight or heavy boxing pyro shark and items like the axestinguter or lock and load or tomslovae a MUST PLAY IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED TF2 YOU HAVENT LIVED. a great game with even better characters, its charming, but please valve i beg of you just fix the bot problems oh my god. Team Fortress 2 is a classic most people don't care about lack of updates but some others do i personally don't care about lack of updates I'm just sad about the amount of bots, bots are a problem that nobody likes but as of writing this review i have noticed hardly any there are a few bots but easy to kick i have seen some horrors before and there are servers filled with bots but I'm finding servers where nobody can join because there are to many bots and then they soft lock themselves i would recommend this game to anyone who likes casual fps games Two things i love about this game is the art styles and personality each character has i really hope people will get into this game. What can I say? It's another of Valve's masterpices. It has beautiful graphics even tho it's old and the gameplay is very different depending on what set-up and class you use. Only thing that you can notice is it's bot problem (#SaveTF2).. I WOULD say its a perfect 10 outa 10 but team fortress 2's (more like team fortless updates 2) bot problem will always disappoint and the players while SOME nice once its usually just salty 10 y/o. At the same time you cant give it any lower then a 8 or else you're a freak of nature to hate this masterpiece from valve like c'mon if something has more lore than PORTAL its got to be good weather the actual lore is good or not. cool game because good comunyti taunts hats hallowen update christmas update. Its a hero/class team based game with variety of weapons, and hats. I will start with positive one. 1. Its free, 2. In terms of gamelay, its pretty good for the most part. Each class/hero have different stats, different strategy to attacks or defends from the opposing team, and different ability . Every class/hero is already unlockable at the start of the game, so you can change the class/hero at any time as much as you want. There is also a sub-class, aka different version of the default. And if u ask how is the battlefield? It could be chaotic, I mean, very chaotic. And, there is a variety of gamemode too, like capturing the intelligence(cta), push the cart thingy, capture the points, etc. 3. In terms of graphic, I think its okay. Its pretty cartonish with a little bit of gore to spice it up. I kinda like it. Well, its time to talk about negative part of this game. 1. Bots. Bots are everywhere. Bots have aimbot. Bots are annoying if it doesn't get kicked sooner or later. 2. Then, if u want to use voice commands, or chatting in-game, you need to pay an items in-game first to use them. Which is annoying for most f2p players. Thats all. Sorry if I have a bad grammar and a bad ""rating & critics"" about this game. But hey, since its free, you could try it first and give yourself a rating about the game. Have fun :D. I like Shooting holes in my enemys and Watch them burn and sufer but all in all good Game but a Bit too high prices for keys but good Game. A great and fun multiplayer fps experience! I would say I probably would prefer this over Overwatch. Unfortunately I wasn't really there during the game's hay days and it seems like Valve didn't really care for maintaining the game until very recently. Definitely a must-play. A fallen game, that once was the all time banger, almost had his own TV show, but Valve could not agree with Adult Swim. Oh Valve... You magnificent Company, You created this game, back in October 10, 2007. I was 6 years old, sadly I only started playing Tf2 many years later. This is/was my all time favorite game, I have 1920 hours in this game, however, the Community is one of the toxic I ever saw. A dude started **** talking my family and none of the 98 more players did anything. I told him to leave me alone and ignored him. He started saying stuff like: ""How amazing is when he stopped speaking"" I asked him once again whats wrong with You? Then he continued bad talking, like ""Told you to shut up"". I joined the enemy team so i can, be with this manchild on one team to kick it. I did, he got kicked then I got bullied why i did that. After this the pink cloud was over. I realized this game is never gonna get new weapons, or anything from Valve. Just Imagine a story mode... Or stories to every character. Anything. But nothing will happen with this leaked spaghetti code. Only time valve ever did anything was when it got so bad that bots were spamming racism in chat, which got news media attention. Their solution was to disable chatting for all new players... This game will never be the same it was. Will play this game, but not like before this incident. Selling all my valuables, and moving on to Alan Wake series and Call Of Duty series. Bye my old friend. See You sometime.. Realy,its great. I have a one question. Why Jungle İnferno is bad? Don't care it. Its little bit old game but its not look like a old its look like and feel like a new game. VALVE HEAR US!. This is one of the best games I have ever played great gameplay all 9 classes are fun and unique. Lots of replay ability with many different maps and customizable load outs and outfits. An amazing timeless art style. If you have not played this game, you should.. A once great game that has fallen from grace. How could it have fallen so far when cheaters were once the greatest threat, but now instead cheating bots have infested the game to such an extent? They have virtually ruined the game, and yet, Valve does nothing. The only time valve ever moved to do anything was when it got so bad that bots were spamming racism in chat, which got news media attention. (Their solution was to disable chatting for all new players…) Now something even worse than that may be brewing, and yet… nothing. I wonder how far it would have to go before Valve finally does something? If cheating means nothing to them, will it take actual crimes being committed in voice chat to move them to actually fix the problem? This is a sad, yet very real possibility that seems to slowly be coming true… sad to see such a legendary game either and die like this.. good game have good characters, variability of guns but the community is so toxic. I', Not Playing This Game Because Team Fortress 2 (TF2) ****! I Don't care about that.. Pretty good game whit source games. A Clasic. The main problem is the lack of help from valve and the bots. Amazing multiplayer game with endless amount of fun! Very great maps and modes!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic game here that I've lost over 2000 hours to. Unfortunately, a lot of the playerbase appears to be man babies who cry when people enjoy stuff that's more popular than TF2.. it is my favorite hat simulator It's so much fun and the shooting mechanics are alright I guess. Funny game lol,good game with a fun and fast (or slow if playing with heavy) good community,huge variety of guns and a great cartoon graphics. I just find a shame that the game hasnt had a major update since 2017 and the public servers are full of bots. This game is just fun. Its class-based fps, the community is hilarious, the gameplay is enjoyable, and there are multiple gamemodes. The only downside: no major updates since 2017... Help us valve ;). i understand the appeal, but i personally dont enjoy this game. if you like it, thats fine, but i dont. just not my kind of shooter. One of my favorite class based shooters. Every class is simple and easy to play, all you have to do is pick the one you like to play the most. And for a game that's pretty old to still have such a strong fanbase must say a lot about the game as well considering its diverse fan base.. For a game that is so old but yet so fun. Team Fortress 2 is absolutely is absolutely a fun game to even play. Rather than just having realistic old-school character models. The game focuses on a cartoony aspect. Maps remained great, classes which are treated as actual characters rather than just generic characters and the game is still absolutely the most fun that I absolutely have. However, the biggest downside that I have not played this game for the past years is that I have to upgrade my inventory for it and pay it in real cash. Back then when I was very young I could not even get my rewards because of a full inventory and it did not really motivate me to play this game. I expect to have this game as a level-up feature that unlocks inventory slots but it doesn't. Plus the players in the game were absolutely abusive. They were absolutely rude and disrespectful that this game did not have a turn-off chat feature which absolutely disturbs my gameplay. Although they have a tutorial on YouTube on how to disable chat. Team Fortress 2 still remains great for other players in Steam and maybe someday I will go playing this game again.. TF2 is a game for all in the ever eons of time. Wether it his giving my enemies the boom booms with a grenade launcher of rocket launcher, you are on fire enemies now, or making guns I will always be fun. Remember kiddos, Team Fortress 2 will always be superior to your god damn fortnights. A cool game of all time. Definitely recomend. This game is a must play classic for FPS players or just gamers in general. With over a dozen Weapons, 9 Classes and so many game modes and maps, this game is the best game to play with friends, online or offline.. Team fortress 2 is the definition of Mediocre, even though it's fun and Enjoyable, it suffers from a horrible fanbase, lack of update, hackers, bugs, and microtransactions. This game could have been a lot better if valve actually cared about it. Perfect game,perfect **** i can't say these to the weapons.Especially to the hitboxes.. even with hackers this game is still going hard valve needs to show this game some love, this game is very funny and everyone should give it a try at first i didn't like it but now this year i am hooked on it, also i recommend everyone watch valve's animation about this game and trailers they are so hilarious!. The goat. if only valve could come back and REMOVE ALL THE PORN FROM THE SIGNS OMFG THERE IS SO MUCH PORN I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE THE FACT I NEED TO USE MODS TO REMOVE PORN IS SO ANNOYING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Literally the goat. An amazing game that has truly stood the test of time. There is only 9 classes, but they all have their defined roles. The scout is a fast short guy who’s good at getting into combat, but has the lowest health in the game.Heavy runs in the front line and deals massive damage. Engineer builds sentries and defends the base. Medic heals the team. Those are a few, but there are many different playstyles you unlock from getting new weapons, such as Battle Medic. The only negative is the bots. Bots can genuinely ruin matches. There are a couple “solutions”, such as playing on community servers like uncletopia. Overall, if you like fps games, then please play this.. ""I AM BULLETPROOF!!"" - Heavy 2009. God this game is so stylized and entertaining. Valve please update it tho :(. Classic.. The Characters are the best. This game isn't perfect but it's too much fun. i swear to God next time i see a scout with 124 hp spamming medic.. It's the best thing Valve has ever made in forever. Peak, hella fun and best shooter there is. Amazing game, have been playing it since 2019. Incredibly fast paced game with a very goofy community.. Aged incredibly well, only problem is the lack of care from Valve. This game is so much fun, it has guns, war, oh and did I mention the hats? Well the hats are what takes this game from being an ordinary FPS, to something extraordinary!. Team Fortress 2 is probably the best first-person shooter out there I know it has been ruined by hackers a bit but most of the lobby's are mostly hacker free and bot free. The community isn't great but just don't t",the game is now entirely playable and also super fun . it's iconic and has an infinite potential to generate moments of fun and hilarity . it's gotten quite bloated over the years with all the obsolete game modes .
157.System Shock 2,"Real solid game. It has 9 decks, interestingly I started to enjoy the game after reaching 4th level so the game unlocks right there. From FPS perspective it was unusual, relying on stats and research rather than aim quality of player. And general level design was superb, overall.. I'm 37 years old and I've only now, this year, played SS2 for the first time ever! Finished the SS1 remake and had to check out the sequel... and WOW! What an amazing game that still holds up today with just a few graphics mods applied. I am in awe of this game's magnitude and weep at its magnificence. We are all just a pathetic species of insects, beings of little significance, in the presence of the almighty SHODAN. I await her return!. The best game ever, everyone who calls themselves a gamer should try it at least once. An absolute classic for a reason, even more than 20 years later System Shock 2 never fails to invoke emotions such as terror and joy throughout the entire game. Flawed in some areas but the experience as a whole is one that every gamer should take part in.. The best game ever made. And I've played it only a few years back. Get the Redux mod (HD textures, widescreen HUD, updated 3D models etc.) and enjoy. No hand holding, just immersive sim at its best with amazing atmosphere which feels like Alien but with more mystery.. System Shock 2 is a terrifyingly immersive experience, with deep RPG elements and a haunting narrative that still resonates today. A classic.. Completely over-hyped game! Endless re-spawning monsters you need to fight in melee because firearms always break. Endless backtracking trough the same maps in search for survivors that are always dead when you find them anyway. Endless maze like levels that make no sense for a space ship at all. Compared to the original System Shock, this seems like a very weak copy with a lot of things changed for worse.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. Great game. The best Sci-Fi story. A real creepy environment. GReat combat and research. But the story, oh man.. Î still remember being hunted through those corridors and finding what was left of the crew, and what ahd became of them. Amazing.. I just finished it for the 3rd time. It is truly an amazing game. An excellent storyline. Perfect level design. Great atmosphere and art design. It's a top notch game for its year. Shodan is very well designed. Her voice is very impressive. Various weapons, various skills. Multiple playability feature. Definitely a must play game.. Fascinating to see the precursor to the Bioshock series. So many elements of that game are revealed here in an earlier state. The psionic powers, the voice logs, the hacking and combat. It's like Bioshock 0. It also has a pretty great story that delves into all kinds of space horror that is revealed as you journey through the ship. This is a pretty good horror game in its own right. Now for the bad. By today's standards it's a clunky mess in terms of UI and combat. You can work with it, but it's really rough. The RPG elements are more unforgiving than other ""shock"" games. This is actually kind of hard until later in the game when they rain modules like candy, and it's quite easy to get stuck in progression if you don't have the right build. I recommend reading a character building guide. The game is also often unclear as to what you're supposed to be doing. It will say ""go to the command area,"" but there are multiple command areas on the ship, and what are you supposed to do when you get there? I found myself wasting a lot of time running to different areas trying to figure out how to trigger the next step in the story, and the vague instructions and backtracking only worsened as the game went on. Enemies also respawn relatively quickly, so the more time you spend trying to solve the game's puzzles, the more of a nuisance they become. Despite all that, this is a classic game that offers a strong narrative experience beginning to end, and the gameplay more or less works. The FPS elements are ok considering the time that it was released. Like the Bioshock games, you feel deeply engaged and part of the story. Everyone should play this once.. Cyberpunk done right...this is a classic MUST PLAY. (seventy five characters). ""Remember, it is my will that guided you here. It is my will that gave you your cybernetic implants, the only beauty in that meat you call a body. If you value that meat... you will do as I tell you."" The cult classic sci-fi horror FPS-RPG has returned.. Irrational Games: the beginning. Immersive sims: the formation. Gameplay: combat mechanics 7/10 stealth 7/10 atmosphere 10/10 Gameplay as RPG & ****: 10/10 Story 10/10 Graphics 8/10 Sounds & music 10/10 . Cheers, K. Levine!. System Shock 2 is amazing. Nothing quite lives up to the sheer level of dread and creativity Irrational Games pumped into this nightmare. I loved it, I would argue this might be one of my favourite games. It's just this perfect concoction of surreal sci-fi body horror with immersive sim creativity pumped into it. Highly recommend playing this honestly. Fair warning that it is quite esoteric at times, and also the rpg elements are confusing. You will have a bad time playing in the beginning, after awhile it clicks and you can start figuring out your most preferred play-style. I was a stealth, energy weapon, pistol wrench Jedi my play-through.. DO. THE. REMAKE. NOW. I'M MEAN IT!!! This game is a underrated mile stone of FTP RPG genre. This game is good. And amazing level of depth to gameplay and story. Just get it.. It was the only game that made me feel anxious when walking through a door.. There is a HUGE learning curve that you need to get over in order to enjoy this game.... but when you do it becomes amazing!. System Shock 2 is so underrated, its impact on out industry is undeniable. It wasn't perfect or flawless but let's see what it did best that made it an instant classic: 1. Subtle gameplay 2. Perfect atmosphere 3. A story that was ahead of its time 4. Realistic level design Sure thr game had flaws as well, to be honest it had many flaws but sometimess something is just too good.. I played this game for the first time and i must say the game very good. The story itself and the antagonist SHODAN are very good and make the game very enjoyable to push through even though the gameplay part of it is very hard. its kind of an RPG with you searcing for weapons that are degradable, multiple types of ammo, You have this research info which you have to invest cyber modules for you to know how to kill enemies easier. Pretty much the entire system is well made. While most of the time you will know what to do but how you do it is up to you and you will be lost a lot. A big problem is that if you are poisoned and you don't have anti tox then you will have to reload a previous save. I had to use cheats to get more health and antitoxins because I would make it through at all so if you play it for the first time dont be shy to use cheats. It will make the game more enjoyable. The graphics are a bit dated, especially the character modules....they are horrible. A true classic. System Shock 2 sets the survival atmosphere well, throwing you alone with a voice in your ear to survive on a ship where something has gone wrong. The story is pieced together as you play, learning more and more about what happened, how it happened, and who else is alive on the ship with you. The game starts with limited resources, trying to balance them as you eek out your survival. In this way, it encourages plenty of exploring. The more you explore, the more resources you find that will help you late in the game. Ultimately, what this really does is limit more than open. Nearly everything in the game is locked behind some kind of skill barrier. That armor you picked up? If you're not strong enough, you can't use it. That weapon? Are you proficient in the right skills? Can you repair it if it breaks, maintain it so it won't break as often? Hacking is essential, as it can - literally - open doors for you that are otherwise out of your reach. The game is not perfect. The engine feels fairly clunky today, and it can be very difficult to heal or swap some skills on the fly, particularly when trying to dodge enemies. It suffers from the same ending-going-off-the-rails as Half-Life. And it can be brutally difficult at times, particularly in areas where very powerful enemies like to respawn, and keep respawning. But even now, more than fifteen years later, this game can keep you invested. As an added bonus, the Steam version comes with the Multiplayer mod, allowing you to take a friend with you so that you aren't all alone. This does make the game considerably easier as, even though you are sharing resources, you get to specialize and utilize far more tools between the players, since everyone get the same amount of upgrades. There are also lots of community mods and patches to help the game look better, in some cases run better, fix bugs, etc. Don't hesitate to use them if that's your thing. Give this game a try and find out WHY it's spoken of so highly by those who've seen it through.. A perfect example of horror storytelling mixed with RPG mechanics. One of the best PC games ever made.. Amazing game. Scary, fun, and well written. Made by the creator of bioshock.. It's a great game, but might be a little too complex for many players. It's an RPG so shooting is not really about skill, no such thing as a headshot, rather the damage is higher as you upgrade your weapon skills. There are 3 main branches that you get to choose at the beginning. It's much more effective to focus on a few certain skills than trying to be a jack of all trades. When I say complex, i mean there are Tech, Weapon and Psi (space magic) skills that all have sub skills. Plus you get a statistics modifier to increase physical abilities like Strength, Agility, Speed, etc. It will be a little hard to understand everything during the first playthrough. Story is nothing too special, but the charismatic antagonist makes up for it. The reason I deducted 2 points are: 1: Melee: It's very awkward, sometimes you can stun an enemy if you hit the first, sometimes not, it's random. The character also has a very large hitbox so some enemies can hit you even if you're behind their back. 2 I was playing on Hard and by the end of the game i had to use melee too much, because I couldn't find any ammo. As mentioned above, it was pretty awkward. For first time players I would recommend playing on normal and without manual saving. It really enhances the experience and there's always a way to avoid game over state, if you die.. An incredible cult-classic that basically set up the layout for future classic games like the BioShock trilogy, Prey, and more. Though the graphics may not have held up over the years the game play and story are still great. The game does a great job of creating a creepy sense of isolation and fear through its environment and terrifying enemies. System Shock 2 also provides a nice dose of puzzle solving and scary combat that builds up an interesting story though it's quests and hidden lore. For all the gamers who want to kick back and enjoy the games of the early 2000's, System Shock 2 is a must play!. this game is truly a masterpiece i remember when i started playing it i was around 12years old and it was too terrifiying for me so i let my 6years older brother play the entire game and i enjoyed watching every second of it .. A pure an unadulterated masterpiece! This is the game that in my opinion has the greatest moment in it of all time. Which is truly an accolade in itself for any title. Its also challenging and managed to blend a first person experience as an RPG style, which had not really been done before. So Kudos to the developers as they basically created a new genre in itself. And what I really love about it is that it manages the suspense factor impeccably. A survivor horror shouldn't just be about jump scares. It should reel you in, give you a blanket, and then turn that blanket into a horrifying mesh of unspeakableness. System shock 2 is peerless for its time. And should rightly go down as one of the best games ever made.. I figured I get around to reviewing this game even though my first experience with this masterpiece was back in 1999. System Shock 2 today still retains all of it's qualities albeit beeing very dated. You can enhance the game with a few mods that are easy to implement and even have their own guides in the games community hub on steam. One of the big strenght of this title is the feel of dread and isolation it delivers. The game is an RPG/FPS/Horror hybrid with alot of sci fi done right and puzzle solving. If you're familiar with the “Alien” series of movies and have played another master piece by the name of ""Deus Ex"" (the original pc version), you already have a good idea of what to expect. The atmosphere portrayed within this game is incredibly tense and has a creepy, somewhat disturbing ambience to it. I will attempt to explain how the game's plot goes: you are a soldier of a futuristic military force known as the UNN, and accept a mission to go onboard the maiden flight of mankind's latest technological achievement: a starship called the 'Von Braun'. This starship is capable of travelling faster than the speed of light and is the first manned spacecraft to explore beyond our solar system. You are put into hypersleep for six months and while you're asleep, all hell breaks loose. Aliens take over, all the crew is slaughtered and the AI running the ship goes berserk (ala 2001: A Space Odyssey). You however are not discovered and upon waking must find out what happened. And the game keeps your interest throughout the entire game. The actual gameplay mechanics, like ""Deus Ex"", are brilliant for those of us that like games a bit more intellectually challenging than say other horror titles like the newer Resident evil titles or moody fps games like Alien vs predator titles. The story line is presented brilliantly, and character development is unbelievably good. This is a glimpse of how games that are allowed to take risks could be, if the devs don't fall for the run of the mill console cannon fodder dudebro titles. Or at least in my opinion how they should be. If you're a budding game developer, this game would be a great place to look for ideas and examples of a quality gaming experience. In conclusion though, I can't really recommend this game enough. Summary of some of its traits: A quality game hampered today only by it's age. The ambience is heavy and dark. The atmosphere is one of death and hopelessness throughout, not unlike a good horror movie. It successfully imposes a feeling of isolation and dread. Storywise it is very good but where the game excells storywise is not necessarily in the story itself but in its execution. If you though Half-Life, Resident evil or Alien Isolation were good, you haven't seen anything. Gameplay is excellent. It's essentially an intellectual's FPS. It's closest comparison is the original pc version of Deus Ex, other examples are the Thief series (or Ultima Underworld series if you're old fart like me, or atleast old enough to remember), and newer examples are the Bioshock titles wich were inspired by this game. I't cheap and can be found both on Steam and GOG and well worth a buy and playthrough.. Simply the game that show ideals of level design, atmosphere and that game can offer to go trough as you. And also represent promises of the whole generation. Remember Citadel? Yes, we remember, as good as the old gaming world, that is unknown in these Godless time. Maybe Shodan-less time too. Hear, this is the game!. A sheer masterpiece from start to finish. It reeks of that pre 2000 FPS feel and it has aged remarkably well. It has a huge replay value, has the right level of challenge and each time I play it it just gets better. Hands down one of my favorite games of all time.. An early mix of action and RPG, which was the inspiration for the more famous Deus Ex game. In System Shock you could use dozens of psionic abilities in addition to a large selection of weapons. Great graphics for the time, excellent GUI, atmospheric music and a horror story about the AI capturing the world. The game was largely under-appreciated when it came out. Unfortunately I could never get this game run on Win 7.. It is very loosely an rpg, unless you happen to read a walk through that has character development, you're up **** creek without a paddle on a river starving piranha, the lack of ammo almost makes you have to create either a melee or psi fighter.. I've been a huge fan of this game since it came out in '99. Everything comes together in this low-fi horror game set in sci-fi future space. The interface is a joy to use and feels just complicated enough to keep things interesting while being intuitive. You never get a chance to rest for long and activating your inventory does not pause the game. This lends to incredible immersion. Audio design is top notch. Shodan, Xerxes, The **** excellently crafted. There's a million other things to say about this game, but If I were to say just one more thing, I'd tell you that there is a reason after all these years that this game can be re-released and still gets 90+ on Metacritic. The reason is, it's a game not to be missed by anyone.. Shockingly good Despite being a 16-year-old game SYSTEM SHOCK 2 has a lot to offer. Yes the graphics look very dated when compared to today’s games but they can be improved by the mod packs readily available online. And it’s really only the visual differences that set this game aside from contemporary titles. It’s immediately obvious that SS2 is the progenitor of the excellent Bioshock series. There’s a strong storyline backed by first-rate voice acting. The combat is okay given the game’s age, and the RPG elements are convincing. Personally, I’m not a fan of weapon degradation and repair (thankfully dropped in the Bioshock games) but otherwise the gameplay design is very good. You can pick this game up very cheaply these days and if you want a nostalgic wander down Video Game Lane you can’t go far wrong with this.. Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. System Shock 2 presents an interesting layout, you are a military recruit fresh off training stationed at the Von Braun and when like any other game, it all goes horribly wrong. I won't dive into too much plot detail but if you have ever played a Bioshock game, System Shock 2 plays similarly, so much so that it is only recognizable to fans of the Bioshock franchise. However the difference between this and its spiritual successor is that System Shock 2 has stronger rpg elements and is more unforgiving. Even with the limited engine of Thief running it, the developers manages to make the game not scary, but rather atmospheric and eerie to a point where noise gave me the chills. The sound design in this game is also fantastic, as it serves the gameplay by identifying which enemy is to be expected. I recommend turning the music off, not only to help the mood and ambiance of the game, but also the soundtrack has a rather uninspired midi-techno that dulls rather than elevates the game. However additional problems also extend into the game with hit detection, predictable and exploitable AI, and the final quarter of the game which loses steam and interest w/ an ending that leaves much to be desired. However, none of this holds back one of the finer PC games back in the Golden Age of shooters and the seat of atmosphere that led to the creation of the Bioshock franchise.. Made account to review this game. System Shock 2 (which I just completed with graphics mods installed) was equally as enjoyable as Deus Ex on first playthough, which was fantastic. The game starts off slow but after a few hours I was hooked. What I'd like to know is why the BioShock games feel like less of an experience compared to SS2. Sure they have way better graphics, physics, etc, but in no way shape or form were the BioShock games as enjoyable or as compelling as SS2. Not even close. I wish I never played any of the BioShock games and just played SS2. You know what--burn in hell BioShock. Forever.. Finally! After 15 long years, I was fortunate enough to experience supposedly one of the best pieces of pc gaming history that missed me in it's time, and.... yes, it's a masterpiece! SHODAN is one of the best villains ever, retrospective story told in the found audio logs is extremely effective, atmosphere and all the game mechanics are fantastic. Deus Ex still holds the crown in this category for me, but it's important to realize that SS2 came before that and have been a huge source of inspiration, which you can feel in every corner. I was a bit surprised by quite hard difficulty, but that added even more dread and tension to the overall experience. True PC gaming gem. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Creepy. Entertaining. Brutally challenging. This game will test your will and your guts. It is EXTREMELY tough and will challenge you even on Easy, but the narrative is what drove me to complete it. This is a very grotesque game, set in the farthest reaches of space. A setting I personally like because of its isolation. It is VERY creepy. Perfectly incites horror on a star ship 57 trillion miles away from Earth, hallways echo with moans of creatures, and looking out windows you can see the bleakness of space. The narrative is intriguing but lets down a bit towards the very end. IF you seek to challenge yourself ALOT yet enjoy an interesting sci-fi horror story at the same time, this is your game.. First time playing it, it reminds me of Half Life in terms of graphics. But the more I play it, the more I realize just how deep this experience is. They don't make games like this, anymore. Highly recommended. 10 out of 10.. A landmark game to be sure. The RPG elements were well implemented, allowing for many different playstyles and adding to the replayability. The atmosphere is great, the plot is well developed, SHODAN is a great villain and this game is very scary.. This is one game for ""found memories"". Yes, then and because it was a sequel to System Shock, it was great. But today, playing it again, brings back all the drawbacks to the front. It is not a game that, by other mean than pure chance, can be won without cheating. There are less and less ammo and resources as you progress and need it more and more. There is more re-re-re-spawning than you can handle with what the game let you have. It's really an unfair game made for cheaters. If, like me, you like to win a game in normal mode with a normal chance then, unless you get it real cheap, stay away from this one. If you do play it, it will still be enjoyable until you leave the Rickenbacker. After that, quit or put up with lots of frustrations or resort to cheating.. When a game like this is still being talked about and still given recognition 14 years from when it was released, that means a lot. This game has defined the FPS/Survival horror genre so that all the others before it could be inspired. It has also innovated storytelling and having a villain in a game that gets you really involved in what's going on. SHODAN is still considered one of the greatest video game characters and villains of all time. This game has had a profound impact on games and I believe if they made a 100 greatest games of all times list 100 years from now, System Shock 2 would be on the list.. Tense. Scary. Deep. Gripping. A wonderful experience for a BioShock fan like me, uncovering how the series was born and finding a story just as interesting as Rapture and gameplay way more satisfying than I could have imagined. The fights in this are some of the most white knuckle moments I've had in a game, playing out more like a really high pressure MMORPG battle than the simple shooters future entries were. I encourage anyone who loves good survival gameplay, where you really have to think about what supplies you have and what build your character is, to try this out. And of course, that story. That AMAZING story. Definitely a classic worth embracing if you have the time.. Probably one of the best games ever made, not just a short jaunt through a frag fest this game requires thought and innovation on the part of the player. The class system is very intensivley done and you can pick from multiple class's to make very believable subclasses all starting with your original choices for career path in the military. It is worth any hardcore gamers time to pick up this game and play it through to the end, as the story is very compelling. I never played system Shock 1 but when I started this game it made me want to. The graphics are a bit outdated by now but There are several individuals who have gone through this game to reskin and upgrade the textures. One such mod is called SS2 Rebirth, but there are others.. A pioneer in the Sci-fi Horror genre. The game has an a gripping story (you don't need to play the first one to understand thi one), great atmosphere and really satisfying gameplay, even after all these years since it was released. If you have a chance buy it, and enjoy the game that made the Bioshock and Dead Space franchises happen. Ahh, System Shock 2 the word 'classic' gets thrown around a lot these days where games are concerned (justifiably so in some cases, not so in others), but this game deserves that handle and then some. This piece of gaming magic was one of the very first proper RPG-style games I ever played (got a late start in the genre) and I was hooked right from day one. The atmosphere of the deserted hallways on the Von Braun is still, in my view, the finest piece of game design I've ever seen. (The haunted hotel from VtM: Bloodlines comes second brr!) The RPG elements (stats and such) are detailed enough to allow a wide range of character builds catering to various play styles but not so onerous as to induce boredom with the whole thing. True, the graphics are prehistoric compared with what we're used to nowadays but with a game that plays this well, who cares?? After nearly fifteen years of gaming across various systems and generations and having played some truly fine games (and others not so, for my sins) System Shock 2 holds a place of honour on my gaming roster and shows no signs of being ousted any time soon.. It's an ok game. An interesting storyline, amazing level design and progression, not to mention open character delevopment and many different ways to solve puzzles and kill enemies. Annoying and broken combat (wrench ftw), many ways to abuse shortcomings anout it. Personally I hated hacking minigames. Anyway, it's a superior title to almost all next gen productions and you can clearly see dumbing down process if you compare this to its ""spiritual successors"" of Bioshock series.. For the time, when this game was released, it was the perfect FPS game. The graphics were great. The sounds and music still work their charm and aged well. The gameplay is still top-tier. The massively successful bioshock franchise is the spiritual successor to this game. There are graphics overhauls to make the game appear more modern, along with the sounds and story this game can still be greatly enjoyed.. Needs comic relief, but it is one of the best FPS RPG Horror games i have ever had the honor to play. However i found the Multiplayer to be lacking, and the voice of SHODAN to be hard to understand with all the distortion.. One of my favourite single player experiences of all time! Truly an amazing game. The gameplay is very fun, being a shooter with RPG elements but it strikes the perfect balance. Heaps of logs (that are all voiced) that give lots of detail to the story. Great story and Shodan is one of the best characters very made! The atmosphere is perfect and the item management is challenging and fun! This game is truly a flawless shooter.. The greatest RPG/ FPS/ Horror game ever made. (How many of those are there anyways?) It has some great RPG elements where what skills you choose will greatly affect your performance, and yet the shooting gameplay is still really good, unlike certain RPG/FPS games today where one aspect always tends to overshadow the other (*cough*Fallout 3*cough*) It has a great, scary atmosphere, and the story is amazing. This game came out almost 15 years ago and yet most games today have not even come close to being as consistently great as this game.. Extremely deep PC game and I like how this one of the few PC exclusives now and its very well done all the sound effects and audio logs much better than that crappy overrated piece of crap Bioshock came after this and this is the best of all of the Shocks games. It's the best game I have ever played I really would like to back to the past and play this game for the first time. I can't understand why there are 10 negative opinions. Game is just perfect. Especially I love the soundtrack of ""SS2"" Eric Brosius is a genius. Thanks to him this game is so climatic. Now I am going to turn on this game again. Visually dated, but SS2 is still as adept at creating an immersive, tense atmosphere as it was in 1999. Ultima Underworld in space, massively influential and with a narrative every bit as engaging as its gameplay. One of the best PC games ever made, no question.. System Shock 2 is everything I look for in a game. Great gameplay, great story, nice graphics, great soundtrack, great atmosphere, uncanningly amazing voice acting. The player models are a bit ""ugh"" but aside from that the graphics are quite good for the time it was released. The one thing I didn't really like about it was that the default controls really ****. W is forward (as usual), but A and D were turn left and right, respectivly, and S was crouch, whereas Z and C were strafe left and right, respectivly, and X was backward. Of course, this can be easily changed, so it is but a minor annoyance. The thing that first hit me about this game was the tutorial. Most of the time, the tutorials in games are crudly done (Half-Life) or very vague (Ghost Recon) if existant at all (Day of Defeat). System Shock 2 takes tutorials to a whole new level. It's very thorough and fits into the storyline like a cute glove. And if you're on your second playthrough, you can skip the tutorial completely. However, if it is your first time playing, you really should play it. This is not just another FPS. This is unique. So how much is this worth? More than Steam is selling it for. If you don't like RPGs, you wouldn't like this. If you only play modern games because ""GWAFIXXXXX"", stop it for this game. You can't just not play it.. A fine, fine game. One of the best games ever created, System Shock 2 pioneered the FPS RPG hybrid and created an immensely potent atmosphere at the same time, and on top of that, it has aged surprisingly well. The graphics may seem dated but the audio design is superb, the atmosphere engrossing and unnerving, and the gameplay surprisingly 'fun' and visceral. I cannot reccommend this game enough.. System Shock 2 is simply one of the greatest games ever! It's VERY atmospheric and it's an only FPS game in my Top5","""system shock 2"" is a terrifyingly immersive experience, with deep RPG elements . compared to the original, this seems like a very weak copy with a lot of things changed for worse . a great story. A real creepy environment. GReat combat and research ."

The combat is boring and it’s easier to just turn the speed up to 4x and run through most dungeons but your reward is just terrible cutscenes with the worst voice acting in the series. My first FF game. I couldn't finish it when I was little. I guess I was lost. I played it a few years ago and abandoned it again. Now I started once again and this time I finished it. A nice cute game. The graphics are sweet. Cutscenes CGI is good. The story isn't bad. The world is interesting. Boss battles are enjoyable. The skills they use are magnificent. It is not unnecessary long game. and mostly easy. (except hunt quests). In Hunt, especially elite quests can sometimes be incredibly difficult. And sometimes you can't find the enemy you're looking for. Even if you look online. That's why walking long roads and trying to search ends up not being able to find it. It can be boring. Other than that, the game is generally good. It's different from the traditional FF gameplay. But since I'm not much of an FF fan, these issues don't concern me. I played the game and liked it. The characters stayed in my mind. This is an important success for a game.. The start of the decline of final fantasy for those of us that want the turn based battles of the old FF games. I'm sure there's the elements of the soul of FF in there with open world, story etc, but for me, the core of the FF soul and jrpg is turn based battles. If I want action, I'll buy an action game.. Best of Series along with FF6. Sadly it got development hell typical of old Square Soft. It got affect by Spirit Within flop and Develpment team drama. Make second half of game feel rush and boring.. 9.5. it is my second favorite in the series and wildly underrated/over hated.. This game is literally perfection! Best lore in a game ever! So much good things about this game!. I read someone saying: ""I remember this game as the one with pretty bunny girl, cause 90% of everything else I forgot"" Balthier and Fran carried the whole game. Vaan, your protagonist, is just an observer who stumbled upon other characters and they let him stay for no big reason, he doesn't influence anything in a bit, you can erase Vaan and his friend Penelo from the story and you loose nothing. No much human emotions here, no love, no humour, only grand politics which are no fun (yeah it's more like Babylon-5 than Game of Thrones). Level design is flat, only the first town seems interesting, until you understand that it is a mere decoration with absolutely nothing to do, no side-quests, no secrets, no mini games, no interesting NPCs. Gosh, everything looks like a mash up of endless empty hallways, and it applies to towns, dungeons, even open spaces that exist only to seek out lurking enemies. Lifeless - is a best word that describes most of this game.. This entry in the series is pretty different from what came before it. The story is less accessible (though still excellent), there really is no ""main"" character in the game, and there is essentially no romance subplot in the game whatsoever. After I accepted that it was not a traditional Final Fantasy game, it really started to hook me. The story is more political and nuanced than a lot of the more one-dimensional ""stop the big bad guy"" stories of most in the series. The cast of characters feel more mature and real with their personalities. The real time combat is well done. The dungeons and zones are visually delightful and fun to explore. Plus, there's plenty of secrets to find and optional bosses to keep you busy if you want to engage with the game at a deeper level. I understand the disappointment that a lot of people have with this different entry in the series. I felt the same way at first. But once you get over it being different, it excels in its own way and has become my favorite in the franchise.. Litteraly, after about 8 hours you don't give a damn about a single soul in this game. Though characters design seems really good (accept Penelo, she's epicly unremarkable). Along with copy-paste like levels that feel like one repetitive corridor the whole experience is dull and forgetable.. + Most brilliant and certainly most underrated soundtrack in the Final Fantasy franchise + Graphically the best looking game on the PS2 + World design and various landscapes are creative masterpieces + Cinematic cutscenes were way ahead of its time + Boss fights and monster hunts are epic + Excellent atmosphere of political tension - Gambit system and license board are pretty lame but didn't ruin the game for me as much as it did for others - Unmemorable cast of characters and underwhelming story. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. I admit I was let down by this game and didn't enjoy it much at first, but when I restarted years later I realized how great a game it really was.. It's not perfect, but it's my favourite game every, despite all his flaws this game feels magic to me, the license board is well implemented and feels great to complete, the combat and gambit system is advanced to his era, side quests are the more satisfying to complete in any final fantasy game, and good story, lore and characters.. and sorry for what happened in the development of this game, it could be much better, and the difficult one is a bit broken, thank goodness they improved it for new generations. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this eleventh game in the series. this collection is great.. This was the first Final Fantasy I played, that was ""just ok"". I didn't get invested in the characters and the story wasn't as good as I would've hoped. But that doesn't mean I didn't have my fair share of fun with the game. I truly enjoyed the hunting jobs which was the best part of the game experience. For me, only thing that's missing from this game is an engaging story. Too bad that's the thing I'm looking for when I turn on my Playstation.. Final Fantasy XII is in many ways the exact opposite of Final Fantasy X -- it doesn't boast nearly as strong of a narrative or cast, but is heavily focused on exploration and features some of the best side quests in the franchise (including the exceptional Clan Hunts). Final Fantasy XII also ditches the turn based combat in favor of the Gambit system -- a user friendly programming system that allows one to fine tune their character A.I. with incredible precision.. Thisbgame has the best writing ever. The sheer level of effort put on the dialogue and characters is unparalleled. It is a great game but it unfortunately falls into a pitfall many FF games fall into. You can make every character a hard hitting beast who can do white magic and cruise through the game. As such, it cannot be a 10/10 like FFIX imo. The cutscene direction, the English localization, and the voice direction makes the story REALLY enjoyable to watch. Sadly most of the main party you're stuck with comprises dry, unemotive characters. Vaan is the only character who is allowed to emote, and if he wasn't there I don't think I would have made it through the game. Aesthetically, the game looks great. The soundtrack is okay. A little too noisy for my liking but nothing particularly bad. The gameplay is meh. I liked the open zones, but I'm not a fan of the MMO combat. It's not as fun as the turn based battles with the cinematic camera shots and stuff. If you do like the battles, then thankfully there are a lot of optional bosses for you to fight.. My fav ff game by far it's so enjoyable has best bosses and open world in any ff game has like 100+ hours of gameplay value , it's my fav game of all time tbh. FFXII went a different route in 2 main areas. The battle system, which for the first time you could control the character at all times. and the fact that the story centered around a ""side"" character in Ashe. You control Vaan who is by far, in my opinion, the worst of the ""Leads"" in the FF games. He fell flat and was just very vanilla. Had we been able to control Balthier, or even Basch, it would have been much better. Overall though, it was a good FF in my opinion.. The ones in the negative section are the biggest 8 year olds I have ever seen! This game is great.. It's a good game facing the reality, but in this chapter of Final Fantasy miss one thing: Hironobu Sakaguchi. It detaches completely from the Final Fantasy games' formule. Some characters are very intresting even the plot decrease as you get the end.. Quite simply the best game on the ps2. currently re playing it now and still loving every minute of it.. Great G's just pure beauty. Play this game in year 2020 again. Still a masterpiece. The graphics is actually better than FF-X, except the pre-render movie.. After all the years I still don't know if it is a great game that I did not appreciate enough or a weaker game in the Final Fantasy franchise. It has a great story, many remarkable characters and an interesting world I liked to explore while getting rid of random encounters. However it has also some weaknesses as I dislike that you have no direct control of other party members (Liked the Gambit system first but it became annoying after a while), the license board / character development system is uninteresting and the protagonist Vaan has not that much purpose after the set up of the story (He even mentioned this himself in the game and it is sad as I liked him). Also there is an incredible annoyance with treasure chests. The game is set in the world of Ivalice (A few games from Square-Enix are set here like Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy Tactics but these are not related). The Kingdom of Dalmasca is one of a few smaller countries set as buffer state between two larger powers. When one of them Archadia invades another smaller country a war seems unavoidable as there is no response from the other great power. Two years after the events of the intro we follow the protagonist Vaan who dreams to become a sky pirate using an opportunity to infiltrate the royal palace. From here on the story gains momentum. There is far more to the attack on Dalmasca then it seems. You will face political plots, schemes, moral dilemmas and adventures. The twist are great and after some you will reevaluate your opinions as the world and some characters are not black and white. Sadly the protagonist Vaan is the least awesome character in your party. Ashe, Basch or Bathier with Fran were far better choices as main characters. Their stories are immersive and enjoyable. There is also more to them than it seems. The world however is impressive. I liked to explore it as the world is colorful and full of variety. There are also many interesting characters in this game. So far it looks really good but there are downsides. Lets start with treasures. There are some you have to avoid at all cost to get a really awesome weapon that is not obtainable otherwise. This is nowhere told outside **** and I think this is a no go. Also some chest contains good stuff only at a low chance (The guide gives you a percental value here). Then there is the Gambit system. There are no random battles or a battle screen. When you are near enemies a battle starts if they are hostile (Warning in some areas there a stronger enemies you should not attack early on). You have however only control of 1 character in a party of 3. For the others you have to set gambits. First are priorities 1 = highest priority, 2 second highest etc. Then you have to set them. Example: 1: Heal character when < 20% HP and 2: Attack enemies. With this you attack and heal when your HPs are low. If you do it in reverse you will never heal as it is never a priority. This is just the beginning as you should add to use an MP potion when the MP for healing are low at an ever higher priority. As you progress you get more options and can even buy some later on if I remember correctly. This was fun and exciting first but became a burden and uninteresting later on. As you battle you get License Points to spend on the License Board. There you can unlock spells, techniques, new items you are allowed to use (You can have them before but are not allowed to use them until unlocking) or status buffs. It is acceptable but not great. Downside is that you can only link summons to 1 character (This prevented me from using them). There is also a system of special Limit Break like attacks called Quickenings also learnable on the License Board. These can be chained for powerful combos. As per Final Fantasy standards there are many sidequests, additional content and bonus dungeons. Overall this is an excellent game where I disliked the battle system and have some other problems with. It could not win me over completely but it has some great moments and a good story (Sometimes it remembered me of Star Wars with a certain battle;-).. My first and favorite final fantasy. Maybe the most beautiful of them and original design. Thanks to this game i fall in love with the franchise and start to play ff6,7,8,9,10 and 15.. The best jrpg ever With adb battle system make game fun more than other jrpgs with turn base system with battle screen ... Story is serious and very deeper in comparison whit other final fantasies. A political , historical with Evil motives for gaining power and dictatorship. Level and environment and details is on another level for ps2 games that is still working even in 9 generation . Variety of weapons and locations and demons was important part of game ,and make game more fun ... Variety of this game is better than witcher 3 or Skyrim . Characters is Great and believable but best part is the game is character development. This is the best game that you choose to enter jrpg world.. This is, simply put one of the better modern RPGs, it isn't perfect... it has some minor flaws, but it is engrossing, it is fun, and the story is excellent until near the end where the authors seemed to lose their way to some degree. I can think of some minor potential improvements but they are quibbles, you'll love the game.. Personally im not a big fan of automated sidekicks, and i dont like that to get gambits for commands on the allies you got to get em, thats kinda strange. The game is fine, but when you get really hypied about the plot/storry the game ends.. This one is a bit of an oddball in the series. It is very different from the rest, both in terms of its themes, atmoshpere, the way of telling a story and how you play it, really. It kind of feels like an mmo, with no loading screens for encounters, an open world and a lot of content that feels a bit like filler. Story is more of a political background and Vaan is somehow even more bland than Tidus. But ultimately, its a very good game, just not necessary good Final Fantasy title.. Final Fantasy 12 is one of the most beautiful things you can see anyone who likes rpg and this thing is really surprising if you wish to be deeper than you are.. The inverted camera made this game unplayable for me. It may be a great story but I will never know.. This game feels like some MMORPG rather than a single player Final Fantasy game. You travel through the huge but empty world killing everything in sight to rack up experience. Story is boring.. This journey start from a man wants to take his brother right And from that you will explore a wonderful and amazing world with a very good characters and also you will discover another story in this game besides the main story In the end Final Fantasy XII will give the players what they want from any game they think about it. One of my favorite games of all time. Steal from every monster in the game and there are a lot.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: AWESOME. Dialogue: GREAT.. Loved this game. My favourite in the series and basically the last great Final Fantasy the series has released. It ended with a bang. Tremendous game with an incredible story. The gameplay system is as deep as it gets in the series with tons of customization. The remaster on PS4 is even better but this remains a must play. One of the best RPGs I have ever played after I was extremely disappointed with Final Fantasy X. The mature and adult story was enough to convince me that I had something special in front of me. I really recommend this one.. I can't say this game have the best plot in FF series, but definitely have the best combat gameplay and the best sceneries. A vast world to explore, too huge talking about PS2 games. outstanding cinematics and outstanding magics effects and animations. Rewarding for those that work hard farming and grinding items and skills and exploring everything the game has to offer. All the 250 hours i spended in this game was worth.. Final Fantasy XII is a great game ! What, only 7.5 ? I should try the newest version.. One of the biggest jump in innovation of the franchise and undeservely hated for daring taking risks. The narrative is underdeveloped in parts but that big jump in gameplay improvements makes up for that.. If you look at this game as a final fantasy title, it's a 6. If you look at it as a normal title, it's a 8. But I chose to give it a 7, because this game does not feel like a final fantasy game. imo, a final fantasy game is about the turn based system, the adventure, the great music, the amazing story and the wide range of characters. This game has the turn based system (I will get into that later) and the adventure, but it doesn't have any of the rest. FFXII is a game you play for its game play, not for its story. Luckily, the game play is amazing, while it gives you the illusion of not being a turn-based battle system (no random encounters and free movement of characters), it actually totally is a turn based system in its mechanics. Which is a balance that I really enjoyed with this game, FFXII also brings you the type of exploration that you would see in a MMORPG. But what truly breaks the game, and it's a tragedy, is the boring, bland and mediocre story. There's not much I can say about it, it's honestly something to sleep over, luckily the game keeps it short and tends to focus more on the game play, like it's conscious of how bad the story is. The characters are generic and have nothing special about them, you can barely tell the main character is one at all. The music is also mediocre, but this is something I would have been willing to look over if the story had been at least interesting. To conclude, this games is an offline singleplayer MMORPG. Fun game play, bad story.... *YAWN* This is one of the most boring plotlines ever conceived. And it's mostly full of hot air. Kinda like Tom Sawyer decided to make a JRPG so it's just a needlessly convoluted that was only ever meant to entertain one person in the world: its creator. Whatever game you can imagine on your own is better than this, just go think about that instead of grinding in this game endlessly.. i honestly could never understand people praising FFX and giving FFXII a bad review. I mean seriously, just for the moment, stop thinking of Vaan as of main protagonist. This story is not about him. Surprisingly i realized it very early, and as soon as i did - it was one of the best FF experiences i had. The only problem i had with PS2 version are unchangeable inversed controls. But i was so determined to see this game through, so i adapted myself to fully inversed controls. imagine the kind of dedication it takes to actually do such a thing.. A fun, engaging game with an innovative combat system and interesting story. The world is huge for the time it came out and the optional areas are amazing. This game contains so much content I haven't been able to 100% it yet, despite buying it back when I was a kid. The story, while not exceptional, is still interesting enough and the character are all pretty good (Yes, even Vaan and Penelo). The music is amazing and the levels all have a distinctive look aesthetic. It's almost a perfect game for me. I think the only thing holding it back in my opinion is that I prefer a more action-oriented combat system, but that's just personal preferences.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Gambits is my favorite JRPG combat system. It elegantly breaks down game AI into 3 simple components: priority, condition, and action. I wish more games used it. Sadly, plots and characters in this game are underdeveloped.. A great Final Fantasy game with a battle system that is so close to real time action rpg games like Kingdom Hearts but not quite.. I didn't respect this game enough when it came out. Closer to tactics that FFX and it was a ton of fun, especially the monster hunts. Great memories. I think one of the reasons people are so critical is because it is a final fantasy game. If it would be a new series then evrybody would say: ''Did you hear of this game? It's really good, you should try it out.'' And they would be correct. The game is really good. The environments are beautiful, the characters are okay, the story is good... My problem is with the gameplay. At first it seemed boring to me because you control only one character instead of all of them and when an enemy appears your party members attack on their own accord and during the fight you can hardly evade the attacks of the enemies. What is the point of creating real time battles (the opposite of turn based battles in which you stand in a row and await your turn) if you can't evade. You can run away while you wait for your bar to charge but you will recieve damage of a swordslash 4 meters away from you. Another thing is the large amount of grinding before a boss battle because you aren't strong enough yet to beat him. It happens multiple times that you have to grind for 2 to 3 hours and that isn't fun. However, later I started to value the depht of the gambit system. The instructions you can give your party members are really extensive and you can really spend a lot of time thinking about how to set up the gambits of each character. There is a lot to do in this game and it has a beautiful soundtrack.. FFXII is great in a lot of ways and delivers many things that I have always wanted in past Final Fantasy games. Unfortunately for me it lacked some of what made many of the other games in the series truly masterful and as a result I think it ends up as one of the more mid-level entries in the series. The game is far above average, but in my opinion its confusing narrative and generic main characters hold it back from being a masterpiece. The gameplay is as good as past entries but it makes a lot of big changes, some good some bad. One of the gameplay changes that I really appreciate is that there are no more random encounters, which was one of the things I hated in past entries. Being able to see all of your enemies on the field is a great change for a lot of reasons. You can often avoid enemies and get through redundant areas quickly. You can also track down or avoid strong enemies which makes grinding and travel far better. You will often need to avoid strong enemies because sometimes they are way above your level, even early in the game. It is so much more believable and makes attempting to defeat strong enemies early much more rewarding. Gameplay is also much less linear than it was in FFX and that was one of the weakest parts of that game. One downside I found was the MMO style combat to be quite boring at times, especially dealing with weak enemies that don't require the use of special abilities to defeat. There are still some cool looking spells but there are few that are as cinematic as the overdrives in FFX. Summonings this time around are good but didn't feel as satisfying. The story while still good, is a step down from many of the other FF games that I have played. FFVI, FFVII, FFIX and FFX all had more engaging stories. The problem with the story is that most of the major events take place in the background. The main characters, particularly Vaan seems almost unnecessary to the plot. A lot of the bigger ideas that are presented have very little relation to the characters you are playing as. The Occuria for example only have a few scenes and their role is never really fleshed out. The player is also not given context for a lot of the dialog and world building that happens between many of the characters. Final Fantasy games almost always have complex stories but usually as the story progresses you learn a little bit more with every scene and by the end almost everything is revealed in a meaningful way. In FFXII most of the scenes are not given much context and that made it difficult to get invested in what was happening. The motivations of the characters seemed vague throughout most of the story. That isn't say that the writing is bad, a lot of the dialog is very believable and sophisticated but they didn't seem to blend together well into a cohesive whole. The story does have many good ideas though. The Bahamut air fortress was awesome and the idea of the judges is great. The Occuria had potential to be a good idea they just aren't well explained in the story. I really did feel that this world could serve as the stage for many great stories but the one they chose to tell didn't seem to take advantage of the cool world that they have designed. Characters are also a weak point of FFXII. Vaan is probably my least favorite main character in a Final Fantasy game. He just seemed to be generic and he didn't seem to serve a meaningful role in the quest. On the surface he seems a lot like Luke Skywalker but lacked almost all the important qualities that make Luke an interesting character. A lot of the characters seemed to be loosely modeled after Star Wars characters, but most weren't as iconic. I also felt that the characters bonds with each other were a bit underdeveloped. Most of the interactions between the characters didn't give me the indication that they had formed deep relationships. Ashe in particular could have used more conversations since her role is quite complex. I also didn't feel like I got to know the characters in a deep way. Visually FFXII is mostly excellent, the monster designs are some of the best in the series and the environments are large and detailed. The Judges are all cool looking and iconic. The airships are also awesome looking and there are some really unique ones. The cutscenes are great although I think they are a slight step down from FFX. My only major complaint with the graphics is that a lot of areas of the game look very dull. Like a lot of MMOs of the time, everything seems to have a matte look to it. Lot of areas of the game look a bit desaturated. Overall though it's a great looking game and one of the better looking of that time period. Sound Design is almost always great in Final Fantasy games and this is no exception, however, it isn't one of the best soundtracks or uses of music in the series. The voice acting is very good but I would have liked to have more memorable music. I give FFXII an 84%. If you come to Final Fantasy XII looking for another traditional turn-based, full of cliches and unengaging gameplay Final Fantasy title, you are going to be disappointed. If, on the other hand., you come looking for a game with an interesting storyline, mature themes, enjoyable characters (with the exception of Vaan and Penelo, I'd argue this is the BEST Final Fantasy cast ever), deep and engrossing gameplay, challenging sidequests and enemies, you will be satisfied. Final Fantasy XII lets you go anywhere you want, whenever you want (for the most part). The License system lets you customize your characters at your own leisure, similarly to FFX's Sphere Grid. The Hunt quests require you to trigger specific conditions for the spawning of rare enemies, adding a layer of thought to what could have been an otherwise mindless, boring task like that of FFX's Monster Arena (""kill these same enemies over an over again to unlock a rare enemy!""). The cast is well defined compared to previous entries. All of them have very specific goals and motives. The English dub is superb, particularly for Balthier. The game is not perfect or anywhere near close to it, however, and neither were the previous Final Fantasy entries. Aside from the optional encounters, FFXII certainly lacks challenge, and the License Board ensures you can pretty much make each character behave like the one next to him/her. Most of the treasure chests hold pointless treasure (compared to the very effective loot of previous games). I recommend you check out the International Zodiac Job System version if you can, which fixes most of the problems the original release had, and has an unofficial English translation available for download. The Zodiac Age will be releasing later this year for the PS4, so you may want to avoid getting FFXII in favor of an upgraded, better version of the game (as it will incorporate the changes made by the International release). Make sure to also check out Vagrant Story (PS1), set in the same universe as this game: Ivalice. I score this game 8 out of 10: it's a fantastic game, not perfect, and with its share of annoying issues, but very much worth your time.. I love this game from start to finish. This game has all I wanted to see. Great rpg, good story, memorable gameplay and good gameplay, and great characters. And much more.. I don't understand all the hate that this game receives. This is by far my favorite FF game. Battle system is a fun balance of action and tactical thinking. Graphics are amazing for a PS2 game. Story... Story is the best in the series! Mature and interesting, with great set of characters (Balthier is my favorite character in FF games). This game deserves much more positive attention, especially since most horrible FF13 sold twice as much as this awesome game.. Ok. If you've played FFX you'll know FFXII is worse. Yes, both are very different and FFXII has a completely different combat system. The best of this game is its graphics. The cinematic videos are really stunning and the best parts are at begining and at the end of this game. In my opinion, one of its flaws, apart that is way too long, is that when you are more or less in the middle of the game the story becomes very poor, and I missed more conversations and cinematic. I would rated with and 8'5. I mean, as I said, the best is the graphics, the plot is also interesting, the battle system you have to get use to it and the soundtrack it's good but nothing special. What I can assure you is that you'll be entertained.. I will start off by saying that alot of die hard FF fans may not get attached to this game, but IMO it definitely has its' own unique identity that is worth observing. FF 1 - FF 9 will always be a special set for me and I consider these ""classic,"" but like FF10 this game brings something different and interesting. First, FF12 does look pretty nice on the PS2 and I do enjoy the new combat system where it is not as turn-based and you can move","the game is a single player MMO with auto attacks and commands on ATB gauge . it's fine, but in retrospect inferior to other FF in the series . the combat is boring and your reward is just terrible cutscenes with the worst voice acting ."
159.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is the best game ever! Absolutely amazing and beautiful, this is adventure it's a big experience!. Amazing game, graphics, story, side quests, choices, gameplay. It has everything to keep you sticked to the PS4 for days. One of the best games ever created. Memorable main and side quests, a coherent and beautiful world. A game to play before you die.. I would give the Witcher 3 a perfect rating, except for a small issue. It’s a game with an awesome story and really immersive world. It deserves the perfect the score, but Rouch had other plans. Rouch ruined my life. He was the main reason of my divorce. I’m about to lose it. But it’s still a good game. Beautiful game, so immersive and so memorable. This will be one of the greatest rpg's of all time.. amazing game with a very engaging storyline and the best soundtrack. just play it. It's trash when you must pause the game to play gwent and it's time limited. Too much yak not enough hack. Seriously this ""game"" is 90% dialogue, most of which is insane drivel. Some may find the ""story"" compelling but to be honest wondering round a forest looking for a goat just doesn't do it for me. Really? Visuals are good especially for an old game but gameplay is poor, especially combat mechanics. Controls are clunky and the music is so bad I turned it off inside an hour. The much hyped side quests are essentially all the same; 1 pick up a quest from a notice board 2 go speak with an NPC 3 go to a location and search for clues 4 have a fight with a monster 5 return to NPC for your reward. Rinse and repeat. I'm glad I bought this on sale.. A perfect game. witcher 3 has a amazing story with a great setting. For the time the combat was very well rounded and the game of gwent is always fun.. amazing game. The characters the story the setting just breathtaking. I generally play a lot of first person Shooters in the amount of detail in this story is something I have NeVER Really experienced before. I definitely recommend this to anybody. you do not have to have any knowledge of the The Witcher to enjoy this game. best game of all time==========================================================. It is truly shocking how poorly TW3 has aged -- like soft cheese in hot sun. I wanted to give the PS5 Next Gen upgrade a whirl, hoping that many of the game's rough edges would have been sanded down. No luck. Roach is still awful to ride -- spawns wherever, can't follow a trail, and constantly gets **** on brush. Most of the time I opted to sprint rather than try to use the horse. Anything involving boats is a gigantic PITA. Just skipped anything boat-related. The skill points system is insanely stupid. If you're even a few levels above your current quest, then you're rewarded with next to no points. This effectively de-incentivizes doing any quest that you're overlevelled for. Which may, in the end, be for the best, as this game is INCESSANTLY, INSUFFERABLY fetch-questy. I enjoyed TW3 eight years ago, but after Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate3, The Witcher is hopelessly clunky, boring, and irritating.. Greatest of all time. LELELELELEYLELELELELELYELELELELEYLELELEYELELEY LELEY LELEY BEST GAME. This review is for the PS5 version. The story telling, the characters, the side quests, the locations, everything is done with so much love and care, it is difficult not to fall in love with it. Unfortunately the PS4 launch version struggled a lot with the ambitious visuals of the game. The PS5 version cleans it up a lot and brings it very close to the PC version. The only thing keeping it from being a 10/10 are somewhat stiff animations and clunky controls on horse and combat.. Arguably the greatest RPG of all time. Firstly, the game is undoubtedly a stadound due to the main protaganist, Geralt of Riva, a true all men want to be him and all women want to be with him character. This is then built upon by a plethora of amazing supporting characters set inside a truly unique and massive world. The replayability of the game is for me what makes it truly great. There are so kany RPG's that I would consider a 10/10 on the first playthrough but have no replayability value - This is different. Over the course of the games lifespan i have replayed the game 4 times, each as enioyable as the last. Closing point - The DLC's. More than likely the greatest DLC's of all time. One being basically a standalone game in its own right. Forced to give a 10 here but my true rating is 9.5. Story: 9/10 Customisation: 8/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Non-Story related quests: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Open World: 10/10. There's nothing to say. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is one of the best looking open worlds in my reputation because it is a game with very beautiful creatures and some wonderful ones. Very well thought out and investigative quests, you can immerse yourself in a world with beautiful landscapes but the most important and beautiful thing (apart from screwing half the world with the right choices) is the free choice in thinking, acting and speaking. my vote? 10.. Witcher 3 demonstrates the best way to tell stories in a video game. It doesn't shove movie cutscenes in front of you like Red Dead Redemption or new God of War, instead it lets you experience and make your own choices. Witcher 3's quest design proves that different choices with unknown consequences is the best way to mimic real life in a game. Just like the poem by Robert Frost said: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.. Love it!!️️️. LOVE IT ️️️. Best of the best... Looking forward to the continuation of this legendary game! With improved graphics.. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game, it is a true masterpiece that remains the benchmark for RPGs years after its release. CD Projekt Red has created a world that is so alive and atmospheric that it seems as if you are really traveling through Velen, the streets of Novigrad or the wild mountains of Skellige. The plot is one of the best in the gaming industry. Every quest, even the smallest, is filled with a deep story and choices that make you think. And the main line with the search for Ciri and the fight against the Wild Hunt is an emotional rollercoaster that keeps you going until the very end. The gameplay is not far behind either. The combat is smooth and dynamic, alchemy and magic add depth, and the possibilities for customizing Geralt - from equipment to play style - make each passage unique. But the real magic is the modifications created by the community. From cosmetic changes to new stories - mods allow you to expand the already huge world. Want to change the combat system? Add new costumes? Or even get additional stories? All this is available thanks to mod support, and it's truly impressive. Also, every detail in the game looks thoughtful. From the dialogues to the little things in the world - everything speaks of love for detail and respect for the players. The soundtrack deserves a special applause - the melodies are so atmospheric that you want to listen to them even outside the game. The Witcher 3 is not just a game, but a phenomenon. It offers something for everyone: a rich storyline, an open world, customizable mechanics, and a community that continues to improve it today. If you haven't played it yet - be sure to fix it, because this journey with Geralt will be remembered forever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game wants to be every position good because action,characters,story,questline,combat system,atmospher,side missions,side characters,open world,npc quality,level design everything is so close to perfect. One of the greatest games ever created. Strong writing and characters, great graphics and story, a believable world with immersive music. You’d struggle to find a fault here.. Second only to Skyrim on my list of most-loved games ever. Witcher sense is a great plot device for players, and the myriad of creatures and monsters you get to fight keeps the excitement going.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No words for that game you should play it is a must one of the best RPGS in history. The best game ever made. Chapter/Story/Choise/Soundtrack masterpiece. Beautiful. The best open-world RPG with a story that can cover up any gameplay shortcomings.. My favorite of all time, the witcher 3 it's not just agame,it's a masterpiece, every character have it's own unique story, even the monsters have there own part, and some where human, who have acurse, everything is written well, may be the combat is easy but it's fun and simple, and the world is perfect, it's totally dark and amazing, even the graphics are good, I can talk about this game for hours and it's beautiful. Man, this game is a masterpice with a great story line that can take over 100 hour. If ur not doing main quest u can do side quest or you can hunt monsters. Not suprised this game has won the game of the year award. W CD PROJECT RED !!!. Is by far the best game I ever played. Great gameplay and the story is incredible.. this is the game of the year for a reason, story amazing , graphic still stunning in 2024/2025 and true rpg experience! 10/10!. Probably my favourite game of all time. Nearly everything about this game is perfect (aside from the combat), the dlcs are also probably the best dlcs I've ever played in any game (especially blood and wine). The greatest game of all time. I've played Witcher 3 over 5 times and have 500+ hours on it. Every playthrough was incredible I can't get over this game even almost 10 years later. For RPG fans this is a must-play and In my opinion, the best the genre has to offer, as even 10 years later you can still see other developers try to recreate the magic the witcher 3 was able to make, but most fail. The only game I've played that comes close is maybe Baldur's Gate 3. But Witcher 3 will always be Number 1 for me.. It is with great excitement that I have to say that this is a great game that goes down in history and needs no introduction!. the best game of all time, best storyline, Great game play, and njihhhyujjjjjj. I don't know if the devs can ever recreate an experience like this one ever again.. Greatest Game of All Time.Even though the combat is weak and the controls feel a bit wonky at first and the amount of tuturials in the beginning is overwhelming. It's actually not perfect but it's the greatest game of all time! Play it. That's all I can say. if you're interestedand on the fence, give it a shot. A fair shot.Play for a few missions. Don't give up if it feels strange at first. You owe it to yourself to experience the greatest game ever developed.. Awesome setting and music score, great gameplay, nice story but many bugs and glitches.. On this day in 2024, this work has been updated for many years and has become a perfect masterpiece. Blood and wine are good, but personally, I prefer Heart of Stone.. This seemed like a quality game but I couldn't play for more than a few hours: slow tedious story with never ending dialogue, barebones combat, cluttered UI, lack of QOL features, etc. Truly a by-the-numbers formula that requires a staggering amount of time to get started past the intro, cutscenes, tutorials, more cutscenes, more bs dialogue, etc. and once you finally get going it's not that satisfying. I really wish I liked this but why the f are games like this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Everything is really cool. + the new gen update is really nice, I love the new camera. It will give you everything you expect from it imo.. Beautiful storytelling let down by some clunky combat but the experience is so incredible that you can forget about some shortcomings and get lost in the world.. Cyberpunk is one of my favorite games so I thought I would play this too. Pros: nice graphics, lots of content. Cons: simple combat, music gets repetitive, slow story. Overall thoughts, story is interesting enough to keep me going but I wouldn't buy this game for full price or even recommend it to casual gamers.. One of the best story games ever created. Very well made, I'm very excited for witcher 4 ngl. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's impossible for anyone not to recommend this game, and anyone who says otherwise is completely mistaken and has a distorted perspective **** game.I say this with all certainty, most of the negative reviews only concern themselves with a single point of the game ""the combat"" others find the ""combat difficult and not noob friendly"" which doesn't make sense, because the game's combat is the most simple as it **** I put this in this way because they find the shared analyzes ridiculous, since the games that have come out since the Anthem Syndrome will only come out with poorly made games, without any structure in the story, characters with weak backgrounds and the Witcher not only the game but its entire universe They deserve to be highlighted as excellent games to set an example **** game or what makes it good.(History Overall and Characters)- From start to finish, I'm speechless, every choice you make, good or bad, has an absurd impact on the characters and the ending of the game itself, the Witcher 3 is the continuation of the previous games where it brings back notable characters from past **** game manages to convey the same feeling of being present in that world, of actually living the daily life of a witcher and of making tough decisions at critical moments. Only reading lovers could understand this feeling of truly entering this world.Only reading lovers will be able to understand this feeling, we end up feeling like we are really inside the story of the characters and the world itself, it's not for nothing that great games end up being based on Books already **** despite this, we ended up becoming interested in wanting to know more about the game's world, I was one of the people who fell into Witcher 3, I never got to touch 1 and 2 but I had already seen something, and when it's finished I will definitely give it a leap forward in previous franchises, I don't expect the same level as Witcher 3.{Combat and Mechanics}The combat is not very challenging, with just a few hours to minutes you can understand the basic mechanics, which end up being a reason for many to ignore the game, despite this I found the style of combat that the game gives us interesting. The character's movement ends up being buggy and not synchronized with the game's NPCs, often when dodging or attacking an NPC who is in stun, you still take damage even if the enemy NPC is doing an attack animation and it is cancelled.Even so, I don't find combat boring, I always experiment with ways to try and make it fun, always using combat tactics to simulate that I really am a real witcher.{Graphics and performance}The graphics and the world itself are full of details and things to do, compared to some games where they make you walk 500 km to do something and I find it boring, if I walk around the game every now and then there is always some interaction or special event with someone NPC leaving more and more curiosity and desire to explore new rare or unknown interactions.Performance, although some have reported problems even with PCs at the same level as mine, I have never encountered problems resulting from poor performance, crashes, corrupted saves, etc.I even consider Witcher 3 to be an excellent, very well optimized game.(Side Quests and DLC)In some games we can consider that the side quests are literally to fill you up and make you waste game time, but in this game all the side quests are for you to do, I believe that the contract missions where you have to kill some monsters are not have so much impact but completing missions will give you the possibility to interact with new characters that can affect the main quest in general. Honestly, I wasn't bored with the side quests, which even surprised **** game's expansions are excellent, nothing to criticize them for, and I'm sorry they didn't make an expansion of the Blue Mountains area where at the end of the Bloody Baron's quest he ended up heading off with his **** the game, stop being silly about the combat, if you think the story is horrible, start considering reading some books and opening your mind on that aspect.. Fantastic game. Well-built story, very easy gameplay, charismatic characters, spectacular graphics, simply perfect.. Absolute masterpiece! Best 9€ I have ever spend. Some bugs and glitches here and there.. Hope the next installment is full next gen and better combat. And no woke stuff in it CD project red I hope you don't do that. Ten years have passed, and this is still my favorite game. The atmosphere of the game is very well created. Every mission, every side quest, every performance, and every dialogue are perfect. The two DLCs are even better than each other. I've played through the game four times, and every time I finish it, it leaves me with a deep impression. Some people say that the combat is weak, but I don't feel that way at all. After all, this is not an ARPG or ACT game. RPG is all about delivering multi-linearity in performance and storyline, and CDPR has done an excellent job in this regard.. The Witcher 3. One of those 10/10 Games. There is not much to say other than GOAT. If you have over +100 hours in your life to absolutely kill, play this game. It's the most overrated game ever. The story is just boring and long. It forces you to ""interact"" and choose dialogue on each stupid conversation. The music sounds out of context and like a background noise. Combat system ... well there is none. Just dodge in the most basic way. The world is cartoonish and repetitive. You feel no difference between different locations in the world. All look and feel the same. I mean, did you give this 9/10? how about Red Dead 2 or Ghost of Tsushima if this one is 10? puff. best game i have ever played, and it is not ever close, like seriously, everyone should try it, i know it might seem overhyped. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PlayStation 4, 10/10. PlayStation 5, 0/10. Intolerable command input delays.. What I really like most about the game is the gorgeous open world; the amount of details the developers put in are amazing - such as the liveliness of a town, how the world is beautifully depicted with good lighting and sunset, trees swaying under the rain and wind etc, I love it so much that I can just keep running around in the world doing nothing. I really love the game (the exploration, the side quests, the mechanics and great casts of individuals etc) though the overall main story doesn’t do it for me very much.. I would say the game is average. The main story of the game seemed too long, and because of so much side quests it seemed ""обрывисто"". The story in some of the side quests were really interesting and touching, in some not so much. I would say the story of the game is about 7/10. I played the game at the hardest. The level design is bad. At the start, it was super hard to do something, but after 10 or 20 missions I improved enough to have enjoyful experience in gameplay. However, after a while, I understand that the gameplay mainly consisted ""dodge"" + ""attack"". The mechanics of bomb was not comfortable to use. You would iterate all the possible variants to search the one you want. Gwent was really fun. I plan to play this game again, in the future; but before that I want to read all Witcher books and play first two Witcher games. By the way, I suggest playing game in the Normal or maybe in Hard, but not Very Hard definitely because the hardness does not add more gameplay tactics. The enemies become just sponges.. Amazing experience. The Witcher 3 is more than a game; it’s an experience. There is a perfect balance between its story, combat, RPG elements, and soundtrack. I've finished it countless times and still feel immersed in its entire world. Everyone who is a fan not only of the Geralt of Rivia saga should play it, but anyone who calls themselves a fan of video games, as it has become a cult classic.. Went into this knowing nothing about the Witcher & turned into my favorite game of all time. It is perfect.. a fantastic game with an insane world and amazing writing fro the characters. the graphics are still beautiful and it has an awesome sound track. the main story is so much fun and all the dlc is outstanding as well. truly a huge game that everyone should play even if you know nothing about the witcher.. Easily my favorite game of all time. Yes it has its flaws but as a finished product, it is unrivaled. Thismasterpiece is so intricately designed that I come back to it every year since 2019. One of the best games ever made.. Greatest tame of all time, everything about this game is well made and breathtaking from the maps to the side quests and also the main story, altho the best thing about this game are the expansions that are better than most full priced games. this game is wonderful, incredible, goat game but (The physics of the characters are very simple, jumping etc. is very funny) BUTTTTT AGAİN THİS GAME İS SO GOOD. This is the best game that was ever released in my opinion, this would probably be and stay the best game I ever played in my life.. I love the world of The Witcher and have played through all of the games and even read a solid number of the books. This is what piqued my interest. Fun game although the combat is not the highlight.. One of the best games ever. Love it. I hope for Witcher 4. When will it be released?. Rpg masterpiece. Amazing music, visuals, story, characters and word design. Please play it.. no open world has ever come close to the witcher 3 its the king of all open world games. I played this game 3 times on the PS4 including all the DLCs. It has a special place in my heart till date.. SCORE: STRONG 9 = 9,7 If you didnt play the game until today, PLAY THE DAMN GAME!!!!! 10/10 Story, even the sidequests are good. 10/10 characters Combat is fun, nice open world, everything about the game is nearly perfect.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Greatest of all time. I've never seen a game that incorporates history and culture and legends and politics so well into fantasy. It's so beautiful and fantastic. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I gave it up after playing for 39 hours. Visually is astonishing but it lacks from fun. The development of the history is so slow.. Horrible Slow game. It’s just about talking with NPCs. If you want to talk go outside!. One of the best games in history. Incredible campaign, beautiful open world and diverse and interesting side missions, which were so good they would make a game on its own. You can buy without fear..

For me, it's not just a game; it's a timeless adventure that has earned its place among the greatest of all time.. CDPR, really outdid itself, with the 3rd entry, in The Witcher. The only real downside in this game is the repetitiveness, in the combat.. Masterpiece. There are only two games that I have played through twice and this is one of them.. How can I describe this game... Well, does it have the best open world? No. Does it have the best rpg mechanics? No. Does it have the best combat mechanics? No. Does it leave a hole in my heart that can only be filled again by replaying it? Yes.. This is the best game I've ever played. I honestly cannot describe how good this game is. The feel of it, the side quests, the main story, the characters, it is all literal perfection. The world they've created, you could simply just walk around, or ride around for hours or days and just feel like this is your life. The side quests are also amazing, they're natural and not forced and give you all choices on how to approach them. Gwent is also a card game within that is unbelievable. I once jumped onto Witcher and spent 4 hours playing Gwent in a tavern in Novigrad and I loved every second of it. This game is a huge part of my life, and I salute CDPR for creating this amazing world. This is a must play, even in 2024.. This is such a great entry into the series of games. I am a fan of open world games and what a lot of games in the genre do is that there is either no structure/story or too much that things are hindered heavily unless you progress the story. I found the balance in this game to be great and fitting to the fact that you're a monster hunter and have to roam around a fight monsters. The story itself is great and the cast of characters are all compelling to the point I felt awful when some of my actions had terrible consequences later on. With that being said, when it comes to gameplay it does get a little repetitive and mashy. Sure, you'll have to consume a potion every once in a while but that is occasionally and can only be done outside of battle. For most engagements though, you can just attack a lot and use magic occasionally. This game is great and is carried by a very strong story/plot and world building. The gameplay is a little repetitive and straight forward seeing as witchers are super humans that have witcher radar that helps them to solve all their problems. Overall a great and immersive game.. A truly fantastic masterpiece, CD Projekt Red have out done themselves. Along withit's 2 DLC expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, this game is just beyond a masterpiece at this point.. Witcher 3 is a masterpiece in the world of gaming. It is an open-world role-playing game that combines stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and immersive gameplay to create an unforgettable experience. The game follows the journey of Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, as he embarks on a quest to find his adopted daughter and unravel a dark and complex **** of the standout features of Witcher 3 is its breathtakingly beautiful and detailed world. From lush forests to war-torn villages, every location feels alive and realistic. The game's attention to detail is remarkable, with each NPC having their own unique story and the environment reacting dynamically to your **** storytelling in Witcher 3 is exceptional. The game presents players with morally ambiguous choices that have far-reaching consequences, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. The characters are well-developed and memorable, with their own motivations and conflicts. The main storyline is gripping, but it's the numerous side quests and contracts that truly shine, offering diverse and engaging stories that are often as captivating as the main **** terms of gameplay, Witcher 3 offers a satisfying blend of combat, exploration, and role-playing elements. The combat system is challenging but rewarding, requiring strategic thinking and a mastery of Geralt's arsenal of weapons and magic. The vast open world is filled with hidden treasures, monster nests, and intriguing mysteries, encouraging exploration and discovery.Overall, Witcher 3 is an exceptional game that sets a new standard for open-world RPGs. Its captivating story, stunning visuals, and immersive gameplay make it a must-play for any fan of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to RPGs, Witcher 3 will leave you spellbound with its depth, complexity, and sheer brilliance.. A really amazing experience. Immersive world. Top notch storyline, world building and character development.. One of the best Games i‘ve ever played. Great Story, Great Open-World and Great gameplay.. Pretty mid basic game nothing really special,I don't have time to write a full review so watch the witcher 3 review by planetb612 on YouTube one of the best and most detailed reviews I've seen and one of the only honest and good review to this mid game. A real masterpiece with hours of fun gameplay with a story and music and beautiful scenery, this game will never be repeated.. I read full Witcher Saga written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a magnificent continuation of series.. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a sprawling epic that has left an indelible mark on the RPG genre, celebrated for its expansive open world, engaging quests, and memorable characters. However, the game is not without its share of criticisms, particularly in its gameplay mechanics and the length of the main **** game's greatest strength lies in its rich tapestry of quests. The side quests, often as intricate and compelling as the main storyline, create a vibrant world filled with moral quandaries, political intrigue, and emotionally charged moments. Each quest feels meticulously crafted, presenting players with choices that reverberate through the narrative. The depth and complexity of these quests contribute significantly to the game's immersive quality, ensuring players are drawn into the world of The Witcher 3.Moreover, the characters in The Witcher 3 are a testament to masterful storytelling. Geralt of Rivia, the stoic yet charismatic protagonist, leads a cast of characters with nuanced personalities and compelling backstories. From the sorceress Yennefer to the bard Dandelion, each character feels like a living, breathing entity in a world teeming with life. The relationships and interactions, both friendly and adver","i would give the witcher 3 a perfect rating, except for a small issue . visuals are good especially for an old game but gameplay is poor . controls are clunky and the music is so bad I turned it off inside an hour ."
16.Half-Life 2,"Even in 2025, this game is simply a masterpiece and better than most of the games released recently. The game is much better than the first and has a much deeper story and characters. The atmosphere is great and the gameplay incredible. This game is now one of my favorite games because it's so memorable! PLAY HALF LIFE 2!!!. half-life 2 is one of the best games. same with half-life 1 there is no hand holding. The game has a very good story. Simply one of the best if not the best game ever made, what can I even say more about this masterpiece that haven't been said before ? its just the Gift that keeps on giving, mods are also great. this game changed the gaming history, arguably the greatest game of all time, change my mind. Half-Life 2 is a game for all times Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece that set a new standard for games in 2004. Large-scale world, stunning graphics, memorable story with incredible twists and turns - all this makes the game an eternal classic. From a leisurely stroll through the city to thrilling chases, gunfights and helicopter battles, and then a tense journey through the Citadel, each chapter leaves you with unforgettable emotions. This game is not just entertainment, but a true legacy of the industry. 10 out of 10 - forever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's the same case as with the Half-Life 1, first hours with the game are phenomenal but the deeper you go the more its age exposes. Physics are not as revolutionary as years ago, obsolete loading screens as well as strange movement irritating in platforming sequences disrupted my enjoyment. Nevetheless it is a title worth trying out and i can't deny its impact on industry. Get at least to the Ravenholm chapter! 8--/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite game of all time, the physics, sounds, characters, storytelling, ALL in this game is absolutly incredible, and this was released in 2004!!!. Amazing game! Graphics are impressive from a game released in 2004. This game may look outdated, but the game itself is excellent.. It's a great sequel way ahead of its time with the physics and gravity gun mechanic. A must-play classic.. THE GAME IS AMAZING although I WANTED TO SEE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER ADRIAN SHEPHARD BUT WHAT CAN I DO, OTHER THAN THAT THE GAME IS VERY WONDERFUL IT IS WORTH PLAYING half-life 2. Best game I've ever played in my life, everything just enough to amaze you. The atmosphere, graphics, physics (compared to its year) is impressive. Everything this game made is unique.. Half-Life 2 is a timeless masterpiece, standing tall even 20 years after its release as one of the greatest games of all time. Its unparalleled interactivity with the world remains a benchmark that no other game has matched. The Source Engine feels like black magic, delivering physics that are still astonishingly advanced by today’s standards. The story is a compelling continuation of the original. The gameplay is equally impressive, offering a diverse arsenal of weapons that feel satisfying to use and levels that are masterfully designed, keeping the experience fresh and engaging throughout. However, the one lingering sore point is the infamous cliffhanger at the end, a narrative loose end that remains unresolved even two decades later. Despite this, Half-Life 2 remains a game that has shaped the industry and continues to inspire.. The past years have not changed the game at all, it has not lost its relevance, graphic composition, or drama, as it did many years ago, causing only the most pleasant emotions.. According to me best fps game till now I played this game first time How beautiful graphic is this and this game work on low end pc. Half life two is what valve is all about, such an iconic title, one of the most groundbreaking games at that time.. This game was really ahead of its time, by style, graphics, physics and more. Beautiful game and great dialogue.. One of the best modern games. A very worthy continuation of the series. Worth attention in 2024.. I have nothing more to say, if HL2 released in 2024 with updated graphics, it would be game of the year with no issue. One of the best shooters ever made. Half-Life 2 set a standard that not many games have been able to meet.. Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece that shaped the landscape of first-person shooters. With hours of memorable online battles, even in the era of dial-up internet, and an engaging story with groundbreaking graphics for its time, the game delivered an immersive and thrilling experience. At the dawn of 3D VGAs, Half-Life 2 stood out with its stunning visuals and captivating narrative, solidifying itself as a timeless classic in the hearts of gamers. A true gem of electronic gaming!. this **** more influential than nirvana but it ****. yes the story is good and the half life series literally built the foundation of gaming but dont act like half life is a series you dont play only once a year. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best sequel that can be created, a revolutionary game like the first one, graphics, story and mechanics. One of the best games in history.. VERY GOOD《8/10》The only disappointment in this game is that you wont finished it by completing the story. You will need to buy DLC called Half Life Episode 1 and 2, so yeah good cashgrab, and unfinished game...《STORY》 Good 《GRAPHICS》 Beautiful《GAMEPLAY/FUN》Remember Good Amusiment 《BUGS/POLISING》 Minor Bugs《AUDIO/SOUND/MUSIC》 Good《DIFFICULTY》 Significant Brain Usage《WORTH BUYING》 Wait for Sale. Personally. I would say BLB2 in indeed a better game but you know... its a classiccc. hl2 is really you know a classicccc.... ya knaw? classicccc. my favorite part was probably the reactor explosion and the maxinge bombing. I love BLB2 for its innovative gameplay. now go play HL2. Even in 2024 this is one of the best games you can buy, the gameplay is immersive and it never gets boring, there's parts where you have to fight waves of enemies and parts where you have to use your brain to advance, the story is simple but yet it's still very interesting and fun. I think everyone should play this masterpiece at least once in their lifetime. One of the best game i ever played in my pc. It's been 20 years from now but still it is one of my favourite game.. a revolution of the game industry.this is masterpiece.thanks valve.20 years old. Best FPS ever, a real revolution for the industry, this game is a real revolution. Good game! Amazing to play, even its 20 years old. For sure the graphics aged, but the weapons are amazing.. An iconic masterpiece. It redefined what a gaming narrative can be while also having amazingly original creative set pieces and puzzles that flow naturally, alongside excellent pacing.. This is the coolest part of Half Life. We are waiting for part 3 with impatience!. you know what; gonna be blunt here. HL2 is the greatest of all time (on PC) , not lying here, if ya don't like it, then you either have major ADHD or somethin' or just a plain-ass bad taste in games... go back to playing ubisoft or activision games... if you do... ech..... An incredible game, I went in without much expectation, and boy was I surprised. The gameplay stellar, the combat perfect, the innovative gravity mechanic, genius! I was blown away, on top of that it had a fantastic story, impeccable dialogue and attention to detail and the characters were larger than life. Overall I felt it was much better than the first one and one of the best games of all time.. If i could rate this game over 10 I would, not only is this one of the most influential games ever created but it also has such an amazing story making you wonder what is next. I NEED half life 3 or episode 3 this instant PLAY THIS NOW. yeah i'd say it's a pretty fun game (which only changed the game industry forever, again). If you don’t like this game, I have nothing to say to you. Awesome game which was revolutionary for the time and had great physics and ragdolls. You know you’re doing something right when you use the same engine for almost 10 years and are still getting compliments about it. The gunplay could be better but the story and the chapters do make up for it. Gordon Freeman is still a mute scientist badass and still wields his iconic crowbar. Highly recommend if you are a PC player.. Just another must-play game. In my eyes, you can't call yourself a real gamer if you haven't played this game.. This truly is one of the greatest games ever made. Even 15 years later, this game feels like a solid shooter. It has puzzles baked in with some correctly challenging platforming. There is a mountain of variety in this game, keeping everything fresh throughout the entire playthrough. The music really gives you main character energy. The story is just enough to keep you hooked without drowning. The only critique that I have of this game are the driving portions. The controls are good, but a little too sensitive with forward/backwards.. The source engine elevates this game from an already amazing status to one of the finest games of ever. The physics were and still are groundbreaking and the characters feel like real people instead of random Npcs.. Simply one of the most revolutionary games in history. Something I didn't expect so much was the quality of the facial expressions of the game's NPCs, which is sensational, for the time of launch it's something unbelievable. I don't have much else to say, I'll just say: play Half Life 2.. Half life 2 may be 20 years old at this point but almost everything still feels modern, even the physics still feel amazing the source engine was something absolutley insane for even existing in 2004. I know you have seen so many 10's and 0's on metacritic, but this game genuinely deserves it. It's one of the greatest shooters ever made.. This game is very good but its badly weighed down by the boring combat and questionable AI everything else is great. best game in the decade imo, the level design was 1000x better than the first one. half life 2 is peak ficition.. Very immersive game, This game is great, Perfect, There is nothing better than Half-Life. Tl;dr: Amazing but a bit repetitive First of all: the graphics look amazing despite all these years, the objects are very detailed, as well as the physics between them. It's a pity that more creators didn't follow their example in this respect. The plot is okay, but some sequences are well constructed. For example, the beginning of the escape in city 17 is a growing feeling of fear and harassment. The cutscenes are also very well done, there aren't many of them but they make a great impression. Another thing that other creators could be more inspired by. However, the game is not without flaws. The gameplay, although pleasant, is very repetitive and for me it was only digestible in smaller doses. I was also distracted by puzzles based on the physics of objects, cool, but sometimes you don't know what the creators were thinking about.. Although Half-Life 2 is an amazing game, it is not without its tedious moments. The vehicle sections of the game are uninteresting and repetitive, more so the water buggy in the chapter ""Water Hazard."" These features did not, however, impact my enjoyment. The ending does feel a little rushed since it arrives suddenly and without much buildup. However, the other elements are all flawlessly implemented and executed by the game. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. The dull parts of the game don't take away from how much fun you have playing it altogether.. The next part of Gordon Freeman's adventures is even better than the first part of Dr. Freeman. There are no aliens, but we have something similar - the Combine from another dimension. An interesting storyline and three new, interesting weapons. Locations with a terrifying history (Ravenholm or Nova Prospect). In general, I recommend it.. anyone with an intelligence level above 50 gives this game a score above 8 in fact, it can also be 9 jokes, everyone's enjoyment **** is different. Even after all these years this game is still one of the best games ever made and one of the best experiences I've ever had playing a game and I'm shocked it took me this long to finally play it. This game is insane, the story is well fleshed out, the features are fun with additions including the Gravity Gun, the physics engine is astronomical for a game made in 2004. Everything present in this game is exactly why this game won Game Of The Decade. It truly is brilliant. Once in a lifetime you come across one of THOSE pieces of media, where everything just clicks. The story, the atmosphere, the writing, the soundtrack... everything just clicks. Half Life 2 is one of those experiences. Despite being a sequel, Half Life 2 is perfectly sufficient on it's own. Not only does it surpass the original by leagues and miles, it did it so successfully that this title alone spawned an entire universe that itself spawned multiple blockbusters. This title alone cemented Valve's reputation as quality developers for over a decade. If there has ever been an example of a perfect game, this would be it.. Dude its one of the best games it literally came outin 2004 and feels revaluation to this day. literallly best game in the world, we need part 3, valve please make it....... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Literally a perfect video game. You could not replicate this game if you tried.. Really great game , a classic you can't miss and have to play ,everything is perfect.. This is the game of all time surprised it's only number 15 as I easily can spend thousands of hours with mods or not I've replayed this game way too many times. Great story and it was longer than I expected. Can't wait for the RTX version.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Half-Life 2"" is a game that easily deserves the title of classic in the world of video games. From the very beginning, the player is immersed in an exciting and dangerous world, where every step is filled with danger and mysteries. The gameplay is superbly balanced, offering a combination of shooting, puzzles and exploration, allowing the player to approach problems in different ways. The world of Half-Life 2 is so rich and detailed that every corner feels unique and alive. But what makes Half-Life 2 truly great is its atmosphere. From the dark streets of the enemy city to the devastated zones, the game creates an amazing sense of tension and wonder at the same time. Backed by excellent music and sound design, this game makes you immerse yourself in its world. Overall, Half-Life 2 is not just a game, it is an iconic experience that stays with you for years after completion. She continues to inspire game makers and players around the world, and rightly so. And sorry, my English was translated using Google Translate.. what an awful game, as a huge fan of the first game this was a massive let down, full of plot holes and has gordon running endlessly doing nothing, extra credit to the teleporter part (where 1000s of people die simply because dr kleiner couldn't keep his **** pet lock in) and the end part where your in dr breen's office (love how he tells all his guards to go out side his office, what a smart idea) also the gameplay is way slower, there way less variety of enemies to fight and guns to use, it gets evan worse seeing as the alien bad guys (the combine) doesn't really feel like aliens, they feel more like just evil humans from a police state (same goes for there weapons). Possibly one of the most overrated games of all time, there is little going for it in either gameplay or story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I could write dozens and dozens of lines praising this game and still, would not be enough to put in words what this game mean to history of games. It's a timeless classic, a must play for everyone! Even your grandma, LOL. 10000000/10. Half-Life 2 is a must play for every gamer. It has good graphics and great physics which are used for various puzzles. The guns feel good and sound good. It isn't expensive and doesn't need a good PC to run. The story is one of the best if not the best to be ever written and the game is very repayable so you will have a lot of hours of fun.. A solid sequel to one of the greatest games ever created. Graphics, plot, physics. Everything was upgraded significantly. Even after twenty years, it is played well.. Graphics: 9/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: 8/10. This game came out when I was born. Surely, this is the most famous game of its time. Somebody has at least heard of it, even if just a little.. Half-Life 2 (2004) has way better physics than most games now (20 years later) I remember playing through it recently and being amazed. This game has one of the best storylines I've ever followed. Half-Life 2 is on my top 5 list of games.. It's a good game. Well made, and the shooting feels tight. But it ain't really *that* special.. Half-Life 2 is one of the best games ever made by VALVE. Love how they implemented the Source Engine and made more games with it.. Half-Life 2 is an astounding game that has managed to combine innovative gameplay, an exciting story and stunning graphics. In the game, the player has to take on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist who fights against invaders from another world - the Citadel. The depth of the story and incredible atmosphere of the first Half-Life only intensify in the second part. One of the main advantages of the game is its unique gameplay. Advanced physics engines allow the player to experiment with their surroundings, using different items in combat or to solve puzzles. This adds depth and variety to the **** graphics in Half-Life 2 continue to amaze even by today's standards. Even many years after its release, it remains impressive. The variety of locations, detailed character designs and elaborate effects create an unrivaled gaming atmosphere.Half-Life 2 also has a great soundtrack that emphasizes the tension and emotionality of the gameplay. The voice actors also did a great job, giving the characters a unique and real feel.However, while the game is full of quality elements, some aspects could have been better polished. For example, the endless battle levels can get a bit tedious, and some of the puzzles can be too challenging for players not used to such tasks.Overall, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game that is a real pleasure for its players. The combination of an interesting story, addictive gameplay and stunning graphics makes it a must-have for all action game fans. The rating of 8 out of 10 comes from some flaws, but they can't dilute the impression the game leaves.. it’s old but still looks amazing and feels so smooth the immersive interaction and the way the gameis a linear experience but-doesn’t hold your hand I can see why people may not like that but I find it satisfying when I know where to go without being told great story as well fell like I’m playingan action movie without any immersion breaking aspect, the game doesn’t see itself as a game and I think that’s why it’s done so well after all these years it feel like a movie and movies tend to age better then games all and all great experience. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. good game must visite and play and watch this game. ****/. Half-Life is a very good game, both with its story and graphics. It's a bit of fun. I recommend you to play it. Also, the soldiers artificial intelligence is f*cking good (according to time). Without nostalgia or the idea that games should be rated for the time they were released in, do I not the masterclass everyone always talked about. It is still worth trying it once, but you can clearly see and feel the game's age.. I was teeneager, spent evening and nights with tis game,I hope devs from Valve change plans, andwill release game for PS5/Xbox or PC without VR mode only.... best game ever played........................................................................valve make Universal Acclaim. this game is a masterpiece of video games. i especially loved the part where gabe newell and garry form gmod got into a fight and ended with peter griffin appearingand said "" its peterin time""griffened all over the place. in other words, vorts are baddies. Half Life 2 is in my eyes is a perfect sequel. Not a perfect game, but a perfect sequel. What makes a great, excellent or perfect sequel is what the developers learn from the previous game; what made the story intriguing, what made the level design unique & interesting, what made combat encounters thrilling and exciting & what made puzzles unique and well thought out. Everything I just mentioned of what makes a sequel perfect is present in this game. Everything about the first game has been improved & expanded upon here. I won't give spoilers as I won't give my analysis of the story or take on it exactly, but this game's story takes place 2 decades after the first game & adds certain twists & evolves characters you interact with making the story feel rightfully familiar but improved to an impressive amount. Combat has also been involved, introducing different enemies & weapons. Doing this allows the player to use what they know of returning enemies to strategize during encounters and also learn of the unique threat new enemies introduced pose to the player during linear and open settings, giving familiarity & refreshment through out the game. Level design is great too with nice improvements to the layouts and Valve introduced more variety in structures indoors and out, keeping you on your toes as enemies will attack you from a larger variety of angles & from greater heights. This of course translates to puzzles, where the majority of them are to be solved using the environment and inanimate objects that are present through out levels. Due to the improvements of levels, and a greater density of structures and inanimate objects, this allows the developers to be more creative when creating puzzles, giving an evolved take on the previous games already great puzzles. Completing a puzzle sequence during this game is even more satisfying than the first & makes you think more about creative ways of approaching each puzzle and encounter. They'll allow you to attack and defend against enemies in unique ways and provide great replayability & creativity during combat encounters through out the game as well. This game is a masterpiece, not many other ways to put it. I feel that word is far too often used, especially for generic Sony cinematic overhyped nonsense, but this game doesn't rely on 20 hours of cutscenes, or unnecessary sequences of high intensity moments that remove all control from the player. It has a mature story that doesn't feel like an extended movie due to an overuse of cinematics, doesn't have any hand holding segments, no ridiculous bombastic sequences that remove all control from the player or baby easy puzzles. It does everything exceedingly well and deserves all the praise I've given. It has stood up to the test of time better than any game I've played and everyone that owns a PC should Experience both games in this series and the 2 episodes that follow on after it.. Just like the Half-Life 1, but it's a worth sequel that improves its graphics, it has a better gameplay and more plots.. you cant kill the npc but other then that the story is better. the gameplay is way less frustrating then the first game but i like the half-life 1 guns more.. Rise and shine Mr. Freeman.... Possibly the greatest game ever. Valve just knows how to tell a story in game. No BS cut scenes that pull you out of the game. Just pure environmental story telling. The pacing is really phenomenal to the point that it makes a linear game almost feel like it's open world. The characters are great too. More devs need to take a cue from this game. I'm tired of these interactive movies with hours of cut scenes. Please, tell the story in game. This is what makes video games unique. A cut-scene is just a movie.. Just half life 2. Just like the half Life of the first, but there are improved graphics, more interesting plot, more translations into other languages, and so on... Definitely recommend it!. A game that managed to outdo itself. This is the case when it is impossible to say which of the two parts turned out to be better. Thank you for a wonderful and eventful adventure. It's a shame that games like this are only made once every 20 years.. Great graphics, especially for the time it was released. Lots of fun and memorable sections and definitely my favorite Valve game, maybe even my favorite PC game!. I'm mostly docking a point for the airboat section. It was my least favorite part and felt like it lasted forever. Other than that, the game is a masterpiece, and is still more technically impressive than many games today.. I’ve been playing this game at school, while studying at the university and I still play this game sometimes. HL2 for me is more than just a game, it’s life. GTA SA stole the goty. Look up innovative in the dictionary and you'll just see a photo of Valve. I'm not played half life1. but is very fun.. this is by far one of the best games ever made. the graphics hold up, the music is good and aged like fine wine. deserved the game of the year.. I comitted genocide on an evil Combine harvester. This game is amazing. This game from 2004 has really good world building. Half-Life 2 has more life than modern games. Must play.. One of the best games ever. Fun gameplay but confusing story, i don't understand how do the events ont this game correlate to the events on the first one, i couldn't make any sense of it, its just a fun shooting game with a very poorly written story. Half-Life 2, released in 2004, is a landmark achievement in the world of video games, a shining example of what is possible when innovation, storytelling, and gameplay come together seamlessly. Valve's magnum opus not only builds upon the legacy of its predecessor but also sets new standards for the industry, delivering a breathtaking and immersive experience that remains unparalleled. Half-Life 2 picks up the story years after the events of the first game, once again casting players as the iconic scientist-hero, Gordon Freeman. The game introduces players to the dystopian world of City 17, ruled by the oppressive Combine regime. From the moment the game begins, it immerses players in its rich and atmospheric universe, filled with memorable characters, intriguing mysteries, and a sense of palpable oppression. The game's storytelling is nothing short of exceptional. Half-Life 2 employs a minimalist approach to narrative, allowing players to uncover the story through environmental storytelling, character interactions, and the world itself. It's a game that respects the intelligence of its players and treats them as active participants in the unfolding plot. The gameplay in Half-Life 2 is a masterclass in first-person shooter design. The game introduces the Gravity Gun, a revolutionary tool that not only serves as a powerful weapon but also opens up new possibilities for puzzle-solving and combat. The level design is impeccable, offering a perfect blend of action-packed sequences and intricate physics-based puzzles. Combat in Half-Life 2 is intense and varied, with a diverse set of enemies and weaponry that keeps players engaged throughout the journey. The enemy AI is remarkable, with enemies adapting to tactics and taking cover intelligently. The game keeps players on their toes, always demanding strategy and skill. The Source engine, used for Half-Life 2, was groundbreaking at the time of release and still holds up exceptionally well today. The physics engine adds a layer of realism and immersion that was unprecedented in its era, and the facial animations give characters a level of expressiveness that enhances the storytelling. The game's sound design and music are exceptional, contributing to the immersive experience. The haunting melodies and ambient sounds of City 17, combined with the superb voice acting, create an emotional connection with the game's world and characters. Half-Life 2's impact on the gaming industry is immeasurable. It has influenced countless titles and established Valve as a pioneering force in the industry. The modding community has thrived, creating a wealth of user-generated content that extends the game's lifespan. In conclusion, Half-Life 2 is a timeless masterpiece that represents the pinnacle of video game storytelling and innovation. Its immersive world, compelling characters, and exceptional gameplay make it a landmark achievement in the medium. For gamers and enthusiasts alike, Half-Life 2 is a must-play, an enduring testament to the power of interactive storytelling.. Very overrated, still a good game for its time. Half-Life 2 does nearly everything right for a game, the story and world is immersive, good game-play and graphics that hold up extremely well for a game from 2004.. This is the only game that i can play again and again without getting bored. It has it all: great gameplay, great story, very well-shaped characters and dialogue and an epic soundtrack. Playing this game really puts you in a specific state of mind. Long live Gordon Freeman and his trusty crowbar!. everyone like this becease of populer cultur but i play the game and that was boring mostly people like bc this is childhood game i guess. Even today, the game is a masterpiece! Immersive gameplay. Awesome graphics and optimization. The game worked well on my outdated PC back in 2005.. Simply the best game I have ever played. The world and atmosphere that Valve as created here is unbelievably unique and remarkably timeless - even today, nearly 2 decades after its release. The ripple effects that this game has had on the gaming industry as a whole cannot be understated. Everything from its physics systems, cinematic in-game storytelling, grand-scale set-pieces, gunplay, etc. have been copied throughout the years - but never surpassed. An absolute masterpiece.. This game is FPS at its best! No matter how many times you play it, youll either crap your pants or have your mind explode out of the sheer awesomeness of this game!! Incredible puzzles, Frightful and disgusting enemies, superb dialogue, and best of all a gun like no other that allows you to turn every day items to super destructive items of terror!!! I dont care if you're the world's greatest gamer, if you havnt played this **** havnt lived yet.. The game was completed after playing the first part. I definitely liked the second part. The graphics are good for their year and the plot can be liked by someone. From myself I give 8 out of 10.. Half-Life 2 is often hailed as a classic and a pioneering game in the first-person shooter genre. While it's highly regarded, some factors might lead someone to rate it as a 9 out of 10 rather than a perfect 10. In conclusion, rating Half-Life 2 as a 9 out of 10 acknowledges its undeniable strengths in storytelling, gameplay, and innovation, while also recognizing that it might have some minor drawbacks or aspects that have aged over time. Despite these potential weaknesses, Half-Life 2's impact on the gaming industry and its lasting influence make it an essential experience for any gamer.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Half-Life 2 is more than just a sequel to a good shooter. Half-Life 2 provides an immersive, atmospheric experience within City 17 and is a shining example of what good developers can achieve when they work hard. They raised the standards for the shooter-genre so high with this masterpiece. I wish more games were as good as HL2 is. This is by far my favourite Valve-Game. Thank you Valve!. No doubt this is one of the greatest games of all time, It's just cult classic, a standard of the industry. The graphics, ","this game changed the gaming history, arguably the greatest game of all time, change my mind . from a leisure stroll through the city to thrilling chases, gunfights and helicopter battles, each chapter leaves you with unforgettable emotions . physics are not as revolutionary as years ago, obsolete loading screens as well as strange movement irritating in platforming sequences disrupt my enjoyment ."
160.Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2,"Best Mario game ever. Played it when I was like 4. Just better than all the other mario game in my opinion.. One of the best 2D Mario Games. Everything is very well done and some things are even a little better than Super Mario Bros. 3. Definitely worth playing. 8,3/10. (Talking about SNES version) This is the best game of all time. Looking at a surface level, it may seem like any other 2D Mario game, but if you understand how the game works, you'll quickly see the possibilities opened by glitches, bugs, etc.. [DISCLAIMER: REVIEW FOR THE ORIGINAL SNES VERSION] Super Mario World... I was not familiar with your game. I can't believe this game has remained unspoiled for me for this many years, but I'm happy it was. I had never even seen what the final boss looked like. The reason for this is probably because there's so much variety in every single level that it's hard to make any single idea stick in your mind. At this point, Miyamoto's game design philosophy is well-known, but seeing put into practice like this is incredible. Blows modern 2D Mario out of the water, easily the best of the bunch, understandable why this game became the formula for decades to come. STILL NOT BETTER THAN DONKEY KONG COUNTRY DOE. This is a spectacular version of mario world that i'd recommend to anyone!. This game is playable, but the newer Mario games are way better than this, simply improving on everything.. Playing this game was so much fun as a kid. It was one of the greatest holiday gifts I could ever ask for! The characters are unforgettable as are the fun and creative levels. Figuring out how to progress in the game was time consuming but fun and that's what video games like Super Mario World are all about. Worlds 2 and 4 are my favorite in this game and I found it funny how some places were named after food. Once you %100 this game and save Princess Peach, it's really rewarding. Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi were lots of fun to play as. Some of the power ups in Super Mario World were really cool like the cape one. The Game Boy Advance version is the one I played first, then I played the Super Nintendo version. I enjoyed both, but at the same time, I enjoyed the Game Boy Advance version more because of the extra sound effects that it had that were fun for me to listen to.. The best mario game, and probable the best 2d platformer ever made. What a masterpiece. The best remastered and best Super Mario game. A very fun game forever, a timeless game that should continue to be remembered for decades.. Super mario world: super mario advance 2 is a very good game for the super nintendo: gameboy Advance. I'm rating the snes version not the gba version. This is an amazing game, the levels are so fun. Mario controls so smoothly and is a masterpiece. Reivented the whole franchise making the world levels that super mario 3 introduced better and is still one of the best 2d games of all time and holds up almost 40 years later. Everything is perfect, music, level design, art/graphics. Timeless Masterpiece.. do I need to explain why super mario world is a gaming masterpiece? the level design, graphics, music, and powerups are all absolutely phenomenal. especially compared to the older mario games. if you have not played this game, then you need to. the snes and gba versions are both on nso. do it now.. This is the best classic Mario game, the music is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay was a clever spin to the classic 2D platform, is 100% times better than Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, if you have some money for the switch online this is a must play. Another fine conversion of a snes classic that works brilliantly on the Advance.. I haven't played this game for years, however, I do have some very fond memories of playing it as a young child. The level design was great with only a few bad levels and overall this game is still a masterpiece to this day.. The fact that we can create levels in the style of this game in Super Mario Maker is a testament to how the game design still holds up to this day. Timeless masterpiece.. I played this when it came out on the GBA and again just recently on the Switch via Nintendo Switch Online. This is the best 2D platformer ever made. Period. 30 years, and it still hasn't been topped.. Insanely great 2D platformer. Cute graphics and fun gameplay. Easily 10/10. I love it.. This game is kind of good for a remake. It has voices included in the remake, it has more check points in levels, and when you take damage, you just go big again. Don't know why they removed that in the original game when super mario bros 3 had that mechanic in the game. However the graphics don't look as good as in the SNES game, the graphics aren't as good, neither was the music, and there are no new levels in the game. As for the game itself, I first played smw when I was 7 years old back when I was just getting into mario. The graphics were great(not as good or mind blowing as super mario all stars) and it showed me that graphics can go beyond 8 bit on both consoles and handhelds. Before, I just played the gameboy color and NES but when I was at a hotel playing the SNES, I felt like I was in the future! Eventually I saw other kids playing the gameboy advance version a couple years later at a summer camp and I eventually I got it a couple months later. It took me and my brother alittle over 2 years to beat it and it was mazing when I beat bowser. I even had a dream about beating him the day before. What a masterpiece. Nowdays I say the game is alittle easy for a mario game but back then, it was a great challenge. The only thing I wish the game did was have more mystery to the story. Even super mario bros 1 and 3 had some mystory to it.. Pure perfection. Super Mario World is already a timeless classic on SNES and its improvements are well enough for a take on GBA. Removing multiplayer and overuse voice acting might not be great but that does not ruin anything at all. This was the first-ever game I played so I'm probably blinded by nostalgia.. A solid port of the greatest game of all time. Plus it includes the remaster of Mario Bros. whats not to love?. Just managed to get my hands on this game again after years of not playing it! Plopped it into my sp and was taken on a nostalgia trip of epic proportions! Nostalgia aside, this game is still the pinnacle of 2d mario in my eyes! Great level design, fun powers ups like yoshi and the cape, and a colorful world with tons of secrets! Its an amazing game to play to this day, and if your a mario fan you would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game!. Solid game and perfect for gba owners.... Inferior to the super nintendo port but close enough. Super Mario World is probably one of the most interesting side-scrolling mario platformers, filled to the brim with secrets, vibrant colors, and creative level designs all around. This GBA port does not dissapoint.. It actually is incredible how hard this game was to me but like everything about this was just so much fun!. One of the best better than the SNES version wish they had game boy advance virtual console for the Nintendo switch to play this game!. Amazing Game! Playing Super Mario World by itself it's awesome, but (at the time) being able to play game on the go was legendary. The gameplay physics is perfect not exactly like the original but close enough. This game is fantastic and I'd recommend it along with the original.. One of the best games of all time ported to handheld was one of the greatest things at that time. So many memories on both the SNES and on the road on the GBA. A Masterpiece that you could play on the go. Super Mario World is one of all the time great games and still great to play all these years later. Part of gaming history and must be played.. Best remake ever ****, with creativity and level-design the best I have ever seen in a 2d platform game. A game that truly can be replayed endlessly.. Amazing port of the instant perfect classic on the snes. Now you can play almost anywhere which is an upgrade and the controls are amazing and the graphics are phenomenal. Everything in this game ranges from great to perfect.. Super Mario World is a fantastic game. While the GBA did have some criticism from it's small screen (240x160), when it comes to a game like Mario, the screen size doesn't hinder the experience. Luigi's higher jump and terrible traction and the original arcade Mario Bros. are nice, but the sound, graphics, and everything is still what you would expect. All levels (except one) are great and pretty decent, with checkpoints to boot. Difficulty also naturally scales, and not all levels are point A to point B, with some extra exits scattered around for a total of 96.. a very great port there are some flaws the colors of the gba made the game not look like the snes just a minor complaint but the sound i would rate the sound 7 out of 10 so super mario world gba port may not be the best version of mario world but it is good that we can play a good snes game while were out somewhere. Best platformer on a handheld. Many levels and secrets, cape is really fun to use, but still bit breaking the game or rather making the game much easier, it´s still very challenging.. This is personally my favorite Mario game of all time and along with Super Mario Bros. 3, this encapsulate the experience of how our modern Mario has come to be. With expert level design, classic music, and a great deal of hidden unlockables, this game is far better than the New Super Mario Bros. which follow an all too predictable structure. You'll face an enormous variety of challenges on your way to Bowser's castle, and there won't be a single moment of boredom. Even after you take down Bowser, you'll want to find all the special coins and unlock all the special stages because you want to experience this whole game, not because you feel like you need to unlock some achievement or something.. It's essentially the same game as the SNES version, except now you can also play as Luigi. That's not a bad thing, considering this is one of the best games of all time.. Immersion is what you'll find in this spectacular game of Super Mario World. I have played both the Super Nintendo version and the Gameboy Advance port as a child and this game has aged well; the Gameboy Advance version has shown improvement in graphics from the SNES. Like every Mario game, there are barley any story elements. Controls feel right during gameplay from beginning to end. The soundtrack has its moments in specific parts of the game. This game has a variety of game level deign and enemies, so you won't see anything repetitive in this game. The length of gameplay is up to you, whether you want to complete all levels, including every secret finishes and collecting every special objects called Dragon Coins; total completion are from 10-15 hours max. This game is great and I recommend it to those interested in retro games and in the Mario games in general.. The GBA remake of one of the greatest games of all time. The SNES is definitely more difficult, though I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. A masterpiece, regardless.. Really great, spot on port of the classic snes title, and also includes the classic Mario Bros. arcade! with updated graphics and sound, as well as a few new extras added, this is an amazing way to experience the original Super Mario World, and is a wonderful game in general.. I am sooooooo late to the review party on this, but I am retro gaming now. What a great way to play this classic. I was a Sega kid back when this was out, and missed all the SNES fun. Now that I beat the main game, 73 levels so far, I can gush about how this is a must for any gameboy advance owner. The only complaint is the addition of Luigi, he is the worst developed playable character I have ever used on a Nintendo product. He is insanely clumsy and frustrating--hence, I do not use him at all now.. If you missed the first Super Mario World, this is your best chance of re-living a old classic, not only is the game improved with its colors, sound effects and storytelling but it is now on a portable which makes it even more memorable experience. You will surely enjoy this timeless classic.. I remember my brother telling me this game was the best ever when it came out because it was the biggest game ever made. I am pretty sure he was right at the time, this game is really the beginning of video games for me. Nintendo did such a good job capturing our imaginations as kids and this game is no exception. In the early 90's when this game came out it was a breakthrough in gaming, and even today it is still fun to play.. Super Mario World was one of the first video games I played. I was a child when this game came out and I could easily pick it up right now and enjoy it. When I was little the only way I could get even close to beating it was by using the star shortcut. With the shortcut I could basically beat the game in an hour or two. What makes the game so great is that the game play never gets old. Yes the graphics ****, as compared to today's video games, but the level design continuously changes. One level there are black bullets shooting at you and the next you are riding Yoshi, eating apples, jumping on football players. I would estimate that their are over one hundred levels. Not only that, you can play all of them again; except for the castles (boss levels). There are many secrets that I am sure I still haven't discovered in this classic game. Some secrets I have discovered is the star shortcut (duh), the item level, how to get ninety-nine life's, and colored Yoshi's. The music throughout the game is decent. When you are beginning to run out of time the music speeds up which helps change up the tempo of the game. If you have not ever played this game you should do yourself a favor and hit yourself.. Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 may have an awkward title, but it is truly a great game! The controls are solid and you are definitely in control of Mario. The world is extremely vast with many secrets, even top secrets! I always played with Luigi because Mario can not jump as high. The Mario Bros. add-on was not all that great, but it was there in cause you wanted to take a break from the game. The game was challenging and immensely exploratory. This remains one of my favorite Mario games because of its gameplay that can not be put down until the end! It is not that replayable in my opinion based merely on its size, but overall amazing buy for the Game Boy Advance!. I really recommend this game, especially for the SNES, the original. It is a little hard to pass through some levels but it is funny. This game will always bring me good memories from my childhood.. It feels like new despite the games age, which doesn't matter. It plays and feels just like the original. It also has a challenge in its gameplay, which makes it highly recommendable.. I regretted selling my Super Nintendo, knowing that I might never play this game, among others, again; but having a Nintendo DS, with a GBA slot, it gave me a chance to play one of the first games I ever played in my life again and bring nostalgia; this may not exactly be exactly the same as the SNES one, but it's close enough, and is probably better. A remake of a Masterpiece. Super Mario world is one of the best games of all time.. It's not a new game, but it's an excellent port of a masterpiece in the palm of your hands. Pros: Excellent visuals, control, and audio; overall, it's an unforgettable platforming experience. Cons: Not many additional features.. Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 is... well, I'll put it simply, the best game I've ever played! You can stuff all the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 games I've played, this is such a lovely game with brilliant and challenging platform game play and superb 2D graphics. It's a typical 2D platformer which involves Mario or Luigi going through themed levels like the caverns, forest and ghost houses and getting from A to B in an allocated time limit. Memorable enemies from past Mario games make a come back like the Koopa Troopa's and Bullet Bills. Whats nice is that you can pick up Koopa Shells and throw them at your enemies! This 2D platformer is not entirely linear due to the fact that most levels include secret exits and some can take you to secret areas. There's always a satisfactory feeling when you find a secret area since it's not obvious where they are hidden in the level. You need your exploring skills to find them. The boss battles which include you fighting the Koopalings are fun to fight, if a little easy. The music is brilliant ranging from the happy cheerful overworld theme to the dark and creepy castle theme. What adds to the game play is that Yoshi now joins you in the adventure to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser. When you are riding Yoshi, you can eat enemies (except Koopa Shells) spit them out and see them roll into other enemies and different coloured Koopa Shells that Yoshi holds in his mouth, can grant him special abilities for a limited time. Anyway, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 is a brilliant and enjoyable game and, despite not playing the original SNES version, is the best game I've ever played... ever!","""super mario world"" is one of the best 2D Mario games of all time . ""i can't believe this game has remained unspoiled for this many years"" ""this is a spectacular version of mario world that i'd recommend to anyone!"""
161.ESPN NFL 2K5,"This is THE perfect NFL simulation. Nothing before or since has really even come close to the feel of playing in an NFL football game. This is elden ring if madden was assassins creed. Its just on another level. The game play never gets old, even 20 years later. There is no better feeling than reading a defense, calling an audible, adjusting your routes and easily performing pre-snap motions. Madden has been bad lately because there is no competition. Madden was at its peak in 2004 because of this game. To me, this is the only place to turn when I crave NFL football. Being able to emulate this on steam deck is another huge bonus. Playing this on the train is exactly what you think it is.. DANGEROUS! they will steal your deck in minutes. Anyway this is the greatest NFL football game of all time. I pray for one day having a new 2K NFL football game in my hand.. Best football game ever. Simply THE Best NFL Videogame Ever Made! For $20 (or less if you buy a used copy like I did) you get sooo much content and fun that it absolutely stomps all over the awful sports games of today that cost 10 times as much! Create-A-Player, Team Creator, The Crib, the fantastic Career mode, highly accurate physics, superb graphics, excellent controls, loads of fun extras including an awesome SportsCenter Halftime show, and so much more await you in this gem of a sports game that's still getting fanmade roster updates almost a full 20 years later! For those tired of the greedy asinine modern Madden titles, dig out and/or buy an old OG Xbox and play through this spectacular masterpiece to get your American Football fix!. The premier sim football game even after nearly 20 years. Unlike Madden, where the meta is to run backwards 20 yards and throw it to deep crosser routes, the gameplay and presentation of NFL 2K5 actually resemble football. Modders still regularly update the game with current rosters/uniforms/stadiums/face scans.. Coming from the trashy modern madden games, this game plays amazing!!! The presentation, gameplay, depth, its absolutely amazing! I am only 14 and once I was able to get my hands on this game I fell in love with it. Absolutely fantastic. The ability to play a version of yourself, and also the updated rosters sums it up for me. Perfect score all round.. This game could be the best sports video game of all time with amazing presentation and gameplay an incredibly deep and addictive franchise mode along with the crib and vip profiles this game also has the best ai ever in a sports game heck with your vip profile you can play yourself or friends if theirs was saved on yours that’s right you could play your friends even if they weren’t there. This is the best football game of all time, period. The game is so much more immersive than any Madden you'd get nowadays, the presentation, the AI, the animations, everything. Any flaws the game has is easily overshadowed by the extreme highs. It's a timeless classic.. A fantastic NFL game! Played this game for years. Still a beloved game and one that has high praise from most everyone who played it. High quality mechanics for the time. Realistic gameplay for the time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best football game there is. Hands down. No game is without flaws but this is the closest thing to perfect we have at the moment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After all of these years, this game is still so much fun to play. It's a shame they don't get to make football games anymore. This game is superior to any Madden that has been made since.. The fact this game to this day, made nearly 16 years later still holds up to the day when it comes to both game play and presentation show something. First, that how behind EA is when Madden but also how ahead of it's time 2K was with this football title. Translation? It's still the GOAT of football titles.. This game is the greatest football game ever created enough Said!!! Madden 20 is trash next to 2k5 I still update the rosters manually every yr for 2k5 and I enjoy it everytime. I only recently purchased this game due to the praise surrounding it, I've heard plenty of people calling it the best football game of all time, I repurchased an Xbox 360, and got a hard drive for it, just to play this one game, I had to find out if it was as good as everyone said. After playing the game for a good 6 hours now I think it's safe to say they were right, this is the definitive football game for any fan of the sport. There's a lot of things to talk about, but a main part of the praise is the presentation of the game, it has the best ESPN presentation I've ever seen in a football game, from the moments with Chris Berman on the halftime shows and Sportscenters after weeks are finished in Franchise mode, which, on the topic of that, is so very in depth and just really, really fun to play. But they even have many good presentation aspects in the middle of games when talking about in game stats and everything like that. You can hear players on field insulting some of the top stars on the other team, which I think is a very nice touch for getting the player immersed. Not to mention the graphics, top notch, at least for the Xbox era, they were pretty much the best you could get, top that all of with the easy to learn controls and all around great gameplay, you have a very fun, very well made Football game that will forever be compared to the next madden games coming out for years to come. Like I said, it is the definitive football game for any fan, and easily deserves a 10/10.. Still the best football game to date. To think that this came out 9 years ago for only 20 dollars... wow. Graphics were ahead of its time. Gameplay wasn't the best, but for 2005, it was fantastic. CPU AI and teammate AI was more intelligent than any Madden. ESPN presentation, pregame-halftime and postgame show, player interviews and Sportscenter weekly wrap ups still = the best presentation in a sports game. Even though the announcers are fictional, they are still great. The ""Crib"" is still one of the coolest features in a sports game... if only 2K would add that to NBA 2K... All in all, the greatest football (and maybe sports) game ever.. This has got to be the greatest football to todays date. Amazing graphics for its time. gameplay is fast and in a good way unpredictable. running the ball and shoulder charging ppl is so satisfying.. Even after all these years, this stands the time as one of the best football games ever made. The presentation is unparalleled and the game is so packed with features that it still has life nearly 7 years after its initial release. ESPN NFL 2K5 is our generation's Tecmo Bowl.. Just to let everyone know,I'm Job A. but that was the other version of metacritic.Here we are at 2-11 and I will stick to what I said in my other review,this game knocks the shxx out of every madden including Madden 11 when it comes to straight up game play.2K was WAY ahead of there time with football,all of there past football titles were top notch but ESPN NFL 2K5 just blew the doors off of what was or is expected in a football game.Please after you read this play this game on your original xbox and you will see really how amazing it is!10 10 10 10 10.","this is elden ring if madden was assassins creed. it's just on another level . the game play never gets old, even 20 years later . it's the only place to turn when i crave NFL football ."
162.Super Smash Bros. Melee,"Super Smash Bros Melee released in November 2001 developed by HAL laboratory and published by Nintendo for the gamecube was critically acclaimed despite its rushed development. With this being the second interaction in the series Melee introduced a lot of new features. Some of these new items, different game modes, and new characters. With all these new features being put into the game that had around 13 months, with Sakurai the main lead for the game describing the development as destructive. Having no holidays off and very short weekends. Least to say the development team had a very strict deadline in order for this to be launched around the time of the GameCube in september. As a result of the rushed release a lot of the gameplay was different, as they were more willing to experiment with the gameplay style. The first thing that stands out to me when playing this game is accelerated movement compared to the previous game. Later interactions such as Smash Ultimate would go back to this style of gameplay after Nintendo realized there was a competitive scene despite threatening streamers and competitive venues with lawsuits continuing to play the game. As they intended this to be a casual party game instead of the sweaty competitive gamers.. This being because they game was released over 20 years ago, this added with the techniques and mobility to erform some of these tasks. As mentioned previously, this is by the far the fastest game in the series with the learning curve for this game taking well over a year just for a beginner to take a stock off. The rules for competitive melee follow the “20xx” ruleset, they call it this because in the next century; by the year 2099 there will be a frame perfect match. To continue with the rule it goes as follows. For singles it's one versus one, they play a game of rock paper scissors to see what port they play. This is important because every frame of this game matters. There ,both players select their character from the roster, then select the stage. Majority of these rules are all across the game series. The game's goal is to get your opponent off the screen by any means necessary. In traditional fighting games each player has a health bar, something that has innovated the genre is percentage based party games. Combined with the player being able to move in all four directions and the level of speed allows for so much creativity with gameplay style. This movement also creates the barrier of entry when performing a sequence of combos. This is due to when any move hits you your percentage will do up, in return making it easier for your opponent to knock you off the screen. Once the player loses all four stocks or when the 8 minute timer goes down. Something to consider is the position of power and the accessibility to people who have never played. For example, while there is a tier list it mainly only applies to those who have been playing the game for decades. This being compared to someone new in the community who even with 4 stocks and a top tier character would easily lose to an amateur player in the community. This combined with the accessibility of even trying to obtain the game physically which cost around 80 dollars plus the gamecube console. Additionally, you would also need a CRT TV as modern TV’s have frame lag input. All of these barriers make the game very difficult to get into in the modern day. Despite all of this there is a strong community often being one of the top streamed games on twitch. While the game is overall very difficult to get into, the community is super helpful. Even having technique tutorials available on youtube. There are also roms and an online version you're able to play through emulators. While this isn’t legally allowed and counts a piracy, people still play this game through this way as the initial cost to play this game is significant. The influence of Super Smash Bros Melee over the past two decades has had a significant impact on the grassroots aspect of competitive gaming. As other organizations such as the Major League gaming have streaming rights to the game, the melee community has had little to no support. This being combined with the barrier to new players makes it difficult to play. Despite all these barriers to the game, it has made the community stronger.. Many people call this the best Smash Bros. game of all time. While I don't fully agree with that statement, this game is fricking amazing. It works so perfectly with the Gamecube controller and is a must own for any Gamecube owner. Nay, a must own for anyone. Again, not the best Smash Bros. game in my opinion, but it has the best controller programmed for it and it is one heck ****.. As a single-player experience, it is painfully mid. However, fighting games are meant to be played with friends and that is where this game thrives. Melee is an amazing competitive community both as a spectator and as a player alike. Unlike in other fighting games where you learn the mechanics and then the rest of the game becomes essentially just mind games and neutral along with some flashy punishes, Melee harbors in it a lack of a feature that became a feature in itself. Melee does not do any handholding when it comes to inputs. In other fighting games, if you are too early with an input, it comes out the first frame it can. In Melee, however, if you want to be frame-perfect, you have to BE frame-perfect. Achieving closer and closer to perfection in Melee is a feeling unlike any other. There is also so much to learn both offensively and defensively that makes it so fun to play. If you are looking for a game with a limitless ceiling, Melee is here, has been here, and will always be here.. The roster is amazing the controls is pretty good, the competitive aspect of the game is perfect and it’s fun to play with friends. The GOAT. One of the few games I could play forever. As close to a perfect multiplayer game as you can get. Even the jank is fun. Only flaw is a lack of viability in some characters.. Melee holds up incredibly well to this day in all departments. Combat is solid for each character, it offers multitude of different modes, honours every IP featured, and is easy to learn, but difficult to master. A must buy for GameCube owners.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fast, creative, satisfying. Melee is my favorite fighting game of all time. The only downside is the small character pool, but melee-mods of other smash bros games have taken care of that.. Melee is a perfect game ... I honestly don't know ... That's just what Mang0 told me to say.... One of the greatest games ever made back in the day my friend and I played this game nonstop The GameCube will always be my favorite Nintendo Console because of the weird design, and a good selection of games And, of course, my friend says every time we play, smash brothers LET SMASH!!!. I personally find Mario Party repulsive. If I wanted to play a board game, I would do it at my kitchen table. While the mini-games are fun the trip to the mini-games stop me from buying it. So what did I reference Mario Party? It is because I feel Super Smash Brother Melee is a superior party game. It is a party when your pals whip each other's bum and you can just step aside and watch. What makes it even better is the fighting is on the television and there is no blood to clean up! If you like Mario and fighting, this game is well worth the Player's Choice title price.. Just last year I played this game for the first time. I had seen it a lot, I had kept up (a little bit) with the competitive scene, I had watched HBox and whoever else. But I always viewed it as taking the fun out of Smash (I was more of a casual guy). After Ultimate came out, I had started to get decent at that. I enjoyed just doing normal 1v1s, getting better with Fox or Duck Hunt (my 2 mains). At that time, I had started watching Smash much more. Prior I would really just watch content and keep up slightly with competitive. Now I was a bit more invested. Come Christmas of 2022, I ask and receive a GameCube Controller. I specifically asked for one for Melee. I wanted to try it out on Slippi. It felt clunky. I couldn't really work it, and part of that was just the lack of buffer. I was so used to it, so every time I tried to wavedash in the game I would airdodge too early expecting a buffer. I gave up for a few days, but then tried to get a bit better. And holy **** does it feel great. I will say this, I bought a pair of cheap CIPON gc controllers so they are kinda ****. The Y button is jammed on both of them (from my extensive wavedashes), and shield button is a little sticky, and the A button is absurdly loud. I've had them, though, since last Christmas, and while it's hard to play with them, I still enjoy it. The game feels so crisp to move (most of the time). It's just so much fun. I've thoroughly put myself into the competitive scene as well, watching every major I can. The game is great. Fun to play. Just kind of rushed the review cause I don't truly care but I want to put words out.. happy feet. PERFECT. Just one sentence. The replay value in this game is huge and extremely forgiving. P.S. I you play any other Smash,remember; IT'S NOT MELEE. Miss it. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. this game is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy good. the only qualm i have with it is that it doesnt take as much space in my mind as the other 2 big smash games. An incredible leap from the original game, loads of new content and characters plus faster gameplay.. Me, my brother and my friends spent countless hours playing this game. Good old times.. It’s fun, really a multiplayer game though. Once you find a character that you nail a few moves with it can become a bit competitive. It would have been better if there was a story mode for single player.. The best Smash bros game ever! It's not even close. Also one of the best fighting games ever.. This is my absolutely favorite Video Game of all time. The reason is because the Story Mode ist PERFECT!. The best competitive game ever made. There are dozens of techniques that can be implemented into your gameplay. That is why over 20 years after the game’s release it is still played competitively. It is also a great game for casual players. Tons of trophies to unlock. 26 different character. Tons of stages. And amazing single player content. Best fighting game ever made.. This game rocks, the graphics nowadays is a deal, the community made this game even better, in the competitive way is great to see tough challenge, the game bring so much content, like adventure mode, classic mode, all-star, etc, introduces new characters, is a very great game.. Quite possibly my favorite game of all time, SSBM shines to this day. With a roster big enough to allow for character variety, a gameplay system allowing for some of the highest level of fighting games, plenty of one player modes to mess around with, and a community supporting the game as much as possible, SSBM is just as great **** as ever. I genuinely have no significant complaints about the game, and it's pretty much a perfect game in my eyes. While it is true that the competitive scene dominates the discourse of Melee these days, let's not forget how the high-speed of the game also enhances the fun for casual play, adding to the chaos of items and the wackier stages. 10/10 easily.. In every way possible, Melee amps up the greatness that made the Nintendo 64 Smash Bros game so much fun. It introduces tons of new characters to the roster, allows you a rewarding character-unlocking system, provides tons of bonus content and game modes to try, and fine-tunes the mechanics with much more precision. Even now on the Nintendo Switch players prefer to use the GameCube controller layout due to their experience with this game. The new adventure mode is a real treat and classic mode features a healthy variety of battles and bonus stages to test your knowledge of the character's moves and abilities. The trophy collection implementation is not only a rewarding experience but a true gamer's collection dream as it provides lots of context from outside games and overall celebrates the franchises they include. Smash Bros. Melee is a true tribute to gaming and is just one of the most fun games ever made for any platform. If you're not into smash 'em combat games, you may not enjoy yourself but there's still some things to love and respect about the game anyway.. Heavily overratted, still a great game and a classic, even to this day, but be honest yall broke this game and only like it because of how much you've strayed away from the original purpose of this game. Then you shame people who treat it like a party game, and when Nintendo releases a game not catered towards the competitive scene, yall want the game and everyone who plays it executed. Anyway, still an incredible game and a classic, my problem is the community.. this game is just amazing. the gameplay is super fast and satisfiying. the singleplayer is the best its ever been. i understand why its considered a masterpeice 9.3/10. A really good Smash Bros game that has lots of fun yet challenging competitive gameplay.. A game sequel that expands and improves upon everything that already worked in its predecessor..

(N64): 85 Super Smash Bros Melee (GCN): 94. Best smash game ever. Fun, hype, good for casual play and best for competetive. I play a decent amount of comp smash but i really don't like melee not because of content rather there are so many things you have to remember like you have to do up up down left right L to scratch your balls. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is perfect. The skill ceiling is high so it keeps you playing, the gameplay is amazing, the ost is masterful, the graphics while not as good as other gamecube games like mario sunshine or windwaker are still impressive. the roster is iconic, the stage selection is great, and the single player content kept me going back for years even when I didn't have friends over. So the game is super fun, you have to practice til the movement feels fluid but once you do it's so worth it. 9/10 Well, the game everyone wants a HD remake of, huh. Yeah, it's amazing. It's Melee.. I don't know how many hundreds of hours i spent with my friend in this game. This says everything.. Very fun even still in 2021. It not only has a high nostalgic factor. But still has a great competitive scene. Way more fun to play then Smash Ultimate too. Great and Classic Smash experience.. The game itself is good, but its mechanics make me feel compelled to play it competitively.. The best Smash game, I've played countless hours of this on the Gamecube back in the day!. Although Smash Ultimate gives this game a run for its money, Melee is still the best Smash.. An absolute masterpiece. The game successfully integrates the most cherished of Nintendo's franchises into a unique platform fighting game that's both easy to learn and difficult to master. From the art design to the musical score, everything about this title has been elevated to its highest level. Even 20 years later, the game enjoys a vibrant scene and flourishing competitive community. This is without a doubt the best video game ever made.. It's a pretty good Smash game. It's still really fun and all, but people who say ""It's the best Smash game"" are just, like, objectively wrong? lol. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible game, probably a masterpiece of smash industry and the industry of video games !. All time favorite game. There is a reason why this game is still alive today and arguably one of the most competitive games. This game is fun for beginners and those who are competitive. Can play solo or with friends. Go for free for all, or even teams. Can play straight fighting or with items to mix up the fun. Highly recommend. I have never encountered a game with such rich and deep gameplay as this. A lively and active competitive community and the perfection in gameplay Super Smash Bros. are reasons why this game is touted as one of the greats and why it has survived for almost 20 years and I for one am looking forward to a great 20 more.. What should i say, one of if not the best fighting game ever made. Easily the best E sport.. This game is so good! I really wish Nintendo would release it on newer platforms, since you can only play it on a Gamecube or Wii (first gen model).. Sequels are a great opportunity to improve and expand upon what worked with the original game. Some of them offer rather subtle improvements, and others are Super Smash Bros. Melee. It’s remarkable how Masahiro Sakurai and his team at HAL Laboratories were able to make such a massive leap forward from the original to this one, and in such a short period of time at that. Melee was the reason for people to grab a GameCube, and it became the highest selling game for the console at over 7 Million units. In every single facet is this game an improvement from the original. The fighting mechanics, the visuals, the content. Melee’s got it all and then some. There’s a good reason why people still fondly look back on Melee and still play it to this very day. Melee’s presentation is the most obvious upgrade. It’s amazing how in just two short years the N64 original can look so dated in comparison. The character models look great, there are lots of neat little environmental details, and it all runs at a pristine 60 FPS with no hiccups. The game also supports a fantastic soundtrack full of great remixes and original compositions that remain staples to the series to this day. Sure, there are dated aspects to the character models and some parts of the game look kind of gross, but those are very minor issues compared to how much care went into this game. More importantly, though, gameplay has been upgraded considerably. It’s functionally the same as the original, where you pick a Nintendo icon and duke it out using a few buttons to pull off different maneuvers and knock opponents off the screen. The fighting feels much faster and smoother, demanding better responses from players. It’s a much more hectic experience, and in multiplayer it’s an absolute blast. Out of the entire Smash Bros. line-up, Melee is the most difficult to master. This is a much more competitive Smash Bros., and tournament players have been able to pull off many crazy exploits that even the developers never intended. The Character roster has more than doubled, ranging from weird, unexpected choices like Ice Climbers and Mr. Game and Watch, to characters that had been considered for the first game but couldn’t for various reasons like Bowser and Peach. It’s a really solid roster, even **** chunk of them are clones. Some also have pretty steep requirements just for you to obtain (Mewtwo), but half of the fun was being surprised by an approaching challenger and battling them in order to add them to the roster. Melee offers a wealth of content for you to soak in. For starters, there are more single player options. We have the returning classic mode, but this time the character battles are randomized to keep things fresh. There’s the ever popular Adventure Mode where you run through different stages based on various Nintendo properties. While the “adventure” concept of this mode teeters off halfway through, it’s still a fun, novel concept that really should be explored again in the future. We have the returning Break the Targets mini-game where each character has their own custom target stages that fully utilize their abilities. There’s Event Mode where you have different themed challenges to take on. All Star Mode pits you against every character in the game with limited health items. Melee also introduces the concept of trophies that you can collect from the different game modes or purchase with the coins you earn. Of course, multiplayer is back with a vengeance. Smash has always been best with friends and this is some of the best multiplayer action on the GameCube. There are more varieties of game modes to choose from like Coin Battles, Tiny Melee, Sudden Death, Stamina, a full fledge tournament mode. You name it. In case it wasn’t obvious, Melee is positively bursting with content, and is the kind of game that is meant to be played for years on end, not just because of all the things you can unlock, but because of how timeless and fun the core structure of the game is. Super Smash Bros. Melee is not just a great fighting/party game, but it’s just one of my favorites period. Even with other Smash Bros. games that come along it is still worth dusting off from time to time.. A classic Gamecube game and the best from it's series. Melee moved Smash Bros from an ""interesting concept"" to a legitimate game with value. Way more characters, game modes and platforms... try going back to the 64 version now lol However, the franchise itself has lagged ever since until recently. While Melee is a great Gamecube game it is still far from being the greatest fighter. Even within it's own sub genre it seems to be a less interesting title than Power Stone for Dreamcast. So much nostalgia around Smash Bros and 1000s of hours spent on it in my childhood. It's hard to go back to it now the burnout on the game has lasted over a decade. No doubt this game had huge influence at the time and is probably the game that's seen the most organized tournaments outside of esports.. This game was revolutionary. An obvious statement, but based on the fact that this is also a sequel to another game that was revolutionary for its time, that really says something even more. Smash Bros Melee still to this day brings fast, action-packed platform battling to its finest. What may seem to be a smaller roster in comparison to the likes of Ultimate today, Melee's roster is enough to entertain players for hundreds of hours. The competitive gameplay does yield a much less diverse ""viable"" character roster for top-level play, but for most players, that's not inhibiting. Smash Bros Melee also introduced some great new basic mechanics like more special moves, more accessible final destination and batllefield stages, and directional air dodging. And of course, it has developed its own cadre of advanced level gameplay techniques as well, enriching the experience for those looking for the next stage of fighting mechanics. Let alone the new gameplay modes like the Adventure mode that offer great, relaxed ways to enjoy the fighting mechanics in newer settings like stomping on goombas throughout Mushroom Kingdom or having Samus trying to make her great escape. Melee will always have a great spot in my heart as my first introduction to my favorite gaming franchise. It is impressive, to say the least, that the game still has a hardcore fan following to this day nearly 20 years after its release!. This game does not hold up nowadays. The game play is extremely buggy and unbalanced. The graphics are terrible (even for the gamecube) and the sound design is atrocious. Doesn't hold up play Ultimate or sm4sh instead.. Simply the best Smash game of all time. Even better than Ultimate. Unlocking characters and stages is really the main point in this game of fighting, collecting and skill. Event matches are amazingly good, adventure mode is a better version of classic and trophies are very innovative. If you have never played a smash game before, this is definitely your go-to!. While not my favourite in the series (mainly cuz I ****). Super Smash Bros. Melee is an incredibly fun game that I highly recommend. However, some more balance in the characters would be nice.. Graphic: 10 Music: 10 Control: 10 Variety: 10 Degree of Difficulty: 10 Fun: 10 Story: 8 Multiplayer: 10 Content: 10 Long-term Motivation: 10. IT IS MELEE! This game helped move the Smash Bros franchise to where it is today. It increased the roster, adding fan favorites that were destined to return, even if they were left out in Brawl. It is an awesome party game, or just one to calm down with after a long day.. The smash bros with the fastest game style of all to date, addictive and fun like few others. A must for lovers of fighting. Lots of characters, collectibles, game modes, and items.. First, to have fun in the best way possible: no items legal stage only, 4 stocks, 8 minuts. Of course this is my opinion. But this is the best smash game competitively. It is a great game to play if u have technical skills and it is the best Smash game to watch. It may look outdated but that should definitely not bother you.. Super Smash Bros Melee is a fighting game paradise. Its filled with content a roster that can satisfy practically everyone. Amazing multiplayer, simple to learn but difficult to master and it makes it uses the GC controller in the best ways possible. The SSB Franchise is a mashup of videogames and even a celebration and Melee is the game that will propably never be forgotten. There are extra modes like break the targets or classic mode but there are a lot of collectables and its fun looking for them and they are pretty cool **** to mention how much variety it has coin collector, time, and more. The graphics and sound design are amazing but the only thing I don't like is the adventure mode then again the game is filled with content and this is what makes it propably the best game ever made. bruuuh i haven't taken a shower in like 6 months because i'm trying to do these epic fox wavedashes on the 3 stages that aren't banned by the community. man i just love the odor when i go to melee tournaments, sometimes i even don't pass out. now please excuse me, i need to go on my daily rant about how i hate every game that isn't melee.. Its a fun game, buts nowhere near as good as Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Biggest gripes is the character feel like bricks, they don't feel ""floaty"" enough.. My personal rating for ""Super SMash Bros. Melee"" (GC): 9/10 - Awesome Gameplay: 9,5 Video: 7 Audio: 9 Scope: 9,5 Balance: 8,5 Story: -. F*cking Brilliant Melee is not only a better game than it’s predecessor, It’s one of the best games on the GameCube.. This is a classic!, with many characters, fast action, and so much more, almost none of the other smash games could compare to this!. It really didn't age that well, but back in the day it was REALLY good. Some people hate it because of how pro-players always snubbed Brawl, but it is a solid entry in the franchise and a great leap from its predecessor.. This game is great! Good single player, great multiplayer, interesting items for super fun casual play, and the fastest and most competitive game at the same time. My only gripe is that it can be somewhat difficult to learn compared to other smash games.. Not as good as 64 but it's still a great time to be had, especially with all the new characters.. This game is fantastic and full of frenetic fun (alliteration!), although I can see why the fast pace can be too much for some people. This truly was a major step forward for the franchise.. I enjoyed it especially with friends . I liked the gameplay and the mechanics are great. The knocking-out-the-stage mechanic is my favorite. The solo adventure is also good. This game is far from a masterpiece but its great set of characters, the feeling of adventure, and its minimal amount of microtransactions easily makes it a great game.. Melee IS PERFECT,The BEST SMASH,BETTER THAN SM4SH,ULTIMATE,BRAWL AND 64,stages,characters,graphics,original soundtrack and the gameplay are perfect In My Opinion Melee Is The Best Game Of All Time. this game looks great but I think it is a bad idea for Nintendo to remaster this.. Despite it's recognition as merely a modern competitive fighter, this game's depth of content and attention to detail should not be overlooked. The sound design is tight and satisfying, the unlockable trophies are a compelling and creative add-on as a collectible, and the sheer amount of possibility for enjoyment both in a single and multiplayer setting is astounding. To cap it off, Melee's core gameplay perhaps features the most nuanced and free-form movement that has ever been found in a video game. By far my most played game of all time, and I certainly would not have it any other way.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. I found this game to be quite capital. My chums and I do so enjoy a cracking good brawl with the other gentlemen in the country club.. A great improvement over the N64 Smash. Great graphics and incredible fast-paced gameplay that make people choose this Smash over the newer ones. The best multiplayer game on the Gamecube.. This is probably one of the best fighting games ever made. It was awesome. Cool design, cool graphics, cool characters, cool moves and cool attacks and great controls.. Took Smash Brothers to another level and is the first game in the franchise to take it to professional gaming. Roster pool is concentrated and gameplay is fun.. This game is very fun i like the unique gameplay that is very hard to recreate outside of other ssb games great characters and great game. I'm not even gonna dance around it, I'm not going to give an intro that leads into my opinions, I'm just gonna lay it out there now, ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"" is MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE GAME OF ALL-TIME! There, I said it. No game has taken more hours out of my life than this masterpiece, and I'm perfectly fine with that. It's extremely fun, fast-paced, visually wonderful, filled with content, and surprisingly technical. There's a reason this game still has a passionate tournament scene 15 years later: because it's just that good! No two ways about it, ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"" is my favorite video game of all-time, and I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this game. Now, go play it, because I'm gonna go do that, too. Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". The best fighting game of all time, hands down. I’m sure many people will disagree with that, but I’ve never played any other game where it feels so good to control your character. When I play other fighting games, a lot of times I feel like the movement feels super limited in order to make the game’s combo system more robust. But melee, whether intentionally or not, has an amazing combo game while also providing a ton of freedom.. Definitely a game that stood the test of time, Super Smash Brothers Melee improves upon 64 in every way, along with a style that many argue trumps both Brawl and Wii U. This game wasn't meant to be as good as it was, it wasn't meant to bring together like it did. This game was way more than just casual for many of us. If you watch the Smash Brothers Documentary, you will know what I am talking about because this game",super smash bros Melee released in 2001 for the gamecube was critically acclaimed . the game's learning curve for this game took well over a year just for a beginner to take a stock off . the game's goal is to get your opponent off the screen by any means necessary .
163.Virtua Tennis,"Decent enough tennis sim that's playable but ultimately there's not much to it.. A truly faithful arcade port, it has amazingly simple controls that make it an easy pick up and play game for anyone.. The quick learning curve and the wide variety of training exercises available. The best four-player game in a long time, and an excellent single- and two-player diversion. Don't avoid this because it's not football - you'll get more playtime out of it than you think.","the best four-player game in a long time, and an excellent single- and two-player diversion . the quick learning curve and the wide variety of training exercises available ."
164.Rome: Total War,"The BEST Total War game, though fighting Medieval 2 for that title. The only bad thing about this game is the god awful performance in 2024. That still didn't stop me from playing the hell out of it, which tells you how good this game actually is.. A good strategy game, but for my personal taste too much micromanagement on the world map. Unfortunately crashed every few hours.. Rome is life, Rome is Glory, Rome is Civilization, Greatest Total War Game Ever. It was BEST from TW series at that time! Loved to play it. Perfect for all fans of TW and Ancient times.. Wow! Very good grand strategy game, one of the best of always... The approach, with three different Rome factions is a brilliant idea. Quite possibly the greatest strategy game of all time. It revolutionized the RTS genre, painted a picture of Ancient Rome that was unseen in the gaming world, and had an impressive and memorable soundtrack to match.. One of the best strategic games of all time. awesome soundtrack, gameplay and lots of great details in the game make it a masterpiece. It's best Total War game according to its release time.. Initially played on disc for Gamespy Arcade, then inevitably went and purchased it on Steam around a decade later. I love this game, in fact I'd go to the extent to say that this game, alongside the era of games in the early 2000's, late 90's, is the greatest of all time. We have Age of Mythology, Empires, Rome Total War and many others, immensely better than the drivel that exists today, ill tell you that much.. This game was my first Total War. Although it was a game that I was very impressed with at the time, now it is a game that I not impressed as much as before. If we look at the period of its release, it is a revolutionary game for strategy games. Just like other Total War series, it drew me in with its Combat system and music. However, there are some parts that I don't like. For example, the camera only moves with your army. Which is way too restrictive for a game like this. It's also a little frustrating that you can't replenish your troops. But if we take all the gameplay, diplomacys and battles as a basis, we can say that it is a good game. Probably one of the most loved games in the Total War series and me too. This is the highest rating I can give this game. 8. Still fun to play in 2022, but performance is still a big issue as it is poorly optimised.. One of the first games I recall playing as a kid. Just like Age Of Mythology I played it on Disc, and on the old Gamespy Arcade system, which I'm unsure is even around anymore. I'm glad I acquired this game on Steam as well, before it was besmirched and impugned by the 'remastered' version.. the game i played as a child before i knew what kind of games that i liked to play. One of the best products Creative ever produced. For its time it was literally the greatest strategy on the market for years. Magnificent craft indeed.. The best strategy video game ever; everything is top tier quality (historical battles, **** Julii family, etc). Play this incredible masterpiece.. One of the games of my childhood and maybe of my gamers life. Just played it again in 2022 and it still fells great. The graphics, the gameplay, the soundtrack, even the voices are just perfect. It's a far too easy game to beat but I would not change a bit to this pile of nostalgia!. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 8.. No matter how old this game is, it will always be one of my favourite games. The graphics, the game mechanisms, and the vast options it gave are more than worth mentioning. It was ahead of its time. I still can't forget the siege of other cities.. This game was way ahead of its time. The mix of turn-based strategy and epic real-time battles is great.. By far the best game in the series, arguably the best strategy game of all time. It perfects the feeling of emptiness as you exterminate city after city, and has the true sense of conquest a game since then hasn't perfected. With the hard edges on the map, you know you've reached the limits of Hellenic knowledge. It has an imbalance, sure, but that's what gives it charm. Seeing the Brutii dominate the east, Julii take the northwest. This game is a gem. It combines turn based based strategy that let you enjoy macromanagment and conquest without becoming too detailed or tedious and real time battles that represent actual battles without become obsessed about it. I've played others strategy games and even other instalments of the total war series, but Rome: Total war feels the most enjoyable strategy game I've played.. The game was inaccessible. I did not know up from down. The game is a seven out of ten.. Loved and played hours in its time, a new way of strategy games. Still missing it.. I could never decide which game I liked more - M2TW or RTW; however I am convinced that Rome total war will forever have a special place in my gaming heart! I love the variety of units and the fact that you can play as Greek, Carthage or Gaul nation and conquer Romans!! Super exciting stuff. This game is really enormous for that time, even now still playable & it able to bring a fun. You are able to find huge amount of unofficial DLS with tons of improvement & additional content. Some of them are still updated. To my mind it shows how community enjoys this game.. i will have to show this to my kids on day, a masterpiece and personal favorite by far. There's something stranegly satisfying about watching dumbass enemies rushing into a phalanx and instantly dying.. used to be my favorite game,. But its very unbalanced. Unbalance that was never fixed. Romes are OP, they have the best of everything, and barbarians have the worst of everythjinhg. Greeks lack good cav. Macedonians cav is weak too. Romans shuld not even have preatorian cav. Archers were overnerfed. Moral of units is too low. They ruined the camera with steam version or 1.3 patch. And also introduced a phalanx bug where phalanx turns around for no reason. Nefed Egypts only good cav (desert cav 150 size to 120). the game was more balanced when it came oujt then after the patches. The game is an unbalanced mess.. Rome Total War is perhaps my favorite game. How much time did I spend playing it? I dont know. A lot of. Lots of. Played it after 10 years. It seems that the requirements for games have changed - computers have become more powerful, we are used to more modern graphics - and the pleasure of the game has not diminished, despite the fact that the game has been around for many years. To summarize: great strategy!. Second best total war ever, and great for its time (unlike current total wars that haven't really evolved). A wonderful experience with a slue of units, factions and simplistic but entertaining strategies.. It was best of the year on strategy category and stayed on that top rank for many years. Gameplay were much better than later games of same company and you can get enjoy from it at 2020. There were fast-paced realistic well-designed gameplay. Graphics:9/10 Sounds: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Fun: 10/10. The best TW game ever made :) Remember playing this game for hours :) Still playable at same level as back then :). Magnificent game. Still remember it playing it with 3 Roman families. Great time turned strategic part and real time battles.. The game that made everyone keep paying CA for inferior games that followed. It's now been made to play on windows 10 and so I gave it another shot, after playing this for thousands of hours years ago I have racked up another 70 in just a few weeks. If you like a challenge this is probably the only total war game that can give you one, just select hard and play as Partha. Game is set during the Victorian age, just kidding obviously it's set around the time of the Roman empire, it has plenty of unique units and the map is large but not as big as Rome 2 or small as Warhammer so just right. I played this game for over 5 years and along with starcraft and starcraft 2 it was definitely one of the best strategy games ever.. An awesome game when it came out. Maybe not so revolutionary anymore these days but you can find hundreds of mods that are absolutely awesome and historically interesting.. I don´t remember it that much. Played it as a kiddo i remember it to be awesome. Flammable pigs ftw. My first total war experince and with Roman legion i recommend it.. As a modder (classic age total war, peninsula italica and others) i can testify this game still has the perfect mix even in 2018, magnified with excellent mods which bring it at another level and make your graphical card suffer... My only regret would be the cloned units. Diversity like in Medieval II and it would have been perfection on this earth as far as strategy/tactics is concerned. Read Sun Tzu, you'll need it there. I remember back at the beginning endless battles and endless campaigns that could last for several month on end. Each turn was full of critical decision and priority solving. Of course the AI was not its strong point, in battle or in campaign as factions sometimes betrayed too easily. But all in all it was like taking all elements that made the success of strategy games, empire-building Risk-style, and a real time battle management that had so many variables each battle was different, and i don't even speak of having 500 different units, a 200 regions strong world map, tons of culture specifics, pitch battles, ambushes and sieges, civil wars and natural hazards, plus the terrain, which was (compared to Rome II) much more open, without any comparison, graphic aside. Because if amazing graphics makes your day in a show, it is not enough to have players hooked long-term. but RTW had this in its DNA. in short, RTW still stands tall today. Brillant.. This strategy was created by ingenious people who loved their work and invested there in the whole. To make this wonderful game in white light.. Great strategy game. The turn-based campaign map with RTS battles makes for a unique and enjoyable experience. The history is accurate, though you essentially rewrite it as you play. The variety of factions and units makes for some great fun and replayability. One interesting aspect of the game is that troops don't always win against the units they have a bonus against. For example, pike infantry have a bonus against cavalry. However, if cavalry are maneuvered in an effective manner they can attack the pikes from the side or rear, rendering their deadly points useless. The downside of this is that it is so effective that it becomes a staple strategy for nearly every battle, limiting your strategic choices. Sometimes my groups of cavalry would simply attack whatever unit was nearest to them, despite commanding them to attack only archers. This was annoying but fixable by individually ordering them. Auto-resolve is a way to skip the RTS battles and stay on the campaign map, but it is very unbalanced and often makes you lose battles you would normally win easily. Cost $3.24, played 88 hours. Great game, highly recommended.. So good, I'm still playing it 14 years later. Everything about it is perfect except 1 detail - when you get so far in to a campaign, your empire becomes unsustainable, no matter what you do, half your territories start rioting and it gets pointless.. My Childhood! My beloved Memory! Rome Total War will forever be the best strategy game that i've or will ever played! It's the pinnacle of it genre. No strategy game can surpass this masterpiece, this is not an opinion, this is a fact! And yes, that was a fanboy ejaculation, but i don't give a ****! Roma Invicta!. Absolutely fantastic. By far my favorite out of the series. The only thing holding it back from a 10 is the horrible path finding, especially during city battles. Definitely in my top games of all time list.. This game was my first entry into the turn based strategy genre and what an impression it made. Rome is what I compare all games in this genre to and sadly nothing up till now nothing has really measured up to its greatness in my humble opinion. The thing that I feel puts this game over the top is its combat system which unlike other games I have played is very straight forward and easy to master after a short period of time. Most units act as I expect they should and the amount of different units you can command keep each battle refreshing which invites you to go through several campaigns so you can experience the capabilities of each faction. The music does get a bit repetitive at times but is still good in short burst and fits the theme fairly well. Graphics are good but not prestige for the era but honestly who cares when everything else works so well. The political system is a bit bland but functional and it wasn't until I pumped up the difficultly level that I received a real challenge but those can be forgiven when the mechanics and combat are this good. This is one of my favorite games of all time and completely ruined this genre for me in a good way if that makes any sense. A must own for any fan of the genre and is just one of those games that can stand the test of time. This games will always have a spot on my hard drive.. I still come back to this game every now and then. It's the best game of the series alongside with Medieval II. An absolute beauty and the modding community is amazing, also great expansions.. One of the best strategy of the all time. Rome Total War is mother of major **** give me many pleasant **** had the best graphic of those time.(Sorry of my English, I'm Hungarian). Great strategy game for its time. It is still a good game to this day, but it has clearly aged. The management of your cities for example can be incredibly painful when you have a lot of cities.. this game is perfect it may not have best graphics but the strategy of the game play is so realistic of all total wars series i still like this and napoleon the most. This game is a masterpiece. I still play this game at least once a year 11 years later and have probably logged over 500 hours into the game. It is my pick for the greatest game of all time.. This game is timeless. One of the greatest game codes ever created. I started playing on release, and am still playing in 2015 onward... One of the pioneers of the strategy genre and a true hall of famer. Respect.. Had issues at start up that took some time to fix due to bugs. Battles are slow, everything seems blocky and makes my head hurt going through with the game. Not my type of strategy game. Boo. One of best games every for me. Hundreds of hours playing this game and it still doesn't get bored. There are some mods which make game even more exciting like DarthMod. Awesome game!!. In my opinion not only the best Total War game, but the best strategy game to date. Probably the most addictive game I have ever played and definitely the one that has kept me in front of my computer screen for the most hours. Not only is it fun to play, but you also learn much about the antiquity period, which is a bonus if you're interested in history like me. I still pick it up sometimes and get sunk into Europe 270 BC.. I really love this game I've had it since its release and still to this day play it quite frequently. While the graphics are old please remember this game is over ten years old back in those days of gaming this was actually pretty good graphic wise for this style of game. Now for the game-play! For your first play-through you'll have to play as one of the three ruling families of Rome, and help build up the roman empire, you'll be able to do this by building up your cities and of course waging war with rival factions for more territory to rule over! The units are quite complex don't underestimate your opponents or you might end up regretting it! You'll be able to call upon war-dogs, war-pigs(incendiary piggies), Elephants, assassins, Gladiators, and much, much more.. personally LOVE this game even ten tears later.i will however say this,it seems to me that ever since i began running the game through steam power it seems like there are ALOT more glitches and bugs especially when trying to capture **** instance i played a battle three times over routed the enemy army in the city but wanted to kill the rest for the extra xp but found that a portion of the remaining enemy army had somehow managed to get in between multiple buildings where i could not get to them to do this.i reiiterate 3 TIMES OVER!!!!!!!!! this was not an issue when i had the actual disc itself at times it really is an UNPLAYABLE game but again i only ever had the issues when running through steam i will however say that it is still a very fun game, particularly using the berserker units the germans get,it can be a bit tough when you get to the end of your campaign 50 settlements are tough to control simultaneously but over all i would say the BEST most fun game ive ever played. Classic grand strategy game which also allows you to fight tactical pitched battles. Still play the game now and again after many years. The graphics may be dated now but new younger players should try and look beyond this as the core game is still good and enjoyable. Still a solid game and great value for the prices you can get it at now.. Scream with thousands of brave gallic warriors against inglorious Romans before the bloody battle begins. Give phalanx formation order to noble greek soldiers to build a fearsome and deadly pike wall. Deploy Roman legionnaires as one line and then watch how the war machine works. Crush the heart of the enemies with invincible war elephants of mighty Carthage. Lead the merciless children of Nile who walk through death without hesitation for their godlike Pharaoh... With nearly perfect campaign and battle gamplay design, I think Rome Total War is the best Total War game in the series and even one of the best strategy game in game industry. Its innovative high quality mechanics and hundreds of small juicy details captured players hearts and created thousands of fans for CA. After eleven years, I hope Creative Assembly and especially SEGA learn a lesson from their poor Warscape products (ETW, NTW, STW2, FOTS, RTW2) and develop high quality games as they did once.. For me, this has to be the definitive Total War Game. Rome Total War is in many ways a much better game than those that followed it. The combat and mechanics are fairly straightforward, while not being overly simplified and the campaign management is streamlined and not overly burdensome (completely unlike RTW2.) While not perfect in all ways, it is fairly easy to mod things yourself, in order to change things around a bit. Want to give barbarian tribes paved roads and stone walls? Easy to do and takes less than five minutes. Roman units and hoplites are a bit OP and the IA can be a bit stupid at times, but all in all, the game provides many hours of enjoyable play, while the combat animations are far more realistic and weighty than those using the more recent Total War Engine. In the ten year since its release, I'd have easily played well in excess of 1000 hours on this game and after briefly grappling with the disaster that is still RTW2 (even after the Emperor Edition), I can see myself enjoying this gem for many years to come.. My personally greatest strategy franchise of all time and the best strategy game of all time.Rome:Total War is one big masterpiece of strategy games!!. Rome Total War blows away the prequels of the franchise with all round better everything. Battles are captivating and more interactive than ever before, now is your chance to truly conquer the world with brutality. 8/10 - Ben Hazelden. I do not judge RTW by todays standards. The graphics and IA are obviously outdated. However even today, this game feels great, with many different ways of winning, many fight styles. By todays standards, it would be but 7 or 8. Even today, this game is way more pleasure to play than rome 2 tw.. A masterpiece. One of the greatest strategy games every created. The soundtrack? Spectacular. Graphics? Still detailed and awe inspiring to this day. Gameplay? Nearly flawless. The replay-ability in this game will guarantee that you are occupied for many hours fighting battles and expanding your empire. This game got everything right, as it's one of the best in the entire Total War series (with maybe the exception of Shogun 2. That game was incredible). Please do yourself a favor, pick this game up and give it a try. You will not regret it.. Its 2014 and I struggle to understand what exactly this game offered, even at the time when it was released. I see a painfully slow, awkward, restrictive military simulation that is not only uninteresting (outside of the historical context of course), but also immensely lacking as an actual ""game."" Perhaps time has not been so kind to this stand-alone title, but even I remember ""Shogun"" being fun to play and less performance annihilating as well. I play on a relatively decent rig and for the life of me I cannot understand why this game has so many performance issues outside of the confirmed fact that it was a fairly CPU intensive game to begin with. Which makes me doubt anyone's ability to have actually played it with a decent framerate in either 2004 or even 2005 and beyond. I'm not claiming that a multi-core processor like the Phenom's are going to be up to the task, but would it have been out of the question (even at the time) to update the game to take advantage of more than one processor? Its embarrassing really. The franchise itself has had better offerings, aside from the ""Rome: Total War 2"" and even more alarmingly not soon after this game. I understand its a simulation of sorts, a realistic battlefield, taking into account troop movement, troop moral, troop tiredness and other realistic mechanics, but its just feels uninvolved to me. Send army there, they fight, send army here, they fight, and its really not particularly fascinating outside of a siege or some of the larger battles. Those are at least more involved, and planning them out or creating a strategy actually makes sense. If this is essentially a benchmark for single core CPU performance, I get it, but as far as a game that has stood the test of time? I would have to say: ""No."" Not only no, but it literally hurts a games appeal over time when it is incapable of taking advantage of future technology to some extent. Farcry was built to stand the test of time and though it isn't really anything more than a benchmark itself (as well as including a terrible story and by the numbers first person shooter experience) its still works as intended. As in people can take their rigs now, pump up all the graphical eye-candy (at the time) and still enjoy the game. Rome Total War is incapable of being anymore than a well polished military simulation, but its Achilles heel was the developer not even considering future-proofing to some degree whatsoever.. best game ever. I mean really best game ever along with empire total war and shogun. all 10 out of 10 games. aowidmawda it so bootiful so much memories and aoiwdawod CA has sone an amazing job on rome total war. by far the best stragety game out there along with shogun 2 and empire total war and yes ive played civ 5, tropcio, age of empires and all those other games.. Absolutely useless. Nothing to do with strategy. This game is clearly an unfinished project. Bought in 2014 and it still drops out for no reason, due to its programming and despite two patches. Graphics can not be adjusted even with a new powerful machine. If your idea of a fun strategy game is to babysit every single unit and issue orders to run three to four times to each unit and then still find them walking -loosing every single opportunity for advantage in open battle or defense. Also the AI is utterly unreasonable, while apathetic in battles with large numbers, the game allows a single defending missile horseman to venture out of guarded gates and attack 80 arches surrounded by other friendly units, and risk routing them! 3 missile horsemen against 80 javelin men completely routing them, again, while surrounded by friendly units, such as multiple phalanx units chasing them, to which the horsemen pass neatly at the edges of the spears without being engaged and rout your weakest units without even have a reasonably sized force. In the meantime of course none of the attacked units thinks about eliminating their single attacker. Other occasions missile horsemen reduced to 4 units surrounded by 30 heavy cavalry units with General and taking ages to eliminate them, you have to constantly click on them. In the meantime other bigger forces approach and your units are still dealing with the one unit that had been also routed previously. The turn based map is ridiculous also, there is no undo if you accidentally move a unit wrongly and as your turn ends, the next turn's events could be detrimental. You have to be precise with every move to the degree of being impractical. The economy can not really be managed efficiently due to being non intuitive , obscured and embellished with information that does not help the game, you have to try hard all the time for the simplest tasks and you rarely know how economy in some cities will go in the next turn. The impact of each decision is not visible and it can not be managed well. All this while battles, enemy alliances and own expanses are ongoing. The auto management does not seem to achieve much especially in military build. Some cities build more others less with no clear indication. It is a total waste of time. Honestly the one thing this game deserves credit for, is that it forces you to spend hours playing despite immense frustration and upset because you just can not believe that it can be so bad and you keep trying in the hope that it was only one frustrating mission or a particular element that was bad. Unfortunately this game is a constant source of never ending frustration. It feels like its been designed to keep you occupied rather than allow you to have fun. It is definitely worth an uninstall. There is no cure, newer versions in the series maintain the same problems. Graphics are not great, unit management could not be any worse, economies and user interfaces perplexing. The first thing that is needed in order to be on the road of fixing this game is for units to obey orders. Very few other games do not give you even this basic control. This game is the worst I have ever encountered in this respect. Literally unplayable. No amount of patience can solve the problems of this game.. The graphics are great, the combat animations are real and intense, and most of all this game changed my life... seriously. It got me into Roman history, introduced me to military strategy, and is, really, much more than just a game. All who gave this game less than a 9, shame.. this game is the best game i have ever played. It has good graphics and wonderful buildings but the thing is that when there is to much sword men in the game the game goes slower and it begins to stop so you should be aware of that.. A true classic in gaming history. I'm one of the most strategic gamers out there, and I can glady say that I played this in 2014 and was astonished at how I never bought it before (too busy playing Civ 5). If you think this game is old, think again. True, the graphics are not on par with many newer games, but you have to go in-depth and appreciate the tremendous amount of effort and artistry put into this game. The campaign makes you think you've seen it all, that your a super power and can't get wiped out by your opposing roman families. Wrong. They strike with a venegence, your enemies return in strength, and **** units are revealed. This was a shock to me, as I've never seen that happen in a game without some hint of the upcoming units. If you like strategy, if you like fierce battle, if you like commanding a max of 2500 units (all shown), then this is the game for you (can't speak for Rome II, haven't played it, but if you tune in to local chats you'll hear its buggy).. One of the best games I have ever played. It is a great game highly recommend it too series fans and newcomers alike. This is Way better then Total War Rome 2. If you want to play rome in this series play this one not Total War Rome 2. It macks Total War Rome 2 look like it was made by noobs. Just replayed it again (Jan 2014). The game is head and shoulder above R2:Total War. While it's not perfect and it has its own bugs, this game may not have all the graphical bells and whistles of its predecessor, it has something much more important: gameplay.. Super fun strategy game. Hard to pick up as a beginner, but really easy and fun once you get the hang of it. Some pretty unbalanced factions as well, but just adds to the difficulty. Also, Better than the second one... unfortunately.. This is undoubtedly the best game of the year. With well-written script, amazing graphics which stuns you, especially when you're in battle mode with thousands of soldiers, literally, crashing and fighting for their own factions, and most importantly, impressive AI in level ""hard"" and ""very hard"" that catches me on surprise numerous times, Rome Total War earns it's place to be one of the greatest Real-time strategy game of all time.. Rome: Total War was the first Total war game I ever played, I have played it for at least 6 years now and although it has some flaws, it is definitely worth playing. The graphics were really good back in the day (of course if you compare it to Shogun 2, it looks terrible, but you have to look at it, as if you would have 7 years ago. After all, it was released in 2005) and this game made me play every next total war game except for Napoleon. The campaign map was large, and a large variety of units existed. Cities didn't always display on the right location, like Segesta, which was a Sicilian city, but was put by the developers at the spot of Genua. The battles were difficult, but if you were at least a little bit of a tactician, you could beat the AI. The city viewing is another great feature, which I missed in every next total war game. I hope they will add it to new games at some point. The most memorable however, were the huge amount of soldiers you can put on the screen. The largest amount I have ever fielded was around the 10.000, but I have seen videos of more. Despite all the good things, some negative things also exist. The cultural variation is not always accurate, as is the case with the ""Germans"" and the ""Britons"". They simply didn't exist as a single faction back then. The assault of a siege sometimes really ****, since sometimes the units simply didn't want to climb the siege tower. The AI was really weak at using phalanxes. It has to be mentioned however, that the greatest asset of Rome Total war was the large amount of mods that have been released to address aforementioned problems. The ones I played were Europa Barbarorum and Amazon: Total War, the former being a more historically accurate mod than the latter, which introduced female warfare. All in all, a fantastic game, which redifined the essence of a strategy game, and despite some minor issues made a major impact on the world of gamers.. There is just nothing I can say that is bad about this game... Must be one of the, if not the best Stat game of all time.. This an amazing game, far superior than Rome2 which I'm playing since it's release, without getting bored at all! IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The very only game i keep coming back to even after 9 years. Definitely one of the greatest strategy games ever and my all time favourite that i grew up with. Great work by The Creative Assembly. The best strategy game ever made; ingenious in every way. This game is streets ahead of it's sequel nearly a decade later. If you want a good Rome-themed strategy; reinstall this or buy for a pittance","great strategy game, one of the best of all time . great soundtrack, gameplay and lots of great details in game make it a masterpiece . i love this game, alongside the era of games in early 2000's, late 90's, is the greatest of all time ."
165.Forza Motorsport 3,"Forza motorsport 3 it's my first race game, usually i play this game because i have nostalgia and, it's really fun and i think the best forza game ever make.. The Forza motorsport Golden years is oftern thought to orignate with this game, the leveling mechanic is likely the best in the series, with many of the games features being worked on for its sequel, this is the foundation of it all, and in many ways, including the leveling, it outwheighs its sequel.. The thing is about this game is that it has a BIG change in formulae. Going from 2-3, everything has changed with handling, physics, more cars etc... The reason why it ranks above Fm2 and 4 is because it is an overhaul of sorts. STILL what an incredible game this was at the time and in fact I was thinking to bring this game to a friends house who still has a 360 to this very day.. The second best simulator racing game of all time, after FM 4, the third best is FM 7, then FM6, etc. 10/10 ;). This game is a masterclass in refinement, polish, and sports simulation. While this year's changes may seem minor on the surface, they combine flawlessly to create an experience that surpasses its predecessor in every way.. 2023 Take on the game. 9/10 Near perfect sim-cade. Gets you to love racing all over again I'm not going to do the comparison game between other forza motorsports I'm just going to talk about THIS game objectively based on the time it came out and how fun it is today. Cons -Money, if you want every car in this game.... good luck. I think you'll give up. OR maybe you're crazy like me and grind the game for hundreds of hours to afford that 60s Ferrari 250 GTO that costs 20 million credits. Hats off to you if you do it. -Difficulty, idk for me it's too easy, in this game the A.I. drive purely stock vehicles so it isn't hard until you get to the GT4, GT3, LMP cars. Thats when you have to actually try. I play a lot of Forza so maybe I'm just good :P -Unfortunately, you cannot buy the DLC for this game anymore. Which means if you have a vanilla copy you may be missing a decent amount of content, tracks and cars. I don't think Porsche is in the Vanilla game it came out as DLC, BUT there is RUF cars in the vanilla game so you will have Porsche based 911's so it's not all bad. And there is still a large collection of cars to choose from without the DLC. -You can still view online Leaderboard times, but I don't think it's possible to host online games. Local multiplayer is still fun. -Ummmm ya thats it PROS -Menu music. I'm sorry! It's so good I have to put it as the first point. I will literally sit in the menus for an hour just vibing I love it! -Car physics, it feels GREAT! Every car is unique, and it makes for an enticing way to experience cars in a realistic way. -Car sounds, cars sound amazing- especially for 2009 -Car quality and quantity, HUNDRED and HUNDREDS of superbly designed models. Gran Turismo 5 has NOTHING on this game when it came to visual quality of the cars. Not to mention EVERY car had an interior view. -Car customization, the game even rewards you for sticking to one brand by giving you discounts on upgrades. Not to mention every upgrade is branded. Meaning you don't just buy brakes you bought WILWOOD or BREMBO brakes. Those aren't just racing tires those are PIRELLI's. It adds more immersion to see the ACTUAL brands on your upgrades. It makes it feel like your car build is realistic and you could do it in real life. Finally, turning a **** into a track car is always addicting. -Tracks! Lots of racetracks, mostly real ones but a large selection of fantasy tracks that mimic real life circuits or roads and they are all fun to race on and look visually appealing even today. Some tracks are exclusive to this game. -Car variety, I challenge you to go through the car list and think of something thats missing. If you like muscle cars, sports cars, city commuters, luxury SUV's, gt racers, LMP, 90s touring cars, drift cars, historical racers, you name it. They got it. And it's a large list- I think something along 500+ cars. All customizable. -Long career mode. It will be a LONG time before you beat this game. It's got that Gran Turismo 4 length. There are soooooo many events and sooooo many cars to try and use to see which is best at each event. -Tuning, you might not care, but you can alter the dynamics of your car in a pretty realistic way. Camber, Spring Rates, Gear tuning, it's very nerdy but it's fun if you like getting into physics. Every car is important in this game. This is an era where Turn 10 really loved attention to detail. They loved cars and they loved their games they were making. This game doesn't feel rushed despite it releasing two years after the prequel. It feels great to play, amazingly even with the server's down on multiplayer I can still recommend this game. Even for people who have played other motorsports this is worth a visit. Spend some time here and you'll see what I mean. 9/10. They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. The Forza series finds its own way by dumping the Gran Turismo format and introducing a linear chronological series of championships set over a season. The auto-upgrade option is very useful for those who can't be bothered to fiddle around with endless menus but it doesn't seem to make much difference whether you win races or not as the season ploughs onward regardless. Polished and technically impressive but more for those interested in ""realism"" rather than fun.. Forza Motorsport 3 is the best part of the Motorsport series. 4 part has already declined. For 2009, this is an amazing racing game with simulation elements. Yes to Gran Turismo 5 she is very far away, but this is not necessary. Forza has always been an arcade. Forza Motorsport 3 is superbly played and now, I have been re-entering it for 2 years and this is the first Forza that I passed 100%. True systemseller for Xbox360, it is a pity that due to copyright it is not available on backwards compatibility user Xbox One and Series S/X can not play it. Classics need to be remembered). First motorsport game I played and wanted to compare it to Gran Turismo in my opinion for its time of release was far better.. Turn 10 have been making the Forza Motorsport series since 2005, and as of 2021, there are 7 games in the series (soon to be 8). But it's this one, released in 2009, that is the greatest of them all. This was my very first Forza title, and what an introduction to Forza it was. Every single about this game was absolutely perfect. The soundtrack, the car list, track list, career mode, everything. Turn 10 got everything right with this game, and I don't think the legendary status of this game will ever be replicated ever again.. I never really liked racing games (except for mario kart) however, this game was really good. Surprisingly, i even played through most of the campaign. A great and very fun car racing game. It doesn't do much exceptional or anything revolutionary, but it is still a very well made and entertaining experience.. My most played forza to date. Great selection of cars and tracks and solid visuals.. An game with best quality and relaxing menu music. I'm very a big fan of this game. This was my first introduction to the Forza series, and I must say that it's the best racing game I've played. My first time I played, I accidentally sold my Ferrari for a Ford GT without knowing that the GT was V8 and not a V12. Then I sold that for a Viper that had a V10. I tried to get another V12, but failed. I basically sold myself into a corner. So I started again, and got a Toyota Sprinter. They gifted me a very powerful car, so I sold it for 300k, and modded my Sprinter to a S class. So now, all I need to do is design it like the sprinter in Initial D, which might be very easy because of the HUGE Forza community. The only thing stopping me is that the servers are constantly down, which is why it gets a 9. This is WAY better than PGR4. I don't know why this game has a worse negative rating than it. But let me stop my review here and say this: This is the BEST racing simulation game I have EVER played. I'd like to count Carbon and Most wanted, but those aren't simulations, but more of a street racing game. This game is flat out the BEST racing sim you can buy.. stable and realistic graphics, great simulation, fabulos sensation of speed. Vinyls are a great detail. And the number of races gives us endless hours.. Lots of fun. Great detail on the cars & tracks. The only frustrating thing is when you go to pass a car (in single player), the A.I. doesn't sense your vehicle & won't give you a lane to race in. They'll force you to either pass them in the grass or on the outside, otherwise you'll either hit them or overdrive the corner. At that point, this game becomes frustrating. But overall, it's a great game & lots of fun.. What can I say, it was a pretty good game, but never really stuck around with me. Only logged in about an hour and a a half. Might pop it in my 360 soon.. Graphics: 9.0 Sound: 8.5 Gameplay: 9.0 Fun/Story: 9.0 A great improvement of Forza 2, especially on the much more detailed look and textures. Nice game.. This is my favorite racing game and series to date. Feels good and highly customizable. I haven't played any since this one, because my 3rd and final XBroke 360 **** the bed and I got locked out of my account to boot. Needless to say I will not be buying an **** One. F*ck you, Microsoft. You pieces of ****. Great game, though!. More of an add on to Forza 2 rather than a stand alone as, apart from a little tweak of the gameplay mechanics, the game is just the same except for added tracks and additional cars made between the two games. Worth getting for cheap if you have hammered 2 to the point of death.. First of all I do not own a X box 360 but I have played Forza 3 quite a bit. Firstly I really enjoyed the amount of creativity you could do to your cars visually, which some games simply don't offer. The driving was also quite fun and the competition was for he most part equal.. It was a great game, but in my reviews I am pretty much just giving you a short explanation on why I enjoyed it or didn't enjoy it. Not really too much about how good it really is, its my opinion what do I know That's why I give you my enjoyment of it because you can't tell me I'm wrong. And as good as a game this is, racing games just got boring and repetitive to me. To me racing is the same thing over and over again.. I want to love Forza. I've tried every single release hoping for the spark that made me love racing games. There are somethings it does fantastically well. the customisation is better than GT, the selection of cars is good if not really stellar and the aural aspect is high quality. It just seems to lack something. The presentation is more glitz and pizzaz than substance and real polish and unlike other games of the genre you are never really in the driving seat.. You are always aware that this is just another game.. This game is amazing. I have played lots of racing games and none have captured me the way this one has. The cars, parts, and car customization is one of my favorite parts. The only problem is the steep learning curve on adjusting the cars specific details if you don't know anything about cars.. I'm not much of a race car fan. I have never gotten into racing games but bought this used because a guest was coming up for a week and loves racing games. I have to say this is an incredible game. I have gotten lost in the designs and even the game play has had me on the edge of my seat. I've even got my eye on picking up a new copy of Forza Motorsport 4 thanks to my experience with 3!. Complete package. End of. Same detailed and easy-to-use customisation as Forza 2, auction house, tuning in sometimes painful detail, upgrades on virtually any component and hundreds of cars. Any car nut's dream. But as a racing game, it's boring in terms of driving. It's fine when this is ALL you play, but it's not fun and there's no sense of speed like in other racing games. I didn't like the online and many of the talented artists still go on forza 2 due to the bureaucratic censorhip of ""inappropriate content"". Whilst the career mode offers a greater variety in cars and events, there is still no drift mode- only circuit, sprints and drag races (which are EXTREMELY BORING). There are just enough additions to qualify for a sequel to Forza 2, but it's not as special. Still, a game that is worth recommending to anyone. You get more assist options, more tracks, cars, modes, events, drift leaderboards, time trials (which are secretly hidden away under the leaderboards menu), cckpit view and a structured season play. OK yes, every kind of car you can dream of, everything you'd ever want to do to it- upgrading, tuning, ANY paint job/livery etc. that's all well and good. But the gameplay has NOT changed. Turn 10 have failed to add additional game modes and objectives. Shift, for example, emphasises additional objectives and such so that even if all you're doing is driving around a track, there's always something else to go for- a greater goal. Here it just feels like grinding and, given the lack of a sense of speed (despite the unbelievably smooth framerate); I cannot recommend this game over NFS Shift as a game. As a simulator, it's excellent. I wouldn't say this game is as mainstream as Microsoft make out- it gets boring relatively quickly despite the plethora of assists available.. This is the best racing video game so I like this game a lot so I give this game..................... 9/10 really this game deserves !!!!! this rating. I'm a huge GT5 fan and after playing this game for 8 hrs straight at a friends place, I'm addicted. Selling my ps3, gt5 and buying an xbox for Forza 4 alone. The graphics are stunning and the physics are by far the best in any race game ever!. great game amazing graphics so much cars 400 is a lot and forza 4 as 500 top gear is their so get that technology gets better over time this game was amazing 2 years later the new game comes out 10/10. I am a racing game fan. Done them all, you name it. In my opinion Forza Motorsport 3 doesn`t exactly show the same progress like its predecessors did. The main thing I always look at while choosing a racing game is the sensation of actually driving a car. To be honest, Forza 3 falls in average cathegory in this respect. Gran Turismo is better with NFS SHIFT being the best. Given that I play thoset titles often, my first glance at FM3 made me recheck my console settings if I was running this at 1080p. Well, I did. Graphically this game is almost the same as FM2, just average. And no, I don`t rate graphics by watching the showcase rooms but the actual gameplay. **** are just rubbish, there is hardly any head movement that would show some G forces experienced by the driver. While driving in FM3 I feel as if I was a camera inside the car, steering it by a radio controller. The sense of speed is mediocre. The racing locations are merely on par with the competition. I love everything else about this game, but it doesn`t change the general impression one bit. When I feel like driving a virtual supercar, I choose NFS SHIFT or Gran Turismo.. Listen, I own both a 360 and PS3; and the only games I really get crazy about the ones that make me feel like I'm really behind the wheel of a car I wish I actually had. When Forza 1 was released, it was like a fresh breath of air; so fresh, that I found myself pre-ordering Forza 2; with the wheel. Long story short, I traded in my xbox 360 as I decided if I was going to own one console, it would be the PS3. Of course, I purchased GT5 and played the hell out of it... but I felt like something was missing. I couldn't figure out what, but even though I was happy with GT5, I thought, ""Maybe IGN is right; if I liked GT5, maybe Forza will blow my mind... I remember how much I used to enjoy it...."" - That was enough for me to buy another Xbox; luckily my nephew had an extra one. The second I got my ""new"" xbox, I ran to gamestop, literally, and picked up a long sought after copy of Forza 3.... I havent played it, or my Xbox 360 since.... No offense to Xbox fans; its a great system; I just dont own many games for it... and as I played Forza 3, I found myself completely disappointed. I found it unremarkable. The worst part, the part I just couldn't ignore, I found the cars themselves to be incredibly sluggish. The anti-aliasing is lower; the graphics aren't as crisp as I was used to seeing; I also found the track design uninspired. The handling was the worst, by far; even after turning off every assist possible, it felt like driving a car in grand theft auto. Even watching the players hands in the **** view, I kept thinking ""Really? Come on, you ass, turn the wheel faster!"" Like I said, I'm the farthest thing from a fanboy as you can get. When I think of games, I think of it as, ""Well, I own a playstation so I'll get this playstation game"" - for me, its a logistical question. Though after playing Gran Turismo 5, something so far from perfect, I found myself completely bored and almost amused at Forza 3. I can see why its popular; I think its earned its rightful spot in the video game hall of fame; but I didnt buy it to put a hello kitty sticker on my bumper; I bought it to smoke tires and dominate chicanes; and in that regard, I think Forza takes a distant 2nd to GT5; a good enough game, but outclassed as a simulator and once you had the best, its hard to enjoy the rest.... I'm not really a fan of car games, but Forza Motorsport 3 caught my attention. With many cars to choose from, and many tracks to race on, this is a game that will keep you entertained.. For a racing game with a solid community that can post car designs, with an immense design editor, along with tuning setups and even an ability to post videos and pictures of their cars; this game is a solid 10. For the actual racing aspect, this game is a solid 10. My only wish is that the cars were more balanced but that would shatter the realism, and I thank Turn 10 for not listening to my dreams and doing what makes this racing game, perfect.. Quite possibly the last word on racing games, Forza 3 is pretty, massive and a joy to control. Each car handles with unparalled precision, from the Lamborghinis to the Fords. Super fast supercars actually feel like supercars, and even the slower, weaker cars are incredibly fun. And this is Forza 3's greatest strength-there are no rubbish cars. There all fun, even the crap cars are as satisfying as the insanely fast Bugatti Veyron. Of course, it helps that the graphics are incredibly good too, and yet still manages to run along smoothly at 60fps. Another big area of Forza, revealing itself after release, is the fantastic ability for user created content. You can paint cars, create designs, upgrade your cars- all of which backed up by an incredibly strong user base, meaning Forza could last forever. But it won't obviously, as Forza 4 is just around the corner, but it's going to have one hell of a hard time topping this masterful racer.. Bought the ultimate edition that includes all the DLC. Best bargain ever! I love this game for the longevity it has. I hear people complain about online, but I don't play online so for me it is brilliant. Very good game. 521 cars. Don't know how many tracks, super realistic. What's not to love?. 9.5/10 = Incredible = One of the best racing games on console, if not THE best. This game is better than any Gran Turismo game in my opinion.. I will start by saying i played,loved & put alot of time into the first 2 games.I especially enjoyed No 2,& played many online races as well as the career **** 'The Definitive racing game' (as the developers kept insisting on calling it),it most certainly isnt unfortunately.. i'll start on the good **** graphics are good(though only marginally improved on No 2),the tracks are great,with some fantastic new ones,& more of them,& a much welcome **** view..Theres more cars than before,with i think,an improved career mode,that tracks what kind of races you like,& car your driving,& offers you appropriate events.GREAT! but now onto the negatives.. Theres too many races in the career,that are one on one races,& they seem to repeat,& seems to last for what feels like an age.. It feels a real chore to **** music for the most part in the game,is not very good,forcing you to turn it off,or rely onthe 360's dash custom playlist,that is deeply flawed,by not letting you randomise the playlist,so your listening to the songs at the front of your playlist every new play session(very annoying).. The racing itself plays well,& you can play splitscreen against the CPU,& even form teams,which is sorely missing from GT5,as is the performance index for cars,but theres a major problem,or flaw with this game,& that is the Multiplayer.. As i said,i REALLY enjoyed that aspect in No 2,but Turn 10 has all but killed it in No 3!.. See for yourself,the lobbys for it are practically deserted.. How did they accomplish this feat in their self proclamed 'Definitive Racing Game'? They basically took away the ability to create or join a public race with custom rules & restrictions.Unless its a private race.GREAT,how many people out there can get races organised with people on their friends list? not alot.I certainly ****,its all matchmaking **** you have a very limited set of choices of the kind of race you want to race in,but THATS IT! You want to race against other people who arnt using auto braking? forget it,People using Braking lines? forget it,What track your going to race on? Nope.forget it.forget any kind of choice,or keeping the same crowd,but just changing any of the race details.I cant believe Turn 10 actually implimented this massively flawed system to the online part of this game.. If it wasnt for that MAJOR issue,this game would've got an easy 9 from me,& i suspect a better score from many others.Also because of that issue,the game has been grossly overated by the **** well,better luck with Forza 4.Fingers crossed... Growing up playing Mario Kart, I had some difficulty adjusting to Forza Motorsport when I first played the second in the series; but I'm so glad I spent the time to get to grips with it. Forza Motorsport 3 is a near perfect racing game. Each car is meticulously modelled to look and behave realistically; the sounds, the in-car view, the race courses are all stunning. The career is very deep; I've played nearly 60 hours and I'm nearing the end of my final, 6th racing season. There are over 100 events in which to compete to earn money, which you can then spend on cars, paint jobs and tuning set-ups from the storefront. There are some unbelievable car designs on the storefront, from police cars to Mass Effect 2 art-inspired designs. The game has been backed up with DLC too, all of which is included in the Ultimate Edition of the game. There are over 500 cars to choose from here, but beware if you don't have a hard drive, there is a hefty 1.3GB+ to install if you want to enjoy the full experience. The only downsides of this game are lack of dynamic weather and day/night conditions; perhaps this will be added in the next instalment.. This is the best racing game on the XBOX 360 and the second best racing game on a console. It is a sim racer, meaning it's true life. GT5 is the better sim racer and has better graphics (only on important cars), but that's where it stops. Customization, uploading, multiplayer, menus, lobbies, cars, mods... they're all better on Forza 3 and it makes for a better experience. Career mode is okay, but it's just simple series races of up to 5 races. I'd like more. I like season standings and competitive enemy drivers. Unfortunately the AI drivers in career never drive modded cars and it's easy to beat them until you get into R1 or maybe R2. I personally don't have a problem beating the computer at any time, on any difficulty, in anyclass. But it's still fun, just not as good as it should be. Multiplayer and customization is where it's at. It has THE best customization for cars in any game, ever. I won't go into detail, cause I could sit here and tell you more and more things. Mutiplayer is a blast and I like the Truskill ranking system. There are plenty of driver assists that can make even the worst driver, decent. If you like racing games and you have a 360, you HAVE to pick this up.. One of the best racing games available, might not look as good as Gran Turismo 5 but the single player mode in Forza 3 is easy to recommend over GT5's single player offering.. An incredibly well designed driving sim. Now I have never played any previous sims before but when i compare this to this to other racing games such as need for speed, they pale in comparison. One of my favorite parts about this game was how realistic the cars felt. When I rounded a corner my car would barely hold onto the tracks. To sum up absolutely outstanding racing sim.. Forza Motorsport 3 is by far the greatest driving simulator of all time, it surpasses Polyphony's Gran Turismo 5 in every aspect, this is considering Forza 3 is two years old. This is a highly polished title in terms of visuals, sound and playability. To add to the realism, the game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 frames per second. With it's adjustable difficulty, Forza Motorsport 3 is a must have title for casual and hardcore gamers alike, and with a lengthy career, along with a robust multiplayer, Forza 3 will keep you behind the drivers seat for months to come, or until Forza 4 hits the shelves.. LOL @ PS3 fanboys voting this game zero. :D :D I own both consoles and have played GT5 and this game extensively. It's not perfect and lags behind GT5 as far as night driving and weather effects are concerned but if Turn 10 watch the fan reaction to Gran Turismo 5 closely and learn from Polyphony's howling mistakes as far as user interface they'll clean up with Forza 4.. Rewind option is hands down the best racing game feature ever. So far I love the game. Music is mundane, but didn't buy it for the music. Graphics are great and loving the game so far. Love the braking assist. Hard mode is a little too hard and medium is a good setting, but I wish there was a between mode. Oh well. Fun racing game overall.. Best racer yet! Get a wheel for optimal experience. Online or single player, this game is just a joy! The inclusion of V8 Supercars is particularly favourable.. This game is still a very sizable upgrade from the previous title, but I also feel like it lost a little bit from Forza 2. The achievements are very linear and don't appeal very much to the completest nature of the second game in the series. I was looking forward to having absurd tasks like collecting every car and completing every time trial, but this game was built around the hand holding 'I win' button crowd. You play the game and hit buttons and you will get free gamerscore as long as you stick through the games linear plot. It lays out races before you and you can choose your own path, but if you aren't chosing the races they decide are involved in your season, then you are not advancing through the game. Upgrading can be robotic as clicking a button and letting the CPU feed you a list of parts that would be 'helpful' for your next race. If you do mess up in a race, you can hit a button and rewind to where you messed up and start over. While this is super great on a very long endurance race where your batteries die, someone gets in front the TV, etc, it just sums up the whole feeling this game has towards itself. Its very accessable. While I disagree with a lot of these choices, the fact is, this is how you design video games in 2010 and beyond. Anyone could have fun in this game as long as they have an intrest in cars or racing in general. For the hardcore enthusiast there is plenty to achieve with 100's of leaderboards, drift races and a huge amount of DLC content that comes with the Ultimate edition. This game is designed to **** up 100's of hours of your life and I for one will let it. I would really like see some of those super completist achievements and the ability to lock out the 'rewind' function totally by difficulty settings in Forza 4. This doesn't make sense when the game rewards you for setting everything to simulation settings and brutally hard AI for a better rewards, yet you still have the ability to rewind the game at any time. Of course its optional to use, but it simply shouldn't be there at all at the hardest level of playing. This is something they stole from ""Grid"" but didn't quite understand what to do with it. (ie: limit it). Still this is the best time consuming race game out there for me and with the Ultimate edition dirt cheap, its a no brainer to own it if you don't and even remotely love racing games.. You'll be hard pressed to find a better racing simulator on a console. The physics engine is superb and the ability to completely customise each area of the car is addictive to say the least. Beyond the ability to paint and customise the look of your car is the ability to change the actual drivetrain of every vehicle in the game from engines, to engine parts like valves, ****, and flywheels. The amount you can to is unrivaled. The visuals are stunning, while lacking the visual flair of games like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, you must keep in mind the game is running a physics engine 360 times every second which draws alot of resources. To be able to run that while still locking itself at a solid 60 frames per second is impressive. The career mode is LONG. You could play a new race every day for months and not be able to finish up. Re-playability is this games forte. With the Ultimate Collection edition of the game available, any racing fan should have this game if they hadn't already bought it.. Its pretty simple really. Forza is an amazing racing game with incredibly deep customization options. It has an excellent sim physics engine originally designed by Microsoft for auto insurance companies and the police to simulate driving conditions in accidents and to rate cars for insurance quotes. The engine is insanely complex and as far as sim racing games go it is top notch. Ive heard lots of people say it isnt on par with Gran Turismo which is beyond untrue. Anyone who has ever had any experience racing fast cars can tell you Forza is very accurate in the way cars perform. The simulation engine is complex enough to measure airflow around side skirts which is just unheard of in games. Everything matters, even tire tread depth from wear. If your vehicle gets damage and there is a dent on the bumper you can pull up vehicle telemetry and see how its effecting airflow and thus speed/handling. You wont find that in any other game. Forza may not be the prettiest racing game ever created. Its own developers admit to this fact. They have said from day 1 that the physics simulation is more important than just pretty graphics so most of the system resources are being put to use making sure cars drive like cars. That being said Forza 3 is no visual slouch and can easily hold its own with other games. It is by no means ugly. Currently its being compared on a visual level with Gran Turismo 5. Owning both games I can say neither game looks better than the other. For example GT5's premium cars(200 total) look better than Forza's cars. However the standard cars (of which there are 800) look worse than anything in Forza 3. Forza also has higher quality lighting and makes better use of HDR. It also has far better shadows than GT5 but GT5 has better smoke and particle effects. In terms of tracks that are about equal. If you are looking for an amazingly deep racing sim this is the game for you. If you are a casual fan this is still the gam","forza motorsport 3 is my first race game, usually i play this game because i have nostalgia and, it's really fun . the leveling mechanic is likely the best in the series, with many of the games features being worked on for its sequel . the game is a masterclass in refinement, polish, and sports simulation ."
166.Demon's Souls,"A great remake! The visuals are stunning and the atmosphere of the original game is perfectly recreated.. So at first Demon's Souls Graphics are absolutely insane. This Game looks SO good you won't believe it. But it just suffers so much from being old asf, like the enemy placement is ridiculous even for a souls game, you WILL fall of the map, morality system **** and isn't explained. And this Game has the Swamp of Sorrows.. Demon Souls crawled so Dark Souls could run. Disclaimer: I have not played the original version. The dna of a souls game is very much here, just in this first execution, it's not that great. I disliked the disconnected world areas. There were very few armor sets and not that many weapons. The alignment system was very underused and almost pointless. Not to mention you can't properly interact with the alignment system unless you pay and play online. Some of the levels were not designed very well and annoying to traverse (I think Upper Latria was the only place I was actually wowed by, so like 1 section of a total of 16 places). A prime complaint of mine is this feels like the only FromSoft souls game that required farming as you both have the capacity to have your levels removed from you, and the weapon upgrading essentially forces you to farm. I enjoyed that bosses all played fairly differently, but there were also a few too many gimmick boss fights in my opinion. That's a lot of complaints, but the game is still fun enough to play, has good art and design. And yes, the original came out before the existence of the rest of the FromSoft souls games, just now with this being a ""newer game"" as a remake, I'd rather play and recommend the other souls games before this one.. Played original a lot. This game is not just as good as the old one, it is better. I just love it. Easy just like Elden Ring and Sekiro. There is nothing to add. If you like Souls games, this game is for you.. It's funny but it has many bad things like the dodge is to stupid and bosses are super hard or super easy and in every meter there's 5 enim. Boss wise it’s the easiest souls game to start with but the regular enemies are a lot more challenging then they should be and you will probably spend a lot more then the actual bosses. The game balance is terrible, with the main character being too weak from the **** world view is dull and dark, there are no flashy techniques and the attacks are monotonous.When you die, you lose experience points and HP, and there are many other annoying features.. Visuals are great. You feel true next gen experience but distances between checkpoints are rediculus. Otherwise great game.. This game kicked my butt!!! It was my first ""Souls"" game, so this might taint my view because what I understand about this title is although it looks like a PS5 game it still is mechanically a PS3 game. So, it handles clunky and has odd level design and balancing problems with certain boss fights. I did beat the whole game- I'm not sure it was worth it. If you're nostalgic to this get it otherwise I think you're better off playing the newer titles.. It's great to have a remake that's young and accessible to young people. Sadly, there are also a lot of remakes that ruin a masterpiece along the way. In that sense, this piece is lucky. It's all about making good use of all of its strengths.. Hard as nails but never unfair. Looks pretty, so many gothic and dark fantasy environments that will awe you as they kill you. The hub world has its own secrets to uncover. The light-and-dark world mechanic can break the game if you're not careful. Still, this is a faithful remake and quality update of a classic that should satisfy genre fans while not being excluding to newcomers.. I loved the original Demon's Souls for PS3, it was the start of all Soulsborne games and it was genuinely groundbreaking at the time of its release. However it has since been surpassed by the likes of Dark Souls and Bloodborne. This is a very faithful remake, almost to a fault, and replaying the game all these years later I must say it's not as good as I remembered it. Still a solid game though!. Oh my god, I can't believe my eyes!!! Thank you so much Bluepoint Games for such a masterpiece. I have played through this masterpiece several times. I hope Bluepoint Games will make a remaster of Bloodborne.. A butchery. Apart from the challenging combat style, what defines the Souls games is their atmosphere. The designs, the music, the dying worlds, they all come together to set the games apart from the crowd. Demon's Souls is one of my favorite games of all time in this regard. The remake completely destroys the atmosphere of the original. Gone is the utilitarian Boletarian Palace, replaced with gothic Bloodborne-esque spires and tapestries galore. This repeats itself time and time again, with the Prison of Hope being the worst example. Almost all bosses and enemies have their looks changed, with so many having disgusting blisters and sores added to them. The iconic mocking grin of the Fat Official replaced with some grotesque blob. The Fool's Idol was turned into a grimacing witch, surrounded by a malevolent green glow, rather than a divine being enveloped in golden light that the original had (as a reminder people were supposed to worship this being). Color tones everywhere were changed, mostly to the overused orange and teal color palette. The iconic fluted armor set was essentially replaced by something that more closely resembles the DS3 knight set. The Prison of Hope, as mentioned before, is probably the most egregious example of all of these things. Mind Flayers lost their unique and creepy look, now simply looking like generic D&D Illithids. Gone is the buzzing sounds of insects, and the eerie sounds of bells in the distance. Replaced with the Royal Mistress singing return to slumber for whatever reason over the entire map instead of her previous 2 offputting notes when close. Gone are the cold brick walls and bars, replaced with ornate gothic stone and filigree. This makes a PRISON seem almost pleasant. It goes on and on and on. Bluepoint took the entire essence of the original and threw it right into the garbage, replacing the original vision with their own. It disrespects and ruins so many aspects of the source material. Play the original.. Why does a game has to be this hard is beyond me. I enjoyed Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, but this is a complete agony. I Wouldn't even recommend this game for those who hate themselves... 44hours played and still 0%.... This game was a nice surprise. I played all the other games, first Bloodbourne and Dark Souls that I loved, then the others that I enjoyed less and less (especially Elden Ring which felt like a bloated and unfocused mess). Well, Demon's Souls had many of those moments of challenge and great level design that made me love the genre in the first place + great atmosphere and beautiful art direction. And the story is actually understandable! The bosses does feel a bit simple, and the game can get too easy sometimes - but it was mostly a fun experience. After Dark Souls and Bloodbourne its the most enjoyable Soulsbourne I've played.. The OG game that gave birth to all the amazing Souls. The worlds, the art direction and the gameplay are really curated and well designed. I had so much fun, if you struggle a bit you need to take it east and watch some tutorials on YouTube. Definitely a PS5 must have.. Despite its reputation for being slow and difficult, I found this game to be very forgiving and open to various playing styles. It also has a lot of in-game creature comforts like rings for self-healing and increased souls pickup, making leveling and exploring a joy. Bluepoint's work on this title is pretty mindblowing, the game looks like an ultra-modern IP from a bleeding-edge studio, nothing is left to chance, every inch of the world looks polished yet not overdone. But it's also amazing to think that Bluepoint changed almost nothing in the underlying gameplay - From's original ideas are still here and hold up perfectly after all these years.. Amazing graphics and haptics, Gameplay is good and story is interesting. Have to say I found it better then Elden Ring.. This will tick some people off. Demon's Souls is the definition of mid. The art design and graphics are astounding and the setting is very interesting. The problem with Demon's Soul's is how frustrating the gameplay is, you can roll and dodge perfectly but you'll still get hit. The Souls series is notorious for being hard and it's cancerous fan base shuns anyone who dares criticize it, the fact is a game being difficult isn't amazing when it is unfairly difficult. I don't mind the challenge if the challenge is skewed to fit their formula. The World Tendency system is horrid and it punish new comers for no reason just because they were unaware. Also half health! Yeah no this is embarrassing to the soulsbourne series. This will tick some people off. Demon's Souls is the definition of mid.

It’s a must for souls like lovers. Good Level design, too hard sometimes. Very beautiful game but if you have never played a souls game before you might get frustrated in the beginning. I recommend some guide if this is your first souls because in the end this is actually quite a good game.. Other than a few minor nitpicks with design choice for enemies, and the yellow flags changing to red in the Tower of Latria area that shows the influence of The Old Monk, this remake is how all remakes should be handled. Focus on the story, lore, and gameplay first, and everything else will come along just fine. Graphically this is easily one of the best looking games on the PS5, and on all consoles of all time. If you’re looking for a great Souls experience then I highly recommend spending the money to play this absolute masterpiece! And you can only do it in the best place to play……The PlayStation 5!!!. The original Demon's Souls had a bleak and oppressive aesthetic that contributed to its unique atmosphere of desolation and mystery. The remake, while visually stunning, opts for a brighter, more detailed style, which dilutes the sense of darkness and hopelessness that was central to the original game.. Most garbage Platinum Trophy ever existed on any game with the character and world tendency BS. The 2nd play-through is a complete nightmare and you will get one-shot by almost everything.. It's a good game. It is an easy soul like game. There are many gimmics on Boss. Good picture quality. Bad thing is the respwan points are only ine in the map. Overall good games good combat not that hard. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The remake ****, the ps3 version is superior. Bluepoint ironically misses the point of the aesthetics of the original and makes it into a cartoony generic style that looks like warcraft. Also archstones are wrong and the fluted armor is ugly. I dont like the font either, too dull. Demon’s soulless. The most beautiful Sony exclusive to exist, tops Elden ring imo. Level design is peak and for a launch title, it was the standard for this generation when it came to exclusive titles. And it remains the best of the Sony games released this generation.. My personal favorite soulsgame. The graphics are amazing, the atmosphere is phenomenal and the bosses are fantastic.. An all-time low in video games. Take away the difficulty from this game and you've got nothing to like. Awful story, awful writing, poor character design, lousy graphics and music. This game was designed for people who play video games with their toes. They can't read books in real life. They don't have real challenge in real life. They've got squat in real life. But they defeated Demon's Souls' last boss while playing with their toes and without using swords and shields. Avoid this like the plague. One of the worst games in history.. A faithful remake, but I wish that more of the games original issues were sorted.. I never played a Souls Game before, so I was not a fanboy. Now I’m a fanboy. It’s just one Of the best games I ever played. Difficult but masterable. I really love it.. Demon's Souls is not so much a video game as a symptom of social degeneration, which the creators around FromSoft guru Miyazaki shamelessly capitalise on. The target audience for such a title is single men in their 20s to 40s without social, family or professional responsibilities. The kind of people who are springing up in the wealthy societies of our time and who invest all their time resources in gaming. Games such as Demon's Souls provide such people with a tool, a strategy of distinction, to boast about their apparent elitism on the internet - in my view a very questionable mechanism for regulating their self-image. The success can be explained on the one hand by the journalistic glorification of the title (often not present in the original game) and on the other hand by the fact that a product profile that primarily appeals to the Japanese ""bachelor culture"" also works on the international market. In this dynamism, both the industry and the print media vie for the favour of a lost generation whose opium is overcoming a pointless, artificial challenge.. That was my favorite PS5 game until I played Elden Ring. Now I can't play it anymore. It feels like a Demo, a 'Prototype' game.. Best souls like game i have played in my life Gameplay 8.510 Graphics 9.510 Sound Effects 1010 Overall evaluation - 9.3 This is exactly what a remake should look like.. The final piece of the soulsborne saga, re-imagined beautifully. The giant of giants whose shoulders they stand on.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The start of it all. 10/10 remake! Graphics, Sound Design, animation and combat are really solid. Highly recommended for fans of challenging games. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. I never played the original. I wanted to play it, but it aged so poorly on ps3 that it was unplayable to me at the time I tried it. I was introduced to souls games through Bloodborne. I must say this remake is gorgeous, Bluepoint is such a talented studio, Shadow of the Colosus was a great remake so I had no doubt they would make a faithfull remake of the first Souls game. And boy did the game not dissapoint. I had a lot of fun, only reason I don't give it a 10 is because I think that all the souls games that came after Demon Souls have been improoving in many aspects, and while playing Demon Souls I could still feel it was lacking in many things that current souls games just nail it. I know it might sound unfair, but it is what it is, and it's my personal experience. Still an amazing game and I recomend it 100%. Had never played one of these souls games before so decided to start with this one. Initially I couldn't get up the steps at the start of Boletaria without dying and was going to uninstall it then somehow everything just clicked and from that point on I couldn't stop playing it. Loved the grinding aspect of getting souls and leveling up as it always pays off. It looks amazing. The world's are all really unique and interesting though the swamp was a bit of a slog due to the slow mobility. The prison level was as good as any level in any game I've played. Bosses were interesting. Definitely more of a puzzle in figuring out how to defeat them than an actual brawl. The only real negative is what others have said in that the game doesn't care about your feelings as it spawns you back at the beginning . On some stages you have to go through the whole level again just to get back to the boss fight so being prepared is essential though it was possible to just run past some enemies and in others shortcuts are opened. Currently playing Elden Ring and although better designed and more refined I can't recommend this highly enough. Just be prepared for some rage inducing deaths.. This how a remake is suposed to be made. Plus it was made by another studio !? Hold that W. Thanks to both From software and Bluepoint for delivering us this masterpiece..

First off i wanna talk about the graphics and visual aesthetic which are out of this world. If bluepoint ever remakes bloodborne we'll be in for a treat! Secondly the optimization was just brilliantly done and it runs at a solid 60 fps with good resolution too. Now its not perfect by any means & isn't quite as good as bloodborne but it certainly has its own charms & if you own a PS5 you should play it at some point.. The second game of the company, which I managed to play and to put it mildly it broke me! A relentlessly awesome project, grandiosely recreated for the Playstation 5 architecture, capable of giving each player a completely different spectrum of emotions - from hate (and quite strong - I would rate it 9 out of 10 points) to love the game. Unfortunately, my strength was enough for only 1 full-fledged playthrough, which took me about 40 hours - and I clearly realize that true fans of the series have replayed this project several dozens of times, but for me it was a pristine exploration and journey - I say a huge thank you to the developers for the opportunity to touch it and move on.However, of course like any project in principle Demon's Souls has a number of advantages and disadvantages, I'll consider a few of the main ones and I'll probably start with the negative aspects of the series:- After playing Elden Ring how acute the inventory issue was! It's just something with something, such an inconvenient mechanic that definitely made not just talking about it in this section, but in general - pissed me off and made me really angry enough times during the course of the game- Next, I would highlight the basically outdated mechanics of the game in general - I wouldn't divide them into some or specific ones, I would emphasize the totality, and they didn't just hinder the walkthrough - they killed it by introducing unwavering difficulty where you simply don't expect it and where, literally, it shouldn't be.- Passing for knights and other mellish classes is one big minus! And Elden Ring was passed on platinum, so also for a knight without any questions, but this game did not just make me sweat and pump hastily into a magical character - the game just sizzled my nerves because of point 2! Magic didn't just make life easier - it saved it and gave new joyful emotions from the game - that's why I heartily recommend all newcomers to the series to start with this class!Probably, after 40 hours of play, these are all the main drawbacks that this game gave me - and I want to emphasize that I liked the game and carried me so much that I reached the final credits and ended my journey on a positive note for myself as a player!I will briefly talk about the main positive aspects:- The story - yes, for some it may not seem like a plus at all, but for me it's a big plus - because thanks to this methodology you start to learn more about the ENT of the game, watch various reviews and so on - thus getting involved in the game even more- Game mechanics in general - yes, despite the fact that it is indicated in the minuses of the game - the mechanics of Demon's Souls is the strongest side of the game, which along with the trials in the form of a plot gives a lot of positive emotions (but here you need to make an accent on the fact that as soon as you (as a player) pumped up to the level of at least some pleasure from the game - everything changes. The game starts to become a real work of art for you as a player- Music, graphics, content - all these aspects I will mercilessly combine into one point, but each of them individually brings a piece of something cool, complementing the world of the game and making it the work of art that it **** in all, these are the main thoughts that have come to my mind so far after 40 hours of playing the game - however, I'm sure they are enough to rate the game.. Hello guys, we made a game and we **** it up and we called it souls. If you don't like it, you're an idiot. Souls is the best kind of game in the world. Cause we'll steal hours of your time and take the fun out of it. And when you pass a chapter, you think you've won. But in fact, the only thing you've won is wasting your time. It is a nonsense that is exaggerated by social media, which is not even fun full of nonsense, and the player segment that is now 40 years old. It is nonsense made for souls fanboys who do not know how to enjoy life with psychological problems and do not understand fun. Waste of time.. A nearly perfect remake although it should have offered a mode that fixes some balancing bugs and a mode that does not. It tried a bit too hard to not stray from the original at all, to its slight detriment.. Only for nerds and souls like I dont like such kind of stuff If you have much time u can play this trash. Amazing game. This game is my favourite game ever, it just has everything that’s amazing. Graphics, combat, and a very simple but captivating storyline.. Never have I played a souls game with worse platforming. If this is a direct remake to the original, why keep the terrible platforming?Sliding off ledges that should be flat and not round? Losing your footing on a landing that’s not your fault? No thanks, crash bandicoot did the same ****, and I couldn’t care for that either. Miyazaki is a genuine moron sometimes.. Love the graphics smooth movement, but the some of the areas and bosses are just lame. If you liked Dark Souls, try Elden Ring or Bloodborne instead.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. naturally hard difficulty. the levels are harder than the bosses since there is no checkpoints, you just start at spawn over and over, can be rage-inducing. the bosses are varied, often puzzle-like mechanics, very satisfying once you win. the game's age shows in the janky mechanics. But for its time, easily a masterpiece and it still holds up very well in the remake. I played this after Elden Ring, so I had issues with the huge runbacks to the bosses.. This game is great I can’t lie about that. If you like souls games please play but I can’t help but just state the problems of it. The boss runbacks are dreadful. It’s too much to have to fight a difficult boss and also have a frustrating health depleting runback. Along with that this is going back to the original’s pet peeves but the grass system is frustrating having to switch grasses during a fight is more challenging than the fight itself. Also the destinations are good but one I think you’ll know if you’ve played is very stupid and not fun just painful but that’s kinda personal taste I suppose. Solid game would still play for even just the pretty graphics. Graphics bring it to an 8 but that’s only out of new game bias. It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. Between the graphics and the sound design, this is the first game I played that feels ""next-gen"". It's also just a good Souls game. I like the level design, and I like the bosses. The only thing that brings it down for me is the ""cheapness"". I have played most of the Souls games and this one has the most parts that feel like unfair traps. I might have to do a second runthrough now that I know the layout, maybe my opinion will change. But until then, it sits as the best looking Souls games and one of the most fun.. I'm a big fan of the Soulslike genre. But I haven't played Demon Souls on PS3. A remake is the perfect opportunity to fix that. This game is the progenitor of this genre. The graphics in the remake are excellent. Familiar atmosphere and gameplay. The bosses are very easy but there are many difficult enemies in the levels. Everything that is in Demon Souls is also in Dark Souls, nothing new except the trends of the worlds. An excellent opportunity for fans of the genre to get acquainted with the first game. For those who played on PS3, the opportunity to replay the game with new, excellent graphics.. A virtually ground up remake, this PS5 update looks great and confirms that Demon’s Souls still has arguably the most varied and interesting boss battles in the series. It does sometimes feel a little like a prototype for Dark Souls, which provided a far more intricate game world and added a number of other improvements (Bonfires to reduce repeating sections, healing items that automatically recharge upon death etc), but if you’re a fan of the FromSoftware formula this is still a really good game in its own right.. While dated, this is my second favorite souls game to come back to. A straightforward adventure that doesn’t overwhelm the player, while also giving them many things to do.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great souls game that defined the genre. Although the thoughness of oponents is maintained throughout the game. Level design and attention to details in this remaster is done exeptionally well.. This is a very impressive remake. I never played the original demon souls but from seeing side by side footage online, this version looks way better. I did not enjoy it as much as some other souls games, however I hesitate to blame fromsoft since this game did it all first. Some of the levels were a little dated in terms of design and some of the bosses were pretty meh.. Not bad, but it's made from the hard work and labor of a supernatural opponent named Henry. Very punishing, maybe the hardest compared to the other souls or soulslikes. Furthermore, it has archaic level design and most of the designs and choices in the game are very dated. But this is logical, this game is the ""father"" of this genre and FromSoftware created a legacy, a trend, a genre, maybe the most important action rpgs in gaming industry. And it all started with this one. BluePoint made an excellent job remaking this but this is as far as it goes. Great graphics and nothing else.. Its way too hard and i cannot recomended to anyone, even to souls fans. Unless, you want to cheese the game with guides, which, in this case, becomes really enjoyful The only problem is the non existence of checkpoints(bonfires) in levels and the 50%(or75%) hp in phantom(death) mode.. This is a great gateway into the fromsoft formula. I had played Sekiro before this but this was my first run at a more classic souls-style(medieval setting with people stuck in a loop of death and revival governed by tough/gimmicky bosses). Graphics and soundtrack are phenomenal, and the game feels pretty good to play. Though the game feels good, there's no mistake it's an early version of the souls-formula and is generally a bit more stiff than later titles.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A good example of ""how to do a remake"". If we compare it with the Dark Souls remaster, we can realy feel all the differences between two ""old"" games. While the mentioned remaster is a revisit of the original game, with all its pros and cons, the remake of Demon's Souls feels like a completely new game, in harmony with the new generation.. An amazing, solid remakeof an old classic. It’s still Demon’s Souls, however, so it isn’t as good as other titles, but it is still amazing. The graphics, performance and sound are all top-notch.. Beautiful game, but the gameplay and systems are much worse than later games. Dark Souls 1 perfected what this game started.. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. Good solid game! Not the most fun FromSoftware game ever made, but is still worth playing!. A phenomenal remake!. One of my favorite games hands down. Great. Was my souls like game and had been an amazing experience. There are so cool fight against bosses.. Absolutely amazing remake of the original. I love the original, and I love this one even more!. It's an old game with outdated gameplay that has been given a new coat of paint. What's the point of remaking a game if you are going to keep everything that belongs to the past and was removed from subsequent From Software games? It all makes for not so fun experience. Lack of bonfires or any checkpoints means that if you die you have to run entire level once more and kill all the minions once again. You can't just run past them because this game is full of narrow hallways with enemies standing right in the middle and your sword hitting a wall instead of an enemy. It quickly becomes tedious and encourages conservative approach to save time. If you used all of your health items (grass) and didn't manage to kill a boss, you have to farm them somewhere else because they don't regenerate after death. Collecting materials for upgrading your weapons is grindy as well. Most of the bosses are gimmicky and have one weakness that you have to discover and use against them. One of the later bosses delevels you if he grabs you. The first time I fought him I lost four levels. Yeah, that appears to be the message of early From Software: gaming should be pain, not fun. And this game mostly stays true to that principle. It even has a hilarious bug that if you invade someone else's game and they disconnect you may stay as a phantom in their world. If you then touch an archstone you inherit their world progress and lose your own. That's a gamebreaking bug that they did not fix three years since r","""demon's souls"" is a remake of the original game . the graphics are stunning and the atmosphere of the original is perfectly recreated . the game suffers from being old asf, like the enemy placement is ridiculous even for a souls game ."
167.Street Fighter 6,"Street fighter 6 is a nearly perfect game. from gameplay to accessibility to performance, Street fighter 6 continue to exceed my expectations over and over again. I've spent almost as much time playing this game as I have playing elden ring. If not for some strange monetization choices this game would definitely be a 10 out of 10. Both casual and hardcore fans should be able to find plenty to like I strongly recommend Street fighter 6.. Capcom at again. Awful season pass method first 2 characters come out 2 months apart the rest of season you have to wait months for. Ass single player would of wished for a bigger roster than what was given.hardly any costumes for any character. The game is boring to watch compared to street fighter 4 and 5. Pandering to stakeholders with a battle pass to revenue money and appeal to no one.. As an old gamer, I hate the modern style. I hate it. The modern style has eliminated the fun of fighting games where you spend thousands of hours or more practicing. Nevertheless, this is a very good piece of work.. Street Fighter 6 delivers a revitalized experience for both veterans and newcomers to the series, introducing significant updates to its mechanics, visuals, and modes. The game successfully blends the classic Street Fighter style with modern touches, offering more accessibility while preserving its competitive edge. The game's controls are more forgiving than in previous entries, thanks to an improved Modern Control scheme. This gives new players easier access to combos and special moves, without sacrificing depth for seasoned fighters. That said, the traditional control scheme is still available for long-time fans who prefer the classic method​. The character roster is extensive, with a mix of returning favorites such as Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li, and new fighters like Kimberly and Luke, who have been featured in recent Street Fighter lore. The game’s balance between the old and the new ensures that both legacy fans and fresh players have exciting options to explore​. Visually, Street Fighter 6 impresses with its modern, vibrant aesthetic. The character models are detailed, with expressive animations that make each fighter feel unique. The stages are dynamic and interactive, with a variety of locations around the world, each with its theme and feel. Additionally, the game’s use of improved engine results in smoother animations and improved overall graphics​. Street Fighter 6 is a thrilling entry in the franchise that brings something for everyone, from casual players to competitive enthusiasts. With its accessible controls, new mechanics, rich modes, and impressive visuals, it’s poised to continue the legacy of one of the greatest fighting game franchises of all time.. Amazing game but the game is missing a lot of content such as dramatic battle, puzzle fighter mode or rpg mode and characters.. The fighting game is complete on its own, but it also comes with a single-player action game.. This is game is surprisingly hella fun and highly recommend playing this fighting game. Game is fun, but OST is so disappointing! Characters classic themes are missing!!! Neither a rearrangement :(. Easy to play and learn. Needs more characters and more content such as dramatic battle. YT: @Federock Great game. One of the best fighting games you can ever play. Easy, addicting, entertaining, challenging, and annoying. Yes.... The fighting game of the year. So much content and life of the game outside the ranked match is so great. GG Capcom. This would be a near perfect fighting game if the input system was not miserable. As an experienced tournament level fighting game player, the inputs are unnecessarily difficult. This not only detracts from aspects of the game that should actually matter such as playing neutral, but also makes the game unaccessible and frustrating for less experienced players.. Excellent game I could say last fighting game I played was mk trilogy back in the days and this game make come back. I played Guile and I'm obsessed to master it.. Its a great fighting game. Roster is good, with varied archetypes and styles. The drive system is good but, bar feels underutilized, it could have another use rather than just supers. Combos are short and fun. Netcode is excellent, but not the best one i have seen. As a fighting game it is an 8 maybe 9, but the absolutely atrocious despicable and just plain shameful monetization for a 70$ GAME makes me wanna kms. Tekken 8 is good but Street Fighter 6 is way better in terms of gameplay. Forget mk1 it ****, sf6 will last stronger than the 2.. I've been playing Street Fighter since the first one in my local bowling alley's arcade. This has quickly become one of my favorites of all time. Only real complaint is the cost of costumes, and the low number of dlc characters coming out each year.. This has been my favorite Street Fighter game since 3rd strike! It took a little while to learn the drive system as a whole but, I love this game. I have it on all platforms and sooooo many hours in. The World Tour mode is quite refreshing and really gives us the ability to make the best fighter we see fit. The Battle Hub is great too. Give you that arcade feel. I spend most of my time in casual/ranked. Akuma is the main btw! Looking forward to all the content this game will have throughout the years.. Overall, it is a very good fighting game. It allows player to learn new mechanics even for those who never play this genre before. However the balancing is not as good.. There are too few characters. The new characters are not appealing. The additional characters are too expensive. The World Tour mode is boring and just an errand.. The game is fun and flashy but unfortunately the new game mechanics are designed to artificially narrow the gap between good players and newbies. Great to start with if you're not used to the genre but frustrating and volatile on a competitive level. First of all, the campaign/world tour mode is probably the strongest part of this game. The online service is pretty awful but it has been improving with time it seems. Would I recommend this? If it’s on sale, yes. It’s a fun party game but that’s all it is in my opinion.. Trash. Monetized to a state where all the fun is wrung from the game like a dishcloth. Enjoy waiting 5-6 years and spending (at the bare minimum) 3x the base game's price for a full game and roster. Garbage. Absolute garbage.. Overall, a pretty good game that could have been great with a few adjustments. First of all, making you sign into a Capcom account every time you turn the game on is annoying and breaks the immersion. Secondly, having players unavailable right off the bat because you didn't buy the ""Deluxe"" version was off-putting. Lastly, the idea of a story mode is great, but is a bit grindy and tedious. You essentially need to fight every person you encounter on the street as you're going from point A to B throughout the entire playthrough in order to be leveled up enough to get through the late part of the game. That is why I will not end up finishing the game. I could either walk around and fight everyone I see for eight hours straight to level up or just move on with my life. I will continue to play arcade mode and online. Probably will not buy any DLC unless they give a lot more characters. I liked the way the old games (and Nintendo in Smash Bros) allows you earn the new characters.. This is a very interesting game, but at the same time a terrible game of stress. I am weak. But it is interesting.. The Modern System is a miracle that brought veteran gamers like me back to fighting games.. I was very pleased with the game, the story mode is long and fun and I thought the combat was better than the previous game. They definitely took everything wrong in SF5 and fixed it here!. Its a terrible game, isn’t fun at all Characters are bad The world tour is way too overrated the guys you’re fighting against are horrible they are lvl 50 and you are 65 they hit you 2 times and its over. Way too overpriced terrible game.. An absolute predatory garbage game. Horrible practices like overpriced microtransactions and sellout cheap crossover content. On top of those horrible practices almost every other feature that is vital to making a game good had gone downhill in the game since launch. This game is just another one of many other modern FG that has exposed how shallow, exploitive, and just plain awful it really is after the initial honeymoon phase. There is no different character playstyles, player expression, or true skill involved anymore. Just braindead mashing, unskilled 50/50 guessing constantly, boring overly long way too powerful corner carry combos, and aggressive overbearing BS system mechanics that make every characters diverse move-set useless. These things make the whole game feel the same and cheap like a player did not earn their win through skill at all. This caters to casuals and people that don't give a **** about competitive FG. Capcom and the devs have shown their awful true colors like most other modern FG and their company's behind them. They have all shown the awful state FG are in today compared to what FG used to be. The supposed ""new era"" of FG is an absolute joke and this game is a prime example of that. It all makes the future of FG look like garbage.. Ugly characters. The fun is not there. Capcom is just getting woke, it's the start of the end for them. It's time to short the stock.. Street digger 6 is one of the best games in the series, the controls are very fun, there’s modern controls for new players while experienced players can use classic controls, the roster is great and the graphics are good as well. A fantastic start for anybody who wants to get into the Street Fighter franchise. Flashy moves and fun combos make for an enjoyable time. My biggest complaint when playing this game is that classic control users cannot differentiate their matchmaking from modern control users. The characters in the game are cool and all however whenever I match against a modern player, I want to quit just because it’s so annoying how it lacks skill to play and basically be the same skill level as someone who might have played the game for much longer. Modern is a great addition don’t get me wrong but they should have separations between them to only have modern control users play against other modern control users and vice versa.. Ok, World Tour is just copy/paste Mortal Kombat's Konquest mode. I didn't care enough to finish it. Other than that, the game has nothing to offer to you, other than... fun! And that is quite important i dare say. Barebones, yes... but you can cook up quite a broth with these bones, so... cool.. Haven’t playd street fighter since 2 but for m to be renentering the street fighter franchise I’ve been having so much fun with this one at the momen I play offline on hardest difficulty but I will soon be hopping online to farther my skills. Sf6 is a great game. When I first heard about modern controls I was very scared but they somehow made it so balanced. The 20 percent less damage for auto specials doesn’t make it feel like your throwing pillows at the opponent but its also not so little that people on classic feel like they are getting with a semi truck. You can still also perform the regular motion inputs for special moves on modern and when you play modern you lose access to some of your kit to if you play on modern. Btw this is coming from a person who has a classic Ken in plat 5 and a modern Luke in diamond 2 Maximillian dood said it best the people who are complaining about modern are the people hardstuck in silver. The only reason it is not a 10/10 I think world tour could’ve had a little more effort. Highly recommend this game even if you are not a fighting game veterans= still so fun.. It has all the good things that we had in USF4 and SFIII with modern graphics and an excellent netcode. The story mode is just an addition that is cool for a few hours. It is not the best thing I have played, but it helps you to shape your own avatar and to learn how to use new specials.. Awesome game. Insane netcode and cool looking characters. An insanely big step up from SFV which was a god awful game.. This game is everything you want in a fighting game,It takes its fresh new battle system and online battle hub to make it where you can never be bored.This game is just amazing. Street Fighter 6 impresses with its visuals, diverse character roster, and refined gameplay. The stunning graphics, expanded character lineup, and improved mechanics create an engaging experience that caters to both longtime fans and newcomers.. Awesome game for the most Important franchise in genre. Delicious gameplay and graphics.. Unlike many I'm not having too many problems with the inputs on PC but I'm getting way more on the PS5. Sometimes it feels like the game is trying to play itself but if you use a wireless instead of a wired DualSense (no joke it has less input lag) you won't feel it as much. However, the game is still fun and I'm having a blast even though it feels a bit ""slow"" and I don't really like some of the design choices. I might switch to Tekken 8 when I get my hands on it since I've never had problems with the inputs in Tekken 7 (only problems with the netcode) and I like to be competitive in these more popular FGs. I'll still chill and mess around on other FGs like GBVSR and MK1 tho.. Street Fighter 6 is by far the best new gen fighting game. I especially liked the intro sequence animations of characters. The game has a lot of content that will make gamers busy for hundreds of hours.. One of the best fighting games for beginers and experts. World tour mode teaches the basics of the game in a really fun way. Modern controls can help begginers get into the game. The mechanics of the game are super fun and complex. The battlehub is super cool. I just love this game.. This is mainly a multiplayer game. The adventure mode is average and the only reason to play single player modes is to get better at the online game. But the online game is fantastic. Rarely any issues, plenty of players to play and in ranked mode you generally only play equivalent skill players, so its usually a fairly level playing field. Modern mode adds also an entry way into fighting for beginners. I am 200 hours in and have only played a quarter of the characters. Yes the roster is not the biggest but each characters depth is insane. Game of the year for me.. Great smooth graphics..... BUT Really poor character choice with no charisma. Really poor arcade mode and story mode. Obviously too much effort was placed on the adventure mode and online mode but this is so much worse than SF5. Thank godI didn't pay £100 for this. No character unlocks too. WTH. All the charms of SF2 have gone, leaving this boring game with emphasis on 'camp' characters.. this game is masterpiece i love it this game is masterpiece i love itthis game is masterpiece i love itthis game is masterpiece i love itthis game is masterpiece i love it. The ps4 version needs help. The arcade mode is bad The roster is underwhelming the main boss is garbage I got this game for my birthday in August and I haven't touched it since the dlc choices are a joke Akuma should be in game and my worst pick is the godawful music who is making this decisions in capcom I will not be getting street fighter 7. Fix the damn arcade mode give us something damn it and why is the dlc dates so far off this game needs help it's like they looked at the metascore and was like we did great the user score never lies capcom id rather play street fighter 5 atleast the arcade mode is awesome fix this**** capcom. The most beautiful fighting game on ps5. Hands down. Fun to play,enjoyable to watch.. **** very challenging. The best. A fantastic entry in the serie. You like fighting games ? This is THE fighting game. He have all you need. Great gameplay, cool solo contents, perfect online mode, a good roster and the game is very welcoming for new players and pro. Seriously, Capcom really put the bar very high right here. One of the best game of the year, easily.. Almost the perfect fighting game, fantastic competitive experience, easy controls that attempt to remedy the 'if you're not a sf player you're not an sf player,' and good single player experiences. The world tour mode may not be what many wanted, but it still has an arcade mode at least. The good outweighs the bad if we're looking at only the base game, so no microtransactions, then it sits at a 9.5/10(it rounds up).. Capcom applied Denuvo to the PC game, because piracy is a crime. But... It makes the World Tour difficult to get the characters' classic clothes, or you pay real money to unlock them. A terrible lag in World Tour, the same problem in Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite. Every time I'm doing a mission, NPCs keep appearing to fight. You run, but they catch you. The fight is over, more is coming at the same time, I can't progress like this. Complicated, Capcom, wanting us to be honest if you aren't.. Single player is solid, the graphics are top notch, the music is one of the best recent soundtracks, and the game is very polished. I think the low amount of characters from the word go is a bit of an issue, and not being able to search for opponents of similar experience in online lobbies are massive detracting factors that take away from the game. Edit: Dropped down 2 points due to their lackluster collaborations. Mortal Kombat has no issues getting guest characters. Injustice had no issues getting guest characters. Soul Calibur had no issues getting guest characters. Freaking Granblue Fantasy Versus has no issues getting 2B. But Street Fighter has the nerve to overcharge for $15 for skins, and not even give us guest characters? Yes, I am upset that the Spy X Family collab is limited to just skins and icons, and they've already fooled their fanbase twice. Next collab better feature an actual legitimate guest character.. Good game, but with few chars. This was my first Street Fighter game and I really enjoyed it. It is a very fun experience. My only complaint is the roster since I don't have an actual main. I don't feel attached with any of them unlike with games like MK or Tekken so maybe I'll wait for DLC to see if I find my main. The best fighter game in 2023. by far the second-best fighting videogame franchise of all time and imao top-tier game of the year candidate!. What a great fighting game, the game is absolutly dripping with style, with gameplay that is a proper evolution of the street fighter formula, with expert design work. The story mode is also just a fun time, it's not deep but it is very fun. Unfortunately however their is 1 thing that keeps this from being a perfect street fighter game and that is the roster, not only is 20 character a pretty poor number for a modern fighting game but having the majority of the roster be street fighter 2 characters is really lame, only 1 character from sf4 and none from sf5, the roster is street fighter 2 featuring some new characters and Juri.. Best Streetfighter game , didnt like the rush mechanics kinda frustrating Lack of original characters variety. The only game I regret buying. In short, this is a game for Street Fighter fans, so it is unlikely that it will appeal to newcomers, especially those like me who wants to have fun playing the game and enjoy it. I got nothing. Everyone who has played, knows that the main menu of the game (by the way, I praise it because it is really beautiful, original and simple) is divided into three parts. The first is ""World Tour"", to be honest I expected the map to be bigger than my stingy uncle's pocket, but this is far from the biggest problem in this mode. Here! Simply! Very! Boring! Characters who are supposed to inspire or evoke different emotions are just wax figures who don't even always open their mouths during their phrases (by the way, there is no voice acting in the gameplay, so take your glasses, because you will have to read white text in the game of 2023). Rewards are terrible and not worth the time and nerves. Barely enduring this story, I went to the second menu section ""Battle Hub"". This is the most ordinary room with players who can run around, play in the classic mode, ""Extreme Battle"", ""Avatar Battle"" and tournaments that do not take place every day and for the first 2 months did not exist in the game at all. For trophies, i've played it a few times and it's just unbalanced crap! Players of the rank - ""Bronze"", ""Iron"" and ""Rookie"" in the first rounds face professionals such as ""Platinum"" and ""Master"", it is completely unfair to the newbies! Of course, there were tournaments for the same ranks, but where are they now? Why do mice have to fight tigers and dragons? In other words, it's just game suicide. I checked all the tournaments in which I participated and of course all pairs of participants! Instead of a ""Master""/""Master"" battle, I always saw ""Iron""/""Master"", ""Rokie""/""Diamond"" etc. Well, the last section in the menu is ""Fighting Grounds"". Believe it or not, everything here is the same as in ""Battle Hub"" except for unfair tournaments. In addition, here you can find: ""Training"", ""Combo Trials"", ""Character Guide"", ""Arcade"" and multiplayer, where after 10 battles you get the ranks that were written about above. If you like to wait for an opponent for a hell of a time, and then after victory they can run away like the last rats, then this mode is for you. That's all! I tried everything, even got every possible prize that is in the game. You ask me why I bothered playing this game? Maybe just a masochist who evaluates the game only after absolute completion. Summarizing all of the above, we can conclude that if you are an average player, you will not spend a lot of time in the game, especially since there is practically nothing to do in it.. My favourite ever fighting game which brings back fond memories from 30 years ago playing Streetfighter 2 on my SNES.. street fighter six is the best game ever made material.. especially fighting game. the polish of this game is on another level for the genre of fighting games. The plethora of content single player and multiplayer and the deep mechanics are all there. World tour is a mode that has a surprisingly deep RPG system in the context of strengthen your avatar for the ala souls pvp fights on battle hub. The story ending may not be its strong point but the discovery of masters through beautiful art (amazing cutscenes),and rich lore environment, make this a great place for long time sf fans. I enjoyed every minute of it.. Street Fighter 6 on PlayStation 5 is a knockout experience that takes the iconic fighting franchise to new heights. The graphics are jaw-dropping, harnessing the full potential of the PS5's hardware to deliver stunning visuals and smooth gameplay. The roster is diverse and well-balanced, offering both classic favorites and fresh **** fighting mechanics are as tight as ever, providing a satisfying blend of accessibility for newcomers and depth for seasoned veterans. The online multiplayer experience is seamless, allowing for intense battles against players worldwide. Street Fighter 6 on PS5 is a must-play for fighting game enthusiasts, combining the nostalgia of the series with cutting-edge technology for an exhilarating gaming experience.. Street Fighter 6 is amazing. This is a much better entry than SF5 was. New characters are introduced and you can even see originals still around. There is World Tour Mode, an Online gathering spot which I haven’t tried due to no internet connection where I’m currently at, and a normal 2 round match mode where you fight 2 rounds against fighters you know and love. The World Tour as my favorite because you get to create your own character and travel around the world. The fighters you come across are your masters and have a level rank with them. You can learn their moves and supers if you train hard enough bough with each. Don’t fret though if you have a style you like and can’t part with it you can transfer those experience points to a master who needs it and level them up as well. It’s like one big Street Fighter RPG which I absolutely love. As you know I love all kinds of RPG’s and have a special place in my heart for RPG fighters such as this. It all started back on Nintendo 64 with a game called Flying Dragon, but that’s another story for another day. You follow the story by doing missions in the starting city. You find out that’s the same city from Final Fight where they have a memorial to Haggar the Mayor who helped fight to rid the city of gangs and hoodlums. It would make sense, fighting is in these peoples DNA so you can literally fight everyone you see on the street from big buff dudes to old ladies. It’s kind of funny but it works very well with THIS particular city. More areas unlock later on. It’s interesting how the characters are introduced in the story. I haven’t fully seen everything the story has to offer but I’m in my 70’s when it comes to levels. The story mode kind of keeps going. I did play a normal match and it appears for Ryu the new character Luke is the last boss. He’s the featured character on the game so him being the next up and coming guy it’s natural he’d be looking for the legend Ryu. Anyway I don’t want to say much else. The game is what you’d expect from a Street fighter game. Characters are stylish, handsome and lovely respectively. Beautiful visuals that are a pleasure to see. My only gripe about the game was while it was downloading Capcom seems to think I want to see the beginning intro movie all the time with the very feminine male character hosting the fighting event. I mean it’s different but I’d rather not see it more than once. Also I was surprised to see the lack of characters in the story and world tour mode. Other than that I have no complaints about it and I’m sure you’ll love it. SF6 it’s. 9 out of 10 for me. Almost perfect. Happy gaming and enjoy my friends!. An amazing fighting game! Much improved than Street Fighter 5. Highly recommend it!!!. Good gameplay, good netcode and plenty single player content even though not very good. One of the best fighting games out right now.. Celebrating it´s 25th Anniversary, Street Fighter 6 still manages to deliver something new after all those year. With it´s great visuals, tremendously fun to play mechanics, flawless balance and interesting new characters, there is plenty to discover - even if you a veteran to the series.. Good game but gets boring fast.. OVERRATED!!!! average game with terrible RPG mechanics that were unnecessary.. This is the best street fighter game ever **** satisfaction of making a comeback against an opponent after working out their strategy is unparalleled. If you are a fighting game fan, picking this up is a no brainer.. Pros: A lot of content for single players. Word Tour mode alone takes over 100 hours if you want to unlock everything. Combat system, art style, soundtrack top. Battlehub avatar battles are innovative and fun. Cons: Annoying character JP, online battles not always stable, tournaments much too low frequency. Overall:By far the best SF of all time!. The best fighting game you can play. Capcom are just too good.. Maybe the best fighting game I ever played. Just need some more characters like Sagat heheh.. Street Fight 6 is a game that even non-fighting game fans can find enjoyable. While I may not be the best at fighting games, I still had a blast playing this one. My focus for this review is on the World Tour mode, which offers an entertaining albeit campy story. It takes us on a journey through Metro City and other parts of the world like London, though the locations outside of Metro City are not as expansive. Despite that, the World Tour mode adds a fun element to the game and is definitely worth exploring. The graphics in Street Fight 6 are pretty solid, capturing the essence of the Street Fighter series. While they may not be groundbreaking, fans of the franchise will appreciate the familiar visual style. One major highlight of the game is its extensive roster, featuring both current and upcoming characters through the season pass. This adds a significant amount of variety and excitement to the gameplay experience. In conclusion, Street Fight 6 is a fun and enjoyable game, even for those who aren't typically fans of fighting games. The World Tour mode offers an entertaining story, and while the graphics may not be groundbreaking, they still capture the essence of the Street Fighter series. The diverse roster of characters, both current and upcoming, adds a great deal of value to the game. Overall, it's definitely worth checking out for fans and newcomers alike.. tt hs a lot of potential but the leveling up on story mode is pretty boring. Absolutely love this game, if you complain about modern controls, you're just a gatekeeping crybaby. I don't use them, but they're amazing for getting more players. I don't get why you guys don't want new players, do you want the game to die or something?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game play. SCUMBAG microtransactions. No content to keep casual players coming back.. As an avid mortal kombat fan, I am surprised how good this is and absolutely love it. There is lots of single player contents and detailed tutorials for learning combos and character strategies. But the most interesting part for me was I didn't expect it to be this casual friendly. I always had issue with mechanics and combo executions in street fighter games but both are solved thanks to in-depth tutorials and modern controls which is a fantastic design decision to welcome new players. And for ppl who hate modern controls I'm just wondering why they don't switch from classic to modern. Enjoy the game. Don't be gatekeeper. Cheers.. All the negative reviews are absolute rubbish! Everything they say is the complete opposite of the truth. This game is so worth it.. It's a game from the Stone Age. I haven't seen any development other than the graphics, and now all the focus is on the sexual side of the characters. It's far from being a competitor to the Mortal Kombat series.. I purchased this game based on the high critic scores, but I wish I would have paid more attention to user reviews. Here's some pros and cons: Pros: 1. The graphics look very good on PS5 and have the same vibrant, fun and colourful look of previous SF games. 2. The open world is good for what it is, especially for a fighting game and Capcom needs to be commended for this. Cons: 1. Learning curves are pretty much now pointless since it offers no advantages for mastering skills since newbies can button mash there way to a victory. Akin to a pub fighter beating up a kung fu master. 2. The fluidity and smoothness of previous games is gone. The fighting is sluggish and often feels like you're playing underwater. 3. The game has no edge and has none of the fun over-the-top scenes. Characters are extremely vanilla and bland. 4. The host Eternity is cringe, corny and repugnant to look at. Obviously included to tick some checkbox as is the removal of male and female identities. For this reason I wouldn't recommend this game to people who still hold traditional (i.e. normal) values.. Too few characters and too much character design. World Tour mode is a pain to move around and the enemies are too hard. DLC characters are too expensive. And many of them are characters that were in the previous games.. the game run smooth but the combat is just re-hach the new characters feels odd the online play is weak. Street Fighter 6 had one of the best launches in fighting game history and two months later the game still surprises me with its quality. I have been playing fighting games since I was 9 and I've always struggled to find a fighting game that maintained my interest playing online and with Street Fighter 6 I'","street fighter 6 delivers a revitalized experience for both veterans and newcomers to the series, introducing significant updates to its mechanics, visuals, and modes . the game’s controls are more forgiving than in previous entries, thanks to an improved Modern Control scheme . visually, Street Fighter 6 impresses with its modern, vibrant aesthetic ."
168.Undertale,"Undertale is a masterpiece of storytelling and design. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the plot is engaging and heartfelt, and the way your actions influence the story and its consequences is brilliantly executed. It’s an unforgettable experience that rewards players for their choices and creativity.. Coll game, nice dialoges nica caracteres and hustory good gameplay this game is a masterpeace. Great story. Good gameplay. Charming world & characters that delivers a hopeful ending (as least for pacifists).. This is one of the best examples of a perfect game. It's a masterpiece in storytelling, world building, characters, music and gameplay. Behind this simple and retro-looking game lies the most beautiful and unforgettable experience. If you wish to enjoy the most of it, play it completely blind, you won't ever regret it.. By far the best game in the world, I don't even need to comment, I could never catch the depth of the story in another game.. One of the best indies of all time, it has an amazing story, probably top 5 ost of all time, a combat which i really liked, and amazing characthers.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Honestly, the game is perfect, and I do not say this easily. It does not try to have everything (like many games do now), but everything it has is perfectly made. Only reccomandation is: try to avoid spoilers and enjoy, really enjoy, what the game offers. Its a GREAT GAME SO GOOD STORY but if you have played everything in every way it just gets boring.. Do not get all the praise for this game. Sure, original story and concept, but the game is just not fun to play. The ""combat"" is tedious and I have zero desire to replay for alternate endings. A youtube video that summarizes the story is a superior experience.. MUST HAVE!!! The best game ever. Even for those who are not interested in games for those who like difficulties on the way for those who like masterpiece story and for those who like games with variety of endingsUnreal experience unreal emotions and super hidden memories for life.. BEST GAME EVER, BEST STORY, BEST MUSICS AND BEST CHARACTERS BRUVWHAT COULD I ASK FOR. amazing story amazing characters amazing ost overall a masterpiece Go play it. A very unique game. Unique gameplay. Amazing and memorable characters. Amazing music. Amazing story and narrative. Very funny and crazy sometimes! I loved it!. First of all, it is necessary to determine which unity Undertale addresses in the video game industry. Years ago, Dost Kayaoğlu said in his review of this game that the game appeals to a special audience. It is obvious that this diagnosis is made with the idea of ​​​​players of multiplayer games, and in this respect, it is valid. However, while Undertale is drawing a route for itself, its effort to avoid the complicated as much as possible is included in this route. This means that it makes a general speech by approaching the levels of the game's sections to the simple. It should be considered together with the fact that Undertale addresses a special unity, that Undertale consists of a composition of species. Otherwise, there are not even complex outlines in the narrative, gameplay, and design. For example, the main subject in the scenario was the war between humans and monsters. Frisk represented all of humanity. A reasonable representation of humanity can only be made with partnerships. Thus, Undertale presents the simple and uncommon main character in this way. Long-term analyses can be made on the scenario, I think that doing so will not contribute to the understanding of the game. Because what the game conveys to the player is a very entertaining presentation of the struggle of the two communities. When he wanted to impose thoughts, he did it by using the characters' mouths. When I move on to the design, here, the people who made the game can be praised one after another, because this is the one that provides the greatest assistance to the other elements. Also, even when tried to be considered on its own, there can be an aesthetic side. I think the reason for this is that pixel errors create an image that allows it to be read as a suitable part of a whole. For example, let's talk about the characters, take a closer look at the design of Frisk's or Sans' bodies. This is a huge mistake for art creation authorities who progress with the ideology of photorealism. Thus, it is also understandable why Undertale is called Undertale. Due to this preference, pixel errors (I say pixel errors because I mean that game engines can easily provide smoothness in this age, otherwise we cannot think the same way for Final Fantasy VI) stop being a defect and contribute to this tale. I've talked about it so much, let me talk about the tale a little bit. Undertale can be described as a wonderful union of modern fairy tales and video games. When thinking about Undertale, we should not forget this. Toby Fox must have been aware of what he was doing, he made the formula of the game the same as the formula of a fairy tale. For example, Frisk had to face King Asgore against the rules brought by the drama in the scenario - of course he could not go against it. He used the power of the fairy tale against the question of ""Where did this come from?"" to create extraordinary scenes in the game. We can give all the scenes where Mettaton is present as an example. This can be called the power of the modern fairy tale. Aesop's fables are not open to extraordinary moments, whereas phantasma is constantly found in these fables. Undertale, on the other hand, is a work built on a formula and constantly trying to destroy this formula.. This is probably the most important video game ever made. It transcends the genre, and becomes a piece of universal media like The Godfather or Shakespeare. Even if that sounds ridiculous, this game about monsters will teach you how to be a human being.. A game with great emotion. Undertale is a game where skeletons talk while also being a game that gives you some tough choices. This balance between what's serious and what's not is what makes this game a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best indie game ever. Every person must play this game. Masterpiece. My favorite game. Absolutely perfect game I searched a lot for something bad about Undertale but all I could find was NOTHING!. Lovely gameplay, If you can withstand enough dialogue and go for every secret, every line of text, every action, every negative action, and can still go for more? you'll become a better obsession filled person.. Part of my life. Everything is perfect. The song,gameplay, story, choices, characters and is wholesome yet so much creepy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. *(the review is empty... and the username is somewhat familiar... The knowledge that this review is a reference fills you with DETERMINATION.). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game made my life better. No joking. The gameplay is amazing, a turn based combat where you still require skills.. Simply wonderful, a good story, good characters with their problems and peculiarities. You can choose your route, if you want to be a dirty killer and kill everybody, leading you to the genocide route, or be a bit **** person, just killing one or two, and my favorite of all routes, the pacifists route. Amazing game, Toby Fox!. It has to be the most manipulative game I've ever played in my life. Undertale is full of quirky characters with no personality that you can't empathize with, a beautiful graphic style with a pixelated retro that is very reminiscent of the SNES, although details are missing when it comes to combat making it feel empty. And the worst thing is the message it has, Undertale has three routes with three different endings: the pacifist, neutral and genocidal route. In one we have to be an ass-licker and be friends with everyone, in another we can do whatever we want whether it be forgiving or killing our enemies and in the other, my favorite, we have to kill everything that crosses our path. I don't recommend this game unless you are a masochist and want to have a bad time.. Undertale has it's own playstale. And You can choose your ownstory (normal or genocide or pacifist).. It's literally my favorite game, the way this game moves you is incredible, SANS, the characters are super charismatic and alive, the scenarios are beautiful, the pixel art is incredible, SANS, the game's fighting style is completely different and unique, its story is very deep and good, SANS, the gameplay is a bit difficult to get the hang of, it has a very good inclusion that is not forced, SANS, the fact that he simply adds the option to spare the enemy in an RPG game, SANS, since the objective of RPGs is literally to kill and level up, the way the game breaks the fourth wall, SANS, details to understand the game's lore more deeply, the characters are very well developed, the plot twist, SANS. And the best part, the most beautiful, perfect, wonderful, unique and remarkable thing about this game IS THE **** SOUNDTRACK Seriously, every song Toby Fox made felt like he was playing an instrument on fire, they are so good and catchy that in the fight against Mettaton I start dancing instead of playing the game. In short, play Undertale. (SANS). Season 3. + Very cool game. I like the no-combat mantra it takes. I think the characters are well written, funny and occationally emotuional :( I like papyrus the best, and Sans. Cool pixel game cozy game Lot of exploration and love the story of this game. I never thought to see a game so perfect but somewhat underrated, Undertale is a unique RPG, with ideas that almost no one had taken, I can not say them not to ruin the experience of those who are going to start playing, sincerely one of the best RPG I tried in my life, I would give everything to erase my memory and play it again.. It takes a concept like Earthbound and perfects it. The story and characters are funny and charming. The combat while turn based is engaging and innovative. And the spritework and pixel art looks great. A well worth play for anyone, puts AAA game devs to shame with how much and how fun a game can be in 2 hours compared to AAA titles that aren't fun in 100 hours.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Undertale it's a Rpg/Dating sim/ Rhythm game and with the possibility of making any choice you want. 10/10. I came to this site just to say how good this game is, it definitely deserves its money, it has a great soundtrack, a good story, good characters, I couldn't find anything bad in this game.. This game has one of the best stories, characters, soundtrack, morals, and ambience of all time, just wow. This is the game that convinced me that games are a work of art. One of my favorite games of all time.. I don't usually play 2D games but this one completely changed my mind, Story is perfect gamplay is unique and lovely characters, Also Undertale can be really emotional, This game is a masterpiece, Try it you won't regret it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game took 8 hours to platinum. Love the 2D art style and gameplay is great. Creative combat system. The best game of all time! What can i say.. Toby is genius Toby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is geniusToby is genius. Perfect, absolutely perfect, I still listen songs,I have just one problem,I cant change the controll buttons, for example,I want to move with WASD. This is my favourite game of all time I don’t see that changing anytime soon I can’t describe what makes it good without giving the best parts away, you need to experience it for yourself, it’s a very short story and a very cheap game The game is not that hard or scary You just need to play it. This is, without question, one of my favourite games of all time. This small 2D RPG was never intended to receive the enormous popularity it did, but looking back at it, it's clear why that happened. With a small budget to make a game, Toby Fox wanted to try his first ever project, and so created one of the most amazing stories ever portrayed in gaming history. Every character feels like they have deeper secrets or have problems that you can help them overcome, while also being the complete opposite of boring. There's a large variety of areas throughout the game that encourage you to try different things that no other RPG would. This game is also unique for its ability to completely change its tone depending on player decisions, altering its music and sound effects entirely. Speaking of which, Undertale may very well have the greatest soundtrack of any game ever created, with everyone from non-Undertale fans to first-day followers easily being able to nod their heads to the phenomenal tracks that Toby Fox has created. Overall, an absolute masterpiece that every gamer should try at least once.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Undertale is a game that takes a 3 hour experience and turns it into something crazy with characters, story, and lore that feel complex but also amazing at the same time.. Everything that makes an RPG game good, a Incredible lore; great mechanics; a must-hear soundtrack and memorable characters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good characters, good gameplay, good story, good graphics, it is perfect, perfect every detail is perfect. Subversive and innovative take on turn-based RPGs. The scale applied to the player-character's decisions is breathtaking. Quirky, full of heart, with different approaches to combat that constantly keeps the player on their toes.. Undertale is the best RPG I have ever played and always will be. This game has a lot of history, fun characters, the best music in a video game (in my opinion), different routes to follow, charismatic characters and more. If you want to play a game that makes you laugh but at the same time challenging and incredible, Undertale is your option. It may be the best indie game, I can definitely count it as the game of my childhood.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Greatest game ever made, from the flawless story to the amazing characters to the unique gameplay and the greatest soundtrack in video game history everything about this game was perfect. I really love this game I mean the score alone can make this a ten for me. The world setting is so unique and feels fresh. I love any game with 8-bit style done well and the game is funny has so much charm to it. The gameplay is something that was never done like that before and its just a lot of fun and sometimes difficult. But the difficulty makes the game more fun. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of, if not the, best videogame out there, with great characters both in design and lore. What a fantastic way I discovered RPGs at age 28 The soundtrack, visuals, story and gameplay all take part into making it so immersive. Undertale is a masterpiece of an indie game full of great character with entertaining dialogue and humor. The game shines especially in the story it tells and the different choices one can take in the gameplay.. It genuinely will leave a great impact on how you think about fictional characters as a whole, greatly recommended.. This is by far the best game I have ever played. The characters are charming, the artis beautiful, and the storyline is something I didn't expect to enjoy, but it is absolutely amazing.. the game was so good it cured my cancer, incredible storytelling, amazing characters, and a bit short but its still a good game to this day. the most BORING game i`ve ever played on Steam and It`s also Obsolete, for the most part of the game you are walking, Combat is boring too all you do is Land on the attack Bar,Act,Use some Item, Ask for Mercy and move the heart to Avoid Dying, I wished Frisk was a Girl, the sountrack is ok but the Memes Ruined them and just to make Fun of the Fanboys some Themes Doesn`t sound original, One save slot? What is this?A GameBoy Game? that eliminated my Interest to Replay it and it's Very OBSOLETE and Dumb, Only has English and Japanese Text, to go to the Main Menu you have to Reopen the game, there`s no controller Support, The Requierements are a bit High for a Super Nintendo Looking Game. the only Good things this game is the Lack of Storage Required and the Sountrack. On steam this Game cost almost the as Terraria A 2D Survival Game With Customization, Replay value, a Good Sountrack like this game and you Can have a Lot of Save Slots Unlike this Game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Trully a masterpiece Unexpected and trully happy that I stumbled upon this beauty and it is the only game I can think is trully peak in gaming history. The Best Indie Game I have Played In A While, Truly Deserved The Place It is Right Now & I Reall enjoyed everything About This game, The unique Battling System, Choices, Graphics, But Especially The Soundtrack Is The Most Exquisite Thing About This Game. The Soundtrack Suits every Piece of this Game & The Gameplay is just Wonderful. A World Full Of Surprises & Humor! Thank You Toby Fox For Publishing Such a Wonderful Title!. i was thoguh this game is bad but i am shocked now by the story and gameplay, musics, art design its so good musics 10/10 story 10/10 gameplay 9/10 Art design 10/10 Full 10/10. To simply put it, this game is as close to perfect as you can get. The gameplay is fresh and exiting bullet hell, and keeps it difficult without being frustrating. The story is beautiful and unique, with deep characters, lore, and messages. The soundtrack is arguably the greatest of all time, with tracks ranging from beautiful melodies to certified bangers. Undertale is a must play, a ride from start to finish, and a life changing experience. My personal favorite videogame. 100/100.. This game literally changed how I view the video games. It's literally perfect. Characters, story, freedom of choice,humour etc. Extremely overrated game. Everything about it is bad; they simply decided to create an insane story, characters, and humor to try to grab attention in some way, spending very little money to make a technically ridiculous game. The humor is bad, typical childish teenage humor. A complete waste of time playing this in 2024 with so many epic games that truly deserve attention and high ratings.. One of the greatest games of all time. With an amazing story spanning 3 routes, one of the greatest soundtracks of all time and challenging gameplay, Undertale truly is an amazing experience. You may have seen this game on YouTube before as I have and thought that is all you needed to experience this game, but PLEASE play it. Every playthrough is at least a little bit different and when you personally play the first time, it will hit different.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love the Combat, the animations are amazing, this game is awsome, i love it. Btw it has Sans on it soo... thats cool, the only bad thing is that u cant fck with papyrus :(. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have an especial conection with this game, not only it has been my favourite game since I was 9 years old, but it is also the only game that makes me wanna cry every time i replay it.. You can't just not love Undertale. Not into battle system? You'll love the story. Not Story? The music. This game is a masterpiece.. The Endings are amazing.Characters are Perfect. Buy Undertale or u not gud.. I like this game. UNDERTALE makes the player clear, that nothing stands in their way to solve conflicts. The choice is yours, wether you kill or end a fight without any losses, and the consequences depending are clear. You can end up with new friends or feel your sin crawling on your back... And yes, its not an AAA game, but graphics shouldnt matter if you are able to follow a great story.. The best Indie Game Ever Definitely this game deserves a ""Universal Acclaimed"". Undertale is claimed as “best game of 2015.” You could say this game not only bends conventional rules of RPG’s, but of the actual ranking system of games. This game has reserved its space in everyone’s heart.. Loved the gameplay, loved the art style, loved the musics, loved the story and the characters... Probably the best game I've ever played.. Although Undertale has a generally compelling story and characters, the gameplay is where it really falls apart. Undertale is a bullet-hell, at it's core. And to me, those kinds of games aren't fair difficulty. I do want to add, though, that the art is good, and it really is just the gameplay that brings the entire thing down for me. Also, Sans. 4/10.. I have just finished this game, I don't know what to say except that is a true masterpiece. This game is better example to how to create a video game without a spectacular graphics and high resolution or high frames, you only need a beautiful story to tell and immersive gameplay. I wish I could see more creativity in next video games not doing copy paste.. The only game with a good character that uses a comic sans typography, no **** words to describe this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best game ever lol L to whoever says it ****. After you beat the game the only thing you can do is the other routes/play styles apart from that great game good characters astonishing music and SANS (the reason most people played this game probably). Undertale is not my favorite game, but it still a fantastic experience to go through, every song feels carefully constructed to fit the theme of the boss, enemy or level on top of that, each enemy comes with varied attack patterns and the overall story is quite enjoyable no matter which route you're taking, however, it's not all perfect, the game can get quite repetitive doing things like the genocide run, not exactly thrilled after having to **** my face against a wall just so that froggit number 56 can come, but overall it's a great game with minor issues,anyway, deltarune is better. Horrible, story and characters are terrible, 3 point for the music rest is a mess, 6hours per route, boring bullet hell.. I liked the gameplay it's very simple you can attack or just talk with enimes, story was awesome and i liked sans character he was so cool and funny. the perfect game, no game will ever beat Undertale for me. never ever will there be another game like Undertale. never ever will I experience something like Undertale again. 100000000% recommend, I'd sell my soul to enjoy this game for the first time again.. one of the best 2d games I've ever played in my life regrets not playing nyeheheh. The best Game in final fantasy series, And final fantasy series best franchise of all time. So how is this game only rated 92 it should 100. Does what it sets out to do to an astonishingly perfect degree. There's nothing wrong with the game. No more needs to be said.. This game has it all: A unique gameplay, a short but very interesting story, wonderful characters, jokes, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, pixel art that is super pleasing to the eye, completely replayable. A complete masterpiece. 10/10. beautiful game that deserves to be better known throughout the world, many become discouraged as soon as they see pixel art graphics. Unfortunately, the fandom has ruined my open appreciation of Undertale, but I still really love the game. Playing through Undertale at the time of its release before it blew up was such an experience. I had never played a game that made me feel the way Undertale did. And I honestly wish I was able to relive the experience time and time again as it was so fun. I really liked many of the main cast of characters, especially Papyrus and Undyne. And the meta story is so unique that I legit enjoy it. The sprite work isn't amazing or anything, but the incredible story and killer OST help carry the game. Seriously, Toby Fox is a musical genius and the Undertale OST is definitely up there as one of my favorite gaming OSTs of all time. Also, as someone who hopes to one day perhaps make a game of my own, I actually admire Toby Fox as an indie dev, considering how successful this game became.. Masterpiece. The story is amazing, different endings, the battling system, and the OST's are on top.. Literally the perfect game. The story is beautiful, gameplay is peak, comedy at its finest, the music is just perfect, I laughed, I cried, I was disturbed, and I was in a state of pure euphoria. This game is my favorite game of all time. not one problem. Play it. You won't regret it.. This game changed my life, the music, the characters, and the gameplay is unique. Nothing more to say, it's just perfect =). I haven't completed all of the endings yet. But still, this is one of the best RPG and indie games of all time. The characters and the story are compelling and unforgettable. Not a very long game tho, but it's different when you want to complete all the endings. THE STORY IS SO GOOD! but this game make me have Anthophobia, Yellow flower is scary for me. The story is simply icroyable. The history with the music and characters make the game iconic. The art direction is totally different from other games, making it unique. The ""path"" system, based on our actions rather than dialogue, is great. It's one of those games you have to play at least once in your life.. Its **** Undertale what do u expect met to rate it I'm not even joking find me a game with a better soundtrack and storyline I'm waiting. Its my favourite game of all the times, is funny and immersive, the game knows exactly when it's time for jokes and when it's time to be serious, the story is magnificent and criative, the game makes you fell like you are inside him, you fell feelings about the characters and is easy to cry or get emmotive when you playing him. The songs are masterpieces, the soundtrack is perfect, after you play and finish the game, your playlist will have a lot of the songs of him. This game have make my childhood, i cries every time i replay, this game is a masterpiece, a wonderful experience and its marked in my soul.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Phenomenal. That's the only word can use to describe it. Undertale is the MOST charming game I've ever played. Bravo, Toby and Temmie. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has a place in my heart along with BATIM, FNaF for making my childhood better. The game itself is art, and it can satisfy Story-lovers and Gameplay-lovers both. And the consequences of your actions mid-game makes you select and choose actions more carefully.. Chapeu bas Toby Fox. Unique, moving story with amazing soundtrack. Looking forward to playing pacifist run.. An amzing game, loved the song of the game and hard bossfight. Intetesting system and remembered what i did. The best game , it's just a work of art , i think TOBY FOX is a genius and i think it's a masterpiece. I have follow this masterpiece sinceit have release, and for indie game it incredible. I don't thinkif you searchingfor good game with high graphic you wont like this, but if you search for soundtrack and story, you land in the best one,formebut you can play it first. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Undertale is a amazing rpg the characters are great and the soundtrack is awesome and what's so impressive about this game is that was made by one person toby fox. Undertale is easily one of my favorite games ever. I was stunned by how beautiful and engaging it was to me when I first played it back in 2017, and I find myself still just as impressed playing through it again years later. The level of polish, detail, and charm here simply isn't found in very many games, but in all fairness, that's a very high standard to hold any work up to. It's easy to tell that Undertale is a very personal project for the creator Toby Fox, and his level of passion while creating it shines throughout the entire experience. To me, this is the type of game where you can just feel the love and care put into every bit of it, and art like that is truly special across all mediums. Undertale is endlessly funny, the gameplay is extremely interesting and enjoyable, the soundtrack is incredible from start to finish, and it manages to deliver one of the most impactful stories I have ever seen in any video game. Despite being such a relatively small project compared to the massive AAA games we're used to seeing nominated for Game of the Year every year, Undertale might be the most complete game I have ever experienced. I admire so much about Undertale, and I can't get over how loveable and inspirational it is. One of the easiest perfect scores I've ever given to a game.. this game teach me a lot a bout how to live love everybody, everything around me. A masterpiece that i will never forget it has an amazing story woth branching paths and the music if fire. SPOILER WARNING PLS FINISH THE GAME BEFORE READ .the best game ever ot just a masterpiece, if i could give it a 1000 i would do it. is THE history ,deep and funny ,79323792 theories ,no other game have such a geatest history. The gamplay is also amazing with constant change of machanics (soul color) ,and the inovating spare mechanic but also hard ones like sans . The music is just perfect ,toby fox is by far the best soundtrack creator of all time and i have no words to describe the perfection of the music. the art is relly unique and the bad graphics are, ironicaly, very good for the art style. And most importantly it totaly overflows with charisma , i cant stop laugthing with the humor ( and also the serious parts [genocide] are exteamly great) 1.000. / 10 must play it at all cost (like 10$) note: if the gramar is bad , i am sorry ,i am spanish but i thougt that if i wrote this in english more pepole will read this . note2: if you think undertale is overrated then . YOU SHOULD BURN IN HELL *megalovania starts playing*. The Masterpiece. Best RPG ever. No bad gameplay. Just a masterpiece. This is my life game. Thanks for Toby Fox. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Undertale as I completed the game in approximately 6-7 hours. The game's atmosphere is captivating, with diverse maps and enemy variations adding to the overall experience. The creator brought a fresh perspective to turn-based combat, making it engaging and unique. The choices you make in the game significantly impact the ending, adding a layer of depth to the narrative. Personally, I found the story to be compelling, and the characters allowed for a strong emotional connection. Undertale delivered a delightful gaming experience for me.. I love Undertale's story. It is fulled with suprises and emotions. Especially true pacifist route is amazing.. Before I played the game I use to think that the game was overhyped and just a simple game, but when I actually grabbed and played the game I was shocked, the story of this game is just so creative and fenomenal and when you start to understand whats going on, you just fall in love with game, 10/10, by far one of the best games I've ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. + An experience worth playing through, twice?!+ Major characters have personality and depth to them+ Interesting mechanic lets you choose between being a wussy and a monster and everything in between+ Music ranges with emotions~ Graphics look like they could have been done on a Game Boy Color~ Game maybe too good at remembering your choices~ Story is kept simple, while the character","the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the plot is engaging and heartfelt, and the way your actions influence the story and its consequences is brilliantly executed . if you wish to enjoy the most of it, play it completely blind, you won't ever regret it ."
169.Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This game has amazing story and atmosphere, and it undeniably revolutionized the superhero game genre. For what it is, in the context it was released, this game is a timeless masterpiece.. Very good but I should warn that some challenges are really very hard if you want to win the trophies ^^'. Beautiful atmosphere. Revolutionary combat system. Character designs aren't always the best. Boss fights were limited. Final boss felt janky.. A masterpiece. Years before Rocksteady flopped with ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"", they delivered this great Batman experience. It's the video game equivalent to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", which had been released a year earlier. A darker spin on ""Batman: The Animated Series"", the game combines the style of ""Bioshock"" with the adventure of ""Metroid"". Everything from the story to the graphics to the combat are top notch. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.3 out of 10.. Gave an 8 due to Arkham City and Knight in retrospect. Regardless of whether you're getting **** into the Story mode or competing for high scores in the Challenge mode, Batman: Arkham Asylum does an outstanding job of letting you be Batman. Everything about this game--the impressive visuals, stirring soundtrack, superb voice acting, fiendish puzzles, hard-hitting combat--feels like it has been lovingly crafted by a development team that's both knowledgeable and passionate about the source material.. Perfect superhero video game, and one of the most important video games of all time.. Classic for a reason... -Great atmos -Great story -Scary bosses -Chad characters. 9.3/10. The beautifully animated, counter-based combat is what made this game so fun for me. I remember there was a challenge mode where you just fought off endless waves of enemies to see how long you could last. I loved it.. Batman Arkham is the first truly incredible superhero game. It brings a level of seriousness to its story and gameplay that makes it a must play for any Batman fan.. Here we have the first game of a fabulous trilogy, a trilogy and a game that will inspire many other game in the industry but wich will never equal either by gameplay, immersion or character whor are all memorable in this game. One of the best game of his generation.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The only Batman game to feel like a horror game and I’m a horror fanatic so playing this game as a kid scared me a bit because of the atmosphere that they captured insanely well. This game kicks ass and is the reason so many fans love Batman. Brilliant. The cast of the animated series nail their roles. Arkham Asylum feels like a character in and of itself. Combat is fluid, responsive, and often exhilarating. Does right by the comics. Feels like stepping into a new Batman story. Fun Metroidvania elements keep the playing going.. Although I personally find the game to be a little bit dated, its still great start to one of my favourite video game franchises of all time.. Great combat. Top voice acting. Excellent pacing. Fascinating setting. Shows it’s age in some areas.. Perfection! Seriously, this game is incredibly well designed. I love it so much. Very surprised by this game, I've been so sick of the 15 super hero movies per week fad that has lasted a couple decades, and this game is so good it made me remember the feeling i had as a kid when I first saw Batman. There is Zelda influence here, and it is a solid solid 9/10. Beware, the new PS4 version ruins the art style with anew lighting system, look up the compassion videos, it looks worse than the PS3 release.. Aged really well for the most part. Great story, gets the world of batman spot on and has some really good gameplay.. 2catshakur Imagine being so bad at such an easy game you say it's frustrating with clunky controls. And you play FPS games? Get real.... I'd love to see how awful this person is at those, LOL. This game is easy just like all superhero games are. And the controls are GREAT. seamless combat, enemy to enemy. And too many puzzles? Wtf are you 6? Can't figure out the simplest things ever? And you don't have to do a lot of the puzzles that are side content. What a joke. And Arkham City is even better and twice the size!. A great start to Arkham Batman. Though the gameplay is dated compared to it's sequel's. Without this game, insomniacs spider-man would be non-existent. And suphero games in general.. was concerned abt the graphics at begginin, started to love it over time, this game is absolute classic, yeah, the controls are little old school sometimes but it is must play. Good game but very outdated story’s good up till the last boss combats meh not much variety’s but that’s expected for a game that old. Just Perfect. The Story Plays in the Arkham Asylum from the Comics and does have his own Story and makes the Gameplay with every New Item even better. The Boss Fights are okay but nothing compares with the Normal Fights. I got the game from Epic Games and let me tell you that this isn't the first time I played a Batman game before. Batman Arkham Asylum is amazingly a great game to play and let me aside from the story this game has the best thing that this game shows is the combat. The combat in this game almost reminded me when the time I played Assassin's Creed but unlike Assassin's Creed the game does not absolutely focus on killing but instead knocking out enemies. But the game's combat is not the only thing that matters it also focuses on stealth where this game has so many ways to take down an enemy by distracting someone with a Batarang, taking down gargoyles, and diving attacks as well.I got the game from Epic Games and let me tell you that this isn't the first time I played a Batman game before.Batman Arkham Asylum is an amazingly great game to play and let me aside from the story this game has the best thing that this game shows is the combat.

Fighting Bane was the best, Harley Quinn's boss just felt anticlimactic but for the Joker however, I expected him to start with no powers but instead, he became a monster and the timing was way too **** you want to experience the first Batman Arkham games then Batman Arkham Asylum is something to be recommended for new players.. One of the best games ever made and its Batman! Alot of fun and the story is great. Batman Arkham Asylum helped set the gold standard along with its sequel Arkham City for great superhero games at a time when the genre was almost exclusively filled with mediocre or terrible games outside of the fighting game genre. Its great combat is exhilarating and easy to learn and rewarding to master, and does a great job making the player feel like the Dark Knight. Equally important to that immersion is the puzzle solving and gadget use, with the Riddler puzzles in particular providing enjoyable side content for a mostly linear game that makes excellent use of Batman's detective skills. The soundtrack fits the game well and really helps set the mood for the best setting across the Arkham games. While Arkham Asylum may not be as big as the sequel's iterations of Gotham or feature as much side content, its atmosphere is one of the best across gaming and truly embodies the location seen in the comics. Batman himself as well as the many villains and side characters are also amazingly characterized in this game, and something this game doesn't get enough credit for compared to its contemporaries is how accessible it is for casual fans or people unfamiliar with the Batman mythos. The game is full of unlockable bios, interviews and other details that help introduce all of the characters and lore to players while also informing more seasoned Batman fans of its own world and story that takes plenty of inspiration from the comics while still making a story all of its own. If there's any superhero game that excels at drawing in newcomers and introducing them to the franchise, its this one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. In the first this game is the godfather of superheroes games, and its playable now and in future that's what i think, ok this game mechanic is good but the bosses don't expect anything from them, i will give this game 10/10 if the bosses are good, and everything is good in this game but pc version had many bad glitches but i will ignore it and remember this game was released in 2009. One of the best super hero games ever made. Please play it if you haven't already. It's worth it and if you're one of the people that blindly hate this game then please just shut up and play it for yourself. I never really cared for the Arkham games and after I played Arkham Asylum I knew this was an incredible series.. You know you've made a masterpiece when everyone's ripping you off and doing it badly, even your incompetent replacements at the company you used to work for and the wannabes at Insomniac who haven't made a good game since the PS2. Step into The Aslume and hunt down The Jonkler.. to my mind one of the best games really fun the story and the gameplay are amazing and the characters are done perfectly. The story and combat in this game was, and still is, one of the best combat systems I have experienced in a game. Gameplay kept me entertained for hours until I completed the game. This is a masterpiece, an absolute masterpiece… the beginning of the best trilogy in games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first game in the franchise, amazing action packed game with a great story. The claustrophobia of the asylum makes for an intense game. I loved every second of it.. It's such a thrilling experience with no dull moments, and I'm someone who has never read any of the comics or watched any of the movies but am still at least somewhat familiar with the important characters. Definitely up there for one of the best single player games I've ever played.. This is the first time i’ve ever played batman arkham asylum and one thing that was immediately apparent was the sheer polish this game has, I did not run into a single bug or glitch through out my fifteen hour playthrough which is unheard of for games nowadays. The game is also flooded with cool lore and secrets that die hard batman fans could drool over for hours and the story is fun and thrilling. The Arkham Asylum is also such a cool location, Theres just something so cool about running around in that grimy, creepy Asylum filled with super villians. Now, onto some of the problems i have with the game, firstly the framerate in docked mode is just unnaceptable for a 13+ year old game, the games frames will drop rapidly if there is more than ten opponents on screen at once. Secondly the combat gets repetitive pretty quickly because they’re is not any strategy to it outside of boss fights, which means the fighting usually just boils down to mashing y. Lastly is the input delay when using joycons, but ill admit this happens with many different games it was just more apparent here. Overall 8/10 Great Game! Edit: sorry this was meant to be a nintendo switch review, please forgive me lol. I think they did a great job for that period. I haven't finished it yet but my thoughts are positive right now.. very good game but killer moth is not in it except for a little picture it would have been better if he was in it more rocksteady please put killer moth in the next one when it comes out please. Great Batman game.. Even though i think this game is the 3rd best of the trilogy, it is, still one great game, with a amazing atmosphere, boss fights. Of course the game is old so you gonna feel it when it comes down to the combat, upgrades system, actors performaces, like batman, he sounds like hes reading lines straight out of a paper, but Asylum still a good game. 8/10. Absolutely great game. Despite almost being 15 years old, the graphics don’t feel outdated. Combat system is fun, and the adaptability required for various scenarios keeps things interesting. Map was well done, and the riddler trophies were fun to try to find.. Amazing, once again. A very well-designed universe with captivating mechanisms! It truly felt like being a badass Batman.. Great looking, but I got bored with it. Totally linear, repetetive - buttom mashing dumb but cool looking combat. Overrated. Very consoley!. A real Batman experience that makes you feel like you are in the shoes and cowl of the caped crusader. Combat is iconic and detective mode set up many future games to draw inspiration. The story is captivating and exploring Arkham Island has never been more exciting.. A really good visual interpretation of the characters, some cool gadgetry and an open environment to explore with puzzles to solve makes Arkham Asylum an very impressive game initially, but after a while the combat gets very, very repetitive.. This game changeed the situation that comic and movie adaption games are low budget and low standard games.. What a fantastic Batman game. The fact that they topped this is insane. There’s not much to dislike here.. only few games hit me hard in the feels and this is one of them, definitely a must play. As far as Batman games go, it really doesn't get much better than this. The developers obviously knew what would captivate players and gave them a contained, focused, and varied journey as Batman's toughest night! For 2009, the visual fidelity and graphical performance are quite impressive and I didn't have too many issues with frame rate dips on the 360 minus the occasional hiccup when switching to new locations. Load times were pretty fast and general performance was solid (although it heated my 360 something fierce after a couple of hours). What impressed me most was the story and narrative that drives Batman further into the hellhole that is the Asylum. The pacing feels similar to a contained horror survival while seamlessly blending some nice detective/mystery-solving elements, environmental problem-solving, and some great brawling action. My only gripe with the gameplay itself was some combat encounters felt a little stiff and not as fluid as it should have. Several times I saw myself completely missing the target (even when I shouldn't have) and then other times countering in the wrong direction only to have my combo remain intact. The minor combat hiccups weren't consistent to ruin the game or anything but I felt like it could've been refined just a tad more. The Scarecrow sequences interwoven with the game were especially incredible and my hats off to not only the developers executing these ideas but the creatives that thought this up in the first place. The transitions between the real world and Batman's hallucinations are transitions I can only imagine in this medium and I feel like Rocksteady has taken full advantage of this medium to provide a definitive and memorable Batman experience. The voice acting was incredible too. Joker's taunts and henchmen's re-used dialogue did get repetitive and thoroughly obnoxious after a while but the voice talent on display makes the bother much less. Character variety and villain encounters are also unique and fun to experience. The terrifying environment of Killer Croc's lair is thoroughly anxiety-ridden and the careful maneuvering of Bane makes the boss fights grounded and rewarding to go through. In general, it's hard to imagine this game getting any better. If the combat mechanics were just a tad smoother for me, I dare say the game is perfect. It not only delivers on anything a Batman fan might want in a game, but it also makes it thoroughly enjoyable to collect Riddler's trophies, unlock Arkham secrets, and pursue challenges long after the credits roll.. It's an old game, so i won't consider the expressions of the characters , because in conversations there are not expressions. But, the game is perfect, it's a great innovation for hero games.. It kicked off the greatest trilogy of superhero games of all time. Conroy and Hamill are the definitive voices of Batman and Joker respectively.. Yea we all know super hero games dont have the best track record. JUST PLAY IT. You wont regret it and i guarantee that you will be buying all the sequels right after you finish it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is awesome I like the fighting mechanics and storyline it's a great ride round Arkham asylum. I bought a 360 to play this game and it didn't disappoint. Arkham Asylum is an amazing game for its time. The entire series was done right and this masterpiece started it all. Long live Arkham and long live the Bat! Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil are back at it and it's the best! This game is almost a 10 and at the time- there was nothing else like it. Rocksteady has put superhero game on the map with Arkham Asylum.. Gameplay..............Great Graphics................Amazing Story.......................Amazing Score.....................Good. Though it's obviously lacking compared to the newer Arkham games, this deserves the highest points possible for making Batman games genuinely fantastic for the first time ever. This was crazy to experience when it came out and it was kind of unreal that a game of this quality - starring Batman - actually existed. Really great game and kind of changed the game in terms of superhero games as a whole. People began taking that subgenre more seriously in terms of video games, mostly due to its success and greatness.. After proving his modern popularity in the movies, Batman now shows how he can rule the video game territory, with buttery smooth combat, slick maneuvers, just enough bosses, and the iconic voices of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill.. For me when I think of Batman and his large cast of villain's this series is typically what I picture in my head. Most of these interpretations are the definitive version for me. And I think it comes down to the fantastic voice performances from the cast and the designs of the many of the characters Killer Croc is easily my favorite design by far as he scared the **** out of me when I first played this as a child. Also villain's taunting your death when you die in the game is a fantastic detail that I really applicate they put in. I think that a lot of draw backs for Asylum comes down to it's sequels improving the combat and traversal so well that it makes this one feel kind of repetitive in comparison. But when you strip away the sandbox and car and many of the later tools the game is still fun at its core. Taking on large groups of enemies or sneaking around rooms and taking out enemies one by one is so much fun. Getting your combo meter up and avoiding getting hit is invigorating especially if you play on hard mode and so don't have the counter indicator forcing you to pay attention to what each enemy is doing around you. Some things that I really like in Arkham Asylum the comic book art style for the menus and the character bios I really missed in later titles as they give the characters so much personality. Also I like how this one has bios for a lot of obscure characters that I had no idea even existed before playing this game. The Riddler trophies I don't really mind in this one even though the reward for getting them all from a narrative perspective is really disappointing to me but they feel the least annoying to get them all in the whole series. Although this is probably because he gives you maps to find them and the games much more linear then its predecessors. Being more so open areas with levels in them then an open world like in later titles. I think the biggest disappointment for me though would be the bosses their all just okay or underwhelming. Except the last boss which feels a bit out of character and is just not really fun or challenging to fight honestly. If you've played the game you know what I mean and I think those whatever boss fights is what really hold this game back for me. Still a great time would highly recommend I just don't think its the best in the series.. Combat system not great IMO - a bit simplistic and button-mashy. But otherwise, a perfect game with every aspect working like a well oiled machinery. One of the best ""movie games"" ever made. Go play this absolute classic, genre-defining gem right now.. Warning: Spoilers When I first got my Playstation 3 one of the first games that got my attention when I play the demo was Batman: Arkham Asylum. Now Batman is my favorite superhero from DC Comics and I grew up with Batman from the movies to the classic Animated Series the action figures and video games. Now after so many years we finally got a game that is really what Batman fans have always wanted and Thankfully it does not disappoint. The plot of the game has Batman bringing The Joker back to Askham Asylum only for it to be all part of The Joker's plan to make this the longest night of Batman's life. With The Joker and Harley Quinn in control of the Asylum Batman has to be one step ahead of them along with fighting the other villains in the asylum like Bane, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and others The writers really took their time to make this game a joy to play and the story line just keeps you interested from the start as it proves to be one of the longest nights of Batman's life. But Barbara Gordon AKA Oracle helps Batman whenever she can and it gives the game more interest. Also there are a lot to unlock like Character Bios, Interview tapes, Trophies and more. The only thing I didn't care too much for is The Riddler's riddles while they are for helping you unlock items and maps in my opinion The Riddler serves little to no meaning to the plot just a side mission. The boss battles will have you on your highest gaming sense my favorite battle in this game is Poison Ivy but you also fight Bane, Killer Croc, Scarecrow and The Joker in the climax of the game. Now you have to do a lot of thinking on how to defeat these bosses. The game play is really well done with a mix of stealth, action, and puzzle solving which you'll be doing through the game to unlock new combos and gadgets. The game play just spare no expense The voice acting is just phenomenal. My favorite part is that Kevin Conroy reprise his role as Batman from Batman The Animated Series he is the best voice for Batman he knows how to bring the legend to life and once again he prove to do a successful job as Batman. Also Mark Hamill reprise his role as The Joker and his performance is just perfect you can tell he put his heart and soul into the character making him the best Joker in the animated department. Arleen Sorkin also returns as Harley Quinn and she is quite entertaining for the game she really did a great job as the character. Also the rest of the cast, Tom Kane, Kimberly Brooks, Dino Andrade, Wally Wingert,Steve Blum,Tasia Valenza, Danny Jacobs, Fred Tatasciore and the others were just perfect fits for their respected characters they voiced in the game. The Controls work very well for the game. Also the sound and music really matches the Dark Knight. Now onto the Graphics were are just flawless attention to detail for the level designs and the characters really just gives you the feel of being in Batman's world. It goes to show that a lot of love went into this game and it feels like it was done for Batman Fans by fans of Batman. The game also gives you chills with the Scarecrow levels which really brings the fear out and gets your skin to crawl. Also you never know what the game will throw at you next. It gives you the feel of actually expect the unexpected. Seriously if you don't have this game you must get it because it one of the best video games ever created, the Best Batman Game and one of the best comic book games that really is a champion. With original story, Excellent Graphics, Tight Game Play and Superb Voice acting you will be in for a thrill ride I give Batman Arkham Asylum an 10 out of 10. With the amazing cast of the Animated Series for the voices of Batman, Joker, and Harley Quinn and a head writer from the show to give it an authentic feel. The amazing graphics of the time and the now primitive, but amazing early freeflow system make the combat challenging but very fun. This deserves to be in the video game Hall of Fame.. Great game but it is slightly repetitive. Not as good as everyone makes it out to be but still a blast.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 8 Music: 7 Story: 9 Total: 8.50. Writing feels quite dated now, but it's still a very good game that doesn't outstay its welcome. I'd argue City has aged better, but this was the better game at the time.. Great experience overall that puts you in the Batsuit. The fact that it takes place in just the Asylum actually is impressive since you wouldn't think there could be much to do in it but there actually is. The writing and voice acting is at its finest.. A Masterpiece & the best Game in the Series This game is an amazing lesson in atmospherical density and level design, both things in which the prequels while improving on the gameplay, disappointed. It was also the first game ever that really made me feel like a superhero.... Just got into the batman games. Wow what have I been missing out. Combat, story and levels are just soo good.. This game holds up very well to this day, and it is a must-play game. The story is simple but good, combat is great, and the only issue is the final boss battle isn't great.. A very very good story. I recommend also read the comic, it is an art piece. I do not rate 10 because i dont like the fight motor, whis is improved in Arkham City. good history, controls, the truth for me is one of the best games I've played. There isn't a single weak point on this game. All fits perfectly, the whole characters seems truthfull within what we expected for, the system of counter attack it's brilliant, the plot is uptight and immersive, anyway... The best superhero game ever made!. One of the most engaging games I have played in awhile. Pros: - Stealth portions of the game are one of the best parts. With the variety of ways you can take down your opponents in a stealthy manner is very satisfying and refreshing. - Character biographies and recordings can be found throughout the game. They give interesting information on characters in Batman. This is good for gamers who are not acquainted with Batman. - In parts of the game, Batman is affected by Scarecrow's fear gas. These short segments involve mini-games where Batman must conquer his fear and return to reality. These short segments gives players a little understanding of Batman's past emotional troubles. The atmosphere in these segments reminds me of Alice: Madness Returns. - Graphics are amazing. - Most of Batman's gadgets are unique and interesting. They are all put into good uses throughout the game. - The game makes you feel like you are in an insane asylum focused to cure professional criminals with the atmosphere and objects. - The variety of villains featured in the game are classic and have very interesting traits. - The game gives great incentives to progress through the plot with engaging villains. The cruel mind and the **** of Joker and his henchmen will give you a large incentive to take them all down. - Areas rarely feel revisited since the Asylum is so large. Even if the game makes you revisit an area there is something new the game will throw at you to keep it fresh. - Challenge mode. This mode lets you train your close quarter combat skills and stealth skills. There are a variety of locations and scenarios to unlock. You may also compare your scores with your XBL buddies. Cons: - Too much time is spent in detective mode, such that you cannot enjoy the environment of Arkham Asylum half of the time. Detective mode could have been made a bit less infrared so you could still enjoy the beautiful environment. - Some gadgets are assigned to the diagonal inputs on the d-pad of the xbox 360 controller. This was a poor choice because the diagonal buttons on the d-pad are not precise. Usually up, left or right will be registered instead when attempting to press the diagonals. - Joker's henchmen who carry machine guns have unreal accuracy. If they spot you while you are zip-lining really fast upwards they will still be able to land all their bullets.. Everything about this game is great! The story, the characters, the voice acting, the level design! Really excited to check out the rest of the series!. OVERALL - 88% Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 6/10 Fantastic, creative action.. I think this is an overrated game, the story is mediocre, the characters are ok, and the gameplay is normal, it’s the atmosphere and batmans lore what make this a decent game. BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM and BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY are the two best Batman Games of all Time. Great Graphics and Sound, great Story and Fun. Masterpiece!. Masterpiece. You are Batman in this game, in all the perfect ways. Story is a 10, voice acting is a 10, gameplay is a 10.. Such a blast from start to finish. The villains of Batman's rogues gallery haven't felt this strong in a long time. Combined with the pitch perfect free flow combat system, this game is chef's kiss.. Rocksteady brings to us the best superhero franchise ever, and this game is the beginning of the story of Batman and his nemesis Joker, with a lot of characters from the Batverse involved. The game takes place in Arkham Asylum, and is incredible in absolutely everything.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: AWESOME.. Batman: Arkham Asylum is a best comics game I have ever played! So dramatic atmosphere! Great fightings!. Truly authentic and at the time, really ground-breaking. Laser precise combat controls, genuinely challenging puzzles and a fantastic story. It's set the bar for superhero games.. This is the first game into the Rocksteady Batman series and I give it the highest 9 out of 10 possible. It's everything you want and love from a Batman game and it's something new and fresh that had never been done before. For the time this is a great place to start but if your in 2019 and thinking about just jumping in, I'd recommend Batman Arkham City or Batman Arkham Knight as the gameplay has been perfected and the graphics are well polished for today's date.. If you like Batman and Adventure games for a more mature audience then this is for you.. one of the best super hero games i played good story and gameplay, positively surprised me the game, I finished it twice and one of them on the hard level, very good to play. The balance is almost perfect in Arkham Asylum. Gameplay and narrative. Combat and stealth. Comic book fun and gritty realism. The gameplay's variety and steady progression. The subtle visual details and set-pieces that carefully realise Batman's perilous journey through the fascinating and personal, and the awesome villains littered throughout. Other than an ending that falls a little flat and some awkward level design here and there, it might well be the best Batman game of all time.. Batman Arkham Asylum is in my opinion the best game in the Arkham series. It set the bases for the future games in the Arkham series with its brilliant ","this game undeniably revolutionized the superhero game genre . it's the video game equivalent to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" it's a darker spin on ""Batman: The Animated Series"""
17.BioShock,"Why do I give bioshock a 10? This game brings the perfect mix of a wonderful story with unexpected plottwist. The combat in this game is also very exciting, you can always nicely alternate between your powers and weapons. Arguably the greatest game of all time throughout multiple genres of gaming. Didn’t play it much will have to play it and get further into the game to experience the games full potential and when I do I WILL update my rating. A true evolution of the narrative driven FPS that Half Life, and Half Life 2 birthed. One of the few ""must play"" games for all gamers. Go in blind, and immerse yourself in the moody atmosphere, and dark story. With an arsenal of guns and a host of powerful abilities via the plasmids, you'll be tearing your way through a fallen utopia beneath the sea. Now, would you kindly do yourself a fa vor and play this classic?. Bioshock is a refreshing game for its generation. It is a creative game, with an exciting story and setting.. Must play with no doubt I have played it again in 2024 it is still amazing experience and gameplay. It's a very good game with a good story challenging gameplay, since there isn't a lot of light and the enemies are somewhat creepy it also gives chills, very good environment. It's a great game. Must play video game. must play Game. This game is literally a must play for everyone who wants to play a story driven strong campaign fps I it's unlike any fps I have played will not say much more just go and play the game this is something special and you will definitely enjoy every second of your playthrough. my Fav. Game great story great atmosohere great gameplay and great game!!!(a little bit pls gameplay). Review of BioShock 1### Story and Pacing- **Overly Complicated Narrative**: The story can be convoluted and difficult to follow, with many players finding it hard to engage with the plot.- **Slow Pacing**: The game’s pacing can feel sluggish, particularly in the early stages, which may deter players looking for a more action-oriented experience.### Gameplay Mechanics- **Combat Limitations**: The combat system can feel clunky and imprecise at times, leading to frustration during encounters.- **Resource Management**: The need to constantly manage ammo and supplies can detract from the overall enjoyment, making the experience feel more like a chore.### Graphics and Design- **Aging Graphics**: While **BioShock** was visually impressive at its release, the graphics have not aged well compared to modern titles, which may affect immersion.- **Repetitive Environments**: Some players may find the environments to be repetitive, lacking the variety needed to keep exploration exciting.### ConclusionIn summary, while **BioShock 1** has its merits, including a unique setting and innovative mechanics, its complicated story, pacing issues, and gameplay limitations may not resonate with all players. It’s essential to weigh these factors when considering this title.. Another game that does so much and basically cranks it up to 10, the dialogue the twist at the end, everything is perfect, Except the final boss... which is one of the worst final bosses in my opinion but this is still a MUST PLAY. A remarkable accomplishment. Excels in nearly every category. A subpar final boss doesn't detract from one of the most cinematic and complete gaming experiences out there.. Clunky tank controls, confusing map layouts, and a poor attempt at ethical dilemmas via the little sisters made my revisit of BioShock feel clunkier than ever. Some interesting ideas hidden behind a hard to play shell.. It is amazing ,the story is perfect the art style aged like fine wine and it is the best game from the series.. Overhyped piece of cake with immortal hero, not interesting story, and long loading times. Probably the most boring and overrated FPS I have ever played. You cannot seriously boot this game up, play it, or watch it be played and look me in the eyes and tell me this is a 9.6/10. What a joke. Where does that leave gaming reviews? When this old clunky mid game is rated higher than 99% of all titles? Really?. I would have really enjoyed this game if it came out back then, but playing it in 2024, it feels mediocre. I'd rate it as fun in today's terms.. More like BioShlock. Pretentious overwritten dialogue impresses manchildren who never picked up a book before and video game journalists who desperately pray video games become more like movies so their wife's boyfriends will like them.. Best game ever made. Set an whole universe and an idea of magic shooter. first game that let me speechless after completing it, well known that its one of a million moment of gamin. Absolutely phenomenal game. Its atmosphere is the best in the world in my opinion. The underwater rapture is such a wonderful world to explore and the story is just as good. The whole game is just unique entirely from anything I’ve seen before. The gameplay is incredibly solid with some slight clunkiness but still overall minimal problems there. Along with that it is absolutely terrifying to walk around and get immersed in it.. Phenomenal vibe, incredible story and twist. Definitely worth playing for anyone.. The story is fantastic, rapture is so detailed and fun to explore, and the lore just kept reeling me in and wanting to know what happened and why.. That’s one of my favorite games ever!. Fun game. For a game nearing its 20th birthday, the gameplay has aged well—super fun abilities and weapons. The story is interesting. Environments are well designed. Overall, it was a good experience.. Looks a little bit outdated in 2024, but still has a great story and atmosphere.. Bioshock is a great game. The story is engaging and explores interesting concepts. The art direction and world-building are top-notch and immersive. Though some of it is repetitive and a bit dated by today's standard the gameplay is still great as every weapon is punchy and the DNA-changing sea magic is great for adding variety, just make sure to turn off Vita-chambers in the settings if you want a real challenge.. Good setting. Midbrow take on Ayn Rand's philosophy. Drags too much. Shooting is unexciting.. So boring i didn't even finish the game i've wasted my money on this don't recommend this game to anyone. This is probably one of, if not, the defining game for not just atmospheric horror, but storytelling and player engagement in a horror game. There's something to say here where, even after nearly 17 years, this game still manages to wow audiences and holds up gameplay-wise to even some of the most recent gaming juggernauts. If you haven't played this, do yourself a favor and buy the trilogy. This modern gaming classic more than deserves it.. You know, I played my fair share of games in my time, but Bioshock is nowhere near a 9, let alone a 10/10. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, it has good art direction, serviceable gunplay and the story is engaging enough, it's just that as a whole it doesn't hold the candle of being hold as a classic by any stretch of the imagination.. I don't like the story at all. The game is just something that I can get bored of Fast too. I've seen my brother play it and after 10 minutes I just didn't want to see it anymore. When I got the chance to play I got off that same minute. Speaking of the story I just don't think it's as good as any other ordinary story. The gameplay is very moderate which is the only thing that is good to me in my eyes. But that's it for this game. I only recommend you get it if you like Decent gameplay or if you wanna Platinum games that you just don't care about And of you want to do a playthrough which might be entertaining if you make it fun in a way.. This is an amazing game. Unless the game puts heavy emphasis on its story, I usually focus on gameplay. The only times I care are if the story is bad or dumb, but I do acknowledge when a story is good, and Bioshock's story is good. The gameplay was fun. My only complaint was how it took a second to switch from your weapons and plasmids, it isn't a big problem but I did get a little annoyed by it. I also didn't like that there are limited plasmid slots, but I played Bioshock Infinite before this one so it's kinda on me. But otherwise this is a great game.. Bioshock is an FPS released in 2007. Bioshock is set in Rapture, a utopian underwater city built by Andrew Ryan in order to escape the ever degrading morals in the doomed world above (something I can sympathize with). Not only is the setting an interesting fresh idea, it is also beautifully made. You really feel like you are abandoned in an underwater city. That gloomy feeling makes for an amazing atmosphere. What else is good? Pretty much everything. The graphics were also fantastic for a 2007 game, the gameplay polished and nice, with an arsenal of weapons, plenty of plasmids and modifications. You can really have some fun with those. The story is very interesting, intertwined with the city with a major twist in the middle. There are only a few major characters, but they are done well. I like the music, the game font as well. What about some negatives? There are only small bits and pieces. Like the difficulty, for an experienced player there is no challenge. Or the splicer respawn rate. Personally, I also do not like the Vita-chambers very much, but I am really nitpicking here. The game is not too long. I did pretty much everything and still completed it in about 20 hours on a PC playthrough. No microtransactions and no SJW whatsoever. I like it when the developers take matters into their own hands and make a new world from scratch. And that is exactly what Irrational Games did with Bioshock. Legendary game. Final Verdict: 90 %. The opening cinematic along with the first 20 minutes of gameplay make this a work of art. Watch a playthrough at the very least.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Would you kindly review this game?... It still holds really well gameplay and story wise. I adore it's art deco, atmosphere and locations. Awesome series that has inspired a lot of other franshises, some of them still release games nowadays. It was innovative back in the day and is must play for everyone.. This game is amazing from top to bottom, and it doesnt even looks 16 years old, for its quality, story, gameplay, it feels like it was released in the ps4, xboxone generation. One the best games of all time no doubt.. BioShock 1 all things considered is the best FPS game to have ever been created. It manages to have a powerful narrative combined with unique and exciting game design.. So far ahead of its time that even in 2023 it’s still an excellent game with excellent storytelling, characters and atmosphere. Great gameplay but does falter a bit at the end with a boring escort mission but it’s quite short and hacking can definitely be annoying but overall it’s fine. Overall this is an excellent game and well worth your time considering the fact that it is relatively short.. I am making this review solely for the absolute braindead people making the negative reviews about ""running out of ammo"" ""the map is confusing"" ""the enemies are repetitive"". Alright, if you are actually wanting a rebuttle to these instead of just being a review bomb for one of the best games of our time, then go ahead and read. but if you are going to just get mad at calling me out, just pass by like you should have done with bioshock and let your little pea sized brain relax after having to think for so longToo little ammo: I could go an entire map with one gun most of the time and would have to be reminded I could play with a different gun when I would find ammo that I couldn't fit in my inv, 10000000% a skill issue and if you are running out of ammo, either get your money up or uninstall for being so bad at the game (PS: i explored the entire map and killed every single enemy I came across so dont give me any **** for running out of ammo)The map is confusing: sure for all of 5 seconds and then you realize theres not only a legend at the bottom for everything on the map but GIANT RED ARROWS POINTING YOU TO A SECOND OR BOTTOM LEVEL YOU ARE MOVING TO, please just go get euthanized if you genuinely think the map is too hard to read, jesus christenemies are repetitive: I could just say that this is a game from 2007 and you guys are treating it like it came out just today but I will actually show you all the different types of enemies there are since most people getting this far are just seething at how bad they are at the game Enemies: Bouncer with an elite form, Rosie with an elite form, security devices (you don't HAVE to hack them, that's the neat thing you can just shoot them you cavemen), splicers, thuggish, lead heads, nitro, spider and Houdini. For a game this old, this many enemies is just fine and kept me entertained the whole game and if it didnt for you then take your Ritalin if you really are that bored after a masterpiece like thisTLDR: too many braindead review bomb posts and Im here to balance out the score since the people that wrote all of those reviews replaced their morning cereal with rocks and sticks. Overrated as hell or just didn't hold the test of time imo. This game is an absolute gem! The seamless integration of story, action, characters, and the captivating environment is nearly flawless. It's the kind of game that beckons you to replay it time and time again.. I have reviewed this game.. A well-made FPS game with a fantastic story. An experience of around 10 hours leaves a lasting impression as if it were 100 hours.. I played it when it was released, and it was just amazing. I had a lot of fun with this one.. Brilliant storyline, along with great gameplay and great graphics at the time make a perfect game.. The pinnacle of RPG FPS games. A gripping story that doesn't shove the narrative in your face. The most important character in the game is the world, Rapture. The setting, tone, combat, and game systems work so well together and is the ultimate ""shock like"" title to date.. An artwork, its gameplay is a 9/10, the story is a 10/10, the atmosphere, the enemies, the music, everything. Bioshock is art, that's all.. Guys, you need to play this. All this shooter. He is very good. I won't say anything about it, you just have to play it. Plus, it sells for pennies.. A beautifully realised FPS set in an art deco undersea realm that developed in parallel to our own world. An interesting story, plenty of nice embellishments and an original weapons system make up for a slightly unsatisfying combat system that relies upon your ""respawning"" when you are killed, which makes enemies more a nuisance than a threat. Pretty to look at, atmospheric and surprisingly absorbing.. ""Bioshock"" is one of the greatest video games ever made. A first-person shooter that blends adventure and horror elements, it transcends the genre and elevates itself to an art form. This is the thinking man's action game. ""Bioshock"" explores the ideas of Ayn Rand and George Orwell in an intelligent, yet entertaining way. Only ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" rivals it when it comes to thought provoking storytelling and mind blowing twists. Overall, it is a unique masterpiece. I would rate it with a 9.7 out of 10.. Finally finished and played Bioshock 1 for the first time, The story and characters are all great. The levels have great atmosphere but could have been better designed to feel less repetitive. The combat in this game is super fun and satisfying, also the different powers and abilities give you tons of ways to playthrough things again and again. The hacking system in this game is perfect in my opinion it is actually fun and takes a little skill. The enemies do get slightly stale after a while and could have used maybe 2 more types of splicers and 1 more type of Big daddy. Overall it is a great game but I don't think it is perfect. This game needs a remake it would be amazing especially after seeing Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, and Dead space.. Brilliant writing and worldbuilding paired with excellent gameplay and atmosphere. One of the best games of all time.. Me being a gears of war fan, I wanted to venture out and try more story games and this game is truly breathtaking. Very amazing game. One of the games you should point to when you want to prove to someone that game are an art **** the first time in my life a game challenged me on an intellectual level when a game designer designs a game you dont ask questions you just play the game the designer wants and bioshock is the first game i have played that challenged that notion. Amazing work of art A MASTERPIECE. Played this for the first time 2 days ago. Started it and finished it in the same day. The game was amazing. The setting of Rapture is such a damn good place. You feel trapped yet it still looks amazing. The Big Daddies are creepy yet cool looking, the Little Sisters are creepy and saving them is creepy. The gameplay is pretty fun, nothing special but still good. The setting, story and enemies are what make this game truly amazing.. Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock. First time playing this and it looks horrible I hate the look of the graphics and I'm not much likeing anything else on this either. This game was shocked by the opening it´ś gruesome, and besides, maybe Half-Life and Halo is the game where I want to dive deep into the franchise's lore. Gameplay: 9 Story: 10 World Building: 10 Overall: 9.7. A legend, this genre of games is my favorite but unfortunately this breed of games is dying out. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gameplay - 10/10 Characters - 9.5/10 Visuals - 10/10 Story - 8.75/10 Uniqueness - 9.25/10. Fantastic game! The story, the action, the characters, the environment, all so perfectly blended in together. It's near perfect! It's a game you want to play over and over again!. An absolute masterpiece. I played it in 2022 for the first time and my word does it hold up. I miss the days where we got a lot of good high quality linear games that were only 10-15 hours long. This is a must play!. Dude? People who havent played this should, even if Bioshock 2 was bad, and Infinite was ok, the sort of soft horror this game gives off is what i loved, and it was extremely solid. Bioshock 1 is the best. Cool world, story, weapons, upgrades and mechanics. love the water.. This game is just dripping with atmosphere and personality. Would you kindly play it?. So you think you are a Big Daddy?. One of the best video games ever made is still waiting for you. ""Bio-Shock"" overpasses expectations and proves again that a solid and dark plot may get your attention, but extremely detailed graphics, creepy and atmospheric atmospheric music, and the best f/x you will ever see are the perfect elements to make a memorable video game. The plot is extremely intriguing and dark; it involves a City in the likes of the myth of Atlantis, the Lost City but taken further to the point that evil alien-type creatures are invading the city and the political system. Talking about politics, this video game has a sub-plot involving political strategies and an ancient political system accused of being corrupt and cruel for a futuristic City. To make this better, we have futuristic and spectacular weapons that will let you eyed open. You won't see more complex and impressive weapons in any other game. Most of them are deadly and deliver extremely impressive and violent results. Overall this is the most atmospheric game created for xbox 360. Don't look further and buy this game. I won't recommend it for a specific audience; it's a game for everyone. Hands down to last year's best game.. I never got the hype, and still do not to this day. Gameplay extremely repetitive and boring. Technical aspects were good but nothing special imo for the time it released. (Sound/Graphics) Even the story nothing too special imo. TBH I enjoyed the atmosphere from the exceptionally stellar world design the most. I remember getting so bored of it back in '08 I quit after an hour. Forced myself to play through it years later, and kind of wish I had used the time for some other activity/game.. Bioshock is one of the best games of its generation. The game, which is still relevant, and the gameplay is outdated, and graphically it will no longer surprise as in 2007. But the ideas that Ken Levin laid in her are alive, and this is the most striking example of objectivism with modern media content. Bioshock is a vivid example of the fact that graphics technology is not the most important and solves primarily stylistics and design in gamedev AAA projects. Best game of 2007, best part of the series. It looks fresh for 2007, which you can't say about Infinite. Real art, which in modern gamedev almost no longer. Gameplay a bit dated in parts, but exceptional world-building and great twist make this a game I'd still recommend today. Bioshock may just be the best single player story driven FPS of all time.... Gameplay : 9/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 10/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 9/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If I could only choose 1 word to describe Bioshock. it would be: ""iconic"". The setting of Rapture is amongst the most memorable & engrossing in gaming with a group of antagonists that flesh out the dystopia very well. The gameplay still holds up nicely 2 generations later - you have an array of weapons & powers at your disposal to approach encounters in many ways, keeping combat as fresh as you want it to be as you progress through the different areas. This is still the epitome of a single player experience in my eyes.. Bioshock is a classic of the seventh generation of gaming and I believe it's game that most people into gaming should experience at least once. What the game does so well for starters is it's atmosphere and world building. The city of Rapture that it takes place in is so beautiful and it will draw you right and make you want to explore and learn more about it. Now while I did say the game is beautiful some textures and areas certainly show there age but the art style is where it shines and gives the game it's character. Along with that the music fits very well and give you this sense of wonder or terror at times. And the political commentary present in the game and it's critiques on capitalism is done wonderfully with out feeling like it's completely hitting you over the head with it. And the story telling present in the game along with it's environmental storytelling is also done fantastically. And not to give it away but the twist that comes a little over half way through the game is defiantly one of the best twists in gaming to this day. Now I could go on with praising the game and yeah I really love the game however revisiting it now I do see some issues present that feel the need to bring up, For starters the gunplay is quiet sluggish by todays standards and so trying to land accurate shots just feels awkward to control at times. Although I will say I do still enjoy using most of the guns in the game it's just that they don't feel fluent to control. The plasmids on the other hand while cool and many of them are fun to use a lot of them I found to be useless a lot of the time and just found myself using like 4 of them a majority of the game. A common complaint among players that I agree with is the two different endings and how one is objectively worse in both a narrative stand point and a gameplay standpoint because in the long run you will receive less rewards by the end so really what's the point of the evil path. And the final boss as everyone who has played knows is kind of dumb and doesn't really make sense but I can forgive these two blights on the game as they were apparently the only prerequisites from the publisher for the game so whatever. Overall the game is still fantastic and I would say a definite must play for most gamers out there.. This is a very big classic that I can play over and over again. It has pretty much everything you would expect and it does not hold back in **** you into the underwater city of Rapture. This game is so unique for its time and is truly special. The story of Bioshock is simple in concept, You play as someone whos plane crashes in the middle of the sea and following the light to a lighthouse, decends into the underwater city of Rapture run by the ruler/bad guy Andrew Ryan. What follows is a epic story/quest to not only escape but help those who want out as well. I don't want to say anymore than that as this is a game you really need to experience first hand yourself. Audio diaries scattered throughout the world flesh out what the city USED to be like and adds a extra layer of depth to the story and game. Gameplay is also excellent in bioshock. It is a First Person Shooter, However what makes this unique is the special powers you can get in your arsenal or ""Plasmids"" as they are known in game. These powers allow you to do crazy things like shooting electricity at your foes or freeze them or use telekinesis to throw objects at them. You don't get all these powerups at first so as you progress you get stronger and stronger! To maximize your power and potential though you need to go after the big brutes knows as Big Daddies...These brutes are the hardest creatures to take down but if you can take them down and rescue or harvest the Little Sister (Which also detemines if you have the good ending or the bad ending) you get your ADAM (Currency) and get even more powerful. What makes this so clever is that if you want to go for the good ending, you dont get alot for it but you get the good ending, however if you want to make the game easier for yourself, you can go for the bad ending and get powerful BUT you will be bad in the process. It is the constant battle of good v evil which makes it just superb. Final thing to mention I think is the world of rapture itself. This city is very immersive, one of the most immersive worlds I have played in. The way the city is falling apart and parts where the water seeps into the environment is very well put together. Overall well designed and a BIG part of the game. It is almost as if the city itself is its own character. In conclusion, I think it is safe to say this is one of the all time greatest games that came out on the Xbox 360/PS3 era of consoles. There is a remaster which includes all 3 games in this series together in one bundle. If you have never played this game or series, I would say...Would You Kindly?. There is an intense paradox, you may be confused in the game, after doing a 5-minute research on the internet, is that how it is! people say. A light knowledge of quantum physics is required for you to understand the course of the story! When I see Elizabeth, the fat of people melts and I say just watch out.Elizabeth can be addictive: D But first of all, I never recommend you to play this game because; If you are going to come here without playing the previous bioshock games and call this game aga, I recommend you to buy, play, not like it, do not make a bad review. Let me state this from the beginning! Let's come to the issue of weapon variety, you have a lot of alternative weapon options, should I sit down and buy that gun for half an hour? I thought. I should be awarded a gold medal for finishing at difficulty in 1999: D. Don't hesitate and play BUT! Please go play BioShock 1 and 2 first, please :). People in the ''Negative'' reviews section who hated this game are just ****. This game is good.. Probably the best Shooter in my opinion. 100 times better then Cod. Bioshock is a very fun game.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Great Story.......................Great Score.....................Good. OVERALL - 98% Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 10/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay Value - 9/10 To this date there hasn't been a game that has created a better atmosphere and world than Bioshock. When Rapture is revealed, the world feels tangible and real. That mixed with the amazing story and twists made my 2007 16 year old brain fall in love.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bioshock is one of the best games released on the Xbox 360. Its clever and thrilling story is a blockbuster in comparison to many of the primitive and unimaginative shooter games released around the same time. A wonderful steam-punk mix between FPS and RPG. Must have!. A mesmerizing game. Made to break the boundaries of regular videogame production.. A absolute masterpiece. An amazing game and a must play for people who like story driven games.. An amazing game. The story, characters and the setting are all unique and interesting. Gameplay is fast and satisfying. Only downside is the hacking minigames which really slows down gameplay and is more annoying than fun and engaging.. Incredible, after 13 years later and still a amazing game, the gunfight is fun, the graphisms still look good but the story is mind blowing, never an fps game blow my mind like this , bravo Irrational Games. Really good and atmospheric game, but the gunplay is mediocre, and infinite is better. Truly one of my favorite games of all time and I played this game to death. Recently replayed it and found that my first impressions have not changed. Shooting mechanics and so on were nothing new, very much the same as everything other shooter out there. What sets it apart, the skills and how fun the mechanics can be with the variety of options you have to take down enemies. Havoc physics are great. The story is also fun and entertaining! I love the graphics and the beauty of the environment. Truly a must play game.. As good as it gets when we are talking abut story driven FIrst person shooters! Constant story twists left and right sheik delivering some of the best gameplay of its time. The atmosphere of this game is engulfing.. This game is just great. Game play was amazing, and the story was great. Gun play in this game has aged pretty well, and is a blast. The atmosphere of this game is excellent, and the story had quite an unexpected twist. This game is great.. Bioshock is one of if not the most beautiful games I've ever played and not just in the conventional sense. Every piece of this game is encompassed in atmosphere with a story that may be one of the best in video games. Rapture is a wonderful yet tragic backdrop to the gameplay, of which is on par with games like half life 2. There are so many ways to approach this game and (at least on normal) I found that I could switch between them at a dime. From sneaking around with a wrench to freezing everyone in your path there are so many mechanic to explore. That said it is not perfect, aiming down sights is a bit of a mess and the camera item is not entirely balanced but overall it really holds its own. Overall Bioshock is a celebration of not just video games but all art. This is one for the history books.. The atmosphere in this game was amazing when I first played it, I remember being pulled in and hooked by just the demo. I don't think Bioshock is a perfect game, but it's definitely one of the best games ever made. This is one of the first times in gaming I remember a story really standing out and surprising me. There really is nothing else out there like Bioshock and I guess that's all I can say to sell it.. Even in 2019, this game is still really good. I think this is one of the more unique game i know. I really had fun in my playthrough, from beginning to end. The atmosphere is fantastic and you can approach combat in a lot of different ways. The only con is the hacking game who can get repetitive. Otherwise, I can easily recommend this game who deserves my 9/10 rating.. A piece of art. Such a refreshing game in a world of the sam","bioshock is one of the few ""must play"" games for all gamers . it's a creative game, with an exciting story and setting . the story can be convoluted and difficult to follow, with many players finding it hard to engage with the plot . the game's pacing can feel sluggish, particularly in the early stages ."
170.Super Mario Sunshine,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good game for the NGC but the controls feels really clumsy. The water spray can be painful sometimes and the lack of different worlds is unfortunate especially when you come after Mario 64 and before Mario Galaxy. Super Mario Sunshine gets 29 Wario Points from I, The Wario Enthusiast. This is not a Wario Worthy game. Definitely my least favorite of the Mario series. Its a decent game but nothing that I think I'll ever replay. When 100%ing it there are way too many random difficulty spikes which got annoying real quick. The blue coins are miserable and a terrible attempt at increasing play time.. Sunshine is a very weird title. On one hand, it takes most of the great stuff about 64 and expands on it but on the other it feels less creative, because of the focus on being “ summer vacation” themed and the addition of plenty more repetitive collectables (the blue coins are not fun). The additions to Mario’s moveset are all welcome, with F.L.U.D.D. being the highlight of the gameplay, but something about it has always felt off. The movement in this game is too buttery, and often times you’ll find yourself struggling to position mario correctly (ironically enough this game could have benefitted a lot from the ability to crawl, one of the few things they took away from the moveset). The game is also filled with a lot of tiny challenge levels that test your platforming skills, which are always welcomed in a platformer, but instead of raising the difficulty a bit to keep the game engaging, most of these challenges end up incredibly harder for no reason (because of the less reliable movement) making a lot of them just straight up not fun (LOOKING AT YOU CHUCKSTERS). This review might sound negative but you need to keep in mind that this is 3D Mario we’re talking about, this stuff is virtually flawless. Sunshine is the most challenging 3D Mario, and not always because it wants to, but it’s still a blast to play. (What were you expecting from the spiritual successor of Super Mario 64). It’s an 8. Very good game.. It’s a banger. The first CGI animated Mario game ever. A classic even 22 years later.. Mario Sunshine gave me one of the craziest videogame experiences of all time. This piece of game is either heaven or hell. It has some of the most godlevel stages in 3D Mario but at the same time this game is so broken and bad made, that it frustrates and literally tortures the player. You can see on ""Worlds"" like Lido Sirena that this game had so much potential but failed to use it because of time problems and stages like the **** machine or the chuckster level. Overall my experiences with this game were really crazy but I kinda love this game even with it`s many flaws. !!!WARNING DO NOT PLAY MARIO SUNSHINE AT 100%!!! THIS COULD RUIN YOUR WHOLE EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE WORST STAGES IN THE GAME, WHICH CAN BE AVOIDED BY JUST PLAYING THE MISSIONS OF THE ""WORLDS"". 8,95/10. A very good game for the GC platform, however with some issues to control Mario. Anyway, it provides an incredible experience in a completely new ""world"" (island), with nice graphics and soundtrack.. Very mixed bag. Am playing 20 years or so after release, so I bear that in mind The stuff that it does well it does great, but the bad bits are horrific. If they finished the game and polished it off the way it should have been done this is easily a 9, however I can't justify higher than a 7 and would almost lean towards a 6 for the amount of infuriating broken levels it has.. Don't let the nostalgia fan boys mislead. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is broken, unpolished, untested, and unfinished... With that being said it's my favorite 3D Mario Title ever. It may not be as polished as modern mario games, but it makes up for it with a lot of quirkyness and personality. The game begins with Mario being sent to jail, and then later forced to clean up black goo as community service. One of the coolest parts of MS is the fact of how far it will go with the island resort concept and environment. Each and every level is based around something water/resort based. And if you want more traditional 3D mario, you can have that. There are countless traditional 3D Mario challenges that are one of the best parts of the game. The idea's don't always pan out, and the difficulty may scare some players away, Additonally the remaster could have used a few quality life imporvements like more safe states, and even some bug fixes that could fix the overlal perception of the game itself. But with that being said, the game still continues to try out idea after idea, and the ones that do pan out are great, and I personally enjoy more than any other 3D Mario game. The level design, music, flud pack, fludless levels, and hubworld all create for a great game.. A fun Mario adventure and great game overall, just with small issues like some not-so-good level design.. Mario sunshine is game with a great concept and a bunch of charm, that is held down some by frustrating levels and being unpolished. It's overall still a good game.. The gameplay and controls are not as good as I expected. The animations look like low budget kids 3D animation series from early 2000s. The visuals are interesting and the story is goofy. But the gameplay is still fun to master.... Super Mario Sunshine admittedly takes some time to warm up to. It's quite a divisive entry in the Mario platformer lineup because it felt like such a drastic departure from the rest of the series. However, many of its oddities contribute to its charm. I love how cohesive Isle Delfino feels, I was super intrigued by the story and voice acting, I enjoyed exploring the sandbox of the game, and I even enjoyed a lot of the mechanics. There are some things to criticize, like the segments where F.L.U.D.D. is stolen from Mario, highlighting how much of a crutch the mechanic lends to the game. Or how many of the blue coins are hidden extremely poorly. Or trying to push the watermelon across the dock into the blender. However, Sunshine as an experience probably gave me one of the most consistently enjoyable Mario experiences ever. The concept worked so well that they reused it for Paper Mario Color Splash and Bowser's Fury!. The worst Mario game ****. They made everything worse from super Mario 64 - most notably the camera is somehow even harder to control than its predecessor and the side somersault triggers anytime you turn around and jump. Mario Goes To Prison, Truly And Amazing Premise, If only he had met ted Bundy who was in the cell next to him. Is my 2nd Mario game favorite. Everything is perfect. I love a lot searching Blue coins. I hope Nintendo can make a remake about this game some day or a HD remake just as they did on SM64DS. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I understand that a new player might find this game frustrating at first, and that's fair. But once you understand enough how the physics work, this game is serious fun. Its my favorite video game ever.. This game is utterly want in the worst possible way. This game is Mario 64 without all the good stuff. Whoever made this game should be ashamed.. Mario 64 was about breaking into the 3rd dimension, setting a new standard for games as a whole. Mario Galaxy was about conveying emotions such as bliss, joy, wonder, and even grief; all while saying ""**** gravity, am I right?"" Mario 3D Land was about translating the 3D Mario formula into a handheld setting (64 DS got there first, but that's another can of corn that I'll save for later). Mario 3D World brought Multiplayer fun to the mix, and blended the tight levels of 3D Land with a hint of Mario Galaxy's grand music. And Mario Odyssey was effectively the revival of the collectathon genre reminiscent of the N64 days of DK64 and Banjo-Kazooie. So what did this game do, I mean aside looking so dang gorgeous and handsome for it's time? Well... not much. But I think that's a blessing in disguise. While all the other Mario games were made to showcase new technological or formula advancements (while also being fun, I'm not dissing any of them), Sunshine was just able to focus on being ""a game"". ""Ooh, a second analog stick!"", yeah I think that part is less an advancement in tech and more simply a quality of life upgrade. Controlling F.L.U.D.D. feels slick and tight. And I'd have to say that this is the first game where Mario's movement feels complete. Few of his moves in this game have even become staples of his arsenal for the years following, such as the super-ground-pound and the wall slide. Others, like the corkscrew-spin-jump, haven't seen the light of day again, but I must say I don't see why they haven't returned; that move feels awesome to use. Isle Delfino is a wonderful, gleaming paradise, and it awaits you in Mario Sunshine with doors wide open.. Nothing to say on my side. Love the levels the sunny worlds and the atmosphere of this game. The music is great. But the water canon is an amazing idea and they made it into one of the most fun Mario powerups ever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Graphics are 10/10, but gameplay and controls 3/10. The difficult of the game is 100% related to the bad controls.. The visuals and setting are very beautiful, the sound is also good and the plot is captivating enough. However, the controls are far from smooth and that sums to the game's highly variable difficulty between levels. There will be times when you'll be having a good time making progress, but there also will be times when the game suddenly raises a lot the difficulty bar at the next stage or chapter. Those moments of high difficulty will act as a wall in your progress, as those challenges will be unavoidable and may get you stuck. And maybe worse than all that is the fact that most of the challenging moments of the game are just difficult due to the clumsy controls and unpredictable physics.. I love this game a lot, and it's probably my favorite 3D Mario game. That said, it is VERY flawed. Its highs are high, but its lows are extremely low. Thankfully the lows are very few and far between. The controls are just tight and responsive as 64, but with a few moves removed. FLUDD was a great addition and makes this one of the most fun Mario games to just move around in. This game would've been a 9-10/10 but the **** machine alone brings it down. Definitely recommend it though.. Really fun at every point and has my favourite setting of any game in history. Isle Delfino is really fun and immersive and feels like it’s lived in. The world feels very connected and is always a joy to run around in. From Bianco hills to Sirena beach and Pianta village I always feel very immersed. Gameplay wise I would say there are a few things that are clunky and janky due to development time and the game being rushed out but some of these things make the game really funny and unlike any other. The best example of this being the infamous **** machine and getting Mario stuck on it. I think the fludd adds some really great movement to Mario and fixes the lack of a method to save yourself if you fall. In its predecessor Super Mario 64, if you fell there was no way to save yourself. But In Sunshine if you fall, you can save yourself with fludd. Another thing to add is more linear structure of the game. Some people have a huge problem with not being able to skip certain shines and while I certainly can see why, I don’t really mind it all that much but I do think the system in Super Mario 64 was better as it gave you more freedom. Next the shines themselves. This game has some highs and lows in terms of shines. Some lows are the Lilly pad secret shine and **** due to the rushed development time were very broken and difficult. But as well as the lows, this game has some incredibly high highs. Shines such as Mysterious Hotel Delfino, The goopy inferno and maybe controversially I really enjoy the final level, corona mountain. The boat can be janky at time but it’s really fun in my opinion. Time to talk about Delfino Plaza itself. Delfino plaza is easily my favourite hub world of any game. It just has a feeling unlike any other game. While Peaches castle and Rosalinas comet observatory are great, I feel as if Delfino plaza has more life to it and more to do. However some things that I’m not such a fan of are the boss fights. It’s a shame that I have to fight shadow Mario 7 TIMES throughout the game. It feels very repetitive after a while however I love Petey piranha and I think he has just the right amount of fights. Another boss some people might have a problem with is king boo. While I can see why people would have a problem with the rng aspect I never really had a problem with it because I think I was just getting lucky. Overall I think that despite all the glaring flaws, this game will give any GameCube or lucky switch owner using 3d all Stars a great time and its so worth your money. Super Mario sunshine is a great game and I highly recommend for anyone.. This game is huge. Nintendo often does sway from the original Mario formula in their games but this defiantly works. Oh yeah and I will also love GameCube.. Better than 64. Controls very good, fantastic atmosphere ,music is great and is overall a pretty big improvement over 64's gameplay, with only a few problems that makes the game not be a 10/10. It can be vary janky at times, and is surprisinly difficult at points. Some missions are very annoying, and somewhat questionable. It feels rushed in some areas. Basically it lacks polish. I guess this is indeed a required taste.. The completely new and unique world that Mario finds himself in is what makes this my personal favorite 3D Mario. The addition of FLUDD gives the game a feeling completely different from previous Mario titles. The one word that comes to mind when describing this game's setting is ""vibrant"". From the bustling overworld of Delfino Plaza to the sub-worlds within, this game is downright enchanting. On another note, the soundtrack in this game is just about perfect. I still go back and listen to the soundtrack on its own pretty frequently. The tropical music gives this game that extra bit of life that sets it apart from previous entries. The story is nothing we haven't seen before, aside from a very different reason for Mario to initially be forced to stay on the island. Although, the introduction of a new sub-villain is yet another unique part of this game. This game is very much worth buying and playing for any gamer young or old. Even after twenty years.. Best 3D Mario game by far. It's fun and more importantly difficult, definitely most difficult Mario game.. The Best Mario Game of All Time.. For the 1000th review, I’m giving Mario Sunshine a 10/10.. If you have ever played Super Mario 64 and liked it, then this game is up your alley. The controls are almost exactly the same, for the exception of those used by the F.L.U.D. The F.L.U.D. gives you the ability to spray water in multiple directions as well as use the water for different methods of propulsion. All in all, short of not confusing the map with the F.L.U.D. controls, the game controls are easy to learn. Super Mario Sunshine is a Player's Choice game and is well worth it. This game brings back some fond memories and meshes them all together in a great package.. In my opinion the best Mario game.. Excellent 3D Platformer with beautiful graphics, especially the water. Some cheap side missions here and there and wonky camera, but overall controls and plays great.. Gameplay 10/10 Story 8/10 Performance 10/10 Characters 10/10 Music 10/10 Content 10/10. Being very pretty and rather quirky, Super Mario Sunshine takes the basic premise of Mario 64 and gives it a sandbox-style environment that makes it feel very similar to Banjo Kazooie...although not quite as good. Jumps can be unnecessairly awkward - especially when you're against the clock - and the camera can be erratic so for those reasons it does not feel as ""special"" as some of the other Mario games. But it is still a damn fine game in its own right if judged on its own merits.. The game is very repetitive. The camera is not great, it can frequently get lost behind objects. The worst part is being kicked out of levels and having to travel all the way back to them, not just start the level again, when you lose a life. There are also some parts of the game that are far to difficult to be any fun. I will not be recommending it, nor ever playing it again.. My second favorite Mario game after 64 and a worth successor, The mechanics with ""Flood"" are fun, difficulty is good and the amount of shine sprites is huge too! i Got no idea why this game was not very popular back then. I even like this one a bit more than Odyssey. My score is 91 - 100.. Fantastic spiritual successor to super mario 64. Controls and camera angles clunky at times but overall a fantastic mario experience.. Super mario sunshine is best game ever i love playing super Mario sunshine and it part of my childhood . ️️. In my opinion, the best Mario game, I love the tropical atmosphere of this game, and the addition of F.L.U.U.D was amazing. It's very satisfying to use it. The game's camera is good, the controls are good, and the soundtrack is, in my opinion, the best soundtrack ever made in gaming history. It's a shame that the game was released for such a failed console like the Nintendo GameCube.. This is so close to being perfect, it sadly has some odd choices when it comes to the stages and the hub. I loved nearly everything but i won't nit-pick here.. The levels are great, the control you have on Mario is good, it could be better, and the voices are the only thing that gives it an 8. Don't worry about the 0 score ratings, because they probably have not beaten the game. The people that say this game is too hard need to get good. Super Mario Sunshine has some of the most compelling and colorful graphics in any Mario game, and it's music is impeccable. It's very fun to play, even when it gets extremely difficult in the secret courses, they even got me frustrated at times. The controls are buttery smooth, although may be a bit controversial based on the player's point of view on it. As a person who has beaten this game twice, I'd say it is a must play for all gamers if they want a true challenge. Super Mario Sunshine is very controversial, but it is one of the most breathtaking adventures a videogame has ever offered.. The graphics, story and world is really charming but the game is designed in such an annoying way that it makes me hate every facit of my life. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game singlehandedly killed the Gamecube. The collision works... less than half the time. I was speedrunning this steaming pile of **** and I literally clipped through the wall in one of the secret stages and died as a result. Why would ANYONE like this game? One word: nostalgia goggles. Take 'em off, people. This game is worse than 64, worse than galaxy, this is the sonic 06 of the mario series and I am very disappointed.. ""wah wah wah game too hard and too wepetative"" - anyone who complains about this game Easy, fun, silly goofs and gaffs for the whole family, what's not to love. If you don't like this game then you are a silly baby doodoo head. Grow up and learn to overcome some difficulties, show some commitment and determination, it's not that hard, its not that time consuming, and its awesome and fun. Good game 10/10.. When I played it back when it was new it was great and tough. Now It mostly seems as if the game wasn't play-tested at all, because it's flaws are clear as day now. The ""action"" music is stressful, the controls didn't develop since Mario64 and the camera is one of the main reasons you fail and/or die. There's a crapload of glitches. If you die a level have to reload and you can't skip the cinematics when entering a level again. Should be named S&M Sunshine instead, the worst of the series imo. Nintendo forgot how to balance a game, and went back to the times of NES Ninja Turtles or SNES Lion King. FFS, the game is bad.. Insanely underrated, after just playing for the first time I'm blown away by some of the creativity and level design, however, while the game has very high highs, it also has some very low lows, The low parts don't happen often though. There is so much garbage in this game that I could talk about it for hours, but there are so many instances where everything is just perfect that it would be a disservice to discuss its imperfections. The core movement is a joy to experience; I often found myself running around the hub world with no real objective simply because it was fun to do so. The levels are top-notch and are always hiding secrets around every corner. The music slaps and the story is simple but charming. Unfortunately we will never get a sequel but I like to think Sunshine’s spirit lives on in Odyssey.. Probably the best controlling Mario game. The shadow Mario levels are fun and challenging and the FLUDD is an interesting mechanic that makes this game unique.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Mario Sunshine is full of fun surprises in a fun setting, but the main mechanic is cumbersome.. This is a great game overall but lacks polish and is a step or two down from the typical Mario game’s quality, let alone 3D Mario. Satisfaction in the game is everywhere. The aesthetics are top tier. The water graphics ace the test!! The menu sounds and little things like that also show for great presentation. This might be my favorite Mario theme. The gameplay is still good, but there is noticeable movement jank. The GameCube controller's deep sinking triggers satisfyingly shoot water from the new FLUDD, eliminating most crouch moves from SM64 but elevating everything else (sans punching/kicking). The stick flicks great for reliable side jumps, twirls clean for the trickier spin jump, and the C-stick grants more flow to camera control. The now gone long jump is made up for by the belly slide jump, no longer being able to directly wall jump out of it. Using FLUDD to prime your belly slide feels great, but you can’t hover nozzle out of it. Larger jumps may be harder to aim so the Hover Nozzle over corrects, but you’re going to end up relying on it because of imprecise platforming. It moves rough for long distances. When you hover at a ledge, grabbing it after is inconsistent and not snappy. Even when you teeter on an edge, it is inconsistent whether you will drop to the ledge or fall off entirely. The Turbo and Rocket Nozzles are cool one note powerups that end up feeling underused, like Yoshi. The Blooper racing is very similar to Turbo but if you hit anything, you lose a life. You can’t slow down or even get off by yourself once you get on. Ironically, the least fluid movement in the game is the swimming. You go too far with each stroke and underwater segments have tank controls. This feels worse than in SM64. There is a fine smoothness to the controls that outweighs the flaws, with quenching animations, but the jank adds up over time, blooming especially in level design. There’s wonderful free movement in these open spaces until the camera gets stuck (no option to invert it). Despite water being a key theme, most missions don’t engage with large bodies of water enough to constitute as 'water levels'; it’s just the safety net from platforming. It's 3D Mario so all the levels are pretty good. They finely compliment the generally smooth movement. There are a lot of options to get off the beaten path, not just being 'easier' shortcuts but fun alternatives. The earlier levels noticeably have higher quality. 'Delfino Plaza', the hub world, is the most fleshed out ""level"" in the game! All the powerups, including Yoshi, are the most fun and useful here; Shines are hidden well and mostly out of order; Blue Coins have good distribution. The major downsides are the sub levels, like **** and Lily Pads. All levels have a sub level without FLUDD, inconsistent with the main game, that showcase the lack of precision jumping Mario has, sourcing the difficulty. Most, if not all of these missions self-awarely have accessible 1 Up Mushrooms early on. Many of these are mandatory, too, so there’s no escaping the bad game design. There’s a lot of fun new toys, like the hyper responsive bungee wires. But then we have broken toys like boats and Chucksters. Even other optional missions, like Lily Pads and melon rolling, seem luck based with horrid physics, as if getting good at the game doesn’t apply. We also have literal casino slots. Also, there are friendly NPCs in all levels, adding hints if you’re stuck on a mission and adding to a lovely vacation feel. Thing is, you have to do one mission at a time in strict order, requiring you to slog through the many below-average missions. There’s barely room to skip around as the first seven missions of all levels MUST be completed. The game is not worth completing 100%. However, the presentation admittedly counters a lot of the jank for me. Blue coins are cool as 1/10th of a Shine and non-level-locked, but their distribution is not worth exploring for. Also, there is no good coin counter if you already cashed some in, so try not to do that either until you get all 240. While the game has significant jank and noticeable room for improvement, the smoothness that it does have alongside the feeling of warm sunshine overpowers it greatly. ‘Bowser’s Fury’ also uses Shines but is “open-world”, untypical of the 3D Mario being “open-level” (“open-worldS”?). Levels in ‘Sunshine’ are viewable in backgrounds of other levels and it’s unsatisfying to Turbo into an invisible wall from 'Plaza' to the 'Airstrip'. Becoming open world with lessons learned from ‘Odyssey’ (checkpoints, continuous Stars, auto saves) would be enough quality-of-life fixes to potentially make 'Sunshine' the best 3D Mario game. Fans have been optimizing the game longer than Nintendo (check out 'Sunburn')! Heck, I played this in 60fps on a WiiU.. Although this game has many problems like the camera and the different glitches in the game, It is my FAVORITE Mario game. It was the first Mario game I EVER played! It definitely has a special place in my heart because of the memories it gave me. I hate collecting the blue coins!! I'm pretty sure its considered ""torture"" in some countries. Anyway, I love this game for the gameplay and the memories it gave me when I was younger!!. Still like it more than the Galaxy games. Sorry, but sandbox Mario is simply more fun to me and before Odyssey this was the tightest he ever controlled. That stuff matters to me more than 100% completion, which is something I've never bothered to do with this game.. Listen The Game Is Fun But Way Too Hard No Too Hard AND Glitchy I Hate This Game. This game is my favorite game ever it even has story not a lot but no plot holes and the movement is very good the intro is fun and this game is creative when they are limited to just a beach theme you’ll go from shooting a dancing plant to rolling a watermelon down a hill it’s a game you should try out. Such a grandiose and, despite the hectic pace of releasing the game at the time, a super creative as well as just bubbling over with fantasy Mario masterpiece. A difficulty level that you desperately try to find today and certain daring decisions that brought the needed pep. I would give anything for an equal sequel.. Super Mario Sunshine is a spectacularly bad game, and it is as a bad as its predecessor on the N64 in Super Mario 64 was great. I remember playing it for the first time and hating it from the very start to end, and it is a miracle I even beat this game now looking back. I honestly do not know what Nintendo was thinking while making this game because it puts Mario in a situation that no thinking person will ever see as fun. The game starts with Mario being wrongfully accused, and then is sentenced to community service that consists of almost entirely of cleaning up gunk and graffiti. (Does this sound like a game you would like to play?) It gets worse. You have a talking water pack called FLUDD, and Mario is absolutely useless without it, and the courses are just bland tropical regions filled with gunk. Contrast that to Super Mario 64 that took you through ice, fields, caves, lava, sand, inside a clock, and up in the sky besides just water, and you have no attachments that make you useless without them. The soundtrack pales in comparison to Super Mario 64 too. Super Mario 64 established some of the greatest pieces of music in the entire series to this day. Sunshine’s soundtrack becomes grating extremely fast when you spend most of the time cleaning up the same gunk in the same places over and over again. There was one genuinely funny thing in this game though, but I did not catch it until well after I gave away the game. The Sirena Beach stage when viewed from above has the hotel’s beach patio arranged in the shape **** Cube Controller, and the hotel is in the shape of the Game Cube console. Fitting when Super Mario Sunshine is a Game Cube game.. This is the BEST GameCube game in the planet it is so calm and relaxing by the ocean with all of the fish in the ocean and especially I am a huge Super Mario Fan unlike Disney's Party which is the WORST GameCube Game is because Disney's Party does have a terrible mini game with based on the Disneyland attraction Mad Tea Party called Round & Round which had bad awful fast and loud music and giant strawberries falling on the players and killing them which is extremely bad and made me worry for Corduroy the Bear and his buttons and I care about Corduroy the Bear and his buttons a lot. And that mini game in Disney's Party Round & Round reminded me of when Corduroy the Bear's button fell in a storm drain which made me extremely upset but at least they got the button out of the storm drain and put the button back on Corduroy the Bear's overalls and Corduroy The Bear does have two buttons on his overalls this year and forever and Mickey Mouse's iconic red shorts are overalls too.. One of the most enjoyable and creative mario games, the new and different ideas that this game introduced are inventive and makes this game more unique and memorable compared to most mainline mario games, the water jetpack is a great edition and it adds more to the complex and varied move sets and the controls are very smooth with some fun level design and amazing locations and delfino plaza is the best mario hub world and the soundtrack is so good, unfortunately the game has a serious lack of polish with some of the glitchy missions and the blue coins needed more indication on how to get them all.. Mario sunshine a fresh entry in the 3D Mario series. Starting off wit the visuals it looks pretty good and holds up but is nothing amazing. the controls feel very good with the help of flood making up for minor problems in movement allowing you to adjust your horizontal and vertical movement. The biggest problem with the game is the level design many of the levels are unrememberable, tedious boring and unfair. this game would have surely been a 9/ 10 if the levels were more enjoyable to play. I collected every shine and some were just a chore to play though. Overall, this game was very enjoyable to play and holds up to today I just don't think it can compare to many of the other big 3D Mario games. 7/10 (great). I **** hate durians Why does me review have to be this long what is this a school assy. I say this game can be fun at times. I like the water gimmick but it's not as good as the spin mechanic in the mario galaxy games. While the flood mechanic can be fun, it also is intrusive because sometimes you get confused on how to aim when you aren't in hover mode. I wish they would use the turbo nozzle more. As for the level design, ","the controls feel really clumsy and the lack of different worlds is unfortunate . the blue coins are miserable and a terrible attempt at increasing play time . the movement in this game is too buttery, and often times you'll find yourself struggling to position mario correctly ."
171.Thief: The Dark Project,"I was obsessed with this game back in the day. However, replaying it again after 25+ years there are some things I completely forgot about. Issue 1: A lot of levels are built like big confusing mazes with no rhyme or reason to the layout. The real reason was, at the time, levels were small and were often built to be confusing on purpose to make longer gameplay. Issue 2: I forgot about all of the annoying non-human enemies you can go up against. By level 2 you start seeing zombies that are very hard to kill and annoying to sneak past and level 3 gives you weird lizards that spit clouds of acid that are everywhere in packs. I so wish they stuck to the human enemies with the fun dialog and voice overs to listen to. I was in love with the first level but after slogging through the next 2 I quickly lost interest. In the 3rd level if you make an easy fall into a watery cavern it can take you MINUTES to get back to the same spot, after battling through more enemies and that's only if you know the map layout. Lots of poor map design in some levels. The game is a classic that started a whole genre that games like Assassin's Creed owe their existence to, but some things just don't hold up today.. I loved this as a kid, was an amazing experience, sneaking and continuous thrill of being caught :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first thiefs were the best. This game series is basically 10/10 sneaking and thieving. The factions and characters are more well thought than you'd imagine.. Top notch stealth action. You don't need another setting. Top horror experience cause of the horrifying sounds. You won't be able to play it until you're 100% ready. Gameplay: combat mechanics 7/10 stealth 10/10 atmosphere 10/10 Gameplay as ****: 9/10 Story 9/10 Graphics 8/10 Sounds & music 10/10 . Looking Glass magic * * *. Thief is one of the best video games ever made, that got lost in the shuffle. Things that make this game so brilliant are pacing and gameplay. The story is immersive as well. But for 1997 this game impacted MANY video games and although it is considered to be a masterpiece today, i think more people should play this game. The game feels a bit outdated but i think that is not an enough excuse to not experience this great video game.. You better go and make sure you've got a set of taffin' headphones, taffer!. It was one of the first great stealth FPS games released for the PC. 1998 was the year that 3D gaming really became the standard and the game uses it to its full potential. The game is very story-driven with cutscenes between levels. The AI is a bit broken with sometimes the enemy is oblivious to you and sometimes it knows exactly where you are. The graphics were good for the time, the sound and music was amazing. It really has a nice atmosphere. The UI is very outdated and the movement is a bit stiff. The maps can get a bit Mazey at times which is a big negative for me. The second half of the game is pretty bad. Thief didnt age well in my opinion: The AI is very bad, sometimes it is even unrealistic and disturbs the immersion. The graphics engine is outdated, even with HD mods. The levels are big and complex, so you get lost often, what is frustrating. The map is not very helpful. The controlling is uncomfortable,if you search for an item in your inventory. **** beginning of the game is great: perfect atmosphere and great setting. It is a great idea to play a thief exceptionally and not a hero again. in addition stealth games are interesting instead of the 38237rz32th shooter. Anyway I prefer Splinter Cell.. My most favorite game of all times! A wonderful combination of stealth, adventure and some horror elements with one of the best, unsurpassed atmospheres. Imho, this game just lack any possible flaws, all its elements are where they should be. The story isn't the main focus point of this game, but nevertheless it's great. I love the fact that even the dialog between two guards that you can overhear at the beginning of the first mission isn't there just for some funny speech but is connected to the plot. The pure stealth missions are interchanged with ones where you get to do some action, levels set in human environment are interchanged with ones set in some weird places with terrible and dangerous creatures. Thief: the Dark Project is a perfect game by any standards possible. I would recommend it to anyone except, of course, for people that don't like stealth at all.. This and Thief II: The Metal Age are the best stealth games ever made. Other Thief games have nothing on them. Especially not the crappy Thief 4, that totally butchered the brilliant concept of the original games. A masterpiece. A fundamental part of the Golden Age of the Immersive Sim triunvirate (alongside System Shock 2 and Deus Ex). Redefines what immersion in a game should be.. this is my childhood! spend endless days and nights with it back in the days.. Amazing game. It's 2018 and they have not made a game competes with Thief yet.. Thief 1 is a MUST if you like stealth games. The game (although it has 12 missions) can take hours and hours of time to go through. the levels are realistic, the story is great, the graphics are good even though this game is old and the sound design is on point. This game has absolutely now flaws.. Thief Gold has great stealth mechanics and good level design. For its time some of the concepts were revolutionary and many of them still hold up today. Fun features include hiding in shadows, different amounts of noise generated by walking/crouching on different surfaces, and ascending vertically through use of rope arrows. Stealth attacks do more damage, which can be rewarding, though occasionally they would not work and instead do normal damage. Ability to save anytime is very useful to create your own ""checkpoints"". Combat can feel clunky, blocking is actually less effective than walking backwards or jumping to dodge attacks. Most levels are well-designed and fun to explore and find secrets/loot, however a few levels are maze-like and can be frustrating. The map has no player-marker, it just highlights the area where you are. Some mission maps are very difficult to comprehend. Cash and items are not cumulative but vary from mission to mission, so looting everything doesn't have much benefit. Bought for $1, played 26 hours (replayed some missions), great stealth game, highly recommended.. Thief: The Dark Project is not only one of the greatest stealth game ever conceived, it is also undoubtedly one of the best games ever made. Excellent and authentic sound design, emotive voice acting, with level design handled by Ken Levine, the director of SystemShock and BioShock. And his work on the game definitely shows, because the level design is great. Sure, the graphics are admittedly abysmal by today's standards, so this game is therefore not for everyone, but if you like stealth games or games that execute good tension, give this game a shot.. Any time spent playing Thief is time well spent. Other games put through the test of time fail, but Thief stays at the top with one of the best atmospheres in gaming & the amount of different playstyles you can play with. Sure, it's graphics & models may be outdated, but you can fix that relatively easily with a simple mod or two. If you're going to play this game, good luck, you're in for a masterpiece.. Thief along with Metal Gear shaped the stealth genre and to this day still nothing can rival this first person stealth game... You are placed in huge mission areas and its up to you to use your wits and problem solving skills to over come each and every obstacle Garrett(MasterThief) faces. Thief Gold has an incredible amount of depth partly because the man who is behind Bioshock had a big influence on this game. On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running with the big boys even today. R.I.P Looking Glass Studios. It's a ""pure stealth"" action game in medieval fantasy setting. Usually you can't kill even 2 enemies in an open fight, if they attack you at once. So, you need to sneak from behind, stay in the shadows, extinguish lights and so on. The stealth genre basically started with this masterpiece.. One of the greatest and classical masterpieces of all time! Thief: The Dark Project or Thief: Gold, developed from the now defunct company Looking Glass Studios puts you in the Steampunk Victorian times, with creepy music, great atmosphere (believe me this game scares me to bits!), great story line and great voice acting! The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece. Stick to the shadows at all costs!. The first and easily the best of the Thief games, The Dark Project follows the snide yet consummate professional thief Garrett as he engages in a heist with the payday of the lifetime. It's a simple and well told tale of someone biting off more than they can chew. Garrett's ultimate heist takes him to a variety of locations in the City ranging from mansions, prisons, tombs, and the churches of religious fanatics. The experience never seems to get stale as you sneak through dark corridors, avoiding detection from your enemies while stripping the place of valuables. There are a few missions that don't hit their target as effectively as they should, otherwise this is probably one of the best and influential stealth games in history. A must play for fans of the stealth genre.. The first game of the groundbreaking Thief series. Dark and haunting and full of the undead. Scary and engaging. The missions are hard but rewarding. This is a must play and own.. For its time and even now, Thief the Dark Project is a masterpiece in stealth games. Despite the obviously aged game engine, the game is very immersive and atmospheric with some exceptional writing. The stealth is obviously Thief's main strength: finishing a level undetected without killing anyone is immensely satisfying. Thief does have it's gripes: the game burdens itself with too much zombie and burrick-killing which did little more than make the game punishing at times. The Dark Engine also comes with a couple of annoying quirks; namely slippery movement and fiddly inventory management. These issues however, do little to make Thief any less of a classic.. This game is one of the greatest classics I ever played fun, great and funny voice acting. The game engine is perfect for a thief game, great level designs and characters.. Outstanding game with a new way of playing for action-based titles. The hide and sneak way of achieving one's goals are really adding to the great ambiance of this world and demands something completely new from the player. The story begins in what seems like an authentic historical setting and as the story unfolds, things take a turn for the weird. This game combines so many fascinating ideas and manages to tell its story flawlessly.. I was lucky enough to play this game when it was released. Still one of the best game out there. This game had everything: charismatic main protagonist and villains (Garrett, Viktoria, the Trickster etc.), a great new engine (Dark Engine which featured new alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques... all quiet revolutionary back than). Great game and level design (It was designed to be largely unscripted; events, instead of being pre-defined by designers, occur naturally.) Great gameplay (Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first-person perspective, and not full frontal action.) Atmosphere (The game takes place in a metropolis called ""the City"" which has been noted to contain elements of fantasy, the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.) Cutscenes (They were partly animated, partly made with live actors and motion capture technology). Even today the Thief series is the ultimate stealth game in gaming history. The stealth system was very new when the game was released. The player had to rely on the environment to avoid being detected. Shadows could be used to avoid notice; a monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicated the player character's visibility level. The player could lean, crouch, climb, swim and run, among other actions. Surfaces caused varying amounts of noise; for example, carpet is quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud. Enemies were reacting to these factors, and players could manipulate these element of gameplay to distract NPCs etc. Go play Thief:TDS than go and play the rest of the series.. It should tell you something that, 14 years after its release, Thief: The Dark Project still inspires awe and devotion in its fans. Story, voice acting, and level design don't age; if they're great at release, they're great forever, and so it is with Thief. All that remains to review is the technology, and this is where this game and its sequel, Thief II: The Metal Age, really shine. Even the best-conceived and -executed games of the late '90s put their advancing age on full display, with the exception of Thief, and here are the reasons: (1) After all this time, no game has made better use of sound. With headphones or surround-sound, you can literally close your eyes and know where every conversation, grunt, footstep, dripping fountain, and crackling torch are located and how far away they are. The sound design of Thief remains simply astonishing, and it's a critical part of the gameplay; you navigate through the sprawling levels and enthralling missions as much by sound as by sight. (2) Similarly, the use of light and shadows remains unsurpassed. (3) The NPCs have superior AI compared to most games, then and now. Their actions and reactions are varied, complex, and extremely sensitive to how visible you are, how much noise you make, how far away you are, whether you have a weapon drawn, how long you've been in hiding after once being spotted, and so on. And they talk like real human beings! I'm not sure there was a single line of repeating dialogue in the entire game. (4) Finally, the graphics, though limited by the technology of the day, remain surprisingly fresh because of the Dark Engine's unique, angular building blocks. Characters and environments are constructed from skewed polygons that make up for a lack of resolution with a slightly weird distortion, as though you're looking through a kaleidoscope, or perhaps on an extremely low dose of acid. That's not a perfect description, but suffice it to say that Thief looks quite like no other game. Thief IS like no other game. You can buy it cheap these days, and if you love gaming and are open to an experience that challenges your mind more than your twitch reflexes, it is absolutely worth the price.. The whole Thief trilogy are classic games. I recommend that you buy all three in a bundle. I don't think these games will ever wear out. The graphics are good, sound is very good and re-playability is very good. I'll never forget when I first heard the 2 ole guards talking about going to the bearfest and the underslung cheek spikes. I had to just stop and laugh. These are truly the Best sneaking, blackjacking games that have ever been produced or for that matter ever will be . The entertainment value of these games is much more than you can imagine. I hope these 3 never go away.. What an incredible series. Thief was so different in it's time. And even now games are still catching up. With a sound system built into the entire that rivals modern games, an intriguing and dark story, and tense gameplay that changes the way you play games - thief is a hallmark of excellence.. Be aware of the walls, thief. They see everything.. I whole-heartedly join the chours: a timeless classic; THE most immersive game I have ever played (besides perhaps System Shock 1/2 and a little less Deus Ex 1); if you have never played it you are missing out on an incredibly stunning style of play; as another reviewer mentions, if you do want to remedy such a short-coming (as serious an offense as this is :) get the Gold version on ebay - it is exactly like the original just with a few excellent missions added; if you want to read more, go find my Thief 2 review i just wrote; what i do want to mention here though are some of the things that make this game so outstanding: (1) the immersiveness of its atmosphere and the Thief universe - sure, crysis is eye-candy, but this is the real immersion deal! because of the setting (sneaking and looting combined with the player's weak offensive abilities) and the excellent programming, you will use your senses much more than in any other game - you need to pay constant attention to lighting, visual cues, and sounds made by you and others in order to stay hidden and avoid trouble; and the fresh story with its twists and turns (including a betrayal that costs you dearly and your attempt at revenge) makes this a novel and great experience; what's more, the sequel - Thief 2 - IMO greatly expands on this by making the Thief universe even more bizarre with its mechanist enemies and setting (2) (may not apply to all) the outstanding localization work - i own the german version and the voice acting and translations are unbelievably good - the exclamations made by guards chasing you are sometimes outright funny and if i didn't know any better i would have thought that the game developer was a german company (3) the outstanding fan community - humdreds of fan-made missions were made and are still (mostly) available - some even surpass the original missions in quality while others give the game an entirely new twist (and satisfy any cravings for just running around and slaying foes) (4) where Deus Ex offers (often simplistic) alternative ways of getting to the same goal, this game offers entirely different styles of playing the game - ranging from weapons-first approaches to ultimate sneaking (ghosting, Lytha's way), this game can be replayed in many different ways; (5) one of the very few games that i have ever played that really make me miss my experience of playing it for the first time - i remember the nerve-wracking atmosphere of trying to stay hidden; and then all of a sudden there are the moaning zombies! and later the spine-tingling rattle of the haunts and their infernal 'join us, joins us now!' if you've ever played Thief, and you're still not on ebay right now, then i don't know how to help you ;). what a perfect game! i love all the Thief series! atmosphere, story plot, game play... everything is perfect! even though i started Thief 2 first in 2010, it was great. My first love affair with a computer game. Thief is a masterpiece on every level, Warren Spector has crafted a chilling yet humble experience that overflows with charm and unique atmosphere unlike any other.. Phenomenal game considering when it came out. One of the most interesting and unique atmospheres in gaming even over a decade later. I would give this game a 10 if the a.i. was better. A.I. is one of the key ingredients in stealth games considering you have to analyze movement and patterns of behavior to be successful. The a.i. falls short compared to modern games, but it's impressive for it's time. Few games have left me with as much satisfaction after completing a level. Not only is it satisfying, you get to watch awesome cut scenes and mission briefings. Anyone who likes stealth oriented games should check this game out.. Pure stealth was relatively untouched before Thief came out, and it's a testament to how good it is that it's now almost a genre of its own. Incredible atmosphere, ambience and suspense make this one of or even the greatest game I've ever played. It encourages you to remain a sigh on the wind, a flicker of darkness in peripheral vision, an anonymous, undetected shadow. Combine the low fantasy, pseudo-mechanical medieval backdrop with the tense, nail-biting gameplay, and the result is an utter masterpiece. Play it properly and they'll never even know you were there.. One of my favorite games of all time, along with the sequels. Thief brought a breath of fresh air to 1st person 'shooters'. It has to be the best stealth game series I have played to date. You sneak around and hide in shadows and either knock people out or put an arrow in them. Your missions are almost always to get into someplace and steal something. And the storyline is just awesome. It's way better then that joke **** ""Assassin's Creed""-- which I discovered was nothing close to what Thief was. I have yet to find any game that matches Thief in style. I found a website where a group has made an open source game that is like Thief (but it is buggy yet and relies on fan-made mission). Recently I read that Thief 4 is being worked on, but so far no release date! I only had one part of the game that I didn't like, and that was where they put zombies in the game. It wasn't that bad, but I like going up against people that seemed to have some intelligence not some mindless walking goon that made a noise when it saw or heard me-- but thankfully it was only in one part of the game so I can't really complain that much about it. Overall the entire series is just fun to play, and I recommend it to anyone that is tired of mindless shoot 'em ups that have weak or no story lines.",the game is a classic that started a whole genre that games like Assassin's Creed owe their existence to . a lot of levels are built like big confusing mazes with no rhyme or reason to the layout . this game series is basically 10/10 sneaking and thieving .
172.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,"I was so young the first time i tried this game that i had fun for hours just smashing my character against the floor over and over. Later i would actually play and beat the game. Good old times.. Short, but fun. Good - the movement, speed, camera angles, and character model animations made the me feel like an amazing skateboarder. I can't even do a kickflip I'm real life. It allowed me to live that dream. - the level designs were diverse - camera movement is overall very good. Rarely was there an awkward moment. If there was, it'd fix itself very quickly. - the mission goals allowed me to experience many parts of the map. - an image of the objects I had to interact with for missions on the goals screen was much needed help for clarifying where I need to find them, without giving too much away. And I usually didn't have to fruitlessly search for it. Bad - can't kickflip or grab trick while jump is being pressed - You can land in the most impossible angles when coming down from a ramp. Which is very unrealistic. - sometimes I feel it's too easy to go over a ramp. - the buffering on grab moves feels a bit too short. Sometimes I try to buffer a grab move after a kickflip, but it doesn't happen cause I pressed the grab move too early. So I wish the buffer window was a bit bigger. - no second grind after first grind on the same rail - sometimes I would be able to land in horizontal, which looked very awkward. So here I am, growing older all the time, looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind.. Very fun game to boot that made a whole lot of people suddenly interested with skating. Or at least with skate games. Never liked too much those downhill levels, but all the open ones are fun.. Story - n/a Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics - 9/10 (dreamcast version) Soundtrack - 10/10 Levels - 8/10 Replay value - 10/10. best game ever made. especially the soundtrack. you get songs such has ""policetruck"" and ""superman"" and that one song that sounds like the southpark theme.. I remember playing this with my little brother for hours when I was a kid. it was such a unique game at the time, and so well done. the controls are great, the stunts & tricks you can pull off is really satisfying, and trying to complete all the objectives is really addictive. the levels are fun, music is terrific, and it runs and looks great for it's age. if anyone still hasn't experienced this game, I highly recommend it.. The first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater still remains a solid game. Though it may have been outdone by it's own successors, it features many memorable stages and smooth gameplay, while remaining easily approachable. It's still a fun game to go back and play today, and offers an experience that you cannot get anywhere else.. It's a game like this that dared to start an all new franchise that started great from the beginning. Live up the legendary Tony Hawk in his all new skating adventures now.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game that made Tony Hawk a household name was certainly worthy of all the praise it received. Importantly the controls felt very natural meaning that with a bit of practice it was possible to pull of all manner of tricks and combos. It certainly looks dated now but even today it is more than playable.. Considering how much the series has improved, all the sequels are much more recommendable. This one is for the hardcore fans of the series. Buy Pro Skater 3 instead.",i was so young the first time i tried this game that i would just smash my character against the floor over and over . later i would actually play and beat the game . i can't even do a kickflip i'm real life. it allowed me to live that dream .
173.Fire Emblem: Awakening,"Fire Emblem Awakening is a masterpiece, and easily the best 3DS game of all time. The soundtrack, the gameplay, the characters, the story and presentation, every aspect about this game is a 10 out of 10.. Fire Emblem Awakening in my opinion is one of, if not the best RPG Nintendo has to offer and one the best games of the 2010s.. While Fire Emblem Awakening is not among my personal favorite Fire Emblem games, it is still a very solid game. The map design as a whole is solid but nothing too memorable. There aren't very many maps that I look back on as particularly amazing but there also were hardly any maps that had me frustrated either. The music in this game is honestly kind of forgettable save a few glaring exceptions like Don't Speak Her Name and Id Purpose. The story is a mixed bag, with the Plegia arc being really good, the Valm arc being okay, and the Grima arc being pretty bad. This game definitely has one of the most memorable casts of characters in the series, most of the characters in this game are quite likable (save a few glaring exceptions). The animations in this game are generally quite underwhelming compared to a lot of other FE games. While I know this isn't technically the game to introduce Casual Mode (that being New Mystery), this was the first FE game with a worldwide release to have that feature, and I personally gladly welcome this addition (although most hardcore fans would disagree). I understand the arguments against Casual Mode, but in my experience it makes playing the game a lot less frustrating. In most cases, unless you're doing an Iron Man run, you'll probably be resetting a chapter to prevent that unit's permanent death. So rather than take up even more of my time constantly having to reset, the unit is just out of play the rest of the battle. Keep in mind that unless it's near the end of the chapter that you still suffer a downside of that unit being unable to accrue any EXP for the rest of the chapter, which risks that unit falling behind, so it's not like there's no risk/reward to playing on Casual. I honestly didn't have too many units get defeated on the Casual run I did anyways, so it didn't have too much effect on me anyways, but it did certainly save me some time. Classic is still there for those who want the permadeath experience, but I definitely welcome the addition of Casual. One other gripe I do have is that this game features the return of the Battle Save feature, which is where you can basically make the equivalent of a save state whenever you want, which is very nice. However, this feature is only available in Casual when I think it would actually be a lot more useful in Classic. In Casual, while they're useful just as a precaution in case one of your Lords gets defeated, they aren't quite as useful since you can live with the consequences of a defeated unit. If it was in Classic, you could have bookmarks to go back to in order to save yourself more time from a unit dying instead of a full chapter reset. Arguably this could be abused, but if done in moderation, it could just mean going back a turn or two and rethinking your stratagem instead of having to go back all the way to the beginning with a reset. But this feature is nonexistent in Classic, which I think was a poor move in my opinion. The overall gameplay experience of this game is very enjoyable and I can definitely understand why this is the game that rescued the franchise and got a fair amount of people into the series, even if it's not a personal all-time favorite for me personally.. Slow to start but picks up quickly if you stick with it. And you should, because it's worth it.. Classic. That's the best word for this game a pure classic managing to propel and save the series. Great characters, links, combat, solid story and ideas. Combine this with modern approach and leniency to new players plus gorgeous art style, good music and awesome animated cutscenes. Definitely a great time.. Tried to play it, because people told me that it was almost a masterpiece.., tried to play 5 chapters, but it is impossible, so slow paced, the story is literally random, the characters all seeing lacking something.... A truly to-the-masses appealing game that took nearly 2 decades of niche but unique stories and ""saved"" the franchise by dumbing it down to oblivion. It utterly flops in regards to story, characters, and gameplay. - Story 4/10: The story is divided into 3 parts - and while the first one is fairly decent - the second two are completely trash. The second is entirely disconnected from the plot of the other two and simply just unrelated filler and fanservice, while the third is just a somehow even more cliched and boring version of the standard ""Evil Dragon Cult"" plotline - all centered around the complete void of a ""character"" that is the avatar/Robin - Gameplay 3/10: Do you sudden ambush spawns that force you to restart the chapter? Do you like a somehow less impactful skill system than the one that came out 15 years before? Do you like sending all your units walking in a straight line down a wide open plain? Then Awakening is the game for you! - Characters 2/10: Fire Emblem Awakening is a moving story about a prince trying to redeem himself and his family of his father's crimes, while his daughter desperately tries to save him and her family from a future she barely survived. Together, the bonds of family overcome all, as in trying to tear this father and daughter apart the forces of evil created their own demise. Is what I'd say if this were a better game. Unfortunately they made Robin/The Avatar a character, starting the worst trend in the franchise (No, Kris and Mark don't count). Robin is as much a ""character"" as a bowl of cold soup. Flavorless, sad, and pointless, **** all creativity and character writing into the void of the avatar - rendering all around them warped in their wake. Oh right there's other characters... wait no they're all just a loosely collected pile of gimmicks. Great. If you want a game with a good story, play Thracia. Want a game with good gameplay, play Fates. Want a game with good characters, play 3H. Don't play this game - but at least its not Blazing Blade.. Easily one of the best Fire Emblem games if not THE best fire emblem game in the series it does geneology of the holy war proud, and the biggest sin of the fire emblem series was allowing three houses to ruin an amazing system that awakening expanded upon and wash it over with horribly boring and mundane persona romances.. Fire Emblem Awakening helped revived a stagnating franchise with great visuals, and making it both accessible to newcomers, and challenging enough for veterans. It also honours the rich history of the franchise, by having many callbacks to the long list of characters, and stories since the NES days. A must buy for any strategy RPG fan.. This game saved the Fire Emblem franchise from death, and while playing through the game, you can really see how much love they put into this game.. I played the game twice and felt absolutly nothing... Lucina is best girl tho. (version 1.0). There is nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said: The game is perfect in my eyes, and it is the ideal Fire Emblem game. The gameplay mechanics are simple to understand but require time to master, the story is phenomenal, and the amount of content available for the game leaves no stone unturned. The amount of replayability this game has is astronomical, and this game will always be the Fire Emblem I recommend to people when they ask which one they should play first.. Great writing and gameplay is held back slightly by uneven difficulty and mid-game padding.. Having spent far too long on what is suppose to be a 40 some hour game, I have to say that I just love Fire Emblem Awakening. While I know my love affair isn't quite the same for the series as some others, I can at least say anyone interested in playing Awakening will have a great time with it. It combines the best elements of the series and improves on them making for a one-two punch for an amazing game. Genuinely one of the best games you can play. The writing is good and the game play even better. The music pops off and the graphics where great for the 3DS.. A memorable, innovative game. Great story and fun gameplay. Despite its semplicity, it is capable of exploring deep philosophical themes whilst narrating an engaging and epic tale. The OST is top tier, and the cutscenes are spectacular. Something so ahead of its time that to this day, still feel incredibly modern.. They kept the story quite simple, and sometimes, keeping it simple is actually a good thing. It makes you enjoy other aspects of the game more.. A great starting point for a new fire emblem fan, but very mediocre overall. Uninteresting characters, boring map design, mediocre story, etc. The music and customization easily propel this game higher than I would have given it otherwise, but its direct successor both has better music and much more in depth customization, along with better maps. Awakening is a great game but compared to the other games in the franchise it doesn't rank that high. The gameplay is fun but is done better in Engage and Echoes, the story is passable but isn't even able to compare to three houses and sacred stones. The characters are fun but the supports you get with them are mostly mediocore and feels forced in so you can have the children character and most characters don't get supports with characters of the same gender. Awakening overall is a good game and I recommend it but more as a first game than as anything else.. first FE game I ever played and before I knew it I was hooked, love the combat, the strategy the amount of customization, I even went nuts downloading a ton of DLC cause i couldn't get enough, took awhile to get into the story but it's getting more interesting as I play which I like, 40 hours into the game and I'm still learning new things abilities and just insane how much this game has to offer one of the deepest RPGs I've ever played and I'm now a HUGE FIRE EMBLEM FAN.... 10/10. Probably the deepest and prettiest SRPG I've played. The rules are simple but it gets convoluted as more systems get layered on. Keeping track of every unit during the large-scale battles ends up a bit of a chore. The music is fine and the graphics are beautiful. Most of the character designs are great but their portrayals are generally pretty flat. I put too much pressure on myself to complete every battle perfectly. Personally, I prefer Advance Wars where the stakes aren't so high!. In retrospect it was very overrated but it's still an excellent entry point into the series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best fire emblem and a must for 3DS, modernizes the saga and raises the mechanics that are the basis of the following installments.. I have not finished the game yet and I am already ecstatic for another playthrough as I am realizing things I missed/could have done differently. Fire Emblem series are gems and this one really shines, All of the possible combinations and support conversations/relationships, I really can't wait to explore even more. The lore in this game and the interactions really immerse you. I truly love the characters. 10/10 for me. Not to mention I haven't played around with the DLC much yet. I can't wait.. My opinion of Awakening has really changed since launch. I think the game is perfectly fine for the new crop of casual fans. It has more accessibility options than past games, and it features a lot of grinding and over-powered child units that more causal or rpg gamers will enjoy. But Awakening is not a very good Fire Emblem game. On Normal difficulty, it is far too easy. Any knowledge of who the best characters are, knowledge of how to use pair-up optimally, how and when to use second seals properly, and what classes are good for units to go into will completely trivialize the game on Normal difficulty. No grinding or marriage is necessary. So this leads me into Hard Mode, which takes a very casual, easy game and transforms it into one of the most unfair and inflexible entries in the entire franchise. Instead of just adding more enemies and increasing the stats to stiffen the challenge, the game features same-turn reinforcements - otherwise known as Ambush Spawns - and these can be brutally unfair as you have no idea how many of these reinforcements are coming, how many waves of them will come, and what types of weapons you will be dealing with. Awakening absolutely loves creating 4-8 new enemy units and moving them on the same turn, and many of these units do high damage and have 1-2 range weapons, making it extremely difficult to protect weaker units despite being safe when you ended your turn. Because of this, the game heavily restricts which characters you can use because most of them will die. By Chapter 17, the game devolves into using Chrom and Robin the most, where these will probably be the only two units that can survive the random ambushes, turn after turn, because they become so overpowered. Tharja and a few others can also do this, but 90%+ of the characters in the game are basically useless due to poor bases and classes. Even characters like Sumia become liabilities because so many enemies and same-turn reinforcements use Silver Bows and super-effective tomes. To avoid unit losses, you are basically forced not to deploy them at all and solo the game with just a few paired-up characters. It is the least rewarding and least fun way to play the game. So basically, Normal difficulty is too easy and Hard is way too frustrating and inflexible - there is no middle ground here. Hard mode devolves into just using S-tier characters with over-powered builds that snowball out of control. Any sense of strategy is completely gone, and that is why Awakening is a bad Fire Emblem game. Normal mode I give a 7, and Hard Mode I give a 0. It's not that Hard Mode is hard - it's easy if you just use Chrom and Robin - but it's incredibly boring and unsatisfying and poorly balanced and unfair when playing blind.. | A Must-Play JRPG | This is one of my favorite strategy games that have come out, with fun puzzling gameplay, an exciting story, and minor but vital mechanics that lift the game up in quality. Although the story does slow down for a subplot that was rather unnecessary, I thought (for the most part) it was engaging with the time-traveling mechanic and story turns, that made this story stand out more so than other JRPG stories. The gameplay was very interesting. The small mechanics that made this turn-based game different really added a lot, from the pairing system, the triangle system, and the skills that really turned the tide in some match-ups... it was all great. But by far, the best aspect of the game is the character support system. That is what makes this game great. Almost every character is unique, memorable, and interesting. The way the developers did that was great, with great character dialogue and interactions. There are even some characters you want to use not for skill, but for who they are. That's a sign of how well they made some of the characters. Overall, the game is amazing. It has a few other flaws, from the constant spawning of enemies and the small grind needed when playing in order to beat certain levels with a little more ease. But the game is still amazing and I highly recommend it.. This was my first fire emblem game and it's still one of my favorite games to this day. The plot and all it's little moments still bring tears to my eyes. The game play is beginner friendly and never fails to give me a good time. While not as complex as other fire emblem games, it's a perfect gateway game.. Good music, characters, gameplay, overall pretty enjoyable. Its not a super immersive experience but for sure makes its mark on the strategy rpg genre. Awakening was the best fire emblem on 3ds. For sure one of the best games on 3ds. So first let's address the elephant in the room. Or should I say horse? Every character has hooves for feet and these huge horse like legs. They're ugly. They look like they have been kicked by a horse. Beastiality isn't my thing. My next waifu being a donkey, doesn't really appeal to me. Next the battles are awful and I am getting rid of this game after just a short time playing because of it. I played a side quest, made a silly error early doors and started again. My first move was identical on my rerun but the outcome was completely different. I redid this. Started again 4 times. Every time a different outcome from the same move. So I tried a different character. Same thing, random outcome every time. Then I went a step further with this second character and gave them support. They actually did worse with the support than without. Now I am someone who plays Fire Emblem on easy, if the option is available. I am not a major tactical strategist but come on, it is still a strategy game. I still love to plan, even if I'm not very good at it. How can I enjoy a strategy game that is purely down to luck? That is totally game breaking. You can't make a strategy for complete randomness. It just made the game pointless. Next, the dialogue. I like text and I don't like stupid OTT Hollywood cr*p voiceovers. Give me text any day but please not with a one, or two word audio byte for every line. I don't want to hear constant nonsense like, hey, you sure, OK, urgh, that's right, let's go, or any other rubbish they spout. OST. It's Fire Emblem - It's great. Graphics? It's OK. I like the 3D stuff and it looks nice in general but then everything is totally ruined by forementioned horses. I'm not some FE purist that only likes old games. Radiant Dawn was my first FE and 3 House's is my favourite game ever, if anything I prefer newer titles much more but this is just rubbish. It has just cost me £35, so far it feels more like it's worth about £2, if that. That is just for the OST. I'm not really enjoying the game at all. For reference 3 House's is a 10/10 for me and Radiant Dawn an 8.5+/10. I feel I would enjoy a 3rd playthrough of 3 House's, or maybe actually playing my 4th house DLC a lot more than I'll ever like this. No one, absolutely no one is giving me the magic that psycho Edlegard did. She was an exciting character. These characters in Awakening have left me disinterested in them, I'm really not that bothered to find out what they do next. Dull, a polished turd, a gee gee's wet dream. A weird, dull game that sounds beautiful but looks horrific and plays badly.. Mature story with many characters to customize and grow. Many characters that feel unique and purposeful in both the story and in battle.. This is definitely one of the best games the 3DS ever gave us. An entertaining game, with a story full of time travel and a threat that entails a final sacrifice. It has a good soundtrack while you are in the battles and it is definitely the best 3DS title on strategy. 9/10. My first in the series - the story drags on a bit, but a fundamentally enjoyable game.. i loved this game really good and would highly reccomend for anyone who likes turn based rpgs. This game is basically perfection. And if you are very fickle about your JRPGs needing to have a good story. Well sit back and relax, because you are in for some nice plot twists. The only complaints I have is they milked the dlc and it is probably best you get this physically and not digitally. If something happens to your 3ds, there goes your 50+ hours of gameplay. The 3ds has a really bad hinge. Also, a online mode would have been nice, but not really needed.. Fire Emblem Awakening, also known as FE13 is a really good game. Still, the story was a mishmash (maybe only in my opinion), but ending of the game was pretty cool. Gameplay was very, very good - as in every canonical Fire Emblem game.. Fire Emblem: Awakening is a beautiful game. This statement is not only one referring to its aesthetics: Its story, numerous characters, setting, gameplay/mechanics and technical performance are all immaculate. This is one of those rare gems that almost certainly deserves every accolade it receives - where its predecessors on the Game Boy Advance were great video games in their own right, Awakening set an incredible standard not just for Fire Emblem games, but for video games as a whole. Despite perhaps feeling a bit trite and not without flaws, Awakening's story is told in a way in which you can likely look past its shortcomings. Beautiful cutscenes, especially for 2013 (and especially on the 3DS), tell a classic Fire Emblem tale, but with some slightly more interesting twists and turns than usual. Additionally, the voice acting and dialogue are exceptional, and whatever corniness the story possesses is easy to look past because of the convincing acting of those portraying these characters. In totality, these characters may be a bit one-note, but in tandem, they possess surprising depth considering their volume. While all the voice work and storytelling make this game widely accessible, the gameplay is similarly inviting - the Casual mode (in which your units/characters are not permanently gone upon their death in battle) allows players to experience the game without being consumed by the threat of losing their troops (though this option is available to the masochists among us). Additionally, while this game may be among the easiest in the series, the game still has quite a high difficulty ceiling, and those craving a challenge will likely not be starved for one here. Overall, there is precious little to complain about with Awakening. It is an excellent Fire Emblem game, it is an excellent game, and it tells a wonderful story with memorable characters. For the most part, veterans and newcomers alike can enjoy what could possibly be the best game on the 3DS, and is easily one of the best (if not the best) Fire Emblem game ever crafted. I am not sure any game could come more highly recommended from me on the 3DS - it is an absolute must-play for all 3DS owners, and will hopefully be discussed for years to come as the classic it deserves to be labelled as.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fire emblem Awakening is one of the most unique experience ever. Pairing up while the story is tense and every character have their meaning and purpose. Awesome game and true savior of franchise. As I get more and more into Fire Emblem I like it even more. Awakening is loads of fun, even seven years later. I'm a really big fan of modern Fire Emblem but I can definitely see a lot of the roots of the classics here. Unfortunately, the map design is extremely uninspired. Loads of empty fields and just generally boring areas. Love the soundtrack, though. Play it if you haven't; it's one of the best 3DS games out there.. I love this game! It was my introduction to the Fire Emblem series. In hindsight I realize that it was unbalanced compared to other games, but it’s a lot of fun regardless.. story - 1/10. confusing, lots of plot holes, and not creative in any way. kind of ruined the game for me. gameplay - 10/10. I LOVE the battle system, and all the mechanics. so why is my rating for the game 6/10? because the gameplay is a great formula, but it is SO repetitive, and that's why I stopped. visuals - 7/10. a game like fire emblem is not visually strong, and does not need to be. my only complaints are when the characters are talking. during that, the graphics look muddy, and kida gross. but the cutscenes are really nice. would I recommend this game? to any turn based strategy fan, YES. to a fire emblem fan, HELL YES. to more of a platformer guy like me, it was hard to get into. but still lots of fun. would recommend.. I played through Fire Emblem Awakening after having played through Fire Emblem Three Houses, and if I had played them in the other order I would probably score this game a bit higher. However, after having played Three Houses first I can't help but feel how dated Awakening feels. The story is somewhat dull, the music isn't as good and the graphics... Well it's a 3DS, so I guess it's about what you can expect. The fights are generally very good but the game suffers from a dull story and lackluster dialogue. It's still a good game worth playing through if you're a fan of Fire Emblem though.. this game is good and stuff and it think you should play it. this is because it is very good.. Fire Emblem Awakening is an experience. It is One of the best Nintendo games I have ever played. First off, the gameplay makes you think. You have to decide to use who against what enemy, and then you have to think that there weapon might break, and you have to decide who you'll pair up, and so on and so forth. The story is super immersive and engaging. I would say that there are maybe 2 1/2 story lines through the whole game, and they are really good. it also has great payoff from beginning to end. The story is also helped by amazing hand drawn cutscenes. Man, the 3DS was a powerful handheld but this is super good. The characters are very good, and fleshed out. My personal favorites are Chrom, and my favorite, Lucina. The only thing that I can complain about is that some of the levels kind of feel filler, but even that's pushing it. I'm very lenient on giving 10/10s, and Fire Emblem Awakening is SUPER close to that score. I give it a 9.8/10.. When I first played this game when it first released I thought I would hate it. Anime artstyle, turn-based JRPG, a lot of things that would usually turn me off from a game. However I gave this game a chance, and I am glad I did. Everything about this game is great, the gameplay, characters, cutscenes, voice acting and its presentation. The game has tons of replayability too, I've never gotten bored of continuing an old save to max out characters or start a new one to relive the story. One criticism is the story. The story is pretty good, but it is saved by the great character writing at moments. If the story was great on its own then this would be a 10. Another criticism is that the dialogue for supports got stale at some points further in the game but 90% it is solid. Though this criticism does not detract from the games value I'll tell you that. It is still one of my favourite games of all time. Lets just say there has not been a game I've wanted a sequel more to than this one.. After playing it for a second time on hard classic mode , I've think this is a completely above average Fire Emblem game , This game has made me realise dead skills in fire emblems are intolerable And the level designers just gave up , But it has some brighter spot like you can make any characters into superhuman dat can kill anything, But even this part is kind of underwhelming because the main character U play as can single-handedly complete the game , But I do like this game even it is too easy to bake so you have to make your own rules to make it enjoyable sometimes. God, I started playing and I couldn't stop. The game has a story that kept me focused on it and with some really good points, the main characters and some are very good, the gameplay is great, good soundtrack, good sidequests and interactions between the characters. Really good game. The story is very good even though it is generic in some points, it has a plot twist, two moments that I found exciting, some interesting tactics, a great pace and a very nice ending. The part I thought was great about the story is how most of the missions in history advance the plot for a credible reason and often have a reason behind it to happen (it's not: a group of underdogs is attacking the village, let's protect it or you are going somewhere and in the middle of the way you are intercepted by guards, it happened in the classic Fire Emblem and this time). The way it is told is much better than its predecessors thanks to better hardware and a larger budget. The last half of the game mainly some of the missions have strategies behind the political reasons for happening (which they already had before), which was really cool. You feel Chrom's growth during the story. I chose the end of the 'protagonist' and in the end they did something very interesting. My biggest problem with the story was that all the villains were unmotivated, just bad. Fire Emblem likes to pretend it ended the story in the middle of the year. The gameplay. Being brief is Fire Emblem and his gameplay is great (it was literally hard to stop playing), the map and the battles in them were a really cool addition. The mechanics of ""Pair Up"" between the characters was a unique addition to this Fire Emblem and very interesting, generating new tactics only possible in this game. The last maps I found bad, they are very open and involve much less strategy than the first ones. Until chapter 15 I found most of the maps great, but from 19 onwards for me the game was lost in terms of maps. All side quests (except the first 4) are very good, adding to the characters and gameplay, literally. The cutscenes are great (but there could be more), the only problem with them is because they are Fire Emblem and their characters can die the cutscenes are all with immorrible characters (and there are very few that if they die it's game over) which damages the story a little and his immersion, not even his character, who is a protagonist, does not end up actually appearing thanks to the customization that the game provides. And the graphics are pretty decent for the 3DS. The game has a lot of characters, actually too many, and the fact that you can support S rank among practically all the characters made the conversations very generic and mediocre in general (Intelligent Systems laziness but anyway), considering how many characters did a good job all the Suports I saw I found at least ok. Supports between parents and children are one of the best. I saw a lot of people complaining that it was almost a 'dating yes' or something like that, but the romance is almost non-existent even in the 'supports', excluding the S rank. Chrom is a very good character has an ok development (but I thought he was good too much). Your avatar has personality and interacts a lot in the story, I liked the way this system was made (I thought I was a good kkk character). The soundtrack is very good but it doesn't have as many OSTs as I would like. The dubbing is very good although practically nonexistent. I played on Hard and the difficulty was good but I found the game relatively unbalanced. On Hard, enemies are stronger and there are extra or more frequent reinforcements. The mechanics of ""Pair Up"" becomes much more important in this mode, although you do not need to master the mechanics completely to be successful. One problem is that if you want to have a really good troop of characters you will need to grind, otherwise you will have 4 or 5 OPs characters, 1 or 2 okays and the rest is to die and the worst is that you can reset the game only with these 5 OPs and this is one of the reasons I said that the game is unbalanced. I grinded a little to have 5 or 6 okay characters besides the OPs.. Fire Emblem: Awakening is one of the weakest entries in the series in terms of story and gameplay alike, but is a great starting point for anyone looking to get into the series who isn't particularly experienced in the tactics RPG genre. It lacks substance and I find it difficult to return to after playing other games in the series, but is incredibly accessible and fun despite its flaws, with strong art and music along with a fairly nice presentation.. Bad Maps and bad story. this game Is a ovverrated Sorry for my grammaticaly im not english. this is the first good fire emblem game, because permadeath is stupid and dumb.. 9.0/10 A tactical game with incredible gameplay, characters, and story. An astounding experience from start to finish.. First of all, I've noticed most of the bad r","the soundtrack, gameplay, the characters, the story and presentation is a 10 out of 10 . the music in this game is honestly kind of forgettable . the animations in this game are generally quite underwhelming compared to a lot of other FE games ."
174.Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings,"A landmark in the strategy game history. One of the earliest games that I have played as a child and drew me into the strategy genre of video gaming.. He won hearts with his incredible voice. Even today, it is essentially no different from the fourth game, which is its most current version.. I still play this game every few years. It is probably the best strategy game I've ever played. Highly recommend!. Strategy game of the century always will be a classic but I gave 8 because workers should lumberjacking when I sent them to build lumberjack :) These kinds of things are fixed in The Conquerors I guess.. I only have one word for it: legendary. One of the best games I've ever played from my teenage years when it came out up until today.. I'd give it 11 if I could. The storytelling,art and soundtrack are amazing very immersive but it has the same problem that many old games have, the game mechanics are hard and annoyingly complex since technology didn't allow them to create very long or complex games they resorted to making the games difficult so the players would expend more time on them, and with the wide variety of more modern and better games that are available today not everyone is willing to go trough this to finisht he game.. The best RTS game. I'm not fun of the genre but this game is fan and not boring late game as the most of RTS games. I spent many, many hours playing this game as a child. I was so young when i first played it that i didnt even know what i was supposed to do, and i just collected materials and builded a nice city lol Many years later, i would play online regularly, and discovered that i **** at the game, and then abandoned it.. My childhood in a nutshell. Even today, more than 20 years after its release, I can say that it is one of the best games I have played in my life.. The first game I played in the game room with my friend. From then on, I became fond of the medieval style.. Actually abysmal game, which was only popular because of the absurdly high amount of sweaty gamers of the mid 2000's, when the average monitor had no more than 5 pixels and weighed 30lbs. Only in that era these kind of graphics and shallow strategy would be kind of acceptable. The fact that this game is now considered a ""classic"" is an absolute marvel of marketing and business strategy. The only two positive marks that this game had in gaming culture is the ""Wololo"" voiceline and the sheep (even though there should've been more of them).. One of the greatest games of all time. Does pretty much everything right, though I like the campaign of AoM a lot more.. It's my favorite strategy game. It's best real time strategy game........... 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. This very game is still pretty much playable 23 years after its release. Find me a game that could boast the same. Simple, but amazing strategy. This game is a legend. We've all had our fun in the world playing kings, fighting other kingdoms and doing goofy stuff.. Games out of politics! It's racism to take away games based on nationality!. 20 years of strategy games There are many civilizations, various types of arms, and high tactical strategy. One of the best games in my life. How much time I spent in it - just do not count. It still remains the standard of the genre for me.. One of the best RTS games. Economy-based strategy, incredible single-player modes, campaign, and a exciting multiplayer. Lots of maps and scenarios to have fun.. I remember this being the reason to buy my first pc. It was always for me the reference point for strategy games.. Best RTS around, full immersive, great graphisc and innovation with a dynamic sound. Best RTS game of all time. Period. ;) Seriously this game has everything you ever wanted in an RTS game. The graphics may not be up to date anymore but since it's 2D it doesn't grow old as fast as 3D titles do. (look at 3D games of that time and you know what I mean ...) The gameplay is just awesome, because it has. Probably the best RTS ever made. They really caught thunder in a bottle with this RTS. Everything is just designed perfectly, I would still continue playing it in multiplayer to this day, if it wasn;t for the remasters. What a game from the golden era of PC games, they don't make them like this anymore!. What I said for first aoe still counts here. It feels like a chore and I really don't find this enjoyable.. I've spend so many hours in this game as a child and I think it totally worth it. Top gameplay with numerous factions, great campaigns and a map editor that you may lose track of time in. One of the best real time strategy games ever.. One of the few games that really deserve the naming as a masterpiece. I enjoyed AoE 1, but I cant even guess how many hours I have played 2. It is both equally good for RTS veterans and players that are new to the genre. The story offers a lot, the game is well balanced and is simply a stunning classic.. Story: 8/10 (Campaigns) The Way story is given: 18/20 Gameplay: 28/30 Design: 10/10 Feelings left after playing: 19/20 Playability(Bugs and optimization): 9/10 AVARAGE: 92/100. Spend so many hours playing this game. Still remember learning to go online with a 56k to look at the official website for the things you could expect in the game when it would release. Timeless graphics and sounds. Also liked the map editor that came with it. Happy there is still an active online community.. Historically fail, good mechanisms and good graphics. A lot of propaganda and totally twisted historically draws my score down.. One of the first games I ever loved, a true classic and still fun to this day.. Good Ol AoE 2. Memory is much better than the game itself though. Only for RTS fans. Very fun singleplayer and multiplayer, but as I've started with the expansion, the ""basic"" game limitations are degrading my experience.. I always hated AOE2 let's just be clear, It takes too damn long to do anything, but time flies when you're playing, so I either decide I'm going to be productive today or I'm going to play AOE. The models or OK I guess but The animations are horrendous, if this was 1997 I'd understand, but 1999? Come on, it has 8 directional sprites and most of them don't load properly. units are stupidly slow and don't have alternate speeds, there's no time skip button or end turn. All factions are almost identical with only tiny differences. Here are the upsides: the music is good, though a bit too noisy, it needs to be ambient and not distracting. Campaigns stories are interesting but the missions are boring and have you doing the exact same thing over and over, if they could subtract base building it'd be more fun Desu. The worst part of this game is no other historical RTS game has really beaten it, don't even get me started on Total War.. This is easily one of the best RTS I have ever seen. I have played it since my childhood all the way until the remasters came out. It is well-balanced and the history campaigns are fun, diverse and historically correct.. The Age of Kings version was a very big improvement over the first AOE. Significant improvement in game mechanics, gameplay and resource management.. There isn´t much to say in terms of Age Of Empires II: The Age Of Kings. It is the best RTS game to date and has its fanbase since 1999. Everything about this game is just perfect and iconic. An inspiration for all the real time strategy follow ups. A must have!. Great game. Just unfortunate that it hasn't become evergreen and turned into a competitive game franchise like League of Legends or World of Warcraft. At least not yet.. Hail to the best strategy game in history. I still play with the same pleasure. Thanks to everyone who thinks, designs and creates.. I played this game over and over for years. Replayed the campaigns so many times, made my own scenarios. Loved it. A very good strategy game, I highly recommend it, especially to play with friends.. Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is an amazing historical RTS. So many good thing can be said about this game but the players will know this is a legend among it's genre and an indisputable wonderful classic.. Along with its first installment, the best 2D strategy games I've ever played in my life. For some reason, I do not know if due to age or the novelty of the genre at the time, none has impacted me as much as these. Without a doubt, a game that has marked an era and that most games of this style try to take as a reference. Although they only try. Impressive in its gameplay. 10/10 fully recommended.. Dynosaur game. Вinosaurs became extinct and she is not!!! Very worry game. Dont play this game ever. I just loved it. with warcraft 2, best realtime strategy ever. The 2D graphics looked much better then 3D in that time and even longer. Good campaings and great multiplayer on local network.. Father of all RTS games? It is the game I played a lot as a kid, everyone I knew was playing it, it was the game of the time.. At the time of it's release, and a few years after - this game was my standard of real time strategy. And the surroundings, and game-play and the setting of the Middle Ages were excellently made and interesting in walk-through.. I would say it is the best rts ever created with the only real competition being starcraft 2. Need proof? New civs are still being made as I write this in september 2019. Game came out in september 1999.. Note: This is a review of Age of Empires 2 Age of Kings single player campaign. I am aware that the multiplayer is where Age of Empires is at its strongest and this review does not cover the multiplayer experience. Age of Empires was released at a time when RTS genre was considered one of the most popular ones. From Command and Conquer to Starcraft, from Dune to Warcraft, there was fierce competition. It was not hard for Age of Empires to build a fan base with major selling points such as bringing real history with real heroes into our PCs and a ton of nations to play with. The Age of Kings have campaigns that could make someone who has any interest in history salivate: William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Saladin, Ghenghis Khan and Barbarossa. William Wallace serves as a tutorial campaign and each campaign offers a pretty unique experience with a standalone storyline and units particular to that nation. The game requires good micromanagement skills with its more sophisticated economy system, at least compared to other games of that era. In the Age of Kings, you don’t harvest just one resource e.g. spice, tiberium, crystal… You need to make sure to harvest wood, food, stone and gold in a balanced fashion in order to succeed. Food comes from various sources. You can fish from the lakes, you can farm, hunt animals, collect fruits etc. Hunting animals would give you a food boost, but you will soon run out of animals. Farming could give you a steadier income of food, but you will have to spend wood to build farms. Each strategic decision has consequences. This applies to the whole game, whether it is economy, expanding your base, building armies or waging wars. Keeping in mind every nation / faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, on top of the more sophisticated economy and requirement to micromanage, it is safe to say that the Age of Kings is more on the difficult side, especially when compared to other popular real time strategy series of that time. On the other hand, micromanaging in Age of Kings for some reason (whether it is the music or the color palette) is often relaxing rather than stressful. The campaigns never get boring and there is even educational value with all the historically accurate information in your missions or cutscenes. My main criticism to the Age of Kings campaigns, however, is being too formulaic. My experience with the majority of the campaigns was the following. I start a campaign. Build my base (unless the hints suggest otherwise), enemy attacks my base, I lose the game. I restart, this time knowing when, from which direction and with which units the enemy will launch their attack and I prepare myself accordingly. More often than not, this involves collecting enough stones and building a castle to the other side of a crossing and walling up the other areas to my base. The sense of playing a linear formulaic experience was much stronger when I played the Age of Kings campaign, in comparison to titles such as C&C or Starcraft. That being said, my only major criticism is something that only applies to the single player campaign. Playing against a friend with more or less even skills, is where the Age of Kings shines. As a more complex RTS, Age of Kings in multiplayer would undeniably be one of the best RTS games ever made, assuming you do indeed have a suitable opponent who matches your skills. 8.5/10. Good game with fun single player campaigns. Civilizations play very similarly though.. The best RTS ever made, it was mad then, it is mad nowadays, what are you waiting for !?. One of the great RTS games, its a bit outdated but i say its still fun to play, the campaign mode is a nice historical education and motivated me to learn more about the history of the world, the strategy is deep and fun as well, the graphics are outdated but they are enough to enjoy the game. Its the best AoE game, give it a try if you are a fan of strategy games. 8.5/10. It might not be the ultra competitive slugfest that some RTS games are, but it is easily the most fun and playable one around. After well over a decade, I still find myself coming back to this near masterpiece. The voices and soundbites are iconic to this day.. The original Aoe was surely one of the best game in his time and yes I played it then. But today I dont have so much fun with it: The mission in the campaign are very difficult, they changed it a bit in the addon fortunately. The missions are very long, so that it feels like work and not fun. Somehow the game feels very slow. In addition it is frustrating, that the AI not gives up in the base game, although the AI has no chance to come back. In the addon it was changed also. The units are bothering you with bad pathfinding. The graphics is old of course, but anyway I like it still and it is detailed. There is only a problem, when you control to many units, because there is no overview and you cant zoom to distinguish the units. So it is a chaos. Of course there are some positive things: You play some historic characters and learn history. The storytelling of the campaign is interesting. The sound is good and the music fits. you can download the forgotten empire mod, that implement new people and improve the resolution. Result: I recommend this game for hardcore gamer to know, how old good games were. The addon improves the game a lot, but Rise of Nations und Age of Mythology are better in my view.. This game has kept me for many hours in front of the computer and it was totally worth it. If you are a fan of strategy games you have to play this masterpiece!. Everyone who has played the game since childhood realizes exactly how good this game is, as well as the community that plays it. Best game for its age.. From now on I still play this game sometimes, it is one of the best rts games ever made imo, played it also alot in my childhood.. It's an RTS classic. I still enjoy this game, and that's why I will always continue with this franchise.. I can agree with the rest of the reviewers that it is not only a great game but arguably one of the best games of all time. I found some parts to be extremely ingenious and other parts to be worked on. I loved the voice actors but the tutorial had LOTS of room for improvement. Graphics are ok for the 1990s but is not the main focus of the game. Gameplay can be challenging but this rivals many other civilization games like Civilization or Tropico. The difference is its simple yet effective way of battling with other cities and decisions made in battle could cost you the war. Overall, I expect great things from Microsoft and its future updates on age of empires. It's just a good game in general. I have nothing else to say. I especially liked the campaign the **** i have actually learned something from a game this time. :). ""Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings"" was an excellent game, I did not think I would play it but I played it and I liked it, empires, maps and campaigns and graphics were very good, and the music and The dialogues were spectacular.. Brilliant RTS, and to my amazement, it is still being played. This game was my second childhood leap into PC gaming (after AoE 1), and boy, did this blow my little mind! Stellar game!. One of the classic PC games. Endless hours have been spent on this game and with an HD remaster out now, endless more could be spent on it again. A must play game.. A game that made ancient history truly awesome. I have never anything that allowed me to have so much fun, but at the same time, also served as references for our history class assignments and projects back in highschool. Back then, we didn't have the internet and we relied on these things called ""encyclopedias""! The skirmishes were very fun and I remember making insane fortress porns out of my bases. It's regretful that we don't make games this good anymore.. Great game. Would recommend to any beginner RTS fans............................................................................................................................................ possibly my favorite game of all time and not even slightly due to sentimental value. When i first started playing it i absolutely loved it, even though i absolutely **** (literally everyone beat me) only after playing for a while did i get competent. And i didn't start playing it till like a decade after it came out even still i found it an amazing game. It's just the way in which the different civilizations are balanced out and the awesome real time strategy.. its really just amazing. Realize though that if your just playing single player things could get highly repetitive to fully appreciate the game you really need atleast 6 people playing.. Game lan service is the worst service ever conceived, which may or may not work for everyone that purchases it. Also the game is very unstable, it may require many kinds of tricks to make it work as intended. The game was badly ported to new generation machines, even you have the newest generation hardware, it would still lags like hell (I can confirm that because it happened with me). The game was a classic, but the way it was ported, disgust me.. It's based on the Age of Empire Games from the 1997 & 1998. While they contain many materials, content, and strategies that is just like those in the past, this one has addition buttons/tools to use that was absent before and that it would make your work a lot easier to do. They're smart and helpful. But, the biggest bonus about this game is the effects: it looks more beautiful than Age of Empires or Age of Empires: Rise of Rome. I love the way they look. The dialogue or character talks was also a bonus that the previous games didn't include much. The content, strategy mode, and A.I. intelligence level is in the same style as the previous games. But, the game is more easier and more interesting than before.. Age of Empires 2 is a very good game overall. Basically, it's a fun game a lot, but Age of Empires I like most is the Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors Expansion. Age of Empires has good graphics for the time, and is one of the best strategy games in real world time. Its gameplay is excellent, and Ensenble Studios did work in both. In the game you have to lead a village to become an empire, have to make an army to attack your enemies and finish them. This is a type of game that calls me a lot my attention. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the games that will never get out of your head, and you will love forever. It will give hours of gameplay a game, and you will very difficult challenges to meet you, and this is a unique game.. one of the top 10 BEST EVER GAMES CREATED! I cant say anything else just fulfilling to upload it...None of the games that are being released nowadays will ever reach the mastery of this piece of art. (creating ur own campaign??? in which other game!?!?). One of the absolute best PC games of all time, top 10! The gameplay is outstanding and balanced. Multiplayer and single player, as well as campaign.... all are near-perfect. The modding capability, the AI scripting possibilities, the sound, and even the 2-D graphics. Superb. With the recent updates to allow it to run on modern hardware, and new expansions, makes it unique in the annals of PC gaming history.. One of the best RTS games with great multiplayer, excellent 2D graphics and a huge online community until it was sadly closed by Microsoft. By today's standards, it lacks automation and explanations. E.g. you won't easily find tips that pikemen are best against cavalry. And to create production queues for units you'd need to click the same button wildly many times. But for at least 7 years (somewhere between 1998 and 2006) it was one of the most played RTS games in LAN parties. If anything, you should check it out for historical/research purposes. And its graphics are drawn with so much care and detail, that if not the low resolution the game would appeal even to today's gamers.. Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, well has an average storyline, but you shouldnt buy it for the storyline, buy it for the awesome customised battles. Theres a few problems though: Its hard to record gameplay out of AoE 2, since OBS cant record it and Fraps FPS counter glitches and makes the game slow down, theres 3 different screen resolutions, one of the works, the other two go off my screen, but its from 1999 so its excusable. I will still give it a 10/10, because its so old, and were still playing it. Should you buy it? No. Buy the HD edition, it fixes all the problems above.. One of the greatest video game codes ever created. An undisputed God of computer games, and therefore gaming history. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. It's a simple but at the same time sophisticated and intelligent game. The wide variety of different modes and scenarios you can choose from ensure that it never gets old of tired. Even though it was released almost 20 years ago, I still dust it off and pop it in for a few hours of fun on a rainy day. It really is timeless. Graphics: 9.2 Sound: 9.5 Gameplay: 9.0 Fun/Story: 9.0 My favorite strategy game of all time. Nice graphics, nice online and LAN multiplayer. A must have RTS.. This is the game that defined its genre. Even now a decade and a half later, it is still among the best RTS games available. If you're a fan of RTS games, then this is a definite must-have.. It's a classic that must NOT die, even if its graphics are clearly outdated, it's fun and its AI is very intelligent (especially in Conquerors and Forgotten) though sometimes it's bugging and my enemies begin to build towers non-stop lol and sometimes they don't build artillery units but seems to be fixed in Forgotten.. This game is the gold standard for historical real time strategy (RTS) games. I best remember it for its competitive multiplayer and elaborate defenses/sieges. Well-balanced, fun, and colorful.. One of the best games so far, with much respect from me personally. It affected the RTS genre much and as can be seen from the huge community which still plays it, it is time-affection-less. In other words, AOE2 is one of the games you could enjoy in 2004,2014,2024 just as fair. In some aspects it of course got old compared to the new stuff, yet it doesn't push you away. Adding my own sense - AOE2 graphics are pleasing the eye more than AOE3 and most of the new games! :). I spent many, many hours playing this as a kid and still go back to it to this day. I love the amount of civilizations (especially with the conquerors expansion), units, buildings and maps available and of course the addictive, easy to pick up and yet difficult to master gameplay. I'll always remember this game for its great soundtrack too. My only gripes were the population limit and how you had to manually get each farmer to start a new farm once it had expired (although this was fixed with the expansion). Regardless of these minor flaws this is one of those games I'll never forget. The visuals were great for the time, and the gameplay thoroughly addictive and fun. A classic, no doubt about it. I remember playing a lot of Red Alert and Total Annihilation but this is the game that always sticks out as the best.. Great LAN play. Mostly similar to AOE II which was a masterpiece of gaming. The addition of Gods is fantastic but a little more work probably could've netted better results.. Well, to start: I don't believe how this game got less than some CoD ones, and less than those all crappy games that have only graphics. Age of empires II is one of the most creative games I've ever seen (suffered thousands of plagiarism after being released). It is basically two games in one! The scenario editor, a powerful editor which allows you to create your own world, your own game in any style (RPG, B&D, and whatever), and have the awesome multiplayer, in which you can load your own scenario, or play one of the several modes it have! It deserves a lot more than 9.0 (in my opinion should be awarded by a 9.5-9.8, because it's (if not the best) one of the best games ever! To summarize, I will write the positive and negative points bellow: POSITIVE POINTS - Awesome gameplay, and perfectly balanced; - Scenario editor with thousands of possibilities, letting you make anything!; - It doens't takes that much money from you (like those recent games, which any item costs around 10 Dollars); - Is the first one to have this theme (and well-succeeded); - Great graphics (for its time), overcoming many games made two or three years past it!; - Almost no annoying bug, just helpful bugs (like invisible unit trick, invisible tile trick, heal unit trick, etc); - It can be a noob game, for relax, or can be a fuqin hardcore game (depending the way you play it!); - Quite good ES campaigns; - Many sound effects of good quality. - Good voice actors; NEGATIVE POINTS - Some annoying pathfinding bugs; - Repetitive combat sounds; - Shadows aren't very realistic; - Water ****; - ES campaigns are too lengthy, and sometimes boring to play; - Some not well done objects (such as Flowers 1,2,3,4, cracks, etc); - Too dumb AI (However you can design your own); - Stupid Villagers, that walks in a disorganized way and sometimes can slow your economy down; - Some bugs could be solved down before releasing. So those are all I think about AOK. Despite having some bugs, it still awesome and (IMO) the best game ever! (Better than those all recent overrated games). Play it by a whole before judging it just by the multiplayer/random map. One half of the game is in the scenario editor, DO NOT MISS IT!. This game is one of the best RTSs ever to exist. It has multiple factions from which you can choose from, and each one has its own technology and strategy. The campaign is a bit lame for my taste, so I kinda just play with my friends on Skirmish mode. It has multiple buildings and troops you can create and improve. Even though it's from '99, it has resisted time well, and a fullfiling experience lies in here. Go and play it then!. It's just so goood. I enjoy playing this much more than any other RTS game, because it has more heart and soul and charm. Do you need fancy graphics to enjoy chess? Maybe if the pieces were ultra realistic statues that could move like in that Harry Potter movie. The AOE2 gameplay is perfect, love this game.. A classic RTS, they improved from Age of Empires and just made it soo much better. I totally recommend this game to anybody. It's simple yet difficult but always extremely fun.. This is the level of stupidity of RTS and No one is playing it 5years after release. This is because the multiplayer experience is still the same...crappy... The graphics are not anything special, but the gameplay is even worse, which is what really matters. So dont spare a single buck.. BOREDOM UNLIMITED//. This is not even close to a masterpiece. Not only are the singleplayer missions boooring and historically incorrect, it has nothing to offer to new RTS players, as well as old RTS players, and is the most badly-balanced game I have ever played in my career. It is also a lot of fun watching stupid people waste time on it, especially when they play multiplayer. The AI could use an additional difficulty mode, because the hardest mode isn't hard enough for real RTS veterans. I have to highlight the multiplayer again, because it is absolutely ****. Booooooring game... If you are drunk, then getting out of your booze is simple.. Just play it..MUSTT PLAY!! he first i played this game it was **** GOD, Is this even a game? The second time, seriously i never played this the second time. Actually there are people who're jobless.. And yea. it's for them. I dont understand THIS UNREALISTIC SO CALLED STRATEGY GAME... worst game ever... play only if u have a whole time in the world .. please zuffuluzt. dont write fake comments..This has to be the worst RTS ever. There is no element of strategy whatsoever. There are 10 different factions and they are all exactly the same! At least in Starcraft there are differences between the races and makes need for some strategy. The units move ridiculously slow(a king with a pot-belly outran my mounted knights!),. Reviewer is Universally acclaimed. I have seen people saying that this is the worst RTS game ever made. But these intelligent(and smart) people) dont even care about stupid thoughts of stupid AOE players.. If given a chance between death and playing AOE I would choose death(not real death, i mean death in Counter strike) Because all that precious time that you spent playing Age of Empires, you did nothing. AOE fans say, There has never been such an addicting RTS game out there, so if you still don't own it, buy it! It is more than worth it. And if you already have it, go and play it again! It is really so much more enjoying than all the modern RTS games with fancy graphics but no substance Haa, surely he was drugged or drunk or i dont know.. nor i f-kin care. Please dont believe a person who says this about AOE: More than a decade after it launched, I still enjoy a game of AoE 2. There's just something so incredibly gratifying about it. I wound up purchasing the reissued version on Steam, but truth be told it wasn't all that great of an update. If MGS and Ensemble would have just rebuilt it from the ground up with improved graphics and a rebirthed matchmaking system, I'd be much more likely to play JUST AoE2. This game is truly a classic. ALL HE WANTS IS TO WASTE YOUR TIME, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BY PLAYING THIS STUPID GAME SINGLE WORD DESCRIPTION: CRAP... Review by a person who has played AOE(i mean , **** gets so booring the second time you try to play) The gameplay lasted for about half an hour. Until my friend hammered my computer screen out of boredom. Worse than Hell GAME Reviews given by people who havent even played AOE: It’s not a significant improvement as far as gameplay and graphics, but it does help further the claim of AOE as a solid gaming title and a quality multiplayer game. The originality may be gone, but the idea lives on. I never got into the original game, yet I find AoE II enchanting. The sheer depth of the technology tree and evolution of the civilisation are always a surprise. I particularly like the intuitive logic that makes battles more tactical. Simply an awesome game - great in historical imagery, solid in sound and game play, and a lot of fun to play. The Age of Kings deserves its title.. The first i played this game it was **** GOD, Is this even a","""the conquerors"" is one of the best strategy games i've ever played . the storytelling,art and soundtrack are amazing very immersive . the game mechanics are hard and annoyingly complex since technology didn't allow them to create very long or complex games ."
175.Final Fantasy X,"Really underated FF. Maybe not at the top 3, but it could get on the top 5 maybe. lovely story. Probably the best final fantasy game made. You can sink hundreds of hours into this world. Great combat, soundtrack, story and leveling up system.. A story so epic and melodramatic that it rivals the best any other medium has to offer. The strictly turn-based combat is a breath of fresh air. It has some surprising challenges as well, with one of the harder final bosses in series history. Every character feels real and authentic. Some of the best environments in the series, too.. Unforgetable classics, which has the best story in all FFs in my own opinion, the idea that the protag does not strenthen automatically throughout the game is also new, however the method used to entrue these ideas is somehow a failuer, the game makes me feel bored in the last 30%.. The best game of all time. It's so fun Great story great sound tracks Great characters.. The best game of all time. It's so fun Great story great sound tracks Great characters.. The most fun game in my life, a classic among classicsI played it more than 5 times. One of my favorites of all time, absolutely fantastic story great combat system the sphere grid is phenomenal characters are great romance is impeccable. This game **** since it have a horrible level system and super **** game level system is different from most rpgs. in most rpgs its simple you just level up and your character goes stronger. in this game you have to level up stats sepereatly. The game is also super linear until near the end of the game. This game story and battle system is fun thought.This game is literrly just what make ff2 bad and ff13 bad into one **** not play this game and play other good ff games like ff7 ff6 and ff10 2 instead.. My first final fantasy game and I almost 100% it twice. Gameplay & world were great for its time. Music is top.. Final Fantasy X's story has moments of impact, but not enough to outweigh padded and often miserable game design.. Why this game ****. Hi this is fun dog and I would like to post this review on why Final Fantasy X is a bad game. Firstly this game is too much like a movie with lots of long cutscenes. Secondly the story of this game is horrible and have a very bad pace. Thirdly this game music is also too much like a movie. Forthly, the turn based battle system **** in this game.I do not like the game being like a movie since the game have a super slow paced **** not play this crappy game and play FInal Fantasy IX instead which is a much better game then this.. I played this masterpiece for the first time in..2024 ahah and still it's become one of my favorite game ever!!! incredible T.T. Worst final fantasy game ever created. It has nothing that makes it worth playing.. Final Fantasy X remains a timeless classic, captivating players with its gripping storyline and memorable characters. From beginning to end, the narrative unfolds with emotional depth, keeping players on the edge of their seats as they journey through the world of **** of the game's standout features is its solid turn-based combat system, enhanced by the innovative ability to switch party members mid-battle. This addition adds a new layer of strategy and dynamism to the gameplay, making each encounter feel dynamic and engaging.However, Final Fantasy X is not without its flaws. The game's linear structure, while serving to drive the narrative forward, can feel restrictive for players accustomed to more open-ended RPG experiences. The lack of exploration and freedom may detract from the overall enjoyment for some players, limiting the sense of adventure that is integral to the genre.Despite this drawback, Final Fantasy X earns a commendable 8 out of 10 from me. Its compelling story, well-developed characters, and innovative combat mechanics make it a standout title in the RPG genre. While the linear nature of the game may not appeal to everyone, its strengths outweigh its limitations, resulting in a memorable gaming **** conclusion, Final Fantasy X remains a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming, delivering an unforgettable journey that continues to captivate players years after its release.. Easily one of the most beautiful games and immersive worlds ever made. The narrative, the dark moments, the happy moments, and the great battling system! This game hits every box !!!. Probably one of the best in the series. Touching stories with amazing soundtracks.. Grade: 8.25/10 Story – 8/10 Easy to fall in love with the characters, atmosphere and story. Story treads far into anime trope territory, sometimes to its detriment. Gameplay – 9/10 Deep gameplay that will keep you engaged for a long, long time. Grinding hurts it for some players but helps it for others. Graphics – 7/10 Faces look awkward from time to time; I can forgive a lot of this considering its age. Not horrible. Replayability – 8/10 Subsequent playthroughs carry over some things learned previously. This added to the diverse leveling grid makes for a game that you will be returning to constantly. Music – 10/10 A masterclass in music making. All songs fit like the last remaining puzzle piece. Immersion – 8/10 I was enchanted for most of my ride through Spira. Some bad voice acting took me out of the experience as well as a crazy story. Overall a positive and above average trip. Innovation - 9/10 FFX implemented and improved upon the FF formula. The addition of full 3D and voice acting raised the bar for this classic series while maintaining the groundwork put in place in 1987. It is familiar and fresh.. Probably the darkest game in the entire franchise. Covered over by a lot of smiles and good intentions. Fitting for the times it was released, really. S not in my top 5. Probably won;t replay for many years. Original release version of the skill trees forces characters into specific roles. HD release later at least fixes this. Some major character twists at the end make an otherwise crazy disjointed story make sense. Did not care to play through 95% of the game with a narrative told to you and the story loosely following that, and then find out how it really is at the end of it all. Not the franchises best work, certainly not the best story telling. Blonde water soccer kids english voice in the original release is so unpolished it made me cringe multiple times. Possibly one of the worst VA directing jobs in memory. Was the entire script done in one take? Overall the game is worth playing, just only in the HD remaster version. The downsides do not outweigh the upsides. Worth experiancing.. As a kid, I grew up with Final Fantasy X; it's probably the first PS2 game I ever played beyond that of a Jampack Disc. To this day, it's ending is one of the very few to make me consistently cry over. Beautiful, Fun, Mesmerizing... and the Music is arguably some of the best for an early PS2 Title. Square Enix, then Squaresoft, absolutely knocked it clean out of the park with this entry, and proved above all else, Final Fantasy was going to have a smooth transition into the 2000's. That being said, it can be a bit dated at times, but to me, this adds to it's existing charm; like an old friend who's always waiting for you. If you have a PS2, I cannot possibly recommend this game enough! It's a borderline quintessential title to own for the PS2! If you don't have a PS2, and have no readily available way to get one/space to have one, get the HD Remaster on modern consoles and PC Whatever way you choose to play it, Play Final Fantasy X. If you never have played it, you've been missing out on one of the best RPGs of the early PS2 era!. All time favorite game, the characters, world and story are all amazing, the ending was perfect no need for X2. Legendary game. Iconic. Super long, never boring, excellent story, superb RPG mechanics.. There isn't anything I could say about the game; it has its own wonderful aspects, but I believe that the fans overhyped it because their emotions weakened their judgment. Considering that it was launched in 2001, the game is generally good, but is the storyline truly great? Not at all, especially after learning that it's the best Final Fantasy game to date. Since this game is overrated by the fans, I'm left wondering what the best Final Fantasy game is in terms of storytelling?. An outstanding masterpiece. I can't stop thinking about it since I've played it, its music, art and story will always stay with me. In terms of gameplay, I think it is the most interesting of all the Final Fantasy games released so far, because it offers turn-based combat where you have more time to think and plan strategies. The characters are absolutely charming, each one has their own story, they are full of charisma. What fascinated me most about the story was that it was told by the protagonist himself. This character, Tidus, uses this type of narration (in the first person) to reflect his feelings, emotions and thoughts in every situation, which enriches the development of the plot. In conclusion, this video game surpasses excellence and is my favourite game of all time.. I desperately want to give this game a ten, there are so many aspects of this game that are the best in the series. The party is stellar, the romance is captivating, and the combat mechanics are flawless. But those damn Cloister Trials really hold it back for me, most puzzles just aren’t my thing, except for Portal.. FF10 is an amazing game. Its combat allows for more strategy, and switching between party members in battle allows freedom in choosing how you play. The story is also fantastic. It is complex and is paced perfectly. Also making tidus the protagonist was a fantastic move as he is new to the world so therefore you will be as surprised as he is if there is a twist in the game. The worldbuilding is so great, making it linear allows it to be more focused on story and characters, and that works well. Also the cast actually has chemistry with each other, which I find is something JRPGS often struggle with. The soundtrack is fantastic, and works amazingly with the game. Everything about this game is amazing, and even though the voice acting is not too convincing, you have to remember that this is a product of its time. And for a ps2 game the graphics are miles ahead of games like devil may cry, god of war, and others.. There will never be a game that surpasses the story of this one, never ever. It has the best (more humane) story writing and character development. Everything hits really close. We could say that is the best FF, if not, a top 3 for sure.. So far not only my favorite Final Fantasy but also my favorite Game of all time. Really love the story the characters and the world Spira. The way how they handled the antagonist sin is very well done. Highly recommendable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. in my opinion, this was the last final fantasy game that we could actually call masterpiece.. One of the best video games of all time. In my opinion, it's the best of its kind by far. The story, the characters, the music, the atmosphere... it's all there to take you on this magnificent journey through Spira!. This is Final Fantasy at its peak!!!!! Every aspect of this game is perfect.. Simply the best story ever written. Still holds the #1 of all games for me. Masterpiece.. This game made me fall in love with the FF franchise, after mistakenly hated it because of the OG FF7 I was young and naive at the time to understand the mechanics. The graphics for its time, the music, the story, the unique universe on every FF game, voice acting for Tidus could have been a little better, this game got me hooked for months that I never regret spending on it.. One of the best games i ever played in my life, my first Final Fantasy game and my favorite ps2 game.. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. My favorite Final Fantasy and my favorite video game of all time. It feels like this game was made specifically for me. I got it for Christmas 2003 in grade 5.. Beautiful, captivating and timeless. A fantastic story, with a heartbreaking romance and great writing and characters. In my opinion both the perfect gateway to the Final Fantasy series, and one of the greats in its own right.. 20+ years on this still remains my favourite JRPG of all time - an absolute masterpiece that every RPG fan absolutely has to play. It is my favorite Final Fantasy, it has a great story, great characters and a soundtrack of ten. Impressive JRPG for its time, still holds up. Great gameplay and soundtrack.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this tenth game in the series.. Sakaguchi's last Final Fantasy, and the last great final fantasy game. The move to full 3D definitely comes with a lot of losses here. Gone is the world map. Even without that, the individual levels are far more linear, the number of NPCs is reduced. The comedy also doesn't work nearly as well with this format as it did with the style of 7, 8 and 9. However, the move to full 3D allows for great scenery, and more importantly, a more personal attachment with the characters. And thats a good thing because the characters are fantastic here, as is the story. There's still a lot of JRPG weirdness, but this might be one of the tightest, most emotional, stories in the franchise. This is also the height of the turn based combat system and the leveling system. Both the sphere grid and the ability to move characters in and out are exceptional additions. And the gameplay would only go downhill from here.. As a lifelong gamer and 34 years old in 2022, FFX is the first JRPG I have ever completed. I have picked up plenty over the years, but none of them have captivated me enough to warrant follow through to completion; FFX even fell into this camp up until this most recent playthrough. There was probably a bit of younger me ADHD at play before, but actually completing this game feels substantial just for the simple fact that it is my first in the genre. Obnoxious foreword aside, there aren't many games I can think of where a story has grabbed me quite the way X did. Every character had their purpose, but the heart and soul of this game is the relationship that unfolds between Tidus and Yuna. Their story and dynamic is what pulled me through this game, and I'm sure I am far from alone in feeling that way. The winding road of this game brought upon all the emotions. Happiness, anger, sadness. Tears were definitely had along this journey I think the thing with JRPGs that tends to make me shy away is the anxiety of making the right choices when assigning attribute points to your characters. There was a little bit of that at the beginning for me, but I quickly began to realize that the sphere grid system in this game is actually pretty genius. It made me WANT to engage with it. I wasn't so concerned with min-maxing after realizing fairly quickly that even if you pass something up now, you'll have plenty of opportunity to loop back around later. I adored spending time with that system. I am a little mad at myself for not completing this game 5, 10 - hell, even 20 years ago because it is just so damn good. At the same time, I am happy that I was able to truly experience this game for the first time as a grown adult, with the emotional maturity that comes with those years. Easy 10/10 for me, not because it's perfect, but because it is significant, and it's impact on me as a person was profound.. An amazing game. Absolutely a 10/10 game from start to finish. I’ve heard people complain about the voice acting. Considering it’s the first final fantasy to have voice acting it’s not perfect but it’s by no means bad what so ever. This game is absolutely perfect. Visuals story soundtrack I’ve played this game multiple times and have hundreds of hours into it. Amazing game you won’t regret playing. my favorite game of all times it has been 2022 years since i played it first and only today did one game made me like it enough to come and review it truly an amazing experience that will forever stay with me. One of the greatest I’ve ever played. Suddenly didn’t experience it during my childhood, played it on PS4. Highly recommend it for all JRPG fans around the world. Fantastic storyline, amazing soundtracks, and finale is perfect. 10/10. This game has an incredible graphic and mechanical evolution compared to 9. The scenarios are more majestic, in real size and very beautiful and detailed. It's the first FF dubbed so it brings much more immersion to the game. I love how this game works in my hand. The battle system is much more fun, with changing characters during the fight, which can suit the strategy much better. The summons (aeons) being able to fight as a playable character was a really cool addition and for me it was the apex of importance of summons. The game has a lot to explore, extra summons, celestial weapons and extremely difficult boss. Despite all the good things, the cast of characters is much weaker than that of IX, the protagonist in particular, although I like Tidus he doesn't even come close to Zidane's feet. And for me the worst of all are the unbearable minigames to get the heavenly weapons, I almost gave up playing the game when the remaster for pc came out remembering them. I think this game is a masterpiece that all rpg fans should play. A story that excites and entertains with good gameplay, apart from the soundtrack that rocks. 85 out of 100. I wanna say, i'm not big fan of FF franchises, but this game made me cry about 3 times. This game is fantastic, i have no words to explain, what i feel about this game. I'm so glad, that this game shows me, what Final Fantasy is.. Great Characters! Amazing story! Touching emotional Lines! Yuna and Tidus all the way!. Final Fantasy X is actually a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. This story, these characters, this world has stuck with me for 20 years now since I first played it. I remember seeing this game for the first time. It was my first playstation 2 game and I was absolutely stunned and although the graphics haven't aged well, the FMVs are still outstanding. I enjoy the gameplay and especially like grinding my characters to absurd strengths, finding all the best gear, and taking on the post game content, but as far as impact on my life, the story and the music are what makes this game one of my all time favorites. This game has some of the most beautiful, emotional, and evocative music I've ever heard in gaming. Every single piece I hear carries with it old memories and strong emotions. The story is a harrowing tragedy that takes place in Spira, the single most interesting world in any FF game. Every time I play, I'm impressed by the best-selling novel quality of this plot. This is one of the only games in my collection that I come back to every couple years, and very likely will for the rest of my life.. one of my favourite PS2 games that I can sadly not play anymore because I'm sadly not patient person Who can enjoy turn based combat. I love the characters the voice acting the music the way that you and it takes you through the world and make you realise so many things the love story is still one of my favourites. I enjoyed the story part of this game so much but sadly I cannot get myself to play the game play part of it. I love it, but I just have to watch them YouTube videos of it.. When FFX came out on PS2 I was just a little kid; my dad visited me and brought this game as a gift. He kept talking about how amazing the graphic of the game was. At my parents surprise I took a look at the cover and I started crying, I thought it was girly and nothing could have changed my mind. (what's wrong with that though?) That evening I convinced my mother to bring FFX back at the store, but strangely I felt a bit guilty I remember. Twenty years later because of a Déjà vu I mad a research (I couldn't remember the title number) and I bought the game on Steam REMASTERED. I'm super caught up with it. :D. Composed by a distinctive cast of deep characters, a unique world and rich gameplay mechanics, 'Final Fantasy X' presents a story that speaks about universal matters in delicate fashion, delivering one of the most thrilling and mesmerizing stories in videogame history.. The best Final Fantasy! I just love the characters, story and the fighting system. Sphere grid works well as a skill tree. Gets me crying every time. Yuna/Tidus is the best love story on any game I've played. Game that has changed my life when I played it as a kid. Best character awards go to Auron/Jecht cause they're just dope!. the gameplay is good, as well as its story, it is a very good game that does not surpass final fantasy vii, but they tried. GAMEPLAY: 9 STORY: 8 VISUALS: 9 MUSIC: 10 PERSONAL SCORE: 9 !! A JEWELL !!. This certainly is my favorite game of all time. Any of this aspects is beautiful, and as the most incredible representation of a Classic FF he is so successful and is really a game everybody must play at least one time in life.. Another Final Fantasy game I return to time and time again. For me the last game in the golden age of ATB combat. Brilliant story with a decent skill tree for progression.. I played it in 2017, after seeing many references of attractive visuals. This probably the reason I ""only"" give FFX an 8 score. With actually, for that moment in 2017, the sceneries of FFX is still mind-blowing. This entry into the Final Fantasy series came as the last entry in an incredible run of games in a very short span of time. In 1997 Final Fantasy VII would erupt onto the scene, in 1998 no FF, but we got Xenogears. In 1999, Final Fantasy VIII, 2000 Final Fantasy IX and then this one was released in 2001. Then we would enter the dark ages when they would release fewer games and they would not be as good as these four of the ones released on the SNES. Sure, I sort of liked Final Fantasy X-2, but it seemed some of the things they did in that game were kind of lazy such as not changing the appearances of some of the characters and not really adding a few more locations to explore in Spira. Still, I found that game more enjoyable than Final Fantasy XII (never played XI) which had a combat system I did not care for at all and characters that seemed like rehashes of characters in this particular game. This game is the first entry of a FF game for the PS2 and it was a great entry in my mind. That being said, it was not quite as enjoyable to me as part IX, but that FF game still ranks as my favorite game in the series because it has the look and feel of the old SNES ones, but has a wonderful 3D world crafted around it. This one takes a bit more realistic approach as far as character design, but it works and this one also features actual voices for the characters during cut scenes and all through the adventure. The story has a young man named Tidus who is the son of a man who was a star blitz ball player (the popular sport of this world). He lives in a city called Zanarkand and his father is missing. He too, has become a star blitz ball player and he is doing his thing when the city comes under assault from this creature called 'Sin'. A man named Auron assists Tidus battle monsters that emerge from Sin and soon the young man is transported away from his home. He awakens in a cold and old abandoned temple where he meets these people who speak a different language and he assists them and soon finds himself washed away again to a small village that is home to a person called a summoner. Soon Tidus joins this girl and her guardians as they go on a quest to Zanarkand to defeat the all powerful Sin as the summoner must go to various temples to gain the power to summon the final Aeon. This game does a couple of things differently than other FF games as there are several playable characters and like most FF games only a certain number can be in the battle, in this case three. However, what it does differently is that you can switch out characters so that every character can be instrumental in defeating the enemy. This comes in handy as this helps you level up everyone in the party. That is another difference as it incorporates something called a sphere grid as opposed to the normal experience points and level ups. In this one, you traverse a grid to gain more strength, hit points, magic etc. It's great and you can have all your characters powered up to the extreme and using magic. They still retain differences and are unique as each of them uses a different weapon and armor piece. They also have different special attacks called limits so all the heroes are distinct in this one. So, I enjoyed this Final Fantasy game quite a lot. A lot of people these days like to crap on the character of Tidus, but I thought he was a rather good hero. The main reason for the hate is that stupid laughing scene, which does not encompass but a small fragment of the game. My favorite character though is Auron as he is so mysterious, so cool and so powerful! The villain in this one is a bit different in that it is almost a mindless creature (Sin); however, like many Final Fantasy games a true enemy will be revealed at the end and there is another villain named Seymour who just oozes bad guy from the moment you see him. This game could be considered linear in nature to an extent, but nothing like XIII. Here you actually stop in towns and interact with townsfolk and such, but there is a lot of journeying through different areas. The scenery is nice so I actually liked the way it played out. They remastered the game and I guess it looks better, but it was not as if this one really needed that major of an upgrade as far as graphics. Honestly, the PS2's graphics hold up well as the newer systems simply add more details such as better sweat or stuff like that rather than character models. So, this one would be a great addition to the FF series, too bad it hasn't been as good since it debuted, but FFXV was pretty awesome.. At times, Final Fantasy X can feel like more movie than game, though it is elevated by an incredibly rich narrative and deeply strategic battle system -- both of which help mask the linear world design and the worst crop of side quests and mini-games in any Final Fantasy title.. Game is nearly perfect if played correctly. If you do not stray from the path in the sphere grid and do not grind, you will have a classic team that complements each other well. If you do stray and complete large chunks of the total grid for every character, you can three shot the final boss, rendering the mythos of the game moot. If the antagonist is presented as Sin is presented in this game, it is unreasonable to three shot him under ANY circumstances. Literally the most emotional ending to game of my pre-teen years. Thankfully as an adult I don't cry. No you're crying!. Anything that would be said about this game would not be enough to express its greatness. It's a tactical masterpiece. The story is a revelation about friendship and sacrifice, and love. Words cannot do it justice, one has to experience it.. Good graphics, excellent music, amazing gameplay and really simple, but GOOD storyline.. One of the best old school Final Fantasy games, Tidus is a very charming character, and his romance with Yuna is done perfectly. The story is incredible with some tear-jerking moments, and the music is fantastic and fits well with the game. The gameplay mechanics are solid but a little bit outdated, and the grinding can be a very annoying. Also there are many difficulty spikes which make some parts of the game frustrating. Still, the game holds up pretty well for a turn based JRPG, and if you're a fan of the genre this is pretty much a must-play. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. First, I'm going to talk about the actual game. The cutscenes are unskippable, which is aggravating on repeat playthroughs. The turn based combat is okay, but the presentation of the battles with the camera angles and the unique stuff that happens during story battles makes it fun. I quite liked how each party member was different mechanically, with only Waka using his ranged weapon or a magic user being able to hit flying enemies, or Auron using his strength to shatter armored enemies, whereas Tidus' attacks will bounce off of armor. The Sphere Grid is a fake progression system that has no actual choice or depth involved and only exists to waste your time. The process of filling in a spot on the Grid takes several seconds for what should be a one click operation, and that times adds up when you're filling in the grids of 7 characters. The game aesthetically looks gorgeous and still holds up, much better than the brown hyper-realistic artstyles that became popular later on. The music is a mixed bag. There are some really good tracks but there are a lot of stinkers that are grating to listen to. The English voice acting is... okay. The game is disappointing when compared to prior games, as the game is linear. There is no world map. You cannot pilot any vehicles. As for the story, it's okay. The characters are likeable enough, but the story really stalls out around the half way mark.. Call me old school or so, but in my opinion this is the best game I ever played. Amazing story, awesome graphics and cutscenes, nice combat system and of course :) Blitzball. Sometimes I still play it for a few hours of Blitzball. Hope they do a remake or remaster for the PS5.. FFX introduced voice acting for the first time in the series and it was great, yes, including that cheesy laugh by Tidus and Yuna, which btw, if you notice it was done on purpose due to the convo they were having. Anyway, FFX is amazing with all the characters being awesome. The leveling up system is still one of the best in the series and being able to switch characters on the fly for the first time will forever be epic.. Final Fantasy X is a turn-based RPG developed by Square before the merged with Enix. It came out on the PS2 in 2001 and spawned a sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. It's since been ported to PS3, Vita, PS4, and more recently Switch and Xbox (On Game Pass rn) as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. I played the PS4 ver. Without getting too into detail, you are a Blitzball player named Tidus. Blitzball is basically underwater soccer. You suddenly get transported to another world and you have to find your way out and uncover the truth about what happened to your world. Very compelling story that makes you really feel for the characters. Music is incredible as always for the series. FFX has classic turn-based combat unlike most Final Fantasy games which are active turn based. Engaging, challenging gameplay makes combat rewarding. It's one of those games that you take your time with, or play for hours. Truly a timepiece for the PS2 and beyond. It's considered one of the greatest games of all time. A lot of people mention FF7, but FFX is right up there too. Very few games made me cry like this one did. Such an emotional story and beautiful world that envelops you. Highly recommend trying it to anybody interested in the series. 9.5/10. One of my favorite games of all time, I adore almost everything about it. The bright, detailed visuals, the spotty but incredibly charming voice acting, its something I would reccomend to anyone in a heartbeat. I wont go into spoilers, but the story has so many twists and turns that I personally believe its the 2nd best story in the franchise, with extremely likable characters and more incredible Nomura designs. Where I think it really shines however is the gameplay and music Gameplay wise, it is very much a traditional rpg, but one where encounters almost feel like a puzzle. Everyone in Final Fantasy 10 is kind **** cannon, so it's really fun to have to","final fantasy x is one of my favorite games of all time . gameplay & world were great for its time, but not enough to outweigh padded and miserable game design . gameplay & world were great for its time, music is top ."
176.Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri,"I use the Social Engineering screen from this game to explain to people that just because the US is a free market democracy and others have been planned police states, doesn't mean that they are the only options that could exist. And that within those combinations, that your societies values still matter. I tie in that even impeached republican Richard Nixon ran a free market democracy, but that he prioritized knowledge as a core value. And that from the high school movement in the 1920s forward, having knowledge as our values is what enabled us to become so strong. And contrast it with Wealth values policies like tax cuts for the wealthy while ignoring the knowledge values policies to make education accessible to everyone, that were already proven successful in our own history.... And then I use the Future Societies to hammer it into people's heads that eventually we will progress past many outdated views. Cybernetic utilizes automation to free humans for more creative tasks. Eudemonic encourages citizens to achieve happiness through fulfillment in a tolerant society without violence. Or we can continue the path of Thought Control, using triggers that create a population that is obedient, loyal, and rejects outside ideas.... I also use SimCity 2000 tax rates to explain the concept that if taxes are too low, you can't afford the services that enable a strong and thriving economy. And if taxes are too high, your government will kill all growth, and create a downward spiral, and also... won't be able to afford the services that enable a strong and thriving economy. In conclusion, I believe that all members of congress and presidential candidates should be required to demonstrate that they can successfully balance these priorities by succeeding in these two games before they are given the green light to prove that they are incapable and fail to effectively manage the government in the real world.. Good game plenty of options. It's very similar to the civ saga .. I used to think this was the best game ever. After replaying it recently, I have concur with my past self.. I was feeling nostalgic, so when I saw this game on GOG, I had to buy it. It remains, by far, the best 4X game of all time. It's a pity that its ""spiritual successor"" wasn't up to its standards. It's amazing how game development studios relied on fantastic gameplay when they couldn't rely on pretty graphics to sell their products.. Loved this game. Many weekends consumed with it back in the day, I wonder if I can get it to work on Windows 10.... Amazing. If you go in expecting another civilization, you'll be equipped to PLAY. If you play through the game with half the factions, you'll be equipped to WIN. If youve played hundreds of hours, understand the consequences of all your actions and feel like roleplaying, you'll have FUN. This is one of those games where there are a hundred different difficulty settings. And plenty are 'of your choosing'. Do you feel like easy/medium/hard? Go for it. Do you feel like land/sea/air? Choose one or all. Do you feel religious? Democratic? Warlike? Choose one. Do you feel like automating all your units? Just the scouts? Just the attackers? Just defenders? Feel like packing your cities closely together? Pushing your front lines? Yes, okay.. I know that sounds lame ~ you can do all that in plenty of games. But the difference is that you can have fun with this one. Civilization is nice and all, but it doesnt have the depth of customization that this thing does. Given enough time and resources, you could start off as tree huggers, and attack the world with your beasties.. or turn them into something they arent, violently pacifist atrocity-committing infiltrators who angered the world... Its hard to cover all the bases with this one, save to say that every aspect of the game 'works well'. Sending your f(o)rmers out to plow the land, designing new units, rolling out an upgrade plan for obsolete ones, stealth, line of sight, building a successful nation, or infrastructure, or research, or... I dunno, just playing to see what happens. I've found between myself and my friends who've played this, the only way to temporarily make this game unenjoyable but challenging is to make a worst enemy of the faction you usually choose and choosing the faction whose ideals you disagrew with IRL. There's nothing quite like fighting a mirror image of yourself that uses (somewhat) your own tactics while your units are lagging behind in research because of your ethical inflexibility in your faction. And then you might start with a government that doesnt lend itself to (whatever gameplay style) you prefer. Military might, but not an economist? Damn. Lotta money but you have to spend it all to keep ahead of the other guys? Well.. maybe frustrating. But if you set yourself into the scenario with the right mindset, then every scenario is the right one. Just use your common sense. Incite the drones, bomb the hologram theatre, use artillery on their roads.. Useless review, I know. Because you cant describe such beauty in words. ;) Would be 10/10 if the expansion didnt nerf some strategies and introduce two volatile factions that generally dont fit into ANYONE's agenda. Those two are like.. a blight spreading across the land for the first 2 hours.. I'm just here to give props to this absolute classic...still so disappointed by beyond earth. The Best Civ game ever, bar none. Yes, the graphics are dated. Yes, the AI fails at the late game. Yes, there are some balance issues. However, the shear level of customization that was available makes modern Civ games look simple by comparison. The game had something like a million plus possible unit variations. Terrain can be lowered/raised in game using formers (builder unit). Factions were distinct and interesting. Wonder cutscenes were incredible, and there was a storyline that wasn't too bad.. One of the best turn based strategy games of all time. Honestly, would be awesome if they left this game as it is, and just did a graphical remake to bring it into 2016.. I still remember the day when my father came home with this game in his hand. He gave it to me and said: ""This is an interesting game, you should try it out and you will learn a lot from it"". I never imagined he will be so spot on. We both spend countless hours playing this game. Now, 15 years later I still remember the game with fondness and go for a run at least once a year. Actually last year I completed the game with 4 factions each with different victories. (Miriam - Population; Provost - Transcendence; Sparta - Conquest; Morgan - Economic). This is such a good game I might call it perfect. I had high hopes with Sid and his Beyond Earth, which was not a bad game, but it just has so little replay value in my opinion. While Alpha Centauri just seems to have infinite replay value.. Agree wholeheartedly with Tb87670, except I was a little older in 1999 and had played previous Civ titles and whatnot. This game is 16 years old, and miraculously still fresh on my current play-through after not having looked at it in years. I love the sci-fi story in addition to all the usual Civ features. If only something similarly creative could be done in this genre!. The classic. Hasn't been beat really, shame it's suffering from licensing issues and no real sequel could be made. Every Civilization game before and after this game was not near as good as this game, no joke. Customizable units for starters, flexible tech tree, lots of options for terraforming including mountains to collect moisture and make rainfall on one side and to make the other side dry which could be used to ruin an opponents farmland. The complexity is nuts for how old this game is, yet it was easy enough for me to play when 13 with no prior strategy game experience. Even the current attempt at a remake called 'Beyond Earth' is a pale shadow to the original Alpha Cent. The expansion is also good, it just adds more to the already great game.. Years later and I still love this game. The backstory is rich and involving, the game mechanics intelligent and fun, the AI some of the best I have ever seen and the overall experience something that stays with you. The AI deserves special mention. In the game you find pods that do various things, one of them being setting of an earthquake that can raise or lower land. In one game, the drone faction, my allies suddenly broke off their alliance then soon after attacked; it turns out they had accidentally created a land bridge to my continent, presumably making invasion and expansion viable and so changing the AI's game plan. The AI then astounded me when I hammered their ground forces with air by developing ground troops with anti-air capability (presumably using the 'design your own unit' capability that hasn't been used since but is a brilliant innovation), swatting my air force. The game, well over a decade old, felt like I was playing against a human and I have not seen that very often. An astonishing work.. The smartest, most playable, and most finely honed game I've ever played. This game is a masterpiece that evokes the best of science fiction and storytelling and is the penultimate Sid Meier game.. So addictive, so deep and engrossing... Days lost... Amazing game. The best parts are the beginning and mid-game... by late game the knife's edge tension has gone and you are usually either winning by a mile or just stuck in mediocrity. Still, really fun to play.. It is terrifying that this 15-year-old game is still one of the best games I have ever played. The only downside is its graphics and age, which can't be controlled. If anything deserves a 10, it is this game. I'd kill for a sequel.. #1 on my list since it was released. Without any question, hesitation or doubt whatsoever: the best game I have ever played. I've invested more time into this game than all other games I've ever played combined. Sid Meier please make a sequel.. A masterpiece that shouldn't be missed by anyone who likes playing strategic games. It has a very good diplomacy which is quite rare in newer strategic games.. This game introduced me to a wide swath of ideas that inspired and excited me. I enjoyed the game too, but it is really the ideas that I still treasure some 10 years later.. Without a doubt the best game I ever played. Better than Civ series, with a more natural and dynamic diplomacy, much better story, much better terraforming, and the level of detail put in every aspect of the game is unbelievable. Custom units, psy combat, water combat, air combat, bombardment, espionage, the planet itself turning against you and, frankly, the first turn based game I liked. There's so much to do you never feel it's turn based. Units fight back, pull out, defenses fire, it feels dynamic. And the research quotes and customizing ability is beyond impressive. Best. Game. Ever. Oh, and, works in W7 x64 just fine, 14 years later. Scenario editor, too. Custom factions. too. This is how a game should be.. The gameplay from the Civilization series is adapted for an engaging sci-fi experience. The real genius of the game, and what ensures its immortality, is the compelling and dynamic world it creates through a series of excellently voice-acted quotes. Each will have you thinking, and feeling, and longing for more.. Simply the best turn based strategy I've ever played. It's been almost 14 years the game hit the shelves, yet I still play it from time to time. This is what I expect from a masterpiece TBS game, replayability. In every new game, you still find something to keep you playing in my case, it was the stories I made up myself while playing through ). The story: Mankind had just finished the race for space and launched its first colonization craft to the nearest habitable star system, before it fails as a race and destroys both itself and almost the planet. The 80.000 colonists have it tough for years until they reach their objective. Then the captain of the ship was murdered, and it didn't take long for the colonists to unite between factions representing ideals, a new bitter conflict had started... Factions: You play as one of the seven factions, Peacekeepers( Similar to the UN Spartans( Militarists, survival of the fittest Hive( Strength in Unity, brutal police state Gaians( Nature's attendants, ecologists (My all time favorite)), Morganites( Free market economists, money is power), Believers( Fundamentalists University( Science before everything else). Each faction has their distinct modifiers, ups and downs but not as much as limiting their playstyle to a single viable option. For example, Gaians can capture and use mind worms( the planets native life form) in combat while spartans gain +2 morale(experience) upgrade. It is clear that each faction is worked on and been given life beautifully. Gameplay: Not so different from Civilization2, although somewhat more detailed and diversified. You still found bases( cities build city improvements, wonders and units, do research, engage in politics( politics aspect is far better compared to any of its predecessor), terraform the planet, engage in social engineering( instead of governments and so on. There are several ways to victory, almost all factions possess a route better suited for them compared to others. Units gain experience as they fight and survive, improving their combat prowess, and another beautiful aspect of the game, can be created for specific needs, with the unit editor. You need to combat mind worms? Add empath song to the unit. Unit support is becoming a problem? Add clean reactor. So many options are available and it's a blast to experiment with unit types. The wonder cutscenes are gorgeous, way ahead of anything when they were created(in 99). Research tree is immense, always a plus for me. In addition to all that, the game world is so rich that you stand in awe. Brian Reynolds( The game's lead designer, despite the fact that it's branded as a Sid Meier game) had a dual degree in Software Engineering/Philosophy, and the philosophy is masterfully integrated in the game as research descriptions, diplomatic responses and faction profiles. They are too rich and beautiful to ignore. I can find only a single thing to criticize, even in the TRANSCEND difficulty, the game is too easy with certain factions. Iron Man option( Save/Load restricted) adds some challenge though. My last game was an Iron Man Transcend with Believers( The weakest faction in my opinion, maybe my playstyle is not suited for believers) was a good run. Audio/Visuals: While the only thing that may have kept me from giving this game a solid 10 would be the audio, the visuals are good. Granted, visual perfection and eye candy couldn't hurt, the current level is more than enough for what I seek in a solid TBS game. Audio is meh, the music is somewhat irritating at times, though it has its moments. The sound effects are adequate. Multiplayer: An option, but a pain to play multiplayer. Not that it's the game's fault, on large and huge maps with several factions, the amount of time needed is too much. It couldn't have been any other way though. Overall: Best TBS I've ever played( Maybe Dominions 3 would come close It's 2013 now and there's a reason I still install and play Alpha Centauri and its expansion SMACX( Alien Crossfire because no other game could gave me such satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment, in the following years since SMAC had been launched. Brian Reynolds is my favorite game designer, sad to see him working for Zynga now, but I can't bring myself to accuse him( Man's gotta eat, and pc strategy gaming hasn't been rewarding as far as I can tell but it would be my dream come true if Reynolds said this what the hell am I doing here? I should be doing master strategy games! and announces a sequel to Alpha Centauri. Final words: If you're into strategy gaming. This game is a must. You can get it without a second thought.. This is my favorite Civ style game of all time. The gameplay is near perfect and the back story is incredible. I love reading through all of the details on each technology that is developed, and playing through as different factions with entirely different strategies never gets old for me. Even now, more than a decade after its release I still occasionally come back for more, and other modern Civ titles only keep me interested in them for a few months after their release before I come back to this gem. Every future empire building game should strive toward imitating the excellent design of this title.. This is the definitive masterpiece of the strategy genre. Never have I seen a game invest so much effort into building up the lore of the setting. Gameplay is intuitive, easy to learn, and exciting.Factions are varied and diverse, ensuring that players of all stripes have something to suit their styles of play. Multiple paths to victory and engaging multiplayer cement the re-playability of this game. If you are a fan of either science fiction or strategy games in general, I highly suggest that you give this game a try.. Brilliant game. SMAC is probably the apex of Turn-Based Strategy gaming even 13 years after its release. The amount of Philosophy, imagination, new technological trends that was poured into it was amazing at the time. I got to pick up this game for the first time in 2004, some 6 years after its release, and I was blown out of the water by its staggering depth and possibilities. The limit is really your skill and imagination on playing it. You can play it through a myriad of different playstyles following which faction you choose to play with. Each game will feel completely different from another one as the strategies that must be pursued are completely different. Highly recommendable game which you can now buy, updated, through **** for only 5 USD. Really worthwhile. You do not need a high end rig to play it. Its pure strategy gaming directly in your veins.. Alpha Centauri dominates the competition and marks out the stakes for engaging, civilization building. Here's why... 1. Cultural Philosophy is embodied in the different factions. Ridded of the heavy baggage accompanying past factions (egyptians, americans), factions are boilded town to philosophical embodiments including relgious fundamentalism and scientific anarchism. 2. Tech tree has actually been thought out. From the quotes from famous literary figures to the theoretical nature of the discoveries, the tech tree makes you actually stop and read. That never happens in other games of this genre. 3. ""Planet"" is a living breathing player in the game. Not only in the storyline, but also in mindworm opposition, Alpha Centauri gounds civilization in the environment, and forces an amount of eco-friendliness from it's technological business. 4. The graphics and music are wonderous. They effectively immerse your consciousness into the game itself, drawing you in, and bringing you to this planet at the far reaches of space. Absolutely beautiful. This game makes the ""Civilization"" series boring and inconsequential.. Still one of the most amazing game of its category. SMAC was fascinating when it came out and it is my belief that it has yet to be surpassed on the depth and interest of its setting for a realist Sci-Fi strategy video game. The gameplay is surprisingly smooth, maintaining your interest and your control despite the great complexity of the game mechanics. With an almost infinite replayability potential SMAC is still played today while plenty of other popular games in its category have disappeared after a short (comparatively) time. One of the most interesting Civ-like opus.. It's a fantastic game with an very large scope, and takes it all in it's stride. The technology is all scientifically correct, and the descriptions explain a lot, and the quotes interesting. Also, customization of units is a great touch, that I am sad to see has not been continued in later games. The best part about it, for me, were the faction leaders, each with their own distinct personality and viewpoints, all of them humanly flawed, and easy to emphasise with, and see the various pros and cons of their worldview. It has a varied set of win conditions, and the planetary council is a joy. It's one of the best games I've ever played, and I would recommend it to everyone. It's a rare game that makes you truly think about what you are doing.. if you even remotely liked any of the civ games, buy this. graphics aren't phenomenal but the presentation and depth are. the amount of choices at your disposal is overwhelming. the civ series never became stale for me, but if it did for anyone, this game will likely freshen up the experience. similar structure, different atmosphere and world. the thought provoking quotes never fail to disappoint either.. I played this game years ago when I was just a wee tyke,. I got civ5 and got nostalgic so I dug up my old copy. Still so much fun.. The story. The depth.. Man... They really don't make them like they used to.. Have we gotten stupider?. Better than any of the Civilization games, in almost every aspect.. There are useful features in this game that I'm still discovering, even after having played it extensively on three computers. I can't say that for any other game. Two particularly annoying aspects of Civilization are repeated here. The first is the world generator. The player gets one chance a day to start a ""good"" new world/game. Repeated tries generate worlds that are often barren and unplayable. The other issue is that if the human player ""gets too far ahead"", the computer players go into overdrive -- enemy units becoming nearly invincible. Even more annoying, if the computer has decided some faction must die (to make way for another computer player who can challenge you), no amount of money or military units given to the ""loser"" will save them. They do practically nothing to defend themselves and crumble without warning... Fun, but broken six ways from side-ways. compared to Civ II-IV, this was an ambitious but ultimately failed attempt at a strategic game. Worth exploring to find all the ways you can break it at least.... More or less the single best turn-based strategy game ever made, excelling in absolutely every area. Even now, nearly twelve years later, very few games can stand up to its incredible charm and addictiveness. I could play it for months and months.. Liked a lot, one of the MASTER PIECES of it's time, technology tree was superb and you could play it as a leader of one of the 3 clans after a trip to another galaxy. Simply another MUST HAVE","john avlon: the social engineering screen from this game is a good example . avlon: it's a pity that its ""spiritual successor"" wasn't up to its standards . avlon: i think congress and presidential candidates should be required to balance these priorities . avlon: i think it's a pity that its ""spirit"
177.Wave Race 64,"This is a great game and something that i love to go back to every once in a while. The only complaint I can make about this game, is that it's maybe a little on the short side. I believe this was a launch game for the UK release and was worth picking up at launch. It's a shame since Nintendo have killed this franchise. A new Wave race would be great. I'm still playing this game every year, this and Ocarina of Time haven't aged one bit. It just has a timeless gameplay. I don't understand: it's been almost 25 years and we still haven't gotten a good jet ski game that comes even close to this (I'm including the GameCube sequel as well). The atmosphere and the ideas this game has are very simple, pure & efficient. The fact that this game got rushed in production and still ended up being a classic is a sheer marvel. The only downside is that that there aren't a lot of track or game modes. Nintendo kind of abandoned this franchise, since they never came up with any good ideas to improve on the concept. A decision I highly respect and I wish more game developers would be equally judgmental on their own IP's.. I wish to live here. Perfect controls, some of the best music/overall atmosphere in a video game. Might sound silly, but the time trial I consider equally essential to the game as championship mode.. Oh the nostalgia, Wave Race 64 and Blue Storm bring back so many childhood memories. I recently played Wave Race 64 on the Switch again, and I have to say, it still holds up very well. The water effects were way beyond it's time and the racing is top notch. One franchise I REALLY wish Nintendo would bring back, would love to see what Wave Race could look like in 2023~.. A unique racing game that has never really been emulated or ripped off, had girl characters to play as even at a time when male protagonists dominated all gaming (if you care about that stuff) I don't NOW, but I did then when I was a young girl with my first console.. Aquatic racing games have never worked as well as their dry land counterparts but this is one of the better ones. The graphics are showing their age a little but the physics work well and it's reasonably good fun.. I struggle to find anything negative to say about this game. I struggle to feel anything negative while playing this game. So often, I don't get the hype. It's misplaced, confused. But here, I fully understand it. Relentlessly fun.. One of the best racing games ever, it was critical to proving how analog controls could enhance the racing and simulation experiences when it came out. Easy to play, hard to master, the game is still a blast to play, even today. The water effects were way beyond its time. You could hardly find something that good even a generation after. And finally, Wave Race 64 soundtrack is totally outstanding. Basically, this was an amazing game that showed what Nintendo 64 could and other consoles couldn't in terms of graphics when it came out, and it was given in an amazing very Nintendoish approach to a sim racer. One of my favorites indeed.. I'd give this a 7.5 which is simply good. It's a standout for the genre and should have garnered more attention and acclaim at the time of it's release. However, it feels very similar to super smash where the 64 version feels like a concept tester prior to the Gamecube releases. Wave Race 64 doesn't have the charm of Blue Storm but it's a solid title and a must have for any 64 collection.. Wave Race 64 is an amazing game. For the time, this was the best water in a game ever! This game still looks great today. The game was fun, the tracks were fun, and I loved the stunt mode where you get points just for doing stunts. The commentator got annoying at times, but oh well, the game was amazing!. Great gameplay, cool music, and graphics that have aged better than a lot of early N64 games, Wave Race 64 is a must have for any N64 fanatic.. Well can you say anything bad about Wave Race? I played this game as a child and Its amazing how well its aged. They really dont make games like this anymore.. This game is nostalgic and simple and the 3rd best N64 game of 1996. This game is like wii sports it does have it flaws but since it was great and aged well it deserves a 10.. I don't have MUCH to say about this game. It doesn't have history or a huge replay like Mario Kart. But this game is still really good! Very beautiful graphics for N64, good multiplayer and great physic makes this game one of the best arcade race games of N64.. Graphics: 9.0 Sound: 8.5 Gameplay: 9.5 Fun/Story: 8.5 Great racing game, with nice graphics (water effects very good), physics and gameplay. Fine multiplayer.. Unbelievable graphics at the time of its release. The water alone was great. It is fun to play but the N64 has better racers.. The graphic was stunning by the moment standards, but that's all. Wave Race is more like a demo than a complete game. Almost no courses or racers. There was only a few tricks. Very short game without much of a relevance.. One of the bast game of Nintendo 64 , incredible when it was released, magnificent water effects and sound. Better than Wave Race Blue Storm on the gamecube.. Perhaps the best racing game on Nintendo 64; I just wish there were more courses in the game; it's quite difficult to make the racers do stunts; the voiceover can be patronising and what he says can be cheesy and corny. Impressive jet-ski simulator of the 90 's. Another one of the fantastic N64 launching games in it's first era, with good sound effects, commentaries and music. The physics of the water in this game were not matched in a long time.","i believe this was a launch game for the UK release and was worth picking up at launch . i'm still playing this game every year, this and Ocarina of time haven't aged one bit . the fact that this game got rushed in production and still ended up being a classic is a sheer marvel ."
178.Divinity: Original Sin II - Definitive Edition,"This game is quite good for the most part. Scratches that D&D style, turn based fantasy combat itch. Great character customization, branching story options allowing you to role-play in different ways, leading to different outcomes depending on your play style. Wife and I each have over 150 hrs in our campaigns, in many cases getting totally different outcomes for the same missions. It was interesting to compare how our games were playing out differently. Graphically, it is very well done, from the intricate armor and weapons, to the environments and characters. Sound is very well done, from the voice acting, sound effects and especially the music. So good I'll occasionally listen to the soundtrack out of game. It's a long game. Wife and I have been playing for about 2 months so we've definitely got our money's worth, and we may even play through a second time. That said, the game does have a few parts that are tedious and aggravating, ""The Deathroom"" for example near the end of the game was one of the stupidest implementations I've seen in any game. A few of the quests can be tedious and unclear. Fortunately the good here vastly outweighs the bad, and it's definitely worth slogging through some of the frustrating parts to enjoy the overall grand adventure the game offers. Definitely worth playing and I'd love to see a third installment.. I enjoy it more then BG3 simple finding combat better and not so much rng.. Exploration is grea,music is better then BG3,only missing cutscenes that BG3 added everything else is basically same game different name..Combat is just. Everything in this game is great! History, game play, crafting, leveling up.Great game, cannot go wrong!. So, so much fun. The only reason I didn't give it a full 10 is because I don't find the world overly convincing.. I tried this game after BG3, which I loved. Really was not expecting this drastic of a drop in quality. I hate this game.. Despite its acclaim, I found it inaccessible due to its demanding design. It's tough to enjoy without constant lookups and reloads.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really interesting concept and story, but it is very unclear in terms of what you're actually supposed to do to progress the story. You're pretty much on your own at the beginning, and the difficulty is quite high for some encounters.. Turn based combat and gameplay were never my peace of cake. DOS changed that and is now one of my favorite games. Long live Larian Studios!. Even better than bg3 in combat and soundtrack aspects.. Divinity: Original Sin 2 - PS5 Co-op playthrough Graphics: 8 Story: 10 Sound: 9 Music: 10 Gameplay: 9 Final Score: 9.2 First time actually finishing a CRPG in a Coop playthrough. The game was great, it was fun to explore and learn the many stories. Highly recommended. Absolute eternal masterpiece. Very long, but super satisfying game with huge variety of mechanics, tactics etc. Just a perfect match in a genre.. Realy good game from really good developers ...I hope they will make divinity 3 after buldur's gate 3 if not it's oke I will buy ther nexst game for sure. An upgraded version of the first game which was already incredible. This game is a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Larian.. keep being you. Clearly the result of a passion project. Just pure fun.. This game amazing! 12/10 A big and beautiful world, excellent work on the world, charismatic characters, I really like that there are characters with a history that you empathize with, this is very lacking in the modern game industry, you can talk about the Original sin series endlessly, but it’s better to play and preferably in a cooperative!. An absolutely riveting game that lives up to everything a RPG should aspire to be. The freedom of choice and direction in this game is staggering. The scope is staggering as well, and it was consistently jaw-dropping how much freedom and expansiveness the game offered to you. My only small negative was the balance near the end of the game felt off. I felt immensely overpowered with my characters, and made the last few areas and encounters trivial. The strategic gameplay of the majority of the game wasn't present -- I felt as though better scaling could have been implemented. Overall however, there is no reason for any RPG fan not to check this out. It's not only one of the best RPGs ever made, but one of the best gaming experiences I've had the pleasure to enjoy.. This is one of the best games I've played; however, I still think that at least for the PS4/PS5 a few flaws and annoying things hamper this from being best game ever. First, although combat is great in this game, with a wide variety of abilities, it relies WAY too much on environmental statuses like fire, water, electric, etc., and it gets annoying when enemies sometimes can just permastun you for it, and just also becomes hard to see as well. Also, I didn't like that basically you get almost all the best spells by act2, and there's four acts total. Another issue is that the game also does rely way too much on character level and gaining XP, so if you go into a fight a few levels below the enemy you have almost no chance of winning. This becomes an issue in the beginning of Act2 and Act4. Also, it's very easy to misclick and thus wasting your action points... And some fights are total bs, and sometimes way too high armor/magic resistance number Story for the most part is great, although some fatigue sets in Act4 as this game is like75+hours of gameplay. Music is great, voice acting is amazing. Sound effects are very good when you cast spells. The narrator/narration is also very well done, almost like a DM in DND explaining and narrating your adventure. Always fun to use different spells and abilities. You can definitely do more than one playthrough, and I do recommend this as you'll probably miss a lot of quests/encounters.. This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without ""fedex' quests. That' is something that for example. A friend bought it online during a sale and we wanted to play it in couch coop. We started and it was boring as hell. The graphics were bad and the start / tutorial did not pull us in. After 30 minutes we quit the game.. Loved it. Not as much as the first one but it remains a great concept. A refreshing battle system even though I preferred the one from the first game. However the playable characters are so much better. Each of them has background story which kept me really invested.. A massive disappointment. Don't believe in the hype. This game is a failure of RPGs, only the gameplay can be fun, and even then, only with friends and it's worse than that of the first game. Without going through spoilers, the developers tried to make this world where everyone is ""morally gray"" and you have the choice to do anything you want, yet all it culminated in was ""everyone feels evil and uninteresting, so kill kill kill, loot loot loot, yippity hoppity to the next quest"". There is nothing that is immersive, you can see the plot twists coming from the tutorial mission, all the characters are the tumblresque ""snarky and quirky but ill totally kill you if you cross me!!!"" type of personality. The game is so poorly done, one character's quest involves killing a lot of important NPCs, and when you do that, your other companions just get their quest ""progressed"" and just tell you to go to the next part of it. It's so laughably created that I had to force myself, twice, to finish the game with my brother. We finished it on the third difficulty, Classic, which is basically Medium/Hard. The most fun aspect of the gameplay in 1 was being able to increase your starting AP and your max AP, to be able to spam more and more abilities. What do they do in 2? Max AP is 6, can't increase starting AP without 2 turn buffs, and Source points. Yeah, those really cool and big abilities you could use more often in 1? Now they cost source points, something you only have a max of 3 of and which requires either draining a corpse to regain ONE point, or going to specific places in the world to do it. The only thing this game does well, and this is already a stretch: You can basically kill almost anyone you want, and, kudos to the developers, there will almost always be an alternative way to finish the quest. That's it. Go play an actual RPG, this game is trash. If the 1st one was a 7/10, this is an embarrassment, especially after how hyped up it was from all those paid youtube shills.. I love RPG and i bought this game because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I am now around 50 hours in the game and decided to leave it. The game is a huge time black whole, i spent around 50% of my time in the inventory, equipment and skills menus, the game is just too much overloaded with items I spent around 10% figuring out what are the quests and what to do exactly, the igame gives so many quests that you cannot continue because the enemies you face are just too much advanced and then you try to figure out which quests you can actually do. Quests most of the cases dont show on the map where you you need to do something so you spent a LOT of time wandering around. One quest i got, the NPC was telling i should look for an excavation site which is very near. it turned out to be in a totally different region, after looking for help on forums. And yes, i found that i was spending a LOT of time seaeching on forums what to actually do in the quests, because you have no clue and you have an overlod of quests The the rest of the time is spent on the turned based battles which can easily take more than an hour each! And of course if you cant win you need to start again or SAVE after each turn which just kills the fun! Then there are so many conversation, it is like a JRPG, the message of the NPC could be two dialogue items, but it tells you in 20! Way too much to listen/ read, at this point i have no idea what is the main story. I give 5 points because: It could have been a great game, it has an amazing soundtrack, its landscapes are beautiful and enjoyable to discover! You also havethe feeling that the people behind it really loved this project! But honestly i feel that so many hours of my life went into something where in most of the case i was either thumbling in inventory menues or just trying to figure out what to do. Not enough joy for me to continue with this game. It's the best RPG I've played in this generation. I acquired it initially thinking only at the local coop system, but I've discovered that this is just a plus, the game is really awesome. The art, the music, the combat system, the progress, the choices, the classes, everything was made with lots of real efford of the developers. You can see that they have payed attentioon to the detais, and they made a masterpiece. Congratulations Larian Studios for this work, It brought me lots of joy and fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Terrible controls, mediocre story, annoying camera. Stopped playing after two hours. I had very high expectation after reading the reviews, but I am disappointed and regret buying this.. This is by far the very best RPG I've ever played in my entire life. No bugs great gameplay and graphics. Good story too.. Fantastic game. I played this with my boyfriend as my first introduction to turn-based combat, and it was such a good introduction. I was hooked on this game within hours of playing it. Very easy to pick up if you're new to this genre (although I did look up guides for the best builds) and just a very enjoyable game. Great soundtrack and voice acting, and the side quests are just as interesting as the main story. I'm always recommending this game and I think it is a must play.. I have spend 90+ hours playing this game and i definitely will not want to play it again and this is why. I have played Divinity original sin 1, and i was more or less happy with it. I gave it 8/10 and closed my eyes to all the disadvantages the game had, and god knows there were plenty. I give this one 7/10 even though second part is better than the first one in every way possible. The music is simply amazing. I do not remember the game which had better music and i have played quite many games tbh. The story is soooooo much better than it was in the first part it is simply impossible to compare the two. Characters are much much much better. In all seven available you will definitely find at least one that you will love i guarantee that. The gameplay became even better compared to the first part. I loved the idea of different types of damages and all that came with it. I think it was a great addition to the strategic part of the game and that was really awesome, like you have to develop different builds for your characters so all can do different kind of damage. I really like this. I also liked the fact that you can change your stats in any moment, which was a great issue in the previous part cause many people just ruined the game in the first few hours and were never able to advance further in the game. This was not an issue with the second part, but that definitely does not mean that this game was flawless, god knows it wasn't. To begin with, flipping loading time for everything was like 5-7 minutes I **** you not. In the beginning you think it will get better and after you have played more than 50 hours in this game you almost loose your temper every time you make a mistake and have to get back to previous save or when something lags or if there was a bug in a location and the game will simply shut down and you have to load this **** again and that means more time waisted on just waiting for the game to load. Believe me this is supper annoying. Also in my game there was a bug when the game will just close itself whenever i will try to open this bloody cake on the dwarf wedding, which is super annoying cause you need this cake for a mission, i only avoided this problem cause i had Louse in my team, otherwise i don't know what i would have done. I have completed every single side quest that was in the game and i can defiantly say that the second part is harder than the first one, and i think that is where the main issue is. It is not simply harder in the strategical aspect, like you have to think more and stuff, this was actually cool it made me love this game, it was hard in the most boring way. You will just never be good enough for this game, just never. You think you had it all in the previous location you come to the next one and everyone is 2 levels higher than you and you can't do anything with it. You have to find the quests that you think you can do you go half way though it and realise you are just not good enough, your enemies are just better in every way possible, there is nothing you can do. And yeah, you die and have to load the game and wait for the loading for 7 minutes just to realise you need a different saving slot and you have to wait again. And that happened thorough out all 90+ hours of this game. It was unbearable. In the end you somehow complete all the quests, get your best build for your character, spend your last money on the equipment, you feel ready for the final battle... and you are not, You are just not. The final battle was a bloody joke. There was no strategy in it, at all, you just have to somehow survive and pray to be lucky with how your enemies will act, and god knows whatever they do you will not benefit from it. I read all the guides I could find and that did not make live easier. I spend all day for a final battle, just to find out that i do not like any of the endings. ANY OF THEM. Maybe this is just my problem, but if i knew the ending would be such a disappointment, I would have simply watched on YouTube and spend the day doing something else. I liked that this game was not easy, but i think the final battle just ruins all the magic the game had, cause you just want it to end and be over with it. Thinking back, second part is so much better than the first in every way possible except for one, first part got kinda boring in the end, second just became unbearable. I would not recommend it to anyone who didn't play the first part, or who is not the fan of RPG. came back to this review and decided that i was wrong. the game is amazing, at least 8/10. The game has its flaws and solo play deserves 9/10 at most and can be comparable to the level of the first Pillars of Eternity game. But the addition of the local split screen coop in a full RPG game for 160 hours is worth noting and deserves a +1 to the score. If you have someone to play with don't hesitate as this is one of the best coop games I ever played. I was not a fan of the first game (mostly because of poor story and music) but I fell in love with this one. Pros: + Tactical fights are so much better than the ones in Pillars of Eternity. You plan your tactics and cooperate to achieve the best outcome. + Leveling system is clear and rewarding. You are embracing each new level with excitement. + A lot of branching paths and ways to solve the conflicts. You are creating the story. This is the closest to TTRPG I've ever seen. + Amazing music. + Local coop – I found it the best way to experience this game. + The story presented in the game with all the conflicts presented between characters is so much better than in the first game. it is still sometimes hard to follow with all the side stories but i was curious what will happen next. + Crafting and consumables that I actually used, which is not common when I usually play the games. + Companions with the arcs related to the main story is a great way to engage the player. Cons: – You start all the fights with full health and refreshed abilities. this makes most of the encounters very similar (you always start with the same combination of moves). – Story is still a secondary thing. It is not the level of storytelling that Witcher or Pillars of Eternity has. – The setting is not super interesting PoE wins this round. – Fights are tailored to a specific level. If you go to the place you are not supposed to go, you don't stand a chance. – The world feels condensed and thus very small. That affects the story that is told like a grand adventure. – Too much elemental surfaces. Almost every fight were infested with permanent fire. The world burned all the time. – There are a lot of bugs for a 3 year old game (I played it in late 2020).. This game could be great but is held back by its many issues thanks to poor design/ execution. At first, the combat was a bit challenging but once I figured it out I had a ton of fun with it. The other strongest point of the game is the soundtrack, which is absolutely brilliant. While I did like some of the characters and party members, I did not feel truly attached to any of them (which is kind of weird considering I spent 150 hours with them). As for the story, it isn't anything spectacular but it has to be said that the replayability is strong with different builds and characters. My main issue was the map, which is the **** design I've ever seen in a videogame and the fact that I had to look up on the internet which areas had quests appropriate for my level because I didn't want to get absolutely destroyed by enemies 2 levels above me. That was really immersion breaking. I actually think enemy AI and ally AI is a bit different because enemies seem at least capable of using tactics, while ally AI is the worst kind of garbage there is. That became clear to me during a quest where you have to protect an npc ( who is eager to join the battle by any means, I mean ANY means) and after 2 tries I finally managed to keep him out of battle until the very end where he ran into necrofire and gradually killed himself from full health. All that without a purpose, he didn't attack a single enemy, he just climbed up a ladder and burned to death. I don't even know if that actually counts as a bad thing because it was hilarious. Also, the game wastes so much of your time: the fact that skills have a cooldown outside of combat is extremely annoying, as well as having no sprint button when you have to backtrack and explore so much ( fast travel points are sometimes far away from your objective). The game froze 3 times during my playthrough (nothing wrong with ps hardware, I played RDR2 just before this game without any issues) when I started looting stuff. Oh yeah, that reminds me: the inventory is also a mess, it gets so clogged up, there should be a way to better categorize items. That's my experience in a nutshell. I'd still recommend picking up this game if you like turn based rpg-s, maybe you'll have a better time with it than I did.. I played this game following Divinity: Original Sin 1, so I sort of knew what to expect. Played the game anyway. Larion studios throws their own style and creativity and silliness onto the classic baldur's gate 2 style gameplay. Improved from the first one. For those used to sword and sorcery RPGS like Skyrim, Neverwinter Nights and the Dragon Age games, the world has a bit of a scaled down ""cartoony"" feel. It is strategic turn based combat. You control a team of 4. And though you can do it solo (with added challenge, and the right perks) team of 4 is the intended way to play. There are a lot of things about the game like that. Firstly, the enemy AI is much improved from the first game. There is a damage boost/penalty from high places creatively scattered throughout the map. Proper team positioning can make or break you. Causing/avoiding environmental effects or damage is of primary importance throughout the experience. The game offers a lot of freedom, in terms of what you do and how, but there are certain systems designed to reward some combos and punish others. Magic has the most AOE attacks and the most powerful too. But friendly fire is a thing in this game. I went a little fire heavy in the beginning only to be mid-battle with the entire map on fire and half my team burning to death quicker than the enemy. A better strategy throughout was to stun/freeze/petrify/charm/knockdown as many enemies as you can, causing them to lose their turn or help you, and gang up on the rest. When successful, this feels a bit cheesy. Then again, right before the final battle a lever got pulled and the game turned my team into helpless cows for 2 turns. Oh yeah, your team can be similarly disabled. If it happens to all of them the game plays itself for a while, you're probably going to lose, and you might not get a next turn. So the cheese goes both ways. Overall I found the combat fun and challenging at the best of times, and frustrating to the point of feeling rigged against me at the worst of times. And definitely addicting. Not always in a good way. On normal difficulty success is not guaranteed, and nothing more annoying than sinking 45 min into a battle only to realize a mistake you made at the beginning, or lucky break by the enemy AI was going to doom you, and the only way to win the fight meant going back and trying again from an earlier save. Save often if you do get the game. Then there is the layout/plot. While artfully crafted the game hides key plot important stuff in easy to miss ways. Items that trigger or are for side quests are easy to miss. There are also an number of puzzles you must solve to progress. Those range from stupid easy, to very difficult entirely due to lack of instructions. They intend exploration, and want you ""try it until you figure it out."" But if, like me, you recoil at spending over 100 hrs on a PC game, well several game guides are available to consult, to get the most out of one play through. I honestly could not imagine playing the game without consulting them, and think that's a level design flaw. Too easy is one thing, but a lot of stuff was too obscure because of the user interface. Leading to unexciting wasted time revisiting places to chase down the thing I missed. Without a game guide, one would get stuck and give up. The game is mainly split into 4 areas. And while its easy to think the prison isle is a short ""tutorial"" level, it is actually the first 1/4 of everything. You're weak and under-geared, but so is the enemy then. The second act was the biggest, but I also found to be a bit of a slog. Enemy difficulty varied greatly, you could walk from an easy fight, 20 paces away to a fight that was bordering on impossible without a few more levels under your belt. Difficulty spikes throughout. Act 3 was the best one for me. Best in terms of esthetic and balance of combat. Whereas the final act, every level you got lead to massive gear improvements, but some boss fights felt like a steep difficulty jump my team was not ready or prepared for. If this sounds like your jazz, play on. But for needing to rely on outside info to get through, and the combat frustration, I give it a 6/10. This game is everything I want from an rpg. i thoroughly enjoyed exploring every little nook and cranny in this game to find every bit of content I could. The game looks gorgeous, and there is a lot to explore. You always feel rewarded for exploring more. The story isn't anything especially original, but it is told with a lot of charm. The companion quests are also enjoyable and there are plenty of interesting side quests. Actually, this is one of the few games where I replay all the side quests during every play through. All in all this is absolutely one of my favourite games of all time and I can't wait to start another play through.. Rekindled my love for turn based RPGs and RPGs in general. Some of the best/consistent voice acting I've ever heard. So many different ways to do things with different outcomes. I hope this becomes a continued set of games that come out every few years.. Amazing gameplay and world, liberty of choices like a D&D A cool creation mode too. I bought the game expecting an old fashioned RPG game. I was not disappointed. Larian gave us a great tactical RPG game. You can customize your whole team to do as you please (and try again during the game if you're not completely satisfied). You can speedrun it, or just take full on hours exploring the big ass map with tons of secrets everywhere. Is the game perfect ? No. There are a lot of bugs. Freezes. Camera bugs. Cursor bugs (really sometimes trying to aime for a spell sends the cursor in the hell-hole below the map for no reason). It's confusing as well : combat screens get full-on bonkers and unreadable, and tons of mechanics are never properly explained. Is also is not completely consistent as some chapters are much better than others. Should I rank them, I would probably advocate for chapter II as the absolute best since it is so big, so diverse, so challenging and starts to bring a lot of the story to your understanding. Finally, the game is very punishing for two reasons. One : a single mistake can really cost you a game over. Two : even if you can save at any moment (which is a great feature), the loading delays are so frigging high that it become a recurring nightmare. On the bright side, each time you misclick your target you can go boil yourself a nice cup of tea while reloading. It is still very good. The fights are challenging, the story has tons of layers, which you can't all see in a single game. The effects are very impressive and the combat mechanics are really rich, depending on the team you use. The atmosphere is overall great : writing, music and sounds, dialogues. Something interesting to mention is that the difficulty scales pretty roughly yet smartly. At times it can seem frustrating, but it's just the game telling you tha tyou shouldn't be there just yet. And hell, how good it feels to actually play roles ? Very.. Merits of this RPG are limited to the nice looks and excellent sound quality. As a game, its painfully limited and linear, and just lacks the depth and scope of, say, Pillars of Eternity. The combat system is lacking as well, what with the 'outlining' of enemies behind other objects being so poorly done, most of the time you cannot see where the enemies are, and so on. Stories too, are rather dull. So, a very mediocre experience. And still rather buggy as well at the time of writing.. Go with Pillars or Torment, or the excellent Baldur's Gate 1&2, if you want to play a good old skool RPG. This aint worth it.. God I dunno where to start.This game is epic.From the original score,characters,stories,it’s perfect in every way.Also if you have do decide which character to choose,I highly recommend to play as Ifan **** character development and story is marvelous.. I loved the game. Finally, a great classic RPG again. The story is very interesting. The characters are very likeable. The game length is immense! I love the freedom the game gives you. You can solve quests in so many different ways. The choices you make affect the game directly! The gameplay and the fighting system is a lot of fun! Overall, a great game!. Trash. More broken than the first one. Figured I'd give Larian one more chance, but never buying another title from them again. I was looking forward to Baldur's Gate too. But DOS2 on consoles is so broken it's almost unplayable. Anywhere from the awful battle controls on controller to bartering; i.e. be very careful when trying to talk to an NPC in a city or something lest you highlight the wrong thing with these garbage console controls and accidentally steal something. You would think Larien would put some kind of failsafe mechanic for this sort of thing, but alas they're just another garbage dev.. One of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had for a long time. There's a STEEP learning curve for new players, I had a hard time learning the ropes in Fort Joy but the rewards for pushing through are great. The game is vast, with lots to explore. You can get completely lost in this game for hours at a time which can be both a good, and a bad thing. Great gameplay, a fantastically designed world, and voice acting throughout only added to my experience. I think the game would benefit from a comprehensive tutorial before Fort Joy. Also, Act 3 and 4 were slightly disappointing compared to Fort Joy and Reapers Coast but altogether the story was solid. A fantastic way to spend 75 hours. The only negative is the fact I'm struggling to find a game to play now I've completed this epic journey!. Unbalanced. Unfair. Unpolished. Bad game design overhall. Every defeat you stand there. Unsure of what you have done wrong. You are then graced with a long loading screen and more unfair challenges. Waste of code. Waste of time.. This is how rpg must work... If u are new in turn base rpg choose explorer difficulty and enjoy such a great game!! A game with everything u want. Exploration, dialogs, open world approach at every single fight (u can go straight, cheese it, trick it and more), lot of characters, tons of builds (this may be a problem)! Nice music, great controls at ps4. Very good tactical rpg with a lot of replayability. Very few games give you that level of freedom, choose your own path, it is even possible to kill guest giver npcs if you feel like it. Combats are fun and challenging, character progression is addictive. Story is average though imo. Last but not least, split screen couch co op give you the opportunity to share this adventure with your better half. Best feature ever.. It is one of the best games I played maybe my whole life. It is really great. The story is exciting with lots of unexpected twists, and great multi-dimensional characters. Difficulty level is great. Classic is really challenging, then if you like to dig in for nuanced mechanics and min-maxing, and against a bit of an unfair challenge (like I do) you will definetly enjoy replaying it on Tactitian. The one small thing I regret is that I feel there isn't that many viable builds on Tactitian which I would gladly replay again otherwise. All in al","despite its acclaim, I found it inaccessible due to its demanding design . graphics are very well done, from the intricate armor and weapons . sound is very well done, from the voice acting, sound effects and especially the music ."
179.Galactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor,"Complex strategical turn based space game. Really fun, great for its time... This game has some of the best A.I. you will ever find in a turn based strategy, which is a good thing since there is no multiplayer feature. Unfortunately I feel the need to point out that if you're a fanatic TBS player like myself, it still holds no challenge (unless you let it cheat) once you figure the ins and outs of the game. The music is average, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is utterly fantastic. Galactic Civilizations 2's ship editor is one of the most impressive I have ever seen. No need to take my word for it, just use google and look at what other people have made using it. The planet micro management portion is quite interesting, with each planet having a chance to have certain tiles that give a % bonus to production/research/etc that makes each and every planet worth colonizing in the long run. That crappy 4-5 quality planet that you'd normally ignore in search of something better? It might just have a 800% production tile that makes it outstrip every other planet in the sector when it comes to building your war fleets. Speaking of war, that's the one part of the game that keeps me from giving galactic civilizations 2 a 10 out of 10. When it comes to combat, it really is a matter of rock/paper/scissors in terms of defense and offense. You have lasers, missiles, guns and a corresponding defense for each. All combat boils down to is who has more weapon 'points' that isn't covered by their enemy's defense points, and how many ships you have. It doesn't get more complicated than that, which is a real shame. One need only look at games like Master of Orion 2 to see how it could have been done better. A turn based combat system that actually let you control the ships would have opened up entirely new avenues of fun and possibility. All in all, a great game with almost no bugs (I have been playing it for well over a year and the only issue I ever encountered was a strange bug where I loaded a save and all ships had 1hp and 1 movement) that could have used minor tweaking in a few areas to truly be the game of the year instead of just great.. Instead of spending a lot of time to say WHY this game is GREAT, I'll just make a USEFUL review. Look that the NEGATIVE reviews (only EIGHT as of march/2014). They are of people that either: A) say that they don't like 4x B) say that the game is too long (do you REALLY expect to conquer a GALAXY in a couple of hours?) C) say that the game is bad because it only supports one language: English, although the review is in English. D) says that he likes the old games better E) reviews Galactic Civ II badly by saying that **** is not a complete game (may be he got the game in the bundle on steam, where both games came together). Man, THIS IS NOT THE GAME YOU ARE REVIEWING. F) give irrelevant runts and never justify his grade So, if not even the people that gave bad grades to the game could justify those grades, I can guarantee you that the game is worthy 10x the price asked today (US$ 10).. All Flash, no bang. Nice graphics overlay simple, not at all deep, game-play. It's a step removed from a point and click adventure. Desperate groupies try to hold this shallow title up to its better predecessors, and it's very irritating to play it and find out earlier games are miles ahead (in strategy and game play) of this game.. A true masterpiece ****, will keep you coming back longer than any other game. I dare say it is superior to Master of Orion. There's a huge amount of customization, ranging from completely modifiable races, to a map editor and the most utilitarian starship editor in a **** game fully supports mods, which increases the already immense replayability tenfold. Tons of humor, tons of random, interesting events... It's just such a joy to play, pick this up some time!. One of the best turn based strategy games ever! I really cannot express how amazing this game is, it's only downfall is the cinematic combat, but even that is awesome! I would recommend this to everyone who loves strategy!. It was time to choose a new game. I carefully reed and analyse the metacritics. So I was sure to make a good purchase. I choose GC2. First, I had problems to install the game. I began my first game in EASY mode. Early in the game, some pirates take one of my planet between two turns. Took me many many turns to got the technology to take it back. It was just returning to normal when another gang of pirates arrived. Some professionals this time. Their vessels were arround 100 times stronger than mines. I took between 300 and 500 turns to got the technologies to built some presentable units to face them. By that time, they had destroyed almost everything I had and moreover, almost everything others had, in the galaxy. Some starships were hidden in the corners of the maps. lol. But I was finally ready, built 4 pairs of huge destroyers. I was wipe out in a single attack, and they had lost nothing. Just a bit damaged. They were still 20 times stronger than me. Soon after, they finished me. Pirates won the game -I had no fun at all. Even not interested to try another game. Those pirates stole me 19,99 dollars.. Steam Winter Sale 2012/13: Outdated graphic. Tooltips or ingame help? Supports only one language (english). Crashes randomly. No link to or use of the community patches. Master of Orion 2 is still the master of this genre.. As much as I wanted to like this game, it was far too easy and the AI very insufficient and easy to manipulate. I could win every game easily with any victory condition I wanted. There were some good points. Being able to design your own ship was a big plus, and the tech trees were good too. The beginning was challenging, with trying to get your race profitable before your starting money ran out. But apart from that, not much else was good.. A brilliant turn based 4X strategy game that still has no competition. The balancing of the game is awe inspiring. I had to stop playing this game and uninstall it because it took over my every weekend and every afternoon and I was starting to lose contact with friends. I don't believe there will ever be a GalCiv3 because quite simply no-one can think of a way to make this game better other than updating its graphics which are still fine.. Maybe I just don't like 4x strategy games? I tried hard to get into this game, but it just all felt so pointless. There is a total lack of a compelling story in any of the game modes. Looking at the gameplay itself, everything felt like a tedious grind to me. Turn based strategy games can be a lot of fun (I've really enjoyed random stuff like Blood Bowl or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series), but other than the enjoyable music, Galactic Civilizations II just didn't ""grab"" me at all.. great game and i dont understand some of the reviews here, saying 10 for graphics and 3 for turn based, why are people that dont like turn based games playing turn based game an giving them bad rating becaue of that??? the reason its turn based is the reason why m and many others like these kind of games, it gives you time to think and plan and they are supposed to take forever to play, not just jump in to play one game or something like that. if you like turn based strategy games then try this one out, you wont regret it. Loved this game. I would hate to hazard a guess how many hours I put into this horribly addictive game. Should come with warning saying "" if you want to have any type of life do not play"" highly highly addictive. You will be up to 5 oclock in the morning with this game. Must play for space sim strategy fans.. Fantastic game. **** truly outdid themselves. Years of hard work from this middle market company have truly paid off. Can't wait for Gal CIv III which I am sure will come out in a couple of years. :) I'd give it a 9.5 if I could but there are no fractions so I'll round down to a 9.. Turn based strategy means a game where winning is based on complex thought and not reflexes or the speed of the PC or connection. This is a complex strategy based game. As usual in strategy games, there is a very long campaign based on a story line and skirmish capability. The skirmish capability is outstanding, allowing the user to play the role of any of a number of races with different strengths and technological abilities. With some race customization capability and different star systems, this allows for a huge amount of variation in game play. Games can take many hours to play out. The game allows saving status and resuming. The biggest weakness for most people is the lack of multiplayer support. This game is only turn based with one person playing against one or more computer opponents. Alliances are allowed, either in up front game definition or on the fly, by negotiation between players. A multiplayer option would be nice, but is difficult to implement because the length of game play is often too long for keeping a group together. After downloading, there is no need for an internet connection to play the game and no disk is needed to play. This is particularly a plus for PCs without (soon to be obsolete) optical drives. I appreciate a game that cares about convenience for the user over awkward and annoying copy protection schemes. Reasonable graphics performance requires a midrange graphics card. Playability suffers a little with too slow a PC, though not nearly as much as reflex based games. The detailed, race based technology trees add complexity and affect strategy choices. Impressive ship customization options add to thought required and entertainment value. While a detailed analysis of the science may poke holes (population growth etc), the game is quite sophisticated and presents an interesting hypothetical future. Unlike many ""strategy"" games, the simple solution of massing a huge army and only then attacking does not work. Unlike many games, there is an ongoing maintenance cost for ships that are in operation. Maintaining a very large standing fleet hurts the economy and future military capability. To win requires a strong economy, manufacturing capability, technology and, of course, fleet. Much more realistic than most games. Also something that many political leaders do not pay enough attention to in the real world.","galactic civilizations 2's ship editor is one of the most impressive I have ever seen . combat is a matter of rock/paper/scissors in terms of defense and offense . the music is average, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is utterly fantastic ."
18.GoldenEye 007,"I understand that this game is considered one of the greats but I can't play it. I have attempted to boot this game up on both my N64 and Switch but on both consoles I lack any motivation to play it. There is no progression tracker in the game as far as I am concerned which always makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. I also really dislike how it controls but I understand that is due to the hardware it's on.. Retains the camp of the source material while revolutionizing the first-person shooter and multiplayer gaming. This was the first game I remember playing with other people.. This game is a classic, this game is a big reason that first person shooters are the way they are, but man does this game not hold up well in its current state.Thats coming from someone who has tryed playing it on Xbox, Switch, and N64. I think the game behind it, is actually really great. It's environments are well made and make it easy to see enemies, the missions can be funny and quirky to play, and even by todays standerds the shooting and action isn't that bad. But the problem is that It's still not great in it's current state. I feel if they added more control options like mouse and keyboard, and fixed the switch version so you don't have to use button mapping. And added more quality of life improvements like Save States in more versions than the switch version it would be better. A true classic, an innovation of game design, but needs some work from modern developers. GoldenEye 007 – A Revolutionary ClassicGoldenEye 007 is an absolute gem that redefined what a first-person shooter could be, especially on consoles. From its thrilling single-player campaign to its iconic multiplayer mode, the game offers an experience that is nothing short of groundbreaking. The level design is superb, with each mission offering a perfect blend of action, stealth, and strategy, all tied to the beloved James Bond universe.What truly sets GoldenEye apart, though, is its multiplayer mode. The split-screen battles are legendary, providing endless hours of fun and competitive play. The balance of weapons, from the satisfying silenced PP7 to the devastating Golden Gun, is perfect for both casual and hardcore players alike. The game’s variety of modes and customization options ensured that no two multiplayer sessions felt the same.Even after decades, GoldenEye remains a nostalgic masterpiece, a game that not only shaped the FPS genre but also created countless unforgettable gaming memories. Its impact on gaming history is undeniable, and it still holds up as one of the best experiences of its era. A true classic!. Legendary FPS masterpiece. One of the reasons to own a N64. The game captured the over-the-top feel of the movie. Its levels are well designed with various objectives (depending on difficulty level) to complete and great weapons and gadgets to use. The multiplayer is just as enjoyable with its numerous maps and modes. Overall, I would rate this with a 10 out of 10.. Legendary Multiplayer mode, single-player mode ****. It went on to influence other games like Halo.. My first FPS, Perfect !. We live in a timeline where a movie licensed game made by a small, inexperienced dev team evolved and helped to define the FPS genre, and how detrimental multiplayer can be to your enjoyment ****.. The FPS that proved it could be done on consoles, and done well. A team that had never made a game before and this was their first shot at it. At the time it was ambitious, looked amazing for N64, and had all the key points from the movie and then some. Replayability was massive in this game, i sunk so many hrs into it, and ive loved every minute of it. While the modern xbox port wasnt anything great with its choppy framerate, it at least blew the dust off an old legend for everyone to try. Ill always be happy to be able to play it on a modern console. This game is good. One of the best N64 games and one of the best shooters if all time. In my eyes this will forever outclass any other fps.. This game brought my mother and father to FPS. The best game hands down on N64 next to Mario of course. Good one player but it’s with 4 players that this game really shines. Get the Golden Gun before anyone else and get ready for the arguing. Lol. So many great memories playing this game solo and with friends. Such an iconic FPS.. Yeah this is an E P I C game. It basically has it all - and all of it is good.. Doom may have been the original ground breaking FPS, but Goldeneye provided all of the embellishments that made them what they are today. Missions that required marksmanship and stealth as well as a fast trigger finger and its cinematic storyline that stays true to the film were watershed moments in gaming evolution. It does have some ****; the graphics are definitely showing their age, the witless AI means that many enemies can't even cope with an open door and all of the scenery explodes as if its made of dynamite regardless of what it is, but it still presents a challenge with a one-more-go-factor that hasn't dulled with age. One of the few truly classic N64 games.. not that fun **** very boring after a little bit the controls are very clonke just not fun. This is the most important FPS in console gaming history. An absolute masterpiece and the original console FPS. Every console FPS you play today has its origins in this game.. What a legendary and classic FPS, another masterpiece from the golden-age of Nintendo. I recently played through the game again, on the Switch, and I have to say, it still holds up really well. Multiplayer is a blast and the campaign is phenomenal.. Simply one of the best games ever made. A masterpiece on every level. Gameplay, sound, atmosphere. Some games just get everything right, and this is one of those.. GOLDENEYE 007 was the FPS game that changed everything. The first FPS game to use an analogue stick and amazing graphics and very entertaining gameplay and split screen couch 1 v 1. Good times. The classic analog stick FPS. Here's a secret: if you plug in a second controller, you can play with two joysticks for the single player mode. However, the right stick moves your vision up and down and strafe left and right, while the left stick moves your vision left and right and move forward and backward.. When I was young, I was left with an n64 hand me down console. I hadn't ever played a fps to that point as I was 8 years old, And I felt how bad this game controls and didn't like it, I have given it some more chances over the years but till this point I still see it as clunky especially looking back. pretty cool tho. Perfect Dark is amazing, i really enjoy playing against the CPU bots, but 1 thing... F*** Purple. The Farsight is by far the best weapon in the game. It is so good and efficient at shooting that the game practically plays itself. Any person who disagrees with this assessment that i have provided adequate proof of shall be uninvited to my birthday party. Which would be a shame because i am going to have a bouncy castle, On a side note, the game has no boob jiggle physics. and those pointy pyramids are stationary while moving which is extremely unrealistic.. A shooter this old should not hold up as well as Goldeneye does, but this game is still incredibly satisfying to play, even more entertaining than most modern shooters on the current market. I think it accomplishes this due to the diversity of locations and objectives, sound design, and npc animations. While a few segments don't live up to the legendary status of this game, the highs it offers even to this day are incredibly commendable.. After replaying about half of the single player with the new Xbox release, this game still holds up. Best fps ever created by a mile. Beyond revolutionary for its time, but still enjoyable years later for the massive nostalgia blast.. The game was a huge stepping stone for fps and multiplayer but the controls and A.I just failed to deliver, making it a deal breaker. Goldeneye is one of the most legendary and celebrated licensed games ever made, and for good reason. It's fantastic. I recently got the chance to properly play this title for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and I can certainly see the appeal. It's quite easy to look past the dated elements, as the core experience is very strong. I have only really played the single player campaign which I thought was amazing, even though the multiplayer is the more famous aspect of the title. I highly recommend giving Goldeneye a shot, though some have made the bold claim that it hasn't aged well or was never good, playing it yourself proves that is most definitely not the case.. Really not worth the hype, unreasonably hard story mode and dogwater controls.. Great game even though I wasn't very good at this one I owned it on N64 and this was funny pow pow ahhh ( falls off the ledge. Not aged well classic shooter. Besides this a great game at the time of his release. Playing it with other people... Memories... One can't fault the game for its tightly programmed stage layout, flexible controls, or its multiplayer mode, all innovative for their time. In objective terms, there is some needless frustration in the higher difficulty settings, which will stifle unlocking secrets and cheats—the only reason to play this game once its story mode has been completed. Barely repelling the infinitely spawning battalions of enemies is made worse by a stuttering frame rate, obviously the result of eschewing sprites in favor of polygons at the conceptual stage. Despite the highly praised effort from British developer Rare, it is clear that Konami would have done better with this material.. Perfect Dark is better, and always will be. this is one of the best and top n64 games out there. But for its time it was great, but has aged terribly, compared to perfect dark. Everyone loved this game back then, but time moves on, and that age is gone. better represent the classics yo! PD > 007..... The first great first-person shooter game ever made, but gameplay doesn't hold up anymore.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my most played games in life. Absolutly revolutionary in a genre that wasn't even a console genre in the time. Incredible.. I haven't played this game in 15 years so I don't know how much pure nostalgia is playing into my ranking. Me and my brothers and my friend used to play this all the time... no oddball allowed obviously. It was the first FPS I ever played and personally I think it still holds up. Is it a better to game to let’s say Half-Life? No but the nostalgia and fun I have with this games makes up for that and more. If you haven’t played this game, check it out, it’ll be worth your while.. we were pretty young to realize how good a game was. But we just kept playing every day for many hours, without realizing it was a masterpiece. Now that we are older we get it. What can you say? The single player? Perfect. The 4 player split-screen? A unique experience that I wish they implement it nowadays again. You mean if Nintendo released a console with 4 player split screen on 60 inch monitors, you wouldnt play with your friends?. An amazing first-person shooter that perfectly captures the aesthetic of the 1995 movie. One of the greatest video games ever made. It ranks up with ""Grand Theft Auto III"", ""Metal Gear Solid"" and ""Halo"" as a truly astounding action title. If you own the N64, you should grab a copy. It's an essential for action fans. 10 out of 10. Goldeneye 007 is a dated shooter. I can see its influence on console gaming and console first-person shooter but in a few years nobody remembered Goldeneye anymore, that's because Goldeneye played it safe, there was nothing memorable or special about it but it offered great fun for N64 players. It's still worth experiencing today but not something to be sad about. Just play it with an emulator if you can.. One of the best campaigns and multiplayer experiences of any shooting game ever. Only problem is that the graphics **** ass.. Great game, really ahead of its time. I spent a lot of time in multiplayer. Its super fun even today!. F**k Halo and all other shooter genres (except Wolfenstein) this is the perfect shooter game it is just nearly perfect. I really like the in game cheats because 00 Agent is pretty hard. The James Bond genre is pretty good at all but this is by far the best Shooter Game before Goldeneye on Wii. By far my favorite n64 game. This is definitely a pioneering game in the realm of 4 players. insanely amazing.. Was fun to play against friends. Story and missions are very simple and boring however.. my favorite nintendo 64 first person shooter game, there is three difficult levels to everyone to get the hang. The best James Bond game ever made. The best First Person Shooter ever made. Period.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is amazing in every aspect, as a fps, as a mutiplayer. The story follows the movie. A perfect game.. Very rough and laggy today its still fun to play with the amazing soundtrack.. I love this game!! I think this is what brought first person shooter games to where they are today. The missions could be as hard or easy as you wanted. Unlockable characters and the best maps ever for the time the game was made.. To simply put, this game is legendary! I absolutely love this game, punchy gunplay and it has really simple but intuitive gameplay and is surprisingly addictive and fresh compared to many FPS´s these days, one of the most iconic soundtracks ever made and a multiplayer that is simple but so fun, add all that to a blender and you create a game that lasts forever.. This is the N64 classic that truly has it all. A fun singleplayer campaign, and of course some of the best local multiplayer I've played in my life. When it comes to movie based games, it never gets better than this!. One of the first 3D perspective shooters that gave rise to what we know today in the genre. Gameplay of 10 despite the limitations of the n64 controller. History and fun on all sides. Nothing bad to say about this game.. This was one of the games I played most on my Nintendo 64. A great first person shooter, and even more fun when you're playing with friends. Never really got into the story mode, because I am in love with multiplayer games.. One of better FPS titles on N64, the game still has quite a lot of charm, even if its showing its age. Solid multiplayer, and a good campaign make this must-have title for any N64 owner.. I remember the first time I saw Goldeneye 007 it looked so different from what I expected a shooter to be. DOOM, Shadow Warrior, Blood everything I knew about shooters has rooted in the idea that you went down a straight path with floating key cards that opens up the exit to the level. Goldeneye takes those rules and destroys them. You were no longer going down a straight path, you were now doing objectives. This game as a console shooter was so revolutionary that it provided a whole new standard for what console shooters should be able to do allowing games such as Uncharted 4 and Call Of Duty to even be on consoles. You can shoot enemies with a silenced pistol, a karate chop, an AK47, and with this wealth of tools it allows you to approach gameplay with these little nuances that make the gameplay so exciting like when you use the silenced pistol you have to aim carefully because if you miss it will alert the enemies to your presence, if you don't have any ammo for your guns you can karate chop your enemies for more, using the AK in missions with alarms and cameras the guards will run towards the alarms to set them off which will call in reinforcements and the cameras will more easily spot you. The gameplay of Goldeneye is so dynamic that in any second the player is making tons of decisions without even realizing it and all of them feed into the central idea of freedom. From the moment you start playing, you choose which objectives you want to complete in which order and which objectives from the levels you want to do. The train level really flies out of left field with these claustrophobic and close quarters spaces. the airfield is a nice contrast to this, sure you have these annoying turrets but the tank is really fun to use. So many things from this game have been permanently etched into my mind like the unlockables in the main menu, it's such a creative idea to even have these kinds of unlockables like the cheat codes and the secret difficulty. I've spent so much time replaying missions just to see the alternate dialogues you can get depending on how you approach a mission. The game has a incredible way of prodding your imagination with these atmospheric little touches like how if you shoot Alec at the end of the second mission, he will call you a traitor or if you kill the innocent programmer in the Control mission Natalya will show disappointment in you, it makes you think ""what other outcomes could I possibly get?"". To me, Goldeneye 007 is more than an important game. It's an infinity re-playable wonder with an air-tight foundation that has shaped my thoughts on what video games should strive to be. I love this stuff.. This game is fantastic, but I strongly believe Perfect Dark's multiplayer options are vastly superior.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 8.5 Sound/Music: 10 Graphics/Art: 9 Design/Atmosphere: 9 OVERALL: 9.1/10. This game is only worth playing for the multiplayer, the campaign is kinda terrible. Campaign mode is extremely frustrating to play. There's little to no direction on what to do or where to go at any time. I spent sometimes over an hour just wondering through overly large maps trying to figure out what to to. The enemies are also extremely annoying. There were plenty of times when I was in a empty room with only one way in or out and when I go to leave, I get shot in the back of the head and get insta killed. It's not that the game is hard necessarily, so much as it's unfair and frustrating to have enemies constantly spawn behind you all the time. I wanted to like this game but the campaign is just no good. I'd give it like a 3/10 without the multiplayer, it's the only thing that makes this game worth owning.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Seriously one of the best games of all time! The game's controls (that at first are hard to get used to but you'll find that you will adapt quite quickly) are pretty nice and responsive. The graphics (if we're judging by N64 standards) are very good and aren't disgusting messes to look at like some games that I've seen on the system. Auto aim is very nice and helps the fact that an N64 doesn't have 2 analogue sticks, but for guns like snipers, there is a button that allows for manual aim. The story is actually pretty decent for an N64 game as well. If you have a chance to play it, check it out!. Easily the best first-person shooter on the Nintendo 64, and one of the best games of its generation. I spent many hours with my college roommates enjoying the stellar split-screen multiplayer. The single-player campaign is brilliant fun, combining elements of stealth with good old-fashioned gun blazing action. The soundtrack is pure Bond. A must-own for every Nintendo 64 collector.. What I loved about this game is that it did the movie justice! This game was awesome, and it opened the door for future shooting games, because Goldeneye introduced us all to the multiplayer in shooters!!! This game had hours and hours of playability. ODD JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Clearly a 10 back in 97. Clearly a 10 back in 97. Clearly a 10 back in 97. Clearly a 10 back in 97.. The best FPS ever made! Remarkable! The atmosphery of the game, the soundtrack, the style.. Everything is perfect in this game! 21 years later and I still discovering new things in Goldeneye!. This was my all time favorite gem of any console growing up. Every console FPS to date is measured on a scale with goldeneye being the benchmark. Replaying in 2018 in 16:9 on LCD TV and this game still amazes me how ahead of it's time it still is. THE masterpeice of all FPS.. Goldeneye 007 is a fun n64 shooter game developed by RareWare. It has amazing graphics, wonderful gameplay, good controls and an excellent soundtrack. The game will keep you occupied for hours. A must have for any person.. No joke, at this point in 2017 my 8 year old son regularly chooses to play this game over dozens of newer games on newer consoles. It litterally made him want to watch the original Goldeneye film the other night. The power of classic games.. One of THE best licensed games ever made to one of the best Bond films of all time. Look everyone knows that movie licensed games **** now but back then this was something extraordinary. This is one of the games that helped define the first person shooter genre that Wolfenstein 3D and Doom already made popular. The game is a classic. The graphics were amazing back then but obviously would age badly over time. The iconic soundtrack by Rare composer Grant Kirkhope is perfect. It matched the feel of being James Bond. Every stage theme sounded so exquisite. The story is extremely faithful to the film minus a few alterations to the plot. The gameplay was so addictive and fun. It made you want to replay it over and over. You were given more tasks on higher difficulties which made the game more fresh. The controls took a good bit of time to get used to but they are not as bad as avid gamers claim they are. Of course the famous multiplayer added by Steve Ellis himself before the game was released. It is one of THE best multiplayer games in video game history. Various modes, unlockable cheats, classic unlockable weapons and villains from the Bond lore in story mode made multiplayer a staple in the gaming community. The only things I hate in the game that could have easily been fixed was the poor frame rate, the stupid ai, unbalanced difficulty and terrible aiming system. A must buy for any gamer and Bond fan. A classic indeed. .. Back in 1997/98, GoldenEye 007 for the N64 was the most influential FPS title for consoles. To be fair, it still remains one of the most influential in the genre, period. For its time, GoldenEye 007 looked great and the AI was fantastic. Enemies react to wounds on specific body parts, they try to dodge gunfire, and even raise alarm to call for help. The game offered multiple experiences from an easy play through to hardcore time trials, to custom created experiences. This also expanded into the created-on-a-whim multiplayer mode, perhaps the largest selling point for the title. Four ports on the N64 console meant easy four player matches, along with plenty of controller throwing. The music is well composed, taking hints from the original 1995 film but also originating and expanding. Realistically, they had to be creative. The game has more environments for Bond to explore than what the film had shown, including two flashbacks to the past with references to Moonraker, Live and Let Die, and The Man with the Golden Gun. Are you ready to take on Jaws and Baron Samedi? Can you even take them down? Ah, this game may be old but still, no spoilers! With a fantastic first player experience and an even better multiplayer mode, GoldenEye 007 is a classic game that cannot be passed up. During its time, people played this game religiously and it took years for it to lose any steam despite new game and consoles coming and even going. If you're able to, pick this one up and give it a shot—or maybe slappers only.. If you liked it when it came out, you will still like it today. It's still fun. One of my favorite features has always been that the different difficulties give you different mission objections (in most levels). I see a lot of reviews mention the terrible controls: while they are not great, they do not make the game unplayable. Anyone younger than a certain age or who started gaming after a certain year will think they are terrible because they are not dual-joystick. Yes, we all know that the dual-joystick configuration changed the FPS genre for the better. Unfortunately, it didn't exist until a certain point. Also, anyone mentioning mouse-and-keyboard can shut up since comparing a console-only game to PC gaming is a waste of time. The controls are fine if you are a true gamer. It would be one thing if the game's control scheme was messed up, but you can't say a game is bad because the controller that was made for a console isn't great. That isn't the fault of the game. In any case, I played through this game this week, on my N64, on 00 Agent, and beat it all the way through. So, the controls definitely don't make it unplayable. The music is good and most of the levels are fun. It's definitely worth replaying if you liked it before, but I would also say it's worth giving it a try if you have never played it before (unless you are one of these idiots that can't play old(er) games because of some whiny complaint like graphics or something).. Nothing was more amazing than Goldeneye multiplayer back in the day. Now you should play Goldeneye Source if you get the chance, but if you can get used to the control scheme, this game still holds up, especially in terms of the campaign, which is plenty difficult.. This game is a nice shooter. I think he is so contemporaneous, make me come back to my childhood. I really want a truly remake of it, whit new mechanics. I strong recomend.. The best FPS of that generation, The music, gameplay, multiplayer, arms, challenge, It was very amazing, I remember too many hours of my life invested in this game. This is the game that set the standard for 3D FPS and still amazingly playable to this day. Everyone that had an N64 owned this game and with good reason. One of the greats.. Let's all take of the nostalgia goggles for a minute here and give this game a fair analysis. I'm willing to say that there's a lot about this game that is really good. Almost everything, to be exact. Almost. So why is this game bad? One reason. The controls. The controls are so god awful, that they make the game pretty much unplayable. The N64 controller was not meant to play shooters. If you want to play this game in all it's glory, download the keyboard and mouse patch for it. Then you'll probably be able to play it the way all the nostalgia-blind people remember it.. 007 is a great game and started a great series. This is the best and this one is fun to play with and you get mad like great games are like mario party and mario kart.. Hands down, the best James Bond game you can ever get. Based on the GoldenEye movie, it's only safe to say the video game is a lot better than the movie although the movie is still great to watch.. One of the best games of all time, Goldeneye brought the FPS to home consoles. It's mechanics of stealth and careful aiming are amazing. It's multiplayer is fun and frantic. However, it is not perfect. If you haven't seen the movie, the story can be a bit confusing. You can't move while aiming and you aren't the most mobile. Compared to modern FPSs it has several flaws. However modern FPSs have a lot more capabilities, so the comparisons aren't fair. The flaws are small, and there are several ""It would be nice if""s but nothing obvious or annoying. Inside it has many unlockable and wacky cheats. While most of them are rather boring weapon cheats, there are few interesting ones that make the game have another layer. It would be nice if they're were more, but it is nice touch that most FPS's don't have. There isn't a lot to say that hasn't been said, but not getting this game would be a big mistake. Nearly 20 years after came out, I am still playing it. Whilst I was not there to play it at a young age, it is a game I fully appreciated and enjoyed even years after it's release. Whilst the campaign is intriguing and challenging, it is the split screen multiplayer that won it for me.. groundbreaking game so addicting played this **** when it came out in 1997 weapon variety, action, story, all so good my favorite weapon : The Golden Gun one shot one kill too much fun. Perfect Dark is my favourite FPS game, but Golden Eye is without doubt on my top 3 FPS-list. Memorable and classic graphics, awesome music, nice weapons with great sounds!. 9/10 (It doesn't hold up nowadays) .................................................................................................................... I grew up on this game and I still listen to the music today. Holy crap. This game, first off, follows the movie but also creates its own side story that goes well with the movie. It has great weapons, great level design, great gameplay, and great mechanics. I can't see a single flaw with this game.. Without benefit of nostalgia goggles, a perfectly mediocre game. The AI is as crude as, say, Doom's, but much less responsive. Never seen characters flatly ignore so much carnage around them. Plus, the AI lacks any features that lead to interesting mechanics (c.f. Doom's monster infighting). They run up & shoot & no more. While it gets the job done, it's bizarre to see the AI praised. GoldenEye did nothing to advance the art. Shooting is surprisingly satisfying for a game with no gore, thanks to varied, hilariously flamboyant hit reaction & death animations, yet the extraordinarily rapid infinite respawning of enemies quickly **** all the joy out of dispatching them. Run-n-gun is quite fun here except that it's trivial, and the only real threats are (spawning forever) behind you. You need eyes on the back of your head. Stealth elements feel tacked-on, and just bog down the game. The counter-intuitive marriage of arcadey shooting (GoldenEye's light-gun game roots show) with stealth may be possible, but Rare botched it. Level design has a couple high points but through most of the game it's either too linear or pointlessly expansive, in the latter case mostly via extremely repetitious, boring, & constricted 90-degree-angle interiors. It's so easy to get lost, because everything looks identical. The few moments where there's real room for flexibility are welcome. GoldenEye kicked off the unfortunate trend of ""realistic"" level design and is one of the worst examples of its use. Objectives are mostly unobtrusive thematic fluff, but some of them are vague (copy the key?) or frustrating (the ole' escort-the-dumb-bullet-sponge objective again & again). Doesn't help that there's zero saving within missions, automatic or manual. Oh, and unmarked exits that abort your mission and force a restart, they're fun too. A constant bugbear is a low and wildly inconsistent framerate, where the drops often have nothing to do with the on-screen action. Even in 1997 this was no technical masterpiece. Aesthetically it's a mixed bag. Some environments play to the strengths of the hardware, while others are just awful. Throughout, the artistry behind textures is mediocre. Many fondly recall GoldenEye for its multiplayer. Can't comment on that. For certain, the single-player is far from timeless, versus its contemporaries & ancestors. GoldenEye's innovation and influence can't be denied, but glowing praise of its quality per se is even more dubious today. A console FPS, what'll they think of next! FWIW I first played GoldenEye around 2003, having been an FPS fan since the early 90s. I came in with enthusiasm & high expectations due to so much lavish praise, and left disillusioned. It's an instructive example of naivete about other peoples' opinions. There were legitimate reasons why people loved GoldenEye. Quality is bottom of the list.. I bought this game because of the poster. Those are all my arguments. Enjoy the game,.... AND the poster. I miss the N64. And the good gaming critics..... It's 10pm on a Saturday when I walk into the party. It's a group of old friends and I'm the new guy that no one knows. A couple guys and girls are huddled around the TV playing a familiar game. Goldeneye 64. I pick ",i have tried to boot this game up on both my N64 and Switch but on both consoles I lack any motivation to play it . there is no progression tracker in the game as far as i am concerned which always makes me feel like i'm wasting my time . i also really dislike how it controls but i understand that is due to the hardware it's on .
180.Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. better than brawl worse than ultimate if you gonna spend the money buy the wii u version and just have fun its a must have for the wii u but thats kind of the problem its a must have for a overwhelmingly bad system its not bad the hardware is holding it back from being great. THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WII U VERSION Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U is when the Smash series finally found its footing, and learned how to maximize all its greatest features to become the quintessential Smash Bros... at least that's what should've happened. What actually happened was a release on a system nobody really owned, a confusing split naming convention, axed characters due to the reason for said split naming convention, and gameplay that just does not hold up to this day. While its release on Wii U was a major weakness, the game honestly probably got people to buy a Wii U, and having this be the first HD Smash Bros. honestly makes the game look REALLY good. This was the first time reveal trailers were used for the game as we know it, which was significant because the Sakurai really understood how big of a deal this kind of stuff was, not just for Smash Bros. fans, but for gaming culture as a whole. Where I believe the game irrecoverably suffers is when you finally dive into the gameplay. It has some of the weakest and slowest base gameplay, with the only exception really being Brawl, which has its own strengths to make up for it. A lot of the timing of knockbacks and the animations honestly don't feel as good, and the entire game lacks flow and tact, making it a chore to play competitively (not that I play competitively, but it's important). The extra modes, which was what made Brawl's weak gameplay forgivable, are some of the worst in the game, with Smash Tour genuinely being some of the most boring content the game has to date. Not to mention, the character roster being held back by the limitations of the 3DS version, which meant that the game wouldn't be able to reach its full potential not even because of the limitations of the Wii U itself. While it still has some cool content in it, like the last time we'll ever see trophies or customizable movesets, which were really cool ideas, the game just ends up being the most confusing one of the series.. I know a lot of people like Ultimate but imo this is loads better. It holds lots of nostalgia for me, so that’s probably why this is my favourite Smash game. What an odd release. It looks stunning as the first smash game in HD, the roster is phenomenal, and the smash formula elevates any game to a high score. So why only a 7? For starters, the single player is asinine. You're better off playing against a level 1 CPU than playing Smash Tour. The online matchmaking is also terrible. Elite Smash is not a perfect system, but it is infinitely better than For Glory. But all of that pales compared to the sheer brokenness of some of the characters in this one. Up-airs can kill you at 30 with rage. Bayonetta can 0 to death you with no real effort. Mario deals 60 percent to you off one grab. Cloud Strife is in this game. With a more balanced approach, this could have matched up to Melee and Ultimate, but as is, this is Brawl 2 in HD with no Subspace.. Best smash game ever, it really makes a lot of game modes you can play from, the gameplay is perfect and simply is a bit hard to get bored of it, it has some problems like bayonetta being too OP, but everything else is amazing. It was the first Smash I ever played and I loved it. The only negative point is the number of terrains on 3DS. Otherwise the game is perfect even if not as fast as Melee or the next game, Ultimate. None of the characters were really broken ( except Bayonetta ) and none of them really **** ( except in esport of course but for non-competitive players that's not the most important thing ).. okay game but all others top it. i did grow up with Wii U though, so... yeah.. It's fine, but compared to the other Smash games, this just doesn't have much substance. Brawl has subspace, Ultimate has spirits and all the characters, Melee has the competitive edge, and 64 is the first game so it gets free points blah blah blah. Smash 4 just... doesn't stand out. The moment that Smash Ultimate came out, everyone immediately dropped this game, and for good reason. After all, it is still a Smash game, so it's obviously fun, but it's not as good as the others in the series.. Personally this is probably the worst in the smash bros series, but that doesn’t mean it that's bad. The roster isgood but the meta was just horrible which ruined many peoples experiences. Soy fat people bought their **** wii U for this one Soy **** game that controls like trying to wipe your cats anus. Not as good as brawl and ultimate but still both versions are really good games and deserve the love and praise they get. If players enjoyed the previous incarnations of Super Smash Brothers, they should love these. With all of the updates and new features, it is hard to find a reason not to smash!. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. It has notable flaws in the single player game modes, and the menu is the most disorganized. Even so, I improve its Gameplay, although due to the questionable decision of the new characters they make it somewhat weak compared to the others. Even with its flaws, it is a highly recommended game for new players, and it is one that is at least worth the opportunity.. This was my most played smash game and it took my friend and I super long to discover all the different powers for all the fighters, 8 player smash was monumental and we were able to make our own battles come alive within it. Truly an awesome addition.. This game is great at pretty much everything except the core gameplay which is overly floaty, unbalanced, and uninteresting. Although it wasn't even able to provide an interesting story mode akin to Subspace Emissary. Having marginally better combat than Brawl doesn't matter if you're single player content is worse.. Incredibly fun, and super nostalgic for me! This game introduced many staples of the Smash series, such as character CGI trailers, DLC, and, of course, so many third-party reps! Its a shame this game's currently dead.. I love the selection of characters, and amiibo compatibility. However, matches are extremely uneven online. Need a better ranking system and the online lag doesn't help it.. I play Super Smash Bros for WII U: Drake meme no I smash U, bro: Drake meme yes. I hate how the game has such a long name of Super Smash Bros for the Wii U as it ain’t catchy we know Brawl, and Melee, but that is too much. There is no story except off Classic and Smash Tour, which isn’t Like Brawl’s or Ultimate’s World of Light. I do like the addition of fighters of Roy, Bayonetta, Corrin, Megaman, and some Fire Emblem characters. The HD graphics make the game very smooth and better than the 3DS.. Super Smash Bros Wii-U is truly the only reason to own a Wii-U now that Mario Kart 8 has been ported to the Switch. It is great and has many different controller options, but its soundtrack while great, isn’t up to Melee and Brawl standards, lacks an adventure mode, and the addition of DLC means that once the severs go down, you cannot access all of the game anymore if you are starting from a brand new physical copy. Because of the DLC factor, I can only give this game a 9 at best. (Only games that are complete without DLC, microtransactions, and paywalls can get a perfect 10 from me.). Super Smash Bros. For Wii U is definitely a hype game. Adding amazing new characters and dazzling visuals, this game will get you amped up every time you play it, from start to finish.. Sorry, but this one just doesn't feel right. It feels outdated, yet the balance between hardcore and casual is spot on.. The greatest Super Smash Bros. game at the time of release. The roster is impressive to this day, even with Ultimate out.. The worst best Smash on the Wii U. It is a truly epic game with more content than ever. It's very similar to ultimate, but obviously has trophies instead of spirits and some fighters missing, but it is still a great game regardless of if you've played ultimate or not. A really enjoyable game, that's sadly already being forgotten about because of Ultimate. That's because the gameplay was already so good in this one. It's just been tweaked to be better in that game. People should give this game more credit. It's just so fun, man.. Some of the extra content may be a turn off for some fans, but great visuals, an expanded soundtrack, and overall fun make Super Smash Bros. for Wii U a winner in its own right.. i love the game but it has so many bugs on it,and not talking about the characters details,but without that,its a really good game tho,ive been waiting this till meele was relased,8 out of 10. Gaming is about having fun. That is what Super Smash Bros. for Wii U delivers, unlike a lot of other major game releases this year, which have been major disappointments this year. Smash Wii U is a breath of fresh air, and there is so much to do. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is the true casual Smash Bros. experience, taking aspects from Brawl that were already casual and taking them to the max. However, competitive and hardcore players may want to skip this one. No single-player campaign and slow gameplay make Smash for Wii U a nightmare fo non-casual players.. This game is amazing, and the third party round up is great, and the DLC was really exciting when they started revealing them, however, Bayonetta is way too OP, and there isn't much to do aside from playing smash mode. It really could've done with a story mode.. it's super smash bros, of course it's great. and it's the best game on the wii u.. As I didn't played any other Smash Bros beyond this one, there's no way I can make deep short comments. It's simply a game that works perfectly, one of the best fighting games I played. There are several characters with their own moves, skills, a lot of game modes and a great online multiplayer. It's surely a ""must-have"" for the Wii U. The only complaint is that I've missed some kind of campaign. And some battle arenas are annoying as hell.. In my opinion, the worst in the series with a slower combat style than the rest. The last paid characters they added completely derailed the game (bayonetta and company). Still a good smash bros.. Soo... This game is for you competitive and casual gamers. Though why not buy Ultimate now since it is Smash 4 but better... Anyways, it is an amazing game but the lack of players in For glory kind of kills me. It's fun and all but B a y o n e t t a. Would rate 10 but (cough) bayo. [x] Perfect [ ] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. Super Smash Bros For The Wii U is one of the best fighting games, with its unique style of gameplay and amazing cast of characters and game modes. The game has over 40+ characters and they all unique and are from different franchises like Mario Zelda donkey Kong and even sonic and pac man. The game also has an amazing selection of game modes to enjoy, they are all unique to each other. You have a stage maker, a small unique adventure mode where you battle to reach the final boss, amazing event like match’s, and much much more! The amount of music and stages you can play on is a great show of video games biggest franchises. Super Smash Bros For Wii U is a celebration of video games and Nintendo’s history, amazing visuals gameplay awesome characters and stages and so much more it’s just outstanding. (A Masterpiece 5/5) You Must Play It. A great game just like it’s always been but with much less single player content than brawl but still not as good as Alvin and the chipmunks for wii. I don't really like this game a whole lot. It's a good game, but the issue is it does the same things Brawl and Melee do, but worse. There are removed fighters, no story mode and a lack of other features that just makes the game less enjoyable than the others in the series. Definately Smash Bro' weakest entry. Just play Brawl or Ultimate.. The best game in the series. It looks great and it is so accessible. It is easy to learn but difficult to master. The game looks great, there are so many characters, and it is so easy to play with a big group of people. It plays up to 8 people and you can use a 3DS, a wii remote, a pro controller, or the gamepad. The only downside is the DLC maps and characters. It can be expensive if you are a collector, but I haven't felt like I am missing out on much by not having it. Absolutely Amazing Smash For Wii U is most definitely Nintendo at it’s best.. This is probably the WORST Smash Bros game that I had ever played in my entire life! First of all, where in the **** is the campaign that’s what made the last game great?! Smash Tour what ever the hell its called, What a joke it’s literally just a Mario Party Clone a really bad one. I know the 3DS version has a Smash run which is pretty good I have to say. The roster of fighters is a damn joke where’s Snake, Wolf, I understand why they couldn’t put the ice climbers in the game due to the 3DS limitations. Instead they put a lot of Fire Emblem characters in the game for **** sake we already have so many why not king. K rool Overall stay away from this one. This is by far the worst video game I have ever played. I don't care if NintendoBlackCrisis forces me to like super smash bros. or bully people over having a different opinion on the series than the smash fandom. This game has the worst replay value of the entire series, along with possibly the worst item spawning I have ever seen in literally any video game. There was one time where I was playing on Classic on 9.0 and I was trying to attack my opponent while playing as Yoshi on Round 1 until suddenly I attacked midair while a bob-omb spawned on my foot and I got KO'd. Another example of terrible item spawning is one time in another battle, I was charging up my burning drop kick playing as one of my custom mii characters, and while I was charging it up a blast box spawned in front of me and once I finished charging up, I shot against it and got KO'd. The old modes in both versions aren't as fun either anymore. The stage creator has been downgraded in this game, and it has also heavily decreased the number of objects I can place on a custom stage. The new stage creator for the wii U version looks unfinished and rushed comparing to Brawl's stage creator. There is also no new adventure mode either, which was removed due to a pointless reason. The entire hunk of garbage is also way too gimmicky for a smash game. To me, Classic Mode is easily the worst part about the game because believe it or not, you have to spend gold to play classic mode. Another fun fact: if you quit classic mode and lose all of your progress recently made, your gold and customization parts get wasted. That's right, there is no property refunding in this so-called ''masterpiece''. You are forced to stick to your current gold amount and your current custom parts. In fact, when you have earned custom parts but then lose a match on 9.0, some of your custom parts get taken away. Even when it is rare, Sakurai doesn't care and counts everything that is unfair. I even completed Classic on 9.0 without losing a single life and you know what I got? NOTHING. No achievement completions, no prizes, nothing. So not only is one of the challenges in this game all a damn joke, but there are also more problems in this game than classic mode, which was just like wasting possibly 2 hours of my life trying to reach the most pointless achievement in this game. The rewards for the achievements you complete in this game are not enough. For example, I wasted like 20,000 gold trying to complete the achievement ''Complete Classic Mode on 9.0 without losing a single life'' and what do I get when I actually cleared that achievement? A useless protection badge that is barely any use for battle. The trophies and special moves in this game are also a waste of space on Classic Mode. Every time you clear something on Classic and you are hoping to get something good, sometimes, you get something you already have that is also a troll feature in the game that was never removed or fixed. The shield feature in this game is also useless as all hell because sometimes attacks pierce through your shield, so you have to hope that your shield doesn't tell you to buzz off and force damage on you or get you in a situation where you go **** me, that doesn't even make any sense. And also, why can't I play more than 4 players on Special Smash? The game doesn't even explain. Besides, comparing to ultimate, there would be no lag at all in an 8 player special smash, yet ultimate decided to limit the number of players on special smash too for aparently no reason whatsoever. By the way, it also recycles the code from the item spawning in Smash 4, meaning that all terrible item spawning is still present. The reason why I am not reviewing ultimate is because I don't want the SSB fandom to attack me and force me to like all of smash 4's terrible features. To be fair, however, Smash run and smash tour weren't as bad. But what does require explanation is why on earth can the wii U users play on 8 player but the 3ds users can't? To me, that is very hypocritical considering that Sakurai removed the ice climbers from Smash 4 due to it being unfair for the 3ds owners. I'd imagine that would have had no lag. And finally, some of the older stages that was once present in the smash bros. franchise have not been featured in Smash 4 due to no reasoning at all. If the developers of this game are seriously that bad at making games and they consider THIS to be their best work, then I'm worried about their other creations. Overall, this is a very unfortunate attempt to revive the smash franchise and continue to have its great recognition as Brawl v2 would have been a better title. I highly apologize if this review was not very good, but to me, this is possibly the worst game of the series. And it is also the 2nd most pointless video game that I have ever played in recorded video game history. 0/10. I do not recommend this rushed mess to long-time smash fans, especially when they are still hyped for future SG. In many ways this game was the true successor to Melee, providing a very large cast of characters in a very well done and intense fighting action. Unlike it's 3DS counterpart, the Wii U version offered so many modes and features you can easily keep yourself entertained for hours. Plus with the revolutionary 8 Player Smash, Smash for Wii U becomes an instant party favorite and leave no one out of the fun. This game was definitely what the Wii U needed, and it most definitely delivered.. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is easily one of the best games for the system, and arguably the most compelling reason to own the troubled console. This is the best Smash game to date, with an expansive roster and a seemingly endless list of options, modes, and just fun things to do. Of course, since this is a Nintendo game, online multiplayer is somewhat lacking, but Super Smash Bros. is always best enjoyed offline, with friends. There's no use of GamePad features at all, which is actually a good thing, since a GameCube controller or Wii U Pro Controller are the best ways to play.. bad street fighter parody . i cant call it even a fight , its only a pushing game to me. I had an awesome experience in my local smash scene playing this game. It was so much fun learning and improving with this game! The only downsides were bayo was insanely broken and no one used the smash tour mode, because it was a mess ****.. Not bad, it just lacks the personality and meaningful single-player content of Melee and Brawl. Before, everything felt very detailed and had a lot of love put into it, but now everything feels like padding. Plus, the gameplay(for me) feels way too floaty and slow and kills are unsatisfying(why do they fly in the air for 10 minutes before hitting the blast zone?!). Seriously, just go play Ultimate instead. It basically fixed ALL of this bland game's problems.. A noticeable upgrade from Brawl with gorgeous visuals, a ton of new characters and plenty of new stages and modes to keep the game fresh.. This game is good. One of the only things that bothers me is that there is no unique title for it. Wii U? 3DS? This seems lazy. We had Melee, Brawl, Ultimate, now Wii U? This makes the game feel weird and not like a Smash Bros game.. Fun most the time, except that the online is literally less playable than brwal.... how ssb was meant to be. at this rate get ssb 5, but this is great. this, ssb 5 and melee will be the kings of the series. melee for fiercely competitive, ssb u for mostly competitive and smash 5 because it is going to be epic. while no story mode is disappointing, everything else is a step up from brawl. only complaint- Saukrai seems to forget real players hate items (*cough* Smash Tour *cough*). It's Smash Bros, load of modes, characters and fun. Only thing missing is Story Mode. DLC are abusive, expensive and too many.. This game is surprisingly disappointing I loved playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl and I couldn't wait to play Super Smash Bros. 4, Lots of people anticipated the game when it was announced at E3 2011, By making fan rosters as predictions to what the game might look like. But when it came out, OH boy were there problems, First off, Adventure Mode has been removed completely, So that means there's not as much stuff to do besides playing the Smash mode. Also, the game only has 8 unlockable characters while it's predecessor has 16. Brawl feels more like a challenge than 4. Another complaint, Sonic's new voice is way too deep and Fox's new voice is way too nasal compared to their Brawl iterations. And unfornately, Wolf , Ice Climbers and Snake still have not returned from Brawl yet. Also one of my Smash 4 picks Shadow the Hedgehog got into the games as an assist trophy. Some of my favorite stages like Mushroomy Kingdom and Green Hill Zone return in the 3DS version. Also, the textures even though there are HD, the cartoonish art style makes them look worse than Brawl. Brawl's textures made the Wii look better and more competitive than it actually is. Overall, I just feel like this sequel is lacking a lot that Brawl had and it definitely does not convince me to buy a Wii U. Other than that, a least the sound track's good.. I enjoy the smash hell, thanks for this beautiful mastahpiece Nin10doh. Must play again.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The next installment of the Super Smash Bros series is a solid addition. While there are no revolutionary breakthroughs, it still adds upon what was there in previous games and makes it worth the buy. The new additions to the series are fun to play and have a unique style. Characters like Mega Man and Shulk bring new playstyles the series has never really seen, so the roster is sure to have a character or several to suit every player. A few characters like Dark Pit and Lucina are the familiar clone archetype, matching other characters almost exactly, but this is nothing new for the series and doesn't detract from the much more numerous novel additions. Smash 4 also adds custom moves and items. The items allow players to customize their characters by increasing their attack power, defense, or speed as well as adding additional abilities. An increase in one stat necessarily means a decrease in another, however, preventing the customization ability from getting too far unbalanced. Custom moves also give players the option to change special moves to something more suiting their playstyle. While these features can add some fun variability, Smash 4 does not allow their use online with strangers, somewhat limiting their fun. If you don't have friends who also own the game or frequently play with you, you'll only get to use your custom character against computer characters. The stage selection has a mix of the old and the new. Old favorites like Hyrule Temple and Kongo Jungle 64 make return appearances alongside a slew of brand new places. The new stages are, on average, much more... interactive than previous games' stages. There are stages that just let you be and provide footing on which to fight, but most of them want in on the action. The degree to which this is a good thing varies with the stages. Some stages, like Woolly World and Pilotwings merely switch up the ground you're standing on and can improve the gameplay by varying the terrain, but others like Mushroom Kingdom U and Orbital Gate Assault include stage hazards that are capable of KOing your character in one go. These and stage bosses can prove to be a bit much for the somewhat serious player. To offset such dynamic stages, however, is the stage builder. It has its own unique limitations, making it different but not better than Brawl's stage builder. Careful crafters can end up making gorgeous stages that are loads of fun to play on, and the lack of ability to add stage hazards guarantees it'll be relatively peaceful. The standard Smash mode adds 8-player smash, which is a useful addition if you have more than three friends over and don't want to take turns. Online provides both For Fun and For Glory modes of play, the former being a more casual take and the latter being more competitive. While it's fun to play with strangers, both these modes have their shortcomings. For Fun is limited to 4-player, all items on, 2 minute timed mode which isn't always to the taste of the players. For Glory forces the player into two stock, no items matches that can be played with four players or one on one. The unfortunate thing about For Glory is that it also forces players to fight on variations of Final Destination, a completely flat and featureless stage. For the most part, though, the excitement of fighting actual, thinking people outweighs the limitations of online play. The last real multiplayer mode is Smash Tour. This mode is very hit or miss. At its most basic, it is a board game where one collects fighters and powers them up for a duel at the end. While this may sound simple, the game throws a multitude of additional effects and rules in the game that can make it far too complicated and busy for many. For others, all the extras provide some variation to an otherwise rather simple game. It does expect you to teach a lot of the rules and strategy to yourself, however, which scares away many players. While two players can play the remaining modes, they were built with one player in mind. Target Blast replaces the target test from previous games, and while it can be enjoyable, it gets stale fast and pales in comparison to the target test, especially Melee's. On the other hand, Event Mode returns and is the most fun it's ever been. The selection is more dynamic and the challenges more difficult. The lack of a true Adventure Mode hurts the game's single player aspect, especially coming off Brawl's much loved Subspace Emissary. And while the game's large roster only helps multiplayer, it can make All Star mode drag on a bit long. Classic Mode is similarly tedious, although they're both fun in small amounts. All in all, Smash 4 took some steps back and many steps forward. Its single player isn't as enjoyable as previous titles, but its multiplayer is better than ever. Its ""worst"" aspects are only relative, and everything in the game is still quality and enjoyable. You may not be blown out of the water, but you'll still have a great time.. If you want a fighting game for your Wii U, definitely pick this one because it has the biggest selection of fighters, the game is the most balanced Smash game, the visuals are crisp, and the fighting mechanics are the best. It also has a buttload of content to keep you coming back.. An absolute masterpiece. A must-have if you like fighting games and/or Nintendo and own a Wii U. It may lack a story mode like Super Smash Bros. Brawl has, but I don't really see that as an issue when there are more than 50 playable characters, a great selection of stages and music, and numerous fun modes. As was the case with the series before, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is essentially a playable museum of Nintendo history. Personally, I miss the ""Break the Targets"" / ""Target Smash"" stages, but Target Blast is still pretty fun. Even excluding the DLC, this game is bursting with content, and it rarely (if ever) felt unfair when I lost a match. Be warned ****'s highly addictive!. That's how perfect fighting games should be made! Convenient controls. Simple inputs for special attacks and super-smashes (local name for ""fatalities""). Rich character list, most in which have quite unique play style. Unusual area-based gameplay (kick opponents off-screen to win). Pretty neat visuals, without any excessiveness (and with quite a number of dramatic moments). Have not tried competitive, however, for casual player it's a joy to play.. This game is spectacular. The huge amount of characters added to the game, and even better stage creation! But I'm getting ahead of myself here. Let's talk about the different aspects of the game. A: Music/Sounds Could not be better. I am simply astounded by the amount of music that has been put into the game. You know that Legend of Zelda music that you love so much? That's in it. You know that Super Mario Brothers theme? That's in it. Pretty much all soundtracks (Even some have been remixed) in the history of Nintendo have been added to the game. The voices of all of the characters are great, and the sounds are fluid and top-quality. The music, is perfect. 10/10 B: Graphics Beautiful. The graphics could not get much better than this. I mean, it doesn't look realistic - but it isn't supposed to be! You don't need graphics to make a game like this amazing, but man - they pulled the graphics off really well. The individual scales on Bowser are visible, the threads on Mario's hat - and the stages look better than they have ever been before. Unfortunately, the graphics aren't the best in the world - the characters are fine, but some of the stages look a little outdated. 9/10 C: Gameplay Beautiful. An amazing mix of Brawl and Melee. Not too floaty, not too fast. Controlling the characters are very easy, and some characters do require special techniques to work best. For example, Marth does maximum damage when you hit another character with the tip of his sword, whilst Roy does maximum damage when you hit them closer to the hilt of the blade. No matter how much you play the game, you can still get better. You can still learn. And thanks to the great Amiibo support, you can even have someone learn with you! I haven't even mentioned the monstrous amount of stages and Characters. It will probably take you over a day to try them all out properly! They really excelled at this. I can't see how they could have improved it at all. 10/10 D: Online Unfortunately, they didn't do all that well with this. But of course, I have never really been much of an online gamer - so I barely touched this. There's lag during the online matches (generally because of the other person's bad connection) and the tourneys are really strange as well. You can't play as Miis or use your custom stages, but I can understand why you can't do that. But I would have really enjoyed playing as my Mii. I'm not going to get into the DLC, but let me tell you that it is amazing what they have added. 5/10 Overall, Super Smash Brothers. for Wii U is an amazing game that can still be enjoyed for generations to come. I can","the wii u version of super smash bros. was released on a system nobody really owned . the game's release on the wii u was a major weakness, but it got people to buy a wii u . it has some of the weakest and slowest base gameplay, with the exception of Brawl ."
181.Guitar Hero II,"A pretty big step up from the previous title, with a banger of a setlist and enjoyable venues. Between what felt like my fingers falling off during ""Freya"" to spending too many hours trying to master Jordan I love this damn game. A near-perfect game. Accessible to just about anyone, easy to learn and hard to master. The songs are terrific. The adrenaline rush of nailing a previously difficult string of chords is unique in all of gaming.. I have read many positive reviews and decided to try it. I was waiting for smth. wonderful and amazing. But it doesn't give me this unfortunately. Maybe it's not an appropriate time for me for this. I'll try next month and hope that all my expectations will be alive!. Great sequel to Guitar Hero I, supplies more of the original with better controls.. this was my favourite game to play with friends in the spare time of school, we used to skip class rofl. The start of guitar hero really being a new hobby more than a video game. Basically improved on 1 in every way without taking anything out or messing with the formula too much.. this game is much more beautiful and superior than guitar hero 3, my favorite!. Quite the improvement over it's previous entry; as well as packed with a much better selection of songs that would satisfy the most metal-hungry person. The campaign mode was fairly improved as well, featuring a better sense of progression, plenty of satisfying encore songs, and a proper, over-the-top finale featuring Free Bird, one of the greatest songs ever made. I wish, however, that the campaign shop had been improved with more useful items, and not so much cosmetics, as they don't really appeal to me. You can still buy extra songs, that are, overall, less popular than the main ones, and two behind-the-scenes videos, which is cool. Guitar Hero II is a step forward, but could've brought a little bit more changes to the table. It was released only an year after the first installment, though, so there's a very short period in-between them. Nevertheless, I appreciate this game, and it is a GOOD experience.. Guitar Hero II has the best songlist, a lot of songs that I really like listening to, the chart notes are also very fitting with the songs, really managed to make me feel like playing a real guitar, the concert atmosphere and characters are very good, many choices of unique guitars, I love playing with my old school friends, beautiful days. a HUGE improvement on the guitar hero formula. this game takes what the original does right and does it better, along with many improvements with the engine to make it less unfair to play. The best Guitar Hero game of the series. One of the best soundtracks of all time in games, the best one in the franchise. It has been introduced the newest generation to the good music, specifically Rock. One of funniest games of all time, principally risking on a guitar controller. Quite funny and nostalgic. Tasteful playing this game until nowadays.. Ahh, so many good memories i made with this game. I loved those animations, the setlist and the career mode. This was a revolutionary game (and Guitar Hero 1 of course), and i am still addicted to the Guitar Hero franchise, especially this game. One thing i don't like about this game, and that is the HOPO-system. You must be Very accurate to hit every note, but you will learn that one day. This is a game i never will forget.. An awesome sequel to the first Guitar Hero game. The setlist is really good and filled with songs which most of them covers which some are not really good like the Laid to Rest and the Killing in the Name covers, in my opinion they should've just gotten the masters and censored them instead of covering it. The graphics are good but really didn't change from the first game and the difficulty is just right for Hard and Expert so if you want a challenge try those two difficulties, for a 8 year old game it does feel outdated but still a lot of fun to play.. I love everything about this game, except the hammer-on and pull-off system. I am pretty sure that i suddenly miss a note for no reason. I hit the notes at the right timing, but still losing my multiplier and destroys my accuracy stats! It's almost impossible to hit every note on this game when you are strumming very fast, because the game wont register everytime you strum. Overall, this is one of my favourite Guitar Hero games ever made. It makes so many good memories.. This game is amazingly addictive. My ps3 fried and i got a ps2 and played this game. This game is almost ps3 worthy...i hope they remake it in ps4. the notes are a little off and the song selection (being almost all of them are covers) is a little off...then again my music liking may be a little different then Red Octane. The graphics are 8/10 for a **** cartoon artwork was a very good move they didn't really keep in GH 3 :(. Guitar Hero II is bounds better than Guitar Hero. Though the addition of encores is a superfluous addition that only wastes time in the long run, a larger set list, an improved practice mode, two-player simultaneous modes, a vastly improved hammer on system, and superior charting leave little to argue against the upgrade for fans of the original excepting preference of songs. Today, this game is outmoded by other rhythm games except for the guitarist who wishes to test his mettle against Jordan.. GH 1 proved that the Music genre had a niche and that it could expand in the horizon of games. GH2 was even better than the predecessor and made what it made it good, into a juggernaut in the last couple years. The musics start getting nicer and more taste for more varied ways. Guitar Hero 2 is addicting and fun, but also the best in the GH big list.","guitar hero 2 is a pretty big step up from the previous title, with a banger of a setlist and enjoyable venues . the songs are terrific. the adrenaline rush of nailing a previously difficult string of chords is unique in all of gaming . the campaign mode was fairly improved as well, featuring a better sense of progression ."
182.Final Fantasy VII,"This was the only reason I bought PlayStation and it didn’t disappoint. Top three in the final fantasy series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What can you say.? It's the gateway drug and granddaddy to all RPG games ever made. Of course there were others beforehand, but FF7 was the game that hooked us all. It is the 'Nevermind' album for gamers. There's something very special about this game and it holds such dear memories for those who played it in release. As a now 50 year old I am glad I played **** I'll not play it again as i don't want to ruin my memories.. This review is for the launch version of the game on Playstation 1 in 1997. An extraordinary JRPG with many plot twists, interesting characters, and complex gameplay without beeing too difficult. Graphically ahead of it's time, especially in it's prerenderd cutscenes that transfer seamlessly over to gameplay. Just a few minor technical issues like translation mistakes and gameplay functions not working properly, are keeping it away from beeing a 10/10. Truly a legendary game for it's time.. Great storytelling and ahead of its time turn based rpg mechanics. We don't see innovation like this anymore in the current industry anymore. One of my favorite rpg of all time. Excellent gameplay,perfect music, story deep and clean, characters with very good back story's, ihave finished 3-4 times.. The GOAT. The best combination of story world characters music and gameplay, ever.. Some of the technological relics make this tough to revisit and the combat is not in the top-tier of other Final Fantasy offerings. Still, the story and characters are among the best in gaming history and the score is arguably Uematsu's career highlight.. Graphics? Revolutionary (for the time at least) Characters? Extremely nuanced, with each of the cast having very deep and intricate character arcs. Cloud is possibly one of the most complex characters I've seen in fiction. Story? Consistently stellar. I genuinely could not put this game down and was on the edge of my seat the whole playthrough? Plot Twists? Iconic and brilliantly masterminded. The two most famous ones were both jaw-dropping. Music? Critically acclaimed for a reason, and even in this day and age still very charming. Combat? The most incredible turn-based/ATB based combat system in gaming imo. The creativity of customisation in the materia system is utterly unparalleled. You can't beat it. I have no qualms with this game at all. Dare I say it's flawlessly perfect.. The most fun game in my life, a classic among classicsI played it more than 5 times. A better experience than the Remake, but the game is just too old, and the story is nothing to write home about.. Late to the party for this game but enjoyed it so much. This game carries a lot of charm and the music is timeless. When I see the gameplay, I see the late 90s, I see the devs are coming into terms with new technology that would define the future. And they did. While the turnbase combat is unique to me and took me hours to get used to, the narrative and characters in the game are what stands out the most to me. The deep and emotional dialogue of the characters surprises me. I also love the simple and cute polygon character models, I really like how they move and pose with an expressive level of emotion. Such an enjoyable and charming game.. Hands down the best game of all time. The story, themes and characters hold up even today. The Remake done an exceptional job of bringing all those amazing feelings of nostalgia back as well. There's not many games I've played over the years that leave you with a deep emotional connection to the characters but this still hits the spot 20+ years later. The sound track is flawless as well.. The game has a neat beginning, good music and nice backgrounds. That's about it. The story is contrived, convoluted and barely makes any sense. The game itself is comprised of mostly poorly designed minigames. It's like the developers did everything they could to not to make a proper Final Fantasy game. They did remember to include some totally ok battle gameplay though. How this game is so favored among the fans is mindboggling. I even find the hated FF8 a billion times more enjoyable, despite its own set of problems.. it is the best rpg game i have ever played, even 20 years later it’s still absolutely enjoyable. **** peak.. Final Fantasy VII is a timeless classic that got me into the RPG genre in the first place. The world is fun to explore and holds many secrets and fun challenges. The story is simple but amazing. The music is epic and emotional. The turn-based combat runs smoothly, and the Materia system is just amazing in my option. While the game sprites haven’t aged well over the almost 30 years since release, the rest of the game still looks pretty good. I recommend checking this game out on its rerelease on PlayStation 4 or Switch.. Best sci fi story ever made. The lovable cast of characters, the twists, the worldbuilding all comedown to an amazing conclusion. Even the gameplay is fun and strategic with great bosses and unique enemies. Its very saddening to me that this is still the definitive way to play FF7. If only SE hadnt gotten greedy with the remakes and made poor story changes that are purely there to justify 3 stand alone titles and the compilation. We will never have the remake this game truly deserves. One of the best games of all time. They nailed everything from the music to battle mechanics. Imagine being 7 years old and this being one of your first gaming experiences. Through the decades, this game still holds it's weight in much more than just childhood nostalgia. It is without a doubt my favorite experience of all time when it comes to video games. Bold & innovative for it's time. Cinematic, jarring, you will laugh and you will cry. The soundtrack is still one of the greatest to date; Nobuo Uematsu is a genius. I won't spoil you, I won't even urge you to play it. For many, the graphics and the turn based combat won't stick with this generation of novelty brains. For me, this is the best game ever made. Bar none. If you're interested in a video essay that profoundly outlines many of my same thoughts regarding this game, go watch ""Why Final Fantasy VII Matters"" on YouTube. It's worth the listen. Thank you Square for bringing us this masterpiece.. certainly the best game ever made in the history of video games for me final fantasy vii remains unbeatable to this day.. A game that was made in 1997 that I was able to play through entirely in 2024, for the first time? Basically impossible for me to do that most other games from that era. I can't believe this game wasn't a part of my childhood. :( It would have been number one in my book for a very very long time. Incredible story, with plot twist after plot twist in the final act. Awesome combat that kept me engaged even by today's standard. Incredible variety in enemies. Beautiful characters, although I'm not entirely sold on the hype with Sephiroth... This game offers so much to do, and whileI'm not necessarily compelled to indulge in all those activities, its still an amazing feat.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Where to Even begin. This game is about the Theme of Life. It has out of the whole series the BEST Battle system ever created Materia. Materia is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The battles are fast and fun and with Materia you can literally do almost anything from Kill the Super bosses later in the game in 2 or 3 Turns depending on how you set them up. The Graphics have Aged poorly But the Music is INCREDIBILE, but this was one of the first 3d games I recall ever playing. The story is also very interesting though the Translation is not the best. I give it a Perfect score because it is still relevant and influential to the industry to this day despite what all the haters say this is without a doubt the end all be all final fantasy.. The absolute goat of 90s RPGs and Square Enix's then magnum opus. This game shaped my adolescent years and the impact it had on others cannot be underestimated. Way ahead of its time with story, features, and overall vision.. I just played this game again! Still so much lore to explore, items and weapons you can get from exploring the map. It is a 1997 game but you have to say it is way ahead of its time. Yes, the graphics cannot compare to games nowadays, however, the stories and lore are excellent. The great combat system for turn-based games. If anyone gives it a scoreless than 8 that person doesn't play games at all for sure.. While not perfect now, it was for it's time. And unlike Remake it didn't ""need"" to provide fanservice and had the perfect amount of content to explore. Classic emotional JRPG, with one of the(if not the) best soundtracks of all time.. This game is very boring, all you do is walk around in dull environments and participate in easy fights.. One of the greatest games of all time. Theres a bit to much minigames, but it's understandable due to the time Square were back then. The music was astonishing, the characters enjoyable and the story a rollercoaster of emotions, a beautiful game, piece of Art.. Hands down, the greatest game of all time!. A beautiful work of art, memorable characters, Iconic music, it still hasn't aged to this day. Do yourself a favor and just play it and enjoy this masterpiece.. Not much to say other than, this is quite simply... The best game ever made.. What can i say. I played it as a kid, while isolated from the videogame community. I really thought i was one of the few people that played it and liked it. Also, from my perspective, this game was infinite lol I really thought it would take me years to finish and that probably nobody had ever finished it.. An absolute masterpiece with compelling characters, plot, and gameplay. One of my favorite games ever, and the reason why Cloud Strife is my favorite video game character of all time.. I'm so glad that I've finally experienced this legendary game, it's definitely the best old school Final Fantasy game I've played. The gameplay mechanics are outdated and slow, but the beautiful story makes the experience worthwhile. The characters are interesting and likable, some of them could have had more development but the main cast is great. The music is fantastic and very iconic, One-Winged Angel is awesome and gave me goosebumps. The only things I disliked about the game are the annoying minigames that affect the pacing, and the unnecessary filler in the middle of the game, but other than that there isn't anything else that bothered me that much. Even after all those years, this game managed to surprise me and even make me feel emotional, it's such a big game, and probably even a masterpiece for its time, I'm honestly impressed. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. The greatest game I never finished. No kidding. This game is a legend and masterpiece easily among the greatest games ever made to this day, with one the best soundtracks and stories of any game made as well. However, the game is an extremely brutal, hard, and long grind fest that can easily drain your enthusiasm for playing the game and as well reducing the immersion in the lore and story. If the grind is too much for you and still want to experience the lore and story, watch a walkthrough of the game without commentary like a movie. Whether you play it and/or watch a walkthrough without commentary like a movie, this game has a story and soundtrack you don't want to miss.. After 26 years, this game still catches up with its story and characters. Yes, the graphics are pretty old and you can see it was a game released on a PSX. But if you can go through it, it could be the best (or one of the best) game you ever played. The story is engaging and deep, there are many story arcs that combine with each other, and the mystery goes till the end of the playthrough. The game is known from one of the biggest plot twists in the history of the video games, and it's still valid in 2023 (of course if you avoided spoilers). The mechanics are classic-JRPG, turn-based fights, which could be repetitive, especially with random encounters, but honestly, you don't have to grind, if you don't want to. FF7 showed the western world that the story in the RPG can be written very well, immense and compelling. Also, let's not forget about brilliant soundtrack made by one and only Nubou Uematsu. One of the best soundtracks in video game history, up to this date. The game is packed with mini-games, I don't think there's so much diverse content in any other Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy VII for sure is one of the best RPG adventures of all time. If you can stand dated graphics and some gameplay mechanics, such as platforming segments, it's perfect 10/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best turn-based RPG ever made. The graphics don't hold up to today's standards, but it's so damn good that it doesn't even matter. Cloud is arguably the best main character in video game history.. Final Fantasy VII defined an entire generation. Most people that like Final Fantasy VII like it because THEY like it, even if they wear ""nostalgia goggles"" Most people that dislike dislike it because they have no sense of individuality. Back in the day there was no such an ""anti-hype hype and ooh Final Fantasy VII is so overrated, VI is better, Kefka > Sephiroth, insert another pseudo-intellectual comment here"". That is a internet thing from the last 15 years. Final Fantasy VII does not have the most consistent writing. That is not why it is perfect. It is perfect because the image of the story and the characters is perfect, even if some passages are a bit sloppy. This game has heart. It does not matter how many people rant about the story because most of them, not even those that love it, understand it anyway because they either believe in fan theories or just do not understand certain passages, did not understand it because of the translation or just even with enough proper translation simply do not want to understand it in the way intended. But that still does not change that fact that the idea of the story is a touching one that games can only dream to have. And to be honest, even with some inconsistent or unnecessary writing, it still is written so much better than most. Does this game have its goofy moments? It has. That is why it is such a masterpiece. A solid story manages to be dead serious and funny. Look at how many fans Star Wars has. And many Final Fantasys, this one included, took inspiration from Star Wars (and other things). Does the game have the best cast? I don't think so. I think it has some of the best characters but the best overall cast would go to another Final Fantasy. And those that are important are implemented in such a good way that they just peak above all others in the game. And that is fine because not every character in a game is supposed to have the same focus. Still the others are getting their own screentime enough to show they also play a role in this story and also have their own share of problems. The score would bemore or less on par with Final Fantasy VI for me though I have to say most ""normal tracks2 in VII are a lot better for me. But to more or less even that out VI has Terra's Theme, Forever Rachel, Aria Di Mezzo Caraterre, all Kefka stuff and a lot more. I would still give VII a slight edge. So the graphics. Does nobody actually understand that FFVII is supposed to imitate the SNES FF Sprites? Yes, FFVIII looks a lot more ""real"" but that was when they did not want to use that style anymore. VIII came out around the time Parasite Eve was made so they went for that, just as FFVIII's artworks by Tetsuya Nomura looks like his Parasite Eve artwork in style. One can argue how good the cartoony, super-deformed stuff looks and that is fair but that is really only a matter of preference and when it comes to FFVII a part of its charme for so many people. When it comes to me, Final Fantasy VII inspired and influenced me so greatly in my life that I could never thank the creators enough for what they made.. I mean what else can I say other than it’s FF Freaking VII… it’s utterly legendary and lives up to the hype imo. Yeah it’s old now, but so is pulp fiction.. One of the best things about this game is that you can play it now and really get a good understanding of how deep the decline of Square Enix has been since Square Soft's golden age by comparing it to its horrific remake. But anyway, while FF6 was probably actually the game that kickstarted Final Fantasy's golden age, FF7 is the one that really propelled Final Fantasy's popularity in gaming. It was also a monumental game in showing the capability of games to be cinematic experiences. That alone would make this a respectable game in video game history, but FF7 is amazing in general. The characters are exceptional in both their personality, and their designs - which are absolutely iconic. The story starts off fantastically, and then takes a turn into JRPG convolution and insanity. But it continues to have exceptional moments throughout and ends fantastically. The score might be the best Nobuo Uematsu has ever done, and thats saying a lot - because it propels this game to have perhaps the best OST in video games. The gameplay is pretty typical of JRPGs, which means its somewhat mediocre, but the materia system is pretty excellent.. in my opinion, this is the best playstation game that's been ever made. a masterpiece. A Masterpiece! (Loved every single hours playing this beautiful game! A Must Play!). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game have a soul. A true experience. For whatever reason games nowadays can’t reproduce this. It’s not perfect. But it’s a solid 9.9. FF7, FF8, FF9 are masterpiece just play it! I can't differentiate which is better than which.. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. Just amazing, who knows me well won't even ask about the details, a open world with a lot of things to see, great villain and last battle, cool minigames, a lot of characters and styles to tinker with, 10.. My third favorite Final Fantasy game and the third one I tried. Never ended up beating it though.. Good story, good combat, great music, certainly a classic worth playing, but it has aged pretty poorly in a lot of aspects. It is one of those games, that you can only appreciate if you played it when it first came out.. Best videogame soundtrack of all time, best videogame villain of all time. Materia system top notch. Giant explorable world, with huge variety of enemies, weapons, quests. This game has it all. The goat. one of the most beloved games on the franchise. The story is great, the gameplay is fun, although i think it was kinda easy, main campaign wise. Honestly this is the only 10 game I have ever played as nothing is a ten. Except this! Much better than the remake, this has soul depth and emotion. I care about the characters the world and their struggles. If you haven't played this game before and love rpgs, than I think you'll love it.. This could possibly be the greatest video game ever created. Every single aspect of it was created exquisitely. From the overall artistic direction to the combat, characters, story, magic system, music, atmosphere, and overall enjoyment factor were all made with a tremendous amount of passion. The ""Remake"" did not even compare. It's a decent game, in it's own right, but was not able to recapture what makes the original game as incredible as it truly is. ** This Metacritic score is incorrect as it is missing numerous mainstream publication reviews from the time of it's release. In actuality, it's true Metacritic score is closer to a 97. [I added every mainstream critic review, for the PS1 version, listed on Wikipedia (I looked each one up individually to make sure they were accurate) and divided them by the number of reviews given.] ** The true user score is also very significantly higher than shown here, as there are a very high number of fake, hate reviews made by people (trolls) bashing the game because of it's popularity. Most of the hate reviews read as if the people who wrote them had never actually played the game. Almost all of them mention things about the game that are completely falso. Often times mentioning things that do not even exist in this game. And there are tons of these hate reviews on here. Literally, hundreds.. The experience is unforgettable but it is not the best in the series, there is more nostalgia than realism. Overrated piece of crap. Truly hot garbage that people only say is good because they haven't played another JRPG in their life.. Even in 2023 this is the best Video Game Story in History. Sure Graphics are absolut outdated. But this Game is something really really special.. This is the first final fantasy game I've played. I am going to finish it tonight (1/15/23). This game came out when my dad was in middle school, it's over a quarter of a century old and it's held up so absurdly well, there is no doubt in my mind some other 15 year old kid will pick a port of this game up in another 26 years and have the same reaction as me. Part one is an amazing introduction and it's one hell of a Rollercoaster. I spent over 20 hours in part one and I'm planning on replaying it because I actually kinda miss it lol. Part two is super immersive and made me incredibly anxious. This bit probably has the best story section of the game. The craziest twists I've ever seen are in this section. I felt like I was Cloud by this point and seeing him turn into a potato wrecked me I just wanted to play as cloud again. When I got the submarine I was overleveled by atleast ten levels or so but it's not like that mattered because I met emerald weapon just a minute later and was obliterated. I decided to breed a gold chocobo to get kotr just to fight it and still got obliterated. I now plan on slaying it at a later point. This was one of the greatest experiences I’ve ever experienced I was thinking about putting in spoilers but it’s just too good that’s why you should get this game I’ve beaten it on my PS1 but it doesn’t matter which console you play it on I’m currently beating it again on my PS5 I’m 6 hours in but that’s not even close to half of the game.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this seventh game in the series.. We are in 2023 and Final Fantasy VII still remain one of the best game of all time and one of the best FF alongside FF14. This is more of a throwback than a review. FF7 is the game that popularized JRPG to the West as well as the first RPG for many people. It is also for a lot of gamer the first contact that people ever had with PTSD and how it affected the individual, especially with how the storyline treats Cloud's mental illness, in an era where mental awareness wasn't as big as today. FF7 also managed to create simultaneously one of the best protagonist and the best antagonist not only in gaming, but in pop culture in general. Sephiroth's influence on culture as a villain is big and 25 years later, still remains in some rankings' highest spot, sharing the podium with the fairly recent Emelt-Selch from FF14 Shadowbringers. Still to this day, my favourite game of all time. Cloud and Sephiroth may just be the 2 most iconic Final Fantasy characters of all time.. A great game to play even today. Way superior to the trashy title that today they call FF7 Remake. The kind of classic game that shouldn't have been touched with prequels, sequels, spinoffs, and alternative cringe s%it, just to milk and ruin characters, stories and the world.. Never liked it, everything feels so outdated and childish in this one, but remake is absolutely amazing. I would suggest just ignoring the original and play way superior remake.. By far the best video game ever made! It's sick that this masterpiece was done in a year of development time, 25 years ago. I played it first in 1997 and I love to see other people experiencing this masterpiece so I search for playthroughs and new player reviews all the time. Okay, let's mosy over and start with the most important thing in this game. Story 10/10: The best story ever written! It's just so awesome. Great plot twist all the way. Great buildups, great lore and world building. All characters have their moments and has different reactions to different important scenes in the game, depending on which party you choose. That's great for replay ability also. All the villans and plot points make sense too, and you fight no one just for being a bad dude. Those things that don't make sense is part of the story and gets explained later, it's genius and you go to a lot of places here where you never ever thought before the game started. Soundtrack 10/10: Best soundtrack of all time?Yeah, easily! There is no other games that has this many great songs in it and the songs are in all genres and both beautiful, foreboding and hopefull in the same time. Yeah, sure FF9 and FF6 has almost as good tracks and games like Donkey Kong Country 2 and Age of Wonders is also in the top but FF7 has a broader range of diffwrebce in tracks and still more consistent hits it perfectly. It got so many songs with hint and bits from several other songs in them. That's genius. All village themes are beautiful. The main theme is the best song ever. All the fighting music and boss tracks are awesome and the planet and character related music like city of the ancients, Cosmo Canyon and Cids theme is so beautiful. Graphics 10/10: The lego characters got so much life and emotions. They are charmy and funny. The backgrounds are just beautiful and they are art all through the game. Even 25 years later they look stunning. The battles are cinematic and the Summons so cool, but they should be able to skip in all ff games when you summoned them once. The cinematography in this game is just so much before it's time. It's ridiculous. They used great camera angels, cuts and pans in all the right places and the cutscenes where mind blowing for its time and still holds up today. Gameplay 9/10: This is the weekest part of the game and the one thing that hasn't aged like fine wine. It's still masterfully done but the controls is a little bad some times in the world and some of the minigames really ****. It's clear why they did go for one or two big minigames per game in ff8-10 instead. But the ambition was there and it's still alot of fun. The fighting is great and the materia system is so flexible and you really crave new materia even though you can clear most of the things without them. The limit breaks are so awesome but the fights are a little slow now so x3 speed battles are useful in the new ports. This game got the best Characters in any game. Yeah Cait sith **** but even him got some great moments. One last thing I want to say is about the humor in this game. It's so hilarious and funny some times. The honey bee inn. Taking Tifa's underwear in her room. The turks talking about wich of the girls they are in to. The date scene with barret. The scenes where Heidiger rages in Costa del Sol and Hojo is sun bathing and stuff like that is so great and they nailed it. It's also the best paced game of all time and after huge, heavy story bits you always get to something really light like go snowboarding or fly an airship. I **** love this video game!. 2nd favorite game of all time hjsdbfccsefgbdvbjsdhfiwe;hfhsdbcbsa.awbudrehwrfuhnebfbs;sn. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. most overrated game I've ever played, how do people think this is good..? it isn't memorable, enjoyable, or well-written, and it isn't impressive in any way either. the only thing stopping this from being a 1/10 is how iconic it is which is arguable since it has nothing to do with my opinion, but I don't want to sound like a review bomber while writing this, so I'm giving it an honest 2/10.. Classic game that define the genere. Story of war and frendship, story of love that can never be and hatred that always was.. This is the best game ever created. The devs behind this game really knew what they were doing when designing and engineering the game, by using amazingly crafted images and then throwing the 3d characters atop them to fit more and more and more story onto the Playstation hardware. The characters are all 10/10, all of the npcs feel like they could be real people with real lives, which makes you just fall more and more and more in love with the world, speaking of the world... The world is probably the best part, Midgar is one of the most creative places I've ever seen in gaming. And the exploration! It still blows my mind that you could go down an alleyway and then go through an entire part of the story that you otherwise wouldn't even know about. This feeds your mind to explore every nook and cranny that you find. The music is amazing as well, never have I ever seen a game encapsulate a moment more than this game's music, from that iconic opening scene from Midgar to running around the Shinra building and fighting freaking giant robots on a crashing elevator. THE MINIGAMES ARE SO WELL MADE! It just continued to blow my mind more and more how much this game pushes its limits, when I felt and saw that motorcycle minigame nearing the end of Midgar, now that was insane. I could go on and on about this game and how amazing it is, if you haven't played this game, you NEED to. Cheers.. Played this, while listening to Eifel 65, that was it. This was kind of the best world, best story, ever for rpgs, and i never got the same love ever again, even though i played alot of games, this world was one of my favorites. Then square enix decided they were greedy, and now we have 18 different versions of this world, and that dumb remake that doesn't want anything but your money, 180$ or more of it. This game gave you a full package, that newer games, will never touch on ever again.. Contains some minute spoilers Since it's initial release in the 90s, Final Fantasy 7 has been revered as this ""amazing game that you have to play"". And for the most part, that does hold true. The overall plot, and executions were great. Great tension building when revealing the villain. The combat had nice progression, alongside some fun weapons and magic. The map and scenery was beautiful. The music helped give a great atmosphere to the locations, and are just some great songs in general. The character designs were also great, and the characters were enjoyable. The combat was really slow due to animations. Area themes would be interrupted by the battle theme in some areas. The graphics were quite ugly, and did not age well. Most areas felt incredibly time consuming and annoying to complete. The random encounter rate felt like you’d be getting a random encounter every 10 seconds. The characters felt really flat as well. The ending was also quite lackluster. Overall, I really did enjoy the game, I really did. The graphics are ugly, the characters didn't hit me like I thought they would, the animations in the combat were incredibly annoying, the random encounters and some areas were an absolute pain in the ass, and the ending was incredibly disappointing. But... I did still like the game though, really. Great story, great music, great locations, great and memorable character designs, nice magic system, and great overall feel and theme of the game. If you do want to get into the JRPG genre, and want to experience a great story and music as well, or if you're just interested in playing it because of Final Fantasy Remake, do play it because it is still a great game. However, do be warned as it's definitely not the phenomenal JRPG you've been told it is. Ov","this review is for the launch version of the game on Playstation 1 in 1997 . it's an extraordinary JRPG with many plot twists, interesting characters, and complex gameplay without beeing too difficult . graphics ahead of it's time, especially in it's prerenderd cutscenes that transfer seamlessly over to gameplay ."
183.Chrono Trigger,"They should make a remake of this; the game was amazing for its time, the music was legendary, and the story was fantastic.. Chrono Trigger may seems a bit outdated today, but it's because this is what forms the formula. I really hate ATB battle system, but this is what I can stand it and enjoy the playthrough.. Best RPG of all time. Nothing else to say, go buy it and play it right now.. Not only is Chrono Trigger and outstanding experience, its gameplay mechanics are easy to understand with many ways to utalize them and the aesthetic of the game supports the intended atmosphere of the game. No other game has offered me the same excitement with its world building and characters as Chrono Trigger. This game is something everyone that's interested in any RPG subgenre or singleplayer games in general needs to play through and experience for themselves.. Best video game story of all time. The characters feel so real, I actually felt like they were people that I knew irl. Yes, it is a turn based RPG, but it is innovative in that aspect with team attack. It also has a seamless start to battles, with no break in immersion. In this game, your decisions matter too, so no two people will have the exact same experience. This game is a must play, and is one of my all time favorites.. One of the best classic games of all time gotta be a 10/10 simply it’s a masterpiece. A timeless classic, deserving of being at the very top along Ocarina of Time and the others highest in top games of all time rankings on here, unfortunately we do not live in that more accurate timeline. Oh welll. I played my part, at least.. This game is good and if you like Chrono trigger on DS, play Cory in the House also for DS,I prefer the super Nintendo version. R.I.P Akira Toriyama, one of the greatest genius i ever saw. Thank you for creating one of the best, if not, the best game of all time, Chrono Trigger.. I used to play this in the ds and the experience was amazing. Asa kid the characters were awesome and so were the enemy’s. A timeless treasure.. ""Chrono Trigger,"" the 1995 RPG developed by Square Enix, is like the Beatles of video games. It's a magnum opus, a masterpiece that has stood the test of time, much like a well-aged bottle of wine. Graphics: Graphically, it's impressive how they managed to preserve the charm of the original while adapting it to the DS's dual screens. The sprites are crisp, and the dual-screen setup adds a layer of convenience, displaying maps and menus without cluttering the main action. Gameplay: The gameplay, fortunately, remains faithful to the SNES version. The touch screen controls might not be everyone's cup of tea, but they don't detract from the overall experience. The added convenience of having your inventory and maps readily accessible with a tap is a nice touch. It's like the game got a little quality of life makeover. Soundtrack: Now, let's talk music. The DS version inherits the iconic soundtrack from the original, and it sounds just as magical on this handheld platform. Mitsuda and Uematsu's compositions continue to shine, making the DS rendition a portable symphony of nostalgia. Story: And of course, the narrative. The time-traveling epic is intact, with all its twists and turns. The DS version even throws in a new ending, giving players an extra layer of exploration for those hungry for more. In conclusion, ""Chrono Trigger"" on the DS is a faithful port that brings the timeless classic to a handheld format without losing its soul. It's like having a pocket-sized portal to the golden age of RPGs. While it may not revolutionize the game, it certainly doesn't tarnish the legacy.. + Battle system is fast paced, simple, and fun+ No character is completely useless+ World feels alive with many choices constantly being reflected+ No need to grind, battle stragety is more important+ All Characters have depth/development+ Highly replayable / multiple endings+ Does time travel right~ Sidequests are mainly there to develop characters~ Music doesn't really have it's own identity~ A lot of skippable quests, including the final dungeon!- Lavos fight can drag on- Black Omens is tedious. A timeless masterpiece, still oustanding almost thirty years on. This was my first time playing Chrono Trigger, around twenty-eight years after the initial release and it has blown me away. Every aspect of the game exudes love and care; the gameplay is fantastic and the story is heartwarming and terrifying at the same time. I cannot understate how prolific this game is. When I play other games I can recognise how inspired they were from this masterpiece, but as this is the only ten I have ever given so far, none of them have ever reached the same heights. I love this cast of characters. I don't know how they did it but I care for all of them, even the robot -- in fact, especially the robot. The story winds its way through time as you uncover a plot to destroy the world and try your best to thwart it. Throughout the adventure you pick up some of the most loveable characters I have met. Each of them feel like they have their own motivations, their own sense of belonging outside of your game world and have side quests that help you dive into their lore. Typing this makes it sounds generic but I don't quite know how to explain it except: Chrono Trigger does these parts masterfully. Part of this game's success has to be the soundtrack. It underscores everything you do and I have never heard a soundtrack like this. It stays in my head, it made me weep tears of sadness and tears of joy. The quality of the soundtrack is incredible but it is also used masterfully, it knows when to exacerbate your sadness and when to leave you alone to enjoy the sounds of the environment around you. Mitsuda, hats off, this is a masterpiece. The spirtework and detailing astonish me. There is so much love put into the characters expressions, the way they walk and dress. The scenery is beautiful, when I was exploring I would just stop and look at the artwork, then the soundtrack would kick in and I would just stare. This isn't one majestic picture, this is a rolling canvas of beauty. How they managed to do this on the SNES is hard to comprehend. These guys were working on another level. I thought the gameplay would be the one part to let this game down. I don't particularly like turn based combat so I figured I'd struggle through the gameplay for the soundtrack and art. I was wrong. The gameplay is genuinely fun, it's turn based but the Active Time Battle System forces the game to be played at a higher pace. You're trying to select your moves and figure out the enemies weakness while making sure your team doesn't die. It's great. Also there isn't any grinding, which is so typical of many JRPGs, for which I'm truly thankful. You can bounce from story beat to story beat and not feel like the game was pushing you back or saying that you were going too fast. Sometimes in life something strange happens. The perfect composers meet the perfect game programmers with the perfect artists, and they combine to make a true masterpiece. That is this game, and everyone owes it to themselves to try it out.. Solid piece of art with great artwork done by Toriyama and one of best SNES-era music.. one of the best RPGs of ALL time. If not, THE best. It's a great DS port of the original with a few newly added additions that is definitely worth the experience and price tag all over again.. This is one, if not the greatest RPG of all time. I have now idea why anyone would give it less than a 10. The story is amazing, the music is fantastic.. It really good, i understand that many people wouldn't like it but for JRPG fans it a must play. An essence of JRPG along with FF6, FF7, FFX. Those four are just untouchable JRPG masterpieces.. This game is the first rpg that I managed to complete 100%, being a very charming and amazing experience. I grew attached to the characters as the story progressed, their gameplay was revolutionary for the time and still very unique at its core. The freedom to direct where to end the story is a way to motivate us more to complete it 100%. In short, a very complete and great game, which deserves the title of best RPG game in history. The version of ""Nintendo DS"" is the maximum display of affection for the franchise, it is the one that further expands and embellishes its beautiful popularity, the best version to play the game and fall in love with the title.. The best game I've ever played. The characters are super charismatic making them memorable, the visuals and the graphics combine a lot with the context of the narrative, the soundtrack has aged very well and especially the main story, with time travel at all times make the game itself a very interesting and exciting.. This game is a complete work of art! It didn't do anything wrong at all. Captivating characters, intriguing story, beautifully crafted mechanics, and not to mention the music. Chrono Trigger is definitely one of my favorite games, and I will cherish every ending I get.. This is the best J-RPG of all time. No doubt. People who didn't like it, I can do nothing.. The music, the art, the story, the characters, the gameplay, 9.99999. That's for the ORIGINAL game and the PS1 with the nice FMVs. But the new area in later versions is really disappointing and extremely boring/mediocre. Don't waste your time on that. You're welcome.. This game has such a great story! The combination of this and the game play, make it possibly one of the best rpg games ever made.. Often cited as the greatest JPRG ever made, Chrono Trigger is one of those rare instances where that level of praise is justified. Made up of a ""dream team"" comprised of the creators of both Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger offers a fantastic story, amazing soundtrack, and one of the best turn-based battle systems in any RPG. Though, the real stars are its time-traveling mechanic, as well as the origin of New Game+ mode -- allowing players to replay the game as many times as they wish with carry over stats and equipment, as well giving them a chance to discover a multitude of different endings. Furthermore, while the story may not be quite as deep or intricate as the best of the Final Fantasy, Persona, or Xeno franchises, Chrono Trigger's narrative is executed to perfection -- offering loads of charm and wit, twist and turns, and wonderful characterization from beginning to end. To this day, Chrono Trigger remains a truly special game.. A classic way ahead of its time. Likeable characters, one of the best stories ever and arguably the best turn based mechanics of all time. The art still holds up. One of the best rpgs of all time. 8/10, still relevant jRPG experience, which can be a good starting point to explore other classic games of the genre.. One of the greatest RPGs of all time, with a couple of little bonuses along the way exclusive to the DS port. Its arguably the best version, and best way to play the game overall. Beautiful, just beautiful. Chef's kiss.. I don't know where to start from the story to the character development and the soundtrack, everything in this game is perfect. This in my opinion is the best game ever, its a timeless classic. I would rate this higher, but a 10 is the max.. Still an absolute classic on every level. One of the first games that displayed video games can be works of classic art. Soundtrack is still one of the greatest ever, excellent art style, engaging story and adventure. A must play for fans of the JRPG genre.. One of the greatest games ever made and one I often go back. The art style is incredible and the game play deep.. This is one of the best JRPG of all time ... nothing else to say. If you played some other titles of the genre, Chrono Trigger is going to be better ...for sure.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolute master piece. No random enemy encounters being a great thing. Also the music and development of the characters makes the experience whole. Definitely a must play!. The game is pretty linear in terms almost everything but if someone tells me linear stories or games can't be amazing I'd straight up points towards Chrono Trigger... I loved almost everything about the game, story, characters, gameplay, visuals and especially the soundtrack... Yasunori Mitsuda really did a brilliant job in chrono trigger.. Information: . The original game is from 1994. There are N versions for various platforms that are just adapted versions of the original with almost no changes. . The review is based on what was possible at the time of release. So, you can't demand better graphics for a 1994 game. Historical time matters. --> Positive points: . If a piece of entertainment uses time travel that means the authors are insecure about the plot. But Chrono Trigger manages to do an excellent job even appealing to time travel. . its gameplay has become the standard for decades of future RPG-s due to the fact that it was very good for the time of release. . CGI in game is awesome. . Art design . Good side quests. --> Negative points: . Used time travel, so inevitably has some holes in the plot.. How can anyone rate this game below a 10 is beyond me. One of the best of all time and forever my favorite. This simply is one of that games that establishes the pinnacle **** and you know it’s gonna be difficult to surpass. Great gameplay, brilliant graphics and colors, funny characters and techniques. Yasunori Mitsuda as a composer delivers it as always and great story on top of that. Hope to see the dream team composed by Sakaguchi-Toriyama-Horii once again in my life.. I hated every second of it. Why do people like this game so much? Everything is simplified to the point of being the literal, utilitarian definition of what makes a mechanic. To see people call it polished is very surprising.. One of the worse SNES RPGs. It seems as though Square Enix missed the point of video games.. No, I do not ""owe it to myself"" to play this game. Unfortunately, I made the mistake to play it. It is fundamentally flawed.. It's is a clunky hybrid of turn-based and real-time (ATB). Enemies pose no threat and deal a fraction of the damage the player character is capable of dishing out. There's almost no interesting spells or status effects, important debuff/buffs, every ability simply deals damage. Dual/triple techs are just boring variations on the same 'do tons of damage' or 'heal tons of HP' template. There's nothings that messes with Equipment-in battle, interact with terrain or change the very rules and mechanics of the battle, It's so bland and dull. Compare to any turn based games like SMT, SaGa, Etrian, even Chrono Cross or other FF that use ATB, etc. It simply lacks enough depth and challenge to be compelling since you have no real customization, builds or skills which hurts replayablity when every play-through is the same each **** There's barely any exploration, it's a time travel game that is somehow completely on rails. Your only choice is how soon you want to end the game by teleporting to Lavos which is the most disappointing aspect. There's no practical way to beat the game 'early' on your first run, so you pretty much have to get the standard ending, then all the other endings are NG+ replay gimmicks that basically reward you for being over-geared at particular stages of the otherwise linear game. The multiple endings are even shallower than the overall narrative: they're either superficial variations on the same happy ending/easter egg/joke endings. They're pointless and contribute nothing to the game. Time travel is not even used in any meaningful way: instead of traveling back in time to prevent Lavos from becoming a threat, the characters travel forward in time to face him at the height of his power and beat him up. There's no entertainment when the gameplay loop just spam high level techs with a occasional AoE heal. Who the **** finds this ""fun""? It's repetitive and devoid of sustenance and dungeons might as well be linear corridors. It's not even only overly simple, it's overly TOO shallow. There is no challenge and variety is non-existent. Abusing double and triple techs really just destroys anything, and when Chrono receives the Luminary spell, you don't even have to see the pixels on the screen again . The lack of challenge is a major problem when that's 90% of the ****ing game. Its hard to remain engaged when you are just sitting there watching animations play out and not actively engaging with the mechanics. Even Magus' (which people like to claim is a difficult battle) is completely bypassed by doing the same thing you do all game. The game has zero customization which is supposed to be the point of a RPG? There is no player involvement, except in equipping new gear which is just select the best one in every scenario. You can't assign spells or roles to anyone they are just attackers and healers who basically play the same. It's boring as a rpg, and there's no strategy to the actual game part. Just look at the other rpgs that came out CT's era that surpass it in all areas >Phantasy Star IV Came out over a year before CT. Has multi-character techniques like CT, more interesting character abilities, vehicle combat, and the ability to setup turn macros, lots of customization >Lunar Character placement/positioning matters far more than in CT as characters/enemies have movement ranges & have to be adjacent for melee attacks, far more interesting movesets. >Lufia 2 Has limit breaks, a roguelike-dungeons, and far better non-combat gameplay with the tight puzzle & maze design. Of the 100+ techs/spells in Chrono Trigger, less than 10 have a range that is something other than ""single/all"", and you can't even manually target their area of effect. Almost all of CT's tech/spells function just like they do in other jrpgs. In addition, you have no way to influence positioning in any meaningful way, since your own characters can't move. Enemies can technically move, but they do so extremely sporadically and are just motionless 99% of the time. They also do the typical jrpg thing where they jump at you to attack and then jump back to their position on the battlefield, so their position is basically static. There is no friendly fire. Your character's inability to move means you can't take advantage of enemy positioning like you can in other rpgs. Your character's inability to move also greatly reduces the scope of tactics. In other rpgs, you might want to spread out characters to prevent them from all being struck by an enemy's area of effect attack. Or you might have to make a sacrifice: for instance, if one of your party members is in close proximity to the enemy, and attacking them would mean also damaging your own ally through friendly fire. Even these basic tactical options are absent from CT. CT is just a really poorly designed games for little kids, praise the visuals and music all you want, but the game has massive problems on the game part. 0/10.. I see why people love this game. I don't like JRPGs, or RPGs in general, but this game is something special. I think what's really impressive is how well this game holds up even in 2018. I don't want to spoil ANYTHING, so I'll just recommend this game if you can even remotely stand turn based combat.. This is the game of my life, the reason why I like video games and why I consider them art, I played it in the days of snes when I was 10 years old and at that time it was the perfect game, which to date I consider that . I beg for a remake of this masterpiece Story : 10 Gameplay: 10 Music: 10 Visuals: 10 Personal Score: 10+ a master piece !!. In 21st century we have so many so much better games. Here you will encounter nothing more than mediocre graphic, mediocre sound, poor story and frustrating gameplay. Honestly, I can't see why Chrono Trigger have all this cult. If you are not huge fan of jRPG or you don't have high amounts of nostalgia I strongly recommend to play something else.. This game's way ahead of its time. The Good - interesting to hear monsters talking. Their dialogue is pretty amusing. - being able to replace party members at any time is very convenient. Party members that are on the sidelines also scale in level, which is good because when you want to switch them in they won't be super underleveled. - there's not too many buffs and debuffs which I personally like. It has the basic ones, which makes the game not too shallow and not too deep. Games like FF have so many buffs and debuffs, sometimes I lose track of them and it just get a little confusing. - the battle animations are phenomenal for its time - it's nice that they wrote dialog for each character so the cutscenes will still fuel organic no matter who you have in the party. - I like the fact that KO'd teammates have 1 HP after battle. This way I don't have to waste a revive on them - debuffs don't stick after battle. Don't have go into menu just to heal after. Saves time. - really interesting enemies. Like snakes that absorb each other. - before pokemon did the trainer line of sight battles, Chrono trigger did it. Those eye balls in the time egg chapter, you have to wait til they close their eyes if you want to avoid them. The rats in proto dome in lab 32, you have to dodge rats to not get stuff stolen from u. - moving around during text box is great. Allows freedom to check out the area or leave without having to mash to the end. - the menuing is very very fluent and informative, without being over complicated. - button remap is really nice. Allows full customization. - music is awesome - Chrono trigger was way ahead of its time. With the battle system, with the menu layout, with wild encounters, with interesting environments interactions, and enemy types. And even story structure, the whole time travel aspect actually worked out pretty well, with surprises like magus being that kid from zeal, and being able to resurrect Chrono, and all those other characters that's came to the future whom you meet later on in the past. for a piece of media, not even just a video game, this was very innovative. - different dialogue lines depending on who's with the party during cutscene - seeing the game over scene after losing to lavos invokes a certain feeling. The Bad - it's difficult to see the difference between second floor and first floor. As well as corridors that are behind walls. I know the SNES is quite primitive, but I still feel they could have done a better job. Maybe they could have added better Shadow sprites. - I wish Chrono had dialogue. Mute protagonists can work but I don't think they did it well here. The other characters have plenty of dialogue, but they don't really interact with Chrono directly. When they refer to Chrono they say it in the way as if he isn't there. So most of the interactions in the cut scenes of the party makes it seem like Chrono is like a ghost. Which in turn makes me feel like a ghost. Mute protagonist is supposed to make you feel like you are in their shoes, and I am in the shoes of an empty husk. Link is an example of a mute protagonist done well. Other characters refer to him directly, and he does have to do nuisances like facial expressions, physical reactions. - I felt they could have used maybe just a set of different variation of the reaction sprites. There's literally only one suprise sprite. Sometimes the char seem like they are overreacting cause the sprite is so dramatic. - I couldn't go back to kingdom of zeal to get black rock, meaning eternal darkness tech was lost to me forever. I hate not being to back track to important things. I can understand an aesthetic item being missable, but not an item that allows me to learn one of the strongest spells in the game. Missed forever. After zeal fell, the Blackstone should still be attainable either somewhere else, or logically, I should be able to travel back in time, back before zeal fell, to attain black rock.. Truly remarkable that two decades and a half after the original release of this game, we still see many of the tropes presented in it in the JRPGs of our time. That tells how much of a classic this game is. The game shines storywise. The major plot is interesting to follow, but it also doesn't outshine the side stories and character developments of each member of our colorful cast. The moments of peril are exciting to witness, and the emotional bits will leave you with deep feelings. There are also some plot twists that remain a novelty to this day in regular JRPG storytelling, which is guaranteed to take the player by surprise. The graphic part also still holds up to this day to Pixel Art standards, thanks in great part to the character and world designs, making each person you meet and place you traverse memorable. Also, the concept design by manga legend Akira Toriyama is also an immense plus to leave everything oozing with style. Unfortunately, the experience suffers in regards to gameplay. While the fights manage to still be visually enjoyable with the dynamic movement of the characters, the interactivity per se is not much, and the whole thing might get repetitive when it comes to facing regular monsters. Also, navigating certain areas sometimes can be frustrating due to the limited movement on the overworld. Lastly, the pacing of certain moments with a heavier focus on the story might leave you that feeling of ""Okay, can I play now?"". In conclusion, despite the design flaws of its time, Chrono Trigger still manages to be a great game and a real classic, as well as really deserving of the remake treatment that many old games are getting in these modern times.. I never had the pleasure of playing this game when I was a kid. I got to play it on my DS for the first time in 2019. And just WOW. A masterpiece of a JRPG. The graphics hold really really well compared to other SNES JRPGs of the time. Not going to review the story. It's been like 25 years guys. The game is a 10/10 okay?. The perfect video game doesn't exi-......................................... Cast: 4/10 Story: 5/10 Fun: 3/10 Gameplay: 5/10 Not Recommended ----------------------. The first part of this game seems amazing, like a 10/10, one of the best games you've ever played. It then becomes and abrasive boring slow slog with cheap tactics. Oh wow, every enemy automatically takes half my health. Oh this enemy can kill me in two hits. Oh I used the wrong spell I guess cause I just healed it, now my entire party is dead and I have to redo those 5 forced battles before this again. Oh look I finally made it to the boss this will be exciting, .......oh wow they are literally reusing the same boss I just faced 15 minutes ago. God this is so lazily made. It isn't one of the best games of all time, or rpgs, or jrpgs, it isn't the best of anything. I love the characters and the charm it shows at first, and that makes it all the worse that this game falls off such an incredibly steep cliff that you never saw coming.. It’s clearly one of the best jRPG game. Like all jRPG games it’s very simple and have very repetitive gameplay, but despite this, the game stands out from all other jRPGs. In this whole gameplay repeatability typical of jRGS, it is characterized by overall simplicity that makes playing pleasant.. I'll start by saying this is one of my favorites of all time. I played it years ago when SNES was in it's prime. The game holds up on DS and even on the steam version where I'm currently playing jointly with my wife who is also loving the experience. The DS version added an extra dungeon that felt unnecessary but also not intrusive. Across the various versions there are some small translation differences but they don't bother me much- it's largely the same game. The story is not simple, but it feels simple it's easy enough to understand but the game has a couple of terrific twists that keep you guessing. There is also a suprising amount of optional content and side quests that really enrich the game and add more depth to the characters. In my younger years I was suprised how technical the game seemed to be both with these side quest options (especially later in the game) and the combat, including dual combo's and triple techs was amazing back in the day and is still super fun today. I'm shocked more games havn't adopted this style of RPG to be honest. The character development was great in it's prime and still very much holds up. The characters each have personalities and animations that draw you in. The sprite like style of the graphic holds up much more than I thought it would over the years... again it was well done in it's prime and still looks solid today. The music is amazing and iconic in my opinion and I can hum most of the major themes by heart (i've enjoyed the re-imagined versions and chrono symphonic is a great listen for long time fans.) Spoilers. It's an adventure across time but the ways that you change the timelines felt very significant back in the SNES days and they still do a good job of being solid gameplay mechanics. There arn't any real puzzles but you have to navigate the world in different areas and times in order to gain access to the story and eventually side quests. This game is wholesome, complex, fun, and replayable for die hard fans. I play it about once every 5-10 years at this point. It's my favorite RPG. :). Must play. Simply put, one of the best games of all time. Not simply of RPGs, but all video games. Astonishingly good gameplay, story, and replayability.. To be honest, i´ve played the snes version. This game is a masterpiece like no other, musics, graphics, mechanics, its all in there in a perfect form limited to the hardware/tecnology of its time.. An old JRPG ported in NDS version. Although the old RPG games are mostly not user friendly, this one is playable enough even in our age.. Solid JRPG with a terrific story, locations and characters, good side quests, not breaking action, pumping and the main villain. Not a memorable protagonist. Great soundtrack.. Chrono Trigger is the first game I've played for a long period when I was a kid, and of course one of the best RPG game I've ever played in my life! I remember when I first played this game, it was every morning, everybody sleeping and there I was, playing this gold piece for the last 2 weeks... This game taught me to appreciate good stories, and that's the reason I decided to start new ones after finishing it.. This is the best RPG of the 16-bit era. Didn't have the chance to play it when it came out, but it still holds up, and fits very well in the scene of retro releases. Probably the pinnacle of JRPGs. It has a few surprises up it's sleeve, and more than a few very familiar elements of the genre. It does start out fairly linear but it opens up rather quickly and it definitely is an adventure worth experiencing.. I played the original SNES version and it **** me in. I completed it many many times to see all different ending and outcomes. One of the very best RPGs of all time. Awesome adventure through time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece and easily the best JRPG, if no RPG, out there. And also easily one of the best games of all time with one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a video game. This game aged REALLY well and the way it tells the story is beautiful. 10/10. Played in my childhood at 8 years old without really knowing what i was getting into and never manage to pass the third scenario, then i forgot about it and remember it 10 months ago so i give it a try and now at my 20s is my favorite game, even for today standards the development of the history is so amazing, is a masterpiece that will only grown in you with time.. Chrono Trigger is one of those SNES classics like Earthbound, Final Fantasy 6, or Terranigma that not everyone got to play, but are seemingly acknowledged as legends of the 16 bit era. And really, it is. Chro","the game was amazing for its time, the music was legendary, and the story was fantastic . no other game has offered me the same excitement with its world building and characters as Chrono Trigger . it is a turn based RPG, but it is innovative in that aspect with team attack ."
184.Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker,"This was my favourite expansion of FFXIV. The story is so touching and the gameplay super fun. This game will always be a big part of my life and this expansion is just amazing.. ""Endwalker"" is the biggest story in the Final Fantasy series, following ""Shadowbringers."" It's a shame that I can only give this story a 10.. The main story was really good overall, but as others have already mentioned, far too much was skipped over. For years, people have hoped that Endwalker, as the grand finale, would finally answer all the lingering questions, only to find out that everything was rushed through just to start a cliché new storyline in the post-patches that somehow... I don’t know, just wasn’t very good in terms of quality. They really could have put more into Endwalker, both in terms of individual characters and entire aspects of the story. It felt like they just wanted to wrap things up as quickly as possible. I’ll still give it a 7 out of 10 because, despite its flaws, it was still impressive. I think the post-patches are the main reason the score gets dragged down.. Great potential, but sadly, most of it was left unused and the post patches are really bad. I think Zenos suffered the most under the writing and again, they gave him almost no screentime and didn't care to answer all the questions regarding him. And while his few scenes were interesting, in the end, he was just a plot device for the WoL, which is really sad. There are more points, though. The whole story around the Ascian's past felt very rushed, similar to Zenos' story. Also the story of the Garleans or even worse the story around the gods, which should have been in the msq, but wasn't. Zero on the other hand was very cliche and overall a rather predictable and boring char...I dunno... Still a very good expansion, though.. very beautiful and interesting game graphics are perfect as usual it is very pleasant to play it is definitely recommended to play. 6.0 MSQ: 9 | 6.1 - 6.55 MSQ: 5 | Patch Content: 5 | Average score: 6.3. I give it a 7 because it's a shame that the base MSQ of Endwalker is being dragged down by the meager patch content and a huge drop in writing quality from patch 6.1 onwards. That being said, the story of 6.0 was overall great, but not perfect. Pacing issues were apparent during the Level 80/81/83/89 sections of the MSQ, but could be redeemed by all the heights the story goes to otherwise. Overall it was a shame that major events only took place in 1 zone instead of *all* the zones, including ARR zones. The story is not as good as Shadowbringers, but still satisfying overall.. The plot drags on, and if you can skip it all at once, it may lessen the overall experience, but it doesn't affect the gameplay. But it's all worth it after getting past the plot! Worth 4.5 stars for the challenge of the last few copies.. I always love Final fantasy XIV The best MMORPG In The World Enjoy Playing with all of worrier of light. It felt like the expansion was constantly at war with itself and couldn’t decide on what kind of tone and story it wanted to take. There were far too many plot devices going on at once and none of them were well fleshed out imo. And the post patch content… my god…. giving it a 9 bc it is not shb. but damn its much closer to 10. emet selch is still my favorite. For me Endwalker isn't strictly a bad expansion narratively but coming off the excellent Shadowbringers expansion it definitely came off the weaker of the two. First, is that towards the end of the expansions narrative it's trying to create a sense of loss. However it also quickly becomes apparent a big reversal is in store. Which negates any meaning in the actions that were taken. Second, in this expansion we finally get to go to Garlemald the nation that's been home to the major antagonists since the original 1.0 game. However we spend next to no time there and it's impact on the plot is minimal. This is frankly criminal treatment. Third, something my friend has put forward is that Endwalker is really two over arching narratives smushed into one game. It would've been better to have the first half of the expansion up to around level 84 be it's own narrative expansion then leading up to the latter half given it's own. Fourth, major characters were just outright dropped only to surprise come back at the end. Several were just continuing the same story never having really learned or grown in some ways. However some characters also got major resolutions and fulfillment of their stories which is very nice. Fifth, the post patch content was done well in wrapping up any major narrative loose ends. However the writing of the post patch content clearly effected Dawntrail's narrative negatively by not devoting enough time to invest into the coming narrative.. The story twist was enjoyable and of course a good worthwhile addition to the series.. A breathtaking ending to a saga. And you could hardly have seen those story twists coming. A story, that is entertaining and so deep - asking questions about existance and life. Brilliant storytelling, awesome design, heartbreaking music, an emotional rollercoaster.. Get ready to have you mind blown by FFXIV. A master piece of a story and an ending to a saga. All the dots get connected and strings pulled together in an epic story. Together with Shadowbringers one of the best stories in gaming ever told, and my personal 2 best experiences in gaming stories.. The culmination of a story over a decade in the making. The stakes are high and the game continues to pick up from Shadowbringers in providing more high quality entertainment that is work checking out instead of skipping through.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love this story, practically every part of it, 6.x patches not included of course. Not a philosophy or psychoanalysis reader before but Endwalker inspired me to pick up a lot more books than I ever thought I'd go into. I have tremendous respect for the writers who created Venat and depicted Zenos in this expansion. The English version is beautifully versed, while the French one has some very direct and thought-provoking lines, adding savorous layers to some most profound themes that I'd never expected to see discussed to such delicacy in a video game. The writers truly delivered on their ambitions. I cried my eyes out playing through the story, and keep reflecting upon it as I go through those psychoanalysis books that no one around me read... The more I get it, the better it gets. Incredible work.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great expansion to wrap up the initial story. Yhe post msq was great as well and I enjoyed the ffiv throwback.. Thebase story of the expansion feels like a lite version of shadowbringers with its world ending threat, though it still delivered a satisfying conclusion on multiple levels. sadly its patch content and story are arguably the worst in the series.. The story was simply an enormous letdown. It had such a tremendous amount of potential coming in hot off the heels of Shadowbringers, but the last second decision to change it out for something with a lighter tone - and more one dimensional, I'm forced to say - really destroyed what otherwise promised to be something great. The loss of nuance, as well as the horrendous number of plot holes, resulted in a final product that was both jarringly dissonant and highly unappealing. The dumbing down of the combat system is another strike against this expansion. Jobs were streamlined to the point of identity loss, and the forcing of everything into a two-minute burst window forced encounters to be simplified to the point of absurdity.. Riding Shadowbringers cocktail!! nothing impressive, we are back in the original story which is just plain generic. Shadowbringers was such a breath of fresh air, and this polls you back into its mediocrity. final boss fights are good.. 0/10 - cant rate it in any other way. Housing is the only thing that keeps me playing (after content is completed and boring latest 2 weeks after a patch) and the way the aquisition of houses is implemented everything just becomes **** until the system is funamentally changed I wont be able to give any other rating then 0/10.... A great finale for the long story arc, nothing felt contrived or cliche luckily. Many of the side content introduced such as the relic weapons felt nice as they allowed focus to be redirected to other aspects of the game as almost everyone still has something to do and work on. The island sanctuary was a fun and chill inclusion. The patch stories felt nice as they connected and resolved many things though some things did seem to resolve a little too easily and conveniently.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God TIER! One of the best expansions ever to end such an amazing arc to a 10 year saga!! <3. Game is unbearably boring and **** more d**k than new world at launch. Community is comprised of snowflakes and cognitively impaired individuals that refuse to learn how to play the game and then cry when they get criticized. Combat is so horrendous you can literally play the game with 3 fingers. You could non ironically tell a toddler which 3 buttons to press and he can level up to 50. People on hard copium saying that story is good... bro it's the most dull experience in this game, literally. But that's the only thing people can hold on to, because saying ""I spent 100 hours in cutscenes and 200 dollars to experience a **** story"" doesn't sound intelligent (and it isn't). Nothing can make this game look good except potentially some maps which are ruined with underage naked girls and furries running around. Looking at character selection screen you can see who is a fat stinky sewer dweller and who's an actual person that coexists in society with other people by how many big boobs and children characters they have. I don't wanna spend 100 hours killing 3 of this and then 3 of that, running around for the first 20 levels, with only option of traversing the world (which is terribly designed and dead) easier by running faster (THAT IS ON COOLDOWN AHAHAHA). And then after everything wasting 2 weeks of my life I finally get to play a decent dungeon with the most AI generated human beings in existence. Not even League of Legends managed to attract these kind of bots. Literally can go afk and I wouldn't notice a difference. And for this experience I have to pay monthly and look at my cringe anime character every single second I play the game? Nice joke. ****/wiki/Sunk_cost Just gonna leave that here, 99% of you will find yourselves being characterized by a Wikipedia definition lol. Dead **** with R34 graphics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story is great, the community is great (although few speak English) however… the game is completely unplayable because there is no anti-aliasing. Everything is blurry in motion - my eyes hurt. I can’t stand it.Every zone is instanced even when you go underwater. Sorry, this is not an enjoyable game.. If we are discussing 6.0 expansion the game would probably be a solid 8/10. With subsequent patches after this score drops to a 3/10. The casual or mid core content is way to easy and not engaging or pressuring enough for players to comeback. The game prides itself on its great community but they are no where to be found due to lack of social content. Awful playerbase has been taken over by erotica roleplayers. Encounter design in alliance raids have gotten very lazy and braindead. I was a longtime player of 10 years and quit the game.. This company steals from **** you pay for a subscription and then cancel, they will take your money the next month even though you cancelled. They took my money and then refused to give it back. I was a loyal customer of theirs for many decades, occasionally buying games and services but after this experience, I will never buy another game or service from Square Enix ever again!. let's just say that until stormblood it was okish then all wentdown the drain. I understand, it's a JRPGMMO it's for weebs, I am not a weeb therefore I cannot enjoy it.. A truly legendary experience, story, and community. FF14 unseated WoW as the greatest MMO of all time with Shadowbringers and never looked back. WoW will never reclaim that title.. What a beautiful finale. As Endwalker starts to conclude it's expansion cycle in 6.5 it leaves a lack of content and poorly executed ideas as it's contribution to the game. This may have been forgivable if the narrative wasn't arguably one of the most boring presented within the game that constantly conflicts with itself due to information from prior expansions. Overall Endwalker on all fronts outside of high end combat is a failure and a mark on a series that hopefully isn't repeated in the future.. First mmo that got me hooked up so much, i just love this game.. Taking a year break to play other stuff and then coming back has definitely made FF14 enjoyable again. That said, because I've been playing these other games, it really highlighted for me how outdated and limiting some things are in Ff14. Like... after 10 years, we still have the same 4 faces per race/gender. Somehow vieras and hrothgars still can't wear hats. Like... Baldur's Gate 3 is spamming patches and updates left and right and that's a one time purchase game. We pay a monthly sub for ff14... so... yeah... Not to mention the sheer freedom in bg3, which I'm already missing, now that I play ff14 again. Because there really are quite a few things I don't like in the Endwalker story and which my characters never ever would have done, if I had the choice. And the post Endwalker story is just... I mean, I'm really sorry to say that, but it's really bad. Characters like Zero and Goblez just feel... idk... I don't like them.. The story is a major highlight of this expansion, bringing the ""first arc"" of FFXIV to a satisfying conclusion. Gives Heavensward a run for its money.. The currently best MMORPG on the market, though not without its flaws. 1.) The most crucial aspect: The story. Unfortunately, here we find the usual MMO cliché, where one mindlessly accepts every quest and almost always exterminates their opponents without questioning. Now, since Baldur's Gate 3 has shown us that it can be done differently... it doesn't feel quite right in FFXIV to behave like a murderer most of the time and simultaneously be celebrated as a hero. Yes, it's not feasible in an MMO format like BG3, but still. At least a few more dialogue options for the wol would be desirable. This becomes even more bitter in Endwalker, where one has to prevent the end of the world, Zenos appears, someone as strong as the wol, and you simply reject his help, which is just incredibly foolish. Yes, he helps us anyway, but as a player, you are forced to behave like a brute towards him, instead of seizing the opportunity to make an enemy into a friend. Very disappointing, as is the wasted potential with him at the very end like others mentioned. In general, Square Enix tends to write out too many characters from the story. This is especially noticeable when you look at the Endwalker patches. The new characters there simply cannot compete with the old ones. 2.) Next point: Endgame. Unfortunately, as a casual player, there is nothing that keeps me engaged in the game. Islands are terribly boring and all look the same, so there's no reason to visit anyone. The marionettes cannot be replaced with customizable NPCs. In the end, there is no reason to stay on an island. 3.) Player Housing: Unfortunately, it still requires a permanent subscription, so I don't want to get one. The limited item capacity is also very annoying. 4.) Graphics: Not my cup of tea. It's supposed to be improved, but creatures like animals, etc., will still look very strange. 5.) Customization options for playable races: It's okay but could be better.. This is an epic conclusion for an epic game, i had the opportunity to play FFXIV since patch 2.1 and is perfect, lovely, the game works perfectly and the story is pure gold ( for an MMORPG standard) i highly recommend this game if you like this kind of videogames 10/10. This is honestly the very best MMO on the market. The story is not just amazing for an MMO... and not just the best story of any Final Fantasy (in my opinion at least).... Not just one of the best stories in all of gaming, no.... of ANY medium! The community is sooooooo friendly and welcoming! This game respects your time, you barely miss out on anything when you take a break. It's so worth to get into!. Wow, just wow. I did not know how they would top the previous expansion of Shadowbringers but they did. Story went way over the edge and gave the best laughs and crying so far. Another expansion I wish I could play all over again with no memory.. Came back to FFXIV after Blizzard Entertainment screwed-up the Diablo IV game with the new season 1 patch. Man, I must say, what a joy that is, and FFXIV is just a labour of love from the developers. It is not pay-to-win, and paying the subscription fee is so much better than paying every quarterly for battlepass to Blizzard Entertainment, only for them to dictate how you ought to play the game and steal hundreds of hours of your life while also **** you dry on cosmetics.. The games changed a lot. If you look at the reviews everyone is talking about one thing when praising it. Story and single player accessibility. That's fine, is this weren't an MMO. When I play an MMO I dont want 500 hours of cutscenes and dialogue. I dont want to watch 3 hours of cutscenes to then do 10 minutes of combat thats so easy I dont even need to play my class. So lets get into the actual gameplay, not the story, or how much of an anti MMO it is, but the actual game shall we? Classes mostly homogenized. They were actually fun in Reborn and Heavensword, but soon after they watered them all down and homogenized them. It feels like you are playing reskins of the other Tanks as a Tank with light flavor. Its terrible if you like unique design with player fantasy. Its too bad the one tank concept that is mirrored upon all Tanks is quite bland. In fact, they are all literally the same until you get to level 80+. Terrible, terrible pacing. Dungeons - Dungeons once upon a time felt like mini raids. They had hard modes, unique gear, one shot concepts, moving things in the world around to complete puzzles. You needed to chat and talk to each other, it was great. Now? They are made for zone to zone pulls. You walk in press a defensive and spam your AoE while everyone does the same. Great for efficiency or if you hate the group aspect of MMOs, but for people that actually enjoy learning with other people and not doing the same ""collect and AoE"" concepts, its really quite boring. Unfortunately for this game it seems to be full of people and catered to people who hate MMOs. Same as WoW has become. The genre is just kind of dead. In the end. If you hate MMOs and love single player MMOs this is the one for you! If you love generic design and braindead dungeon concepts buy this! If you like watching 3 hours of cutscenes to 10 minutes of gameplay BOY OH BOY are you in luck! If you hate playing games in general this games great. If you hate MMOs you will love it! bahh, what a sad genre this has become. Complete waste of its potential because MMOs became flooded with people who hate MMOs. Doesnt even make any sense.. What can I say? The music, the message, the Battle system, the colors (finally better and meaningful). I can't imagine a game so good that the only bad side is that you need to play a lot, from Realm Reborn until Endwalker, to understand the message and meaning, while enjoying an awesome game. It's an experience that I suggest to everyone.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An emotional end to the Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga, Endwalker marks the conclusion to a story ten years and more in the making. It wastes little time invoking the sentiment and meaning behind that within the story, the emotional beats all are hit, with the weight of time and it's passage behind every moment. The story of Endwalker itself is impressive for an MMO this old, one that I have loved since it's very beginnings despite the flaws I should add, but something about Endwalker just isn't right. While there is no doubt love, and quality in that affection when it came to development, it is plain to see that resources for the MMO are starting to thin. There is a lot of cut corners in Endwalker compared to most other expansions within the XIV, lacking features, entirely missing content, swathes of underdeveloped but highly teased landmasses and not to mention a somewhat lacking finale to a particular antagonist's story. I can't find myself blaming the game however, I think no amount of good writing would match the buildup of a decade's worth of storytelling, and now we're at the end of this particular thread I can't help but nitpick at the lesser details. All that was missed for features that weren't requested, all that is still left a mess despite so much time passing with which to fix it. I look toward the next expansion now, hoping that 7.0 will fix the glaring, aging issues that still permeat XIV. Endwalker was not the best of it's expansions, but it was a good one.. One of the best MMORPG's you can play, ever. Absolute must-play if you like Final Fantasy, as you could very easily go through 90% of the game solo even, not playing with a single other human player. Game serves the story to a T, and director Yoshi P has proven to Square Enix that this game needs not to have huge pushes for monetization in order for them to make millions. A rare instance in modern, AAA game design, and a director that actually cares about making a truly good game. It speaks for itself to make the continual dollars, unlike any gacha game and 90% of other MMORPG's available right now, as much as people would try and cope with the idea of this not being the reality, and that means a lot. This current expansion has proven to be the best thus far, and if you played this game some years ago, give this a go NOW.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Final Fantasy 14 is the best mmo I have ever played. It has a unique and great story with fantastic characters like Nero, Gaius, Aymeric, Haurchefant, Emet, Hermes, Zenos, Graha Tia, Venat, Estinien, Y'Sthola, Alphinaud, Thancred, and so many more. While I, like some others here, would like to see more about individual characters, overall it's really incredible how much character development they show us and how much we empathize with the NPCs. I haven't experienced anything like this in any other game. So really hats off. Player housing is just so much fun once you get a house. It could be a little easier to get a house, and players should really be allowed to place more objects in the houses. While there is already a lot, it could still be improved. I'm not really a fan of the graphics, though. While there are beautiful places, the world seems a bit too artificial to me. Customization options are pretty good, but there's always room for improvement. I don't find the playable races particularly exciting. I would like to see more diversity there. The epilogue has been rather boring so far, with uninteresting new characters. For some, it may not be bad and may serve as a relaxing break after the action-packed expansion Endwalker, though. Raids, etc. are also available, but I won't comment on them as they are more incidental to me. I can really recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a really good story and have fun with things like player housing and the like.. Final Fantasy 14 is by far the best MMORPG I have ever played. The story is simply fabulous and there have been numerous moments that have moved me to tears. While the story admittedly started a bit slow in ARR, it began to get really exciting towards the end with the fight against the Garleans and the Crystal Tower. Also, when the player character is accused of murder and has to flee, only to be taken in by our gracious friend Haurchefant and thereafter deal with the problems in Ishgard. The story just has so many fantastic moments and characters; Graha Tia, Haurchefant, Aymeric, Nero, Emet, Hermes, Cid, Zenos, Alphinaud, Estinien, Jullus, the list goes on. Even up to Endwalker, the story keeps getting better, even though it's already heart-wrenching in Heavensward. Sure, there are moments that I would have liked to be better. I've seen some criticize that Zenos should have more development and especially a continuation after Endwalker, and in that regard, I completely agree. But overall, this game has done a really excellent job so far. Especially compared to other MMORPGs, FF14 is simply unbeatable. With newer characters like Zero, I can't really do much yet, but I'm sure that things will be looking up in the next expansion, and I'm very curious to see where the journey will take us. In terms of story, definitely a 10 out of 10, and that's what's most important to me. Other areas, on the other hand, could use improvement. This includes graphics when it comes to nature, etc. There are indeed many modern customization options for characters, which also puts them ahead of other games, but even here, as others have criticized, there is room for improvement, especially when it comes to faces. Player housing is great and diverse but needs more spots and a better system for obtaining a house.. To me, this is THE best story in ffxiv. Heavensward was my favorite up until this point, but Endwalker takes the cake by a mile. I teared up quite a few times throughout the MSQ. It's such a nice send off to the story this far.. The story of Endwalker is one of the most beautifully written and emotionally impactful stories in any video game to date. The characters are well-developed, and their arcs are engaging and heart-wrenching. The stakes are high, and the narrative is both thrilling and deeply moving. The expansion offers a satisfying conclusion to the overarching story of Final Fantasy 14 while also setting up intriguing possibilities for the future. The player housing feature is also a lot of fun, as it allows players to create and decorate their own homes to their liking. However, it's worth noting that obtaining a house can be quite challenging, and it would be great if it were made more accessible to players. One minor disappointment in the story is the short-lived arc of Zenos. Just when things were starting to get interesting, it seems like he was removed from the story. It would have been great to see more of that character and his potential redemption arc. Hopefully, he'll return in the future to answer the many unanswered questions about his character. The island sanctuaries are a nice idea, but the animal NPCs could have been better designed, so collecting them isn't really fun for me. Also, the house collection on the island could have been more diverse. Despite these minor issues, Endwalker is a fantastic expansion that offers hours of engaging gameplay and a compelling story that will stay with you long after you've finished it.. I must say that the player housing system in Final Fantasy 14 is truly fantastic. The ability to own a home in the game and customize it to your liking is a great feature that adds a new level of immersion to the game. However, the process of obtaining a house can be quite difficult and limiting the number of placeable items can be frustrating. That being said, the overall housing system is well-designed and offers players a great way to express their creativity in the game. The storytelling in Final Fantasy 14 is also top-notch. The game's plot is complex and compelling, with a diverse cast of characters that are well-developed and memorable. The depth of the lore and the intricacies of the world-building are truly impressive. While the story arc of Zenos could have been longer, I still found it to be a satisfying conclusion to his character. Overall, the storytelling in Final Fantasy 14 is one of the game's strongest aspects, and it's what keeps me invested in the game. Another great aspect of Final Fantasy 14 is the community. The players in the game are generally friendly and helpful, and there is a strong sense of camaraderie among the player base. This makes the game much more enjoyable and creates a sense of community that is rare in other MMOs. The gear system in Final Fantasy 14 is also modern and well-designed. The gear progression feels rewarding, and there are plenty of options for players to customize their characters to their liking. It's great that the game is always updating with new gear sets and adding new ways to obtain them. While the graphics of Final Fantasy 14 are generally good, I do think that there are areas where improvement is needed. The animal and nature graphics could be more detailed and realistic, and the island sanctuary could use some improvement to make it more engaging. In conclusion, Final Fantasy 14 is a very good game due to its fantastic player housing system, deep storytelling, strong community, modern gear system, and overall immersive gameplay experience. While there are some areas where improvement is needed, the game's strengths far outweigh any shortcomings.. The only MMORPG with a great story and a passionate dev team that cares about player feedback and improving the game.. Simply the best MMORPG in history so far, a pride for the FF saga.] Story, senarios, character building (NPCS), content addition and much more all deserve 10/10.. Endwalker is an outstanding finale to the Hydaelyn/Zodiark saga that began in A Realm Reborn that has some of the most creative gameplay segments of this entire game, a story that not only lives up to the bar set by Shadowbringers, but actually surpasses it with an even more emotional, heartwarming, & gut-wrenching story about life, its meaning, suffering, despair, & joy, and great pacing for a story that actually was the result of two expansions combined into one. Endwalker has become my new gold standard for how to end a long-running story arc. Believe the hype around this game's story. It is well deserved!. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fourteenth game in the series. this expansion is breathtaking!. This game is the biggest waste of time and treats its players as if they have zero intelligence. The battle system is horrible and boring. Everyone says the game gets better at endgame but that’s after literally hundreds to a thousand hours. Not worth it Final Fantasy is irrelevant in 2023. Extremely bad launch with a rabid fanbase that will swallow anything Netcode is subpar by 2010 standards, let alone 2022, lack of antialiasing and just in general the jankiness of this game is abhorrent. After a year of playing I figure I'd toss a coin to my Witcher (YoshiP). Simply put a masterwork in story telling. Combat feels better than ever. There's an insane amount of content in this game (everything is Evergreen so even ARR stuff is still relevant). Community is pretty good (not as toxic as some MMOs but...still in the internet so...). Overall, the ShB/EW arc and content are probably my fave vidya experiences of all time.. I thought it would be impossible for FFXIV to top Shadowbringers. I was wrong. Endwalker was so impactful that as soon as I finished it I booted up my alt and started replaying from the beginning, so I could get the full impact of Endwalker again. Every time I hear Close in the Distance or fight The Endsinger or Zodiark, half of the battle is not crying.. This expansion alone would be a solid 8/10. For fans and players that have enjoyed this story from A Realm Reborn, it is easily a 10/10. The story of Final Fantasy XIV has been the best storytelling and one of the ","""Endwalker"" is the biggest story in the FFXIV series, following ""Shadowbringers"" the main story was really good overall, but far too much was skipped over . the post-patches are the main reason the score gets dragged down ."
185.Journey,"A fantastic adventure indie that is truly worth the money it costs. Fantastic desing and musics!. I think, that Roger Ebert was wrong, when he said that games cannot be art.. A PERFECT GAME. The music, the minimalist storytelling, the art and graphics, it all works so well. It's also just fun to play. This is the game I show all of my friends when we're high and I wanna blow their minds.. really short game but the feeling is amazing i didnt play a game lige this,this is verry different. just play asap. Journey is one of those games where you either see it as one of the most fulfilling and artistic games you’ve ever played, or as a piece of art you just can’t understand the hype around. Or maybe you’re like me, and have it as 8 of one and 2 of the other. Journey is indeed a beautiful game, where the environments you take are more important than the goal your are moving towards. There are multiple wonderful parts to this adventure, and I think it’s best to leave most of them to be discovered on your own. However, I am not in the camp of this being one of the greatest games ever made. While it is beautiful, it is also incredibly short. This means there is little attachment to the main character or the world. This, to me, is the games biggest flaw. It shows you this beautiful inactivate world with a character that is moving towards something, but does to little to actually invest you in the “journey” you are on. This isn’t to say it ruins the game, but could have easily pushed the game to an 11/10 if it was there. As it stands, Journey is still a game that makes a great play for a rainy afternoon or snowy **** can be a great way to take a step back, and enjoy a game, just for the act of playing it.. Journey was not only one of the most calming game experiences i've had, but it was also one of the most beautiful. The entire world was completely stunning, and each moment felt exactly what the game was trying to display. In terms of experiences, nothing is topping Journey. Highly reccomend.. This game was unreal! Pretty short , overall, but I think it’s the correct length. The music is incredible, and the simplicity of the gameplay is refreshing. Check this one out ASAP, if you haven’t already.. At the time of release, this was a near perfect game. Without an active and thriving community to cooperate with, it's just kinda okay.. Journey is a beautiful experience while playing it, my sole problem is simply its length, because 60 minutes of playtime is enough for a tech demo, but I somewhat expected more from a full release. I am not the kind of person to ramble on about video game lengths, I don't like those 200 hour grind fests and have absolutely no problem with something like Little Nightmares and its playtime of around 4 hours, but Journey is just too short. For a game with a title all about, well, journey, this just doesn't feel as grand as it should. There are beautiful moments in here that surpass almost everything other games have to offer, but once you really get into this sense of adventure, It's already over. Journey, while being able to give the player a few untouchable awesome gameplay sequences, is sadly a victim of its own hype, it is grand and awesome but as soon as you are willing to cheer it on and see where it all goes, you are already watching the credits. At a price tag of around $7 I can recommend it as a game worth experiencing, any more than that price would not have been worth it, at least for me.. This game has the most beautiful aesthetic, I love the vibrant deserts and the architecture within it. The drop-in-drop out anonymous multiplayer is incredible, and my first playthrough created a stronger connection with a stranger than most other games ever come close to.. It's quite fun with perfect length, except there's not much to connect to emotionally.. really beautiful game with an art style I absolutely love the gameplay isn't much to write home about but its more about the journey then the game play. Its the most beautiful couple of hours you can spend in gaming, made all the more beautiful if you are able to complete it with a companion. 100 hours put into this on the PS3, and another 40+ hours on the PS4 and PS5. Its video game perfection. Is crazy how a game this short, can deliver one of my favorite experiences in video game history, the visuals, art direction in this game are amazing, a must play if havent yet. played.. A journey, masterpiece.. An incredible experience with a gripping narrative that is told all throughout with your actions and a great soundtrack backing it.. Journey was interesting lightweight game for the ps3 console. Very climate graphic and music. I can't help but call this... Hmmm, game, painfully mediocre at least It isn't a revolutionary product of mastermind like Ico or Shadow of the Colossus It isn't a fascinating visual experience like Gris or any other later game. Moreover, the design feels very repetitive and boring. It isn't a marvelous gameplay-visual narrative game like The Unfinished Swan It isn't a genius and dramatic existential journey like Everybody's gone to the Rapture or What Remains of Edith Finch. It isn't a fun game like everything listed above. And, of course, showing the flow of lifetime through changing seasons is very innovative and deep. I guess it's completely fine for its average player though. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. I initially stayed away from this game. I didn't think I would be interest in this sandbox world filled with silence. I'm glade I decided to give this game a try. This game may be short but it has a massage to share. It's a journey to find the meaning of life, never ending life.. Journey is a magnificent and emotional experience that can rarely be found in downloadable games.. Walking simulator but its damn good edition. That's all i will say, every gamer needs to try this masterpiece!. Journey is the ultimate art game. The player controls a robed figure on a journey through a desert towards a distant mountain, which can be seen from the beginning. Gameplay is very limited, there are no puzzles to solve nor enemies to shoot, but the beauty of the game is its vistas and the experience of meeting random strangers online and marching forward together. It's possible to meet another random player from the beginning and finish the game together if they don't separate. Upon reaching the cold mountain traversal becomes more difficult and then the final act is an awesome combination of fantastical vistas and music, unmatched by any other game I've played since. This game lasts 3-4 hours, but you should do yourselves a favor and play this game even if it is rather short. It's quality that matters, not quantity.. I played it when it came out. do not seek criticism, and this caused that his art impressed me in addition to the feeling that this game gave me, feelings that make me remember that video games are not always games or fun, many times there is art in them. Story: 10 Gameplay: 10 Music: 10 Visuals: 9 Personal Score: 10 >>> A MASTER PIECE. Only few games can claim to be as contemplative and surprisingly deep. 'Journey' offers us a way to navigate through the story of a lost civilization. You will have to give sense to it by the mean of drawings and engravings. You embody a small and attractive character who has to face numerous challenges to reunite some mysterious pieces of puzzles. You will have to solve riddles in order to deal with strange mythologies. The game is graphically beautiful, with some marvelous lights effects and effects on the sand you walk on. You will cross the path of intriguing monstruous creatures that will make you feel tiny and helpless. The fact that you can play with online strangers is great. Together you can make your own journey and realize that you are not the only one playing this masterpiece. The soundtrack is amazing: often calm and chill but also grandiose. Let's embark for an epic, a moving and questionning journey.. Games like Flower or Abzu typically are boring to me but with Journey it was different. It has been a wonderful experience full of strong emotions, astounding visuals and music. Although you can easily beat it in one sitting (I recommend it), you'll definitely remember it for a long time.. The title doesn't lie, this game truly is an amazing Journey. It might not be focused on combat or difficulty, but it's a chill and gorgeous experience that'll have you on edge 'til the very end.. *Masterpiece* Unique game, can't be compared with any other. Amazing ambience, the emotion, the flow, the learning, etc... A special attention to the soundtrack, absolutly perfect and amazing. This game is an experience, not an entertainmentt.. Journey is a straight-forward game. The title tells it all. You are a being that journeys through a harsh desert. Some people could resume the gameplay to simply ""moving forward"" and label this as a walking simulator and on the surface, and it might be that, but it's also so much more. This is a ""show, not tell"" story at its best. Journey doesn't grab the player's hand and explain all the facts, Journey tells you a story with no words through symbolism and visual cues. If you're looking for a deep and magic adventure, you came to the right place. No other game will ever replicate the feeling of finishing Journey in a single sitting with a random player that doesn't even speak your language. The graphics haven't aged a day as well. Still looks as beautiful as it ever looked on release.. This game is a masterpiece, i simply love everything about it, from the visuals to the simple yet amazing cloth mechanic, not saying that's anything revolutionary, but it simply fits the game perfectly. I have made an account solely to rate this game a 10/10. Overall the reviews on this game are just random and its a really bad journey. Journey, is different. It is really impossible to describe this game. Because even I feel different every time I play. Even the multiplayer option makes this game great. It is a wonderful feeling to establish sincerity with people you do not know or talk and try to progress with them in this game. Does anyone like this game?I do not think so. But I recommend this game to everyone.. This is a short artistic game where the music and the visual beauty are the best. It took me almost 2 hours.. this is an android game, how do they rate it so high, beautiful? not much, game-play? holding up bottom forever, and it is just 3 hours long, i played 30 min and am done. Having been contracted by Sony to create three downloadable titles for their newly launched PlayStation Plus service, Thatgamecompany released Flow in 2006 and Flower In 2009. These games had some nice ideas but were essentially little more than tech demos. Despite its difficult development their third title is however something special indeed. Journey opens with a cloaked figure awakening in the desert, heading to the top of the nearest sand bank you are greeted by a mountain shining in the distance. Instinctively you know that's where you should be heading, your journey has begun... Other than a few simple puzzles Journey features very little traditional gameplay. Instead it is the visual and audio design, alongside the brilliantly implemented online multiplayer, that combine to make for a truly memorable (and at times even emotional) experience. At around two hours in length it doesn't take long to play through but Journey well and truly ends the debate as to whether or not video games can be considered an art form.. Legendary game, play it, this game changed my life for good, all I have for this game is LOVE.. This is a game like no other. It's very artistic and I would even say musical. It uses no language and no real guide but it somehow just works. I enjoyed it and would recommend it just because it's so different.. Journey is a unique experience in all senses, and one of the greatest indie video games ever made. i do not know if it deserves a perfect mark, but the sensation that remains when you finish it is definitely that of a flawless game. The artistic design is breathtaking and the different landscapes look incredible even on PS3. The music also fits quite well, and the vital message beneath is beautiful indeed. As many good pieces of art do, Journey suggests and evokes emotions. Concerning gameplay, there are also some secrets to replay the game, and, above all, you can play the whole game online. Regarding its supposed short length, I disagree with those saying that two hours is too little considering its price (I bought it when discounted, in any case). Journey lasts what it has to last, a short period of time; otherwise, the experience would not be the same. Playing it in just one session is precisely one of the best points, in my opinion. It makes no sense reviewing the game badly because of that. Journey is really worth playing.. Very cool idea **** and you have to play it online to enjoy the full experience because that's how the game was originally meant to be played. You will have a magical and fun journey that you will remember for a long time. Good music and art style and the idea of the game is whats makes it so unique from any other game.. Journey is by far the best game that I have ever played. Never before has a game given me such a strong emotional response and attachment than Journey has. The graphics and music are stunning, the game mechanics are fluid and fun (especially the flying aspect of the game). But more so than that, what really draws me back to Journey week after week is the fact that you make an emotional connection with other players. It is very relaxing to play Journey after a long work day, and to be able to help out or travel along with an anonymous companion. I've purchased triple A titles and spent close to $50 on other PS4 games before, but none of them captivated me as much as Journey did, and I still continue to play Journey even after a year of owning it.. I downloaded Journey for free on PSN and enjoyed it quite a bit. The game is very easy to complete, but the story keeps you wondering. A nice touch that you can meet other players along your journey. Personally, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game, but well worth a free download.. Didn't find any story here, and I wonder how could someone actually did. Yes, storytelling is an odd one, but the story itself as simple as it uninspired. It maybe not a big deal for the genre, but slow and stupid gameplay with kindergarned puzzles makes playing this 'game' a torture.. Awesome experience with an stuning art direction, scenary and soundtrack. A non-talking experience trough an immersive journey, finding random players who travel alongside you.. It has a unique gameplay, sadly short (about 2 or 3 hours) but definitely worth playing. online experience is nice too, although you can finish the game in offline mode.. A cinematic and awesome experience, Journey is simple yet spectacular. Its visual scenes combined with its soundtrack make for museum-like adventure that demands a virtual reality release. What makes Journey so unique beyond its artistic form is the social experiment you're placed in with each game. Walking alongside a fellow voyager, especially through an entire playthrough, creates an experience like no other you might have with a stranger. If this game was reduced to its bare basics to walk to the light and the game was over, it would be above average; however, add the element of online multiplayer along with the intense dramatics at varying points throughout the game and you have a masterpiece, one that elicits deep, real emotions and a search for the metaphorical meaning of what you have experienced in these two hours.. Are you are tired of gaming? Has your interest in gaming been dulled over time with the endless games that are just the same but in a different clothing? Or are you just plain fed up of all that DLC and penny pinching that is plaguing the industry these days? Then let me tell you, you need this game!. Beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay. You can make up your own mind about what the story means and what is the point of all of it. A short but wonderful experience.. that is a game whose mechanics are not to shoot everyone down. It's more a graphical experience than an actual game since the gameplay is not very sophisticated but very basic. It is a 3d platform with original mechanics, but the gameplay is not so fun as other platform games. It's good looking, magical, imaginative a little cryptic experience. very short, but with this gameplay you could not play it for hours, so it's just right in my opinion. maybe it should be a little more fun to play, it should be more interesting exploring such beautiful places, a little more sophisticated gameplay and eventually a little longer.. Tired of mowing down noobs, equipped with your arsenal of Mtn. Dew, Doritos, Turtle Beach headphones, and your epic gold PS3 controller? Want something to do all day other than invest yourself in the gripping tale of a man in the apocalypse while playing The Last of Us? No? Well, then, I don't care. Get off of that lazy bum of yours and go to the nearest game store and get this modern classic. I will say something before I begin: This is not a game. It is an experience. The graphics are phenomenal. Honestly some of the best ever seen. As for the story, it's incredibly vague, but pay close attention and you shall learn the secrets of thatgamecompany's masterpiece. Once you understand, you will feel the feels of a thousand feels. As for length, the game is only an hour or two, but every second is spent from exploring the beautiful desert sands of Journey to enduring the cold, harsh winter environments of the mountain. Everywhere you go is littered with beauty and originality. The feelings you will feel will range from fear to overwhelming joy. Oh? What's that? Did you just ask me where the guns are? There are none. No combat. No violence. No explosions. NOTHING. And it is BEAUTIFUL. As for the ending, it's kind of sad, but it turns out that it's just the closest thing to a modern ""congratulations"". But the thing is, at that point, you don't CARE. The journey is something every human must bear witness to. After all, it is about the journey, not the destination. As for the online, it's nice. I completely support the idea. Meeting somebody just like you: somebody clueless, who meets you like you meet him: Confused, unknowing, and a mind full of wonder. Definitely but this game. And I don't mean if you happen to see it somewhere. I mean get up right now and buy it. Nobody deserves to miss out. Oh, does this not sound appealing? Well, I'm sure you'd rather get back to your episode of Dora the Explorer. Fair enough. I shall keep you no longer.. It's pretty and the music is great, but my god is it boring. I actually fell asleep 20 minutes in the first play through. My online friends gushed about the online co-op mode, but everyone who joined my game would just run around randomly.. Tier 1 + Perfectly designed, paced, and conceived, and does not overstay its welcome + Visually stunning, with some creatively unmatched graphics solutions for its console generation + Fun drop-in co-op system with some aesthetically interesting ramifications ? In some aspects puts its form before its function in a way that some might not find engaging. I though it was only an introduction, but when i saw The End... What? It was fraud, I presume. Creators swindled out my money using good picture and music.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the single best ""non-game"" I've ever played. It truly is an experience and acts as a prime example of video games as art. I've never seen a game tackle the existential struggle so well.. A mysterious, spiritual and strange game. But a surprisingly enjoyable adventure. It is different than other games. It is if you are dreaming during your sleep. You find yourself in strange places. With strange carpets? papers? (I dont know what they are actually) that can help **** your journey continues towards somekind of special mountain. You dont really have enemies to fight and you cant really get killed.When I first started the game it looked a bit dull for the first 15 minutes, but travelling further it became better and better. And I have to say that the game is something special. It is (like said by others), at moments really a stunning audiovisual experience. This game leaves everything to your own interpretation. But it appears eventually to be a spriritual game where you try to find your path to devotion, God and heaven. The great sounds and visuals lead to a mysterious enjoyable atmosphere. The games drawbacks are its limited saving options (only autosave from your last adventure as far as I know ) and unfortunately limited content (about 2.5 hours). But it is still good value for money. A special game that is different than any other game you played in your lifetime. I give it a 85 score.. I bought this game on PS4 after hearing all the hype about it and because of that hype i am slightly frustrated with the game, but if i try and not think about how great people made it out to be i can accept it for what it is, the story i found quite boring and repetitive, its also quite short but in this case i was quite glad.. What an amazing audiovisual experience, what an incredibly talented developer! I suggest these guys should work with icelandic Band Sigur Ros, that would definitely make a great collaboration!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game doesn't want you to fight the enemy to dozens of you. The game is all he wants to do well, you should continue to progress. The graphics are really great. Experience has to be one of the games.. the game is the definition of the monomyth, the story is told without dialogue yet it gives out a clear understanding of the past culture of the desert. the graphics are beautifull ! the gameplay is simple and its main purpose is to travel and explore the world of the desert ruins while going all the way to the mountain. the soundtrack itslef is pretty amazing. its a game to relax and play with wonder and awe.. I was cautiously optimistic as I prepared to play Journey for the first time. There were so many glowing reviews by game journalists that I could not discount its quality, however I wasn't completely convinced of its greatness and so approached it with hope and a slight amount of pessimism. There have been many defining moments with video games that I've experienced in my life. The joy and wonder of discovering likes of Pac Man and Centipede in the arcade as a five-year-old. As I grew up and video games changed, my horizons opened up with the possibility for adventure in The Legend of Zelda on the NES. Super Mario Brothers, Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Doom and Half Life. Each of these represented major evolutional steps in video games. Exploration, adventure, 3D worlds, immersion, storytelling. I look back fondly on all of those experiences but in doing so realized that as the years have gone by these types of moments came with less frequency and impact. I love games such as Mario Galaxy, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim. I can appreciate the mind-blowing quality and depth of these games but they don't stack up to the experiences of my youth with, arguably, vastly inferior games. It only took a short time with Journey to come to the realization that I was experiencing something that I had been missing for many years. Chills ran down my spine. My pulse quickened. I was enthralled. It was not immediate but grew like a wave, building slowly and consistently until the wave broke in a crescendo that was moving and awe-inspiring that left me speechless and teary-eyed. I had not been affected like this in years and perhaps ever. Journey is an experience that is a privilege to partake in. It evokes a range of emotions from joy and wonder to fear and heartbreak. The visuals are a sight to behold. It is simple, but not simplistic. It will make you ponder life, friendship, love, loss and triumph. Journey deserves to be experienced.. What I have to say to this game if it was sentient **** YOU!"". That being said this game escapes me for words, I will damn try to though! First off story ... There you go! Ok but seriously the story is the best thing about this game and is the best way to tell a story and that is through silence, you are given only backstory of the event that have led up to the world but even then it's shown not told and it's up to you to interpret it in your own way, so for me: There was light that created life, soon little Sprites (as I want to call them) use the light to create and they made giant civilizations and striving for more light, when they reached to the Heavens though the light abandoned them an with no light the Sprites fought over what remained, soon war raged against one another the desert becoming a sea of graves thousands upon thousands laid to waste and soon nothing but silence remained, but then one day the light did come back and with it you were born, and now it's up to you to write what happens next. Everything else is up to you, this game from me get's high praises as something of a new piece of art since I am an artist (humble brag) able to convey emotions through music and visuals. That being said it should be played by people who think critically or are thinking about going into art, fun is something to be had here when you find a companion (they're random) to share in your experience creating a strange friendship with multiple stories to tell out of this. But again it's up to you since there is no definite story to this game and it' for you to interpret. Simply put: This game is up there with the best, and no I will not get off this emotional pain train.. This game was truly an amazing experience and the best PS Exclusive I have played to date. The length of the game did not bother me at all, I actually think its the perfect length for a game like this.. Though Flower evoked emotions through similar means of its visual and aural atmosphere, Thatgamecompany’s 2012 minimalist masterpiece Journey goes even further and although I immediately became emotionally invested as soon as the premiere of the E3 trailer years ago, I didn’t expect myself to cry at the end. It’s—in line with Thatgamecompany’s previous projects—not a conventional video game and it certainly acts more like an art project or cinematic experience than a gaming experience, however, there’s much, much more gameplay elements than we witnessed in Flower: the controls and camera are smooth—however, the inclusion of the motion control camera seems unnecessary and at its worst, distracting; it’s easy and has a duration of about 90 minutes if you play it straight through, but once you realize that every single cutscene, design, and overall detail is well warranted and the complete erasure of any filler, it’s definitely necessary and only makes the impact more well-deserved than it already is. And at last, it’s one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played—and I’m taking into account games like 2001’s Ico, 2005’s Shadow of the Colossus, 2006’s Ōkami, and many, many more. From the animation of the sand to the vibrant design of the creatures made of cloth, it’s a testament to just how visually stunning a video game can be, comparable to that of an art film. And the soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory, is couldn’t be any more **** fit, how it’s timed and how it syncs into every single moment like a puzzle piece, the Grammy nomination was obviously earned. It’s certainly not an experience everyone will find joyous, however, besides the emotional impact Journey left on me, I have revisited the game multiple times already—the multiplayer experience is a one-of-a-kind and just factors into the emotions, it’s one of the most rewarding co-op experiences I’ve ever witnessed. The Trophies are easily earned yet exciting to collect and once you collect your White Robe after earning the Transcendence Trophy, you’ll be jumping with joy if you’re anymore of a fan than I am. If I’m overrating Journey, it’s because of complete bias, but even outside of a personal experience, it’s not surprising how much acclaim it initially received and how much of a legacy it’s generated since its release. It’s also not surprising that it has its fair share of criticism, but it’s baron in comparison to the many, many positive factors implemented into the experience. It’s one of the shortest epics out there, but it’s damn sure one hell of a memorable one. Overall rating: 10 +Beautiful visuals +Beautiful soundtrack +Best co-op multiplayer experience in years +Excellent controls, camera, and no filler -Short -Motion control camera can be an annoyance. I don't even know what to say , i was just bored and decided to play this game , i didn't really know why i bought it but i ended up loving every single moment of it . This is one of the weirdest and yet best games , after i finished it i felt like i went through an amazing journey -as the title indicates-i suggest this to everyone , even hardcore gamers should try it and see what i'm talking about , i'm literally struggling to find a flaw on it because i don't like giving 10 as a score but i'll have to make an exception here !. I must say that I've reached the point in my life where I've become tired of slashing enemies, shooting things and people, Hollywood explosions, and pretty much just the gaming industry nowadays. I came to the point where I wanted a game that would make me reflect on my own life, my own human existence and purpose. Journey is the game that did just that. No there isn't particularly any hardcore action and fighting. This game reflects the hardships of life, the challenges we face so we reach our destination. At the end we see it's not the destination, but we look back at the journey to get there and how it shaped us. This game cleverly portrays itself as the journey of life, and I haven't felt as connected to a game like this for a long time. The game is short but worth the experience like others have said.. What the hell just happened, I've just been watching my boyfriend press 'UP' for 90 minutes, his finger hurt so I've been pressing up for him, why? Why is this game so lame that I've had to take time out of watching youtube seminars to relive his finger. This game is pointless the music is composed of midi crap and the whole thing is a lame stab at some art house peace of ****. The one truly unique gaming experience you will have this year. Buy it and play it as soon as you can. The game is stunningly beautiful and the score is a once in a lifetime experience. You will not regret this purchase -- unless you hate fun and happiness.... This was the first game I played on PS3 and I have to say, it's magnificent! Pros: Stunning Visuals Excellent Soundtrack Desert Slide Section Cons: Puzzle Elements are poorly implemented and are unnecessary Journey is a really compelling game that will go throug","i think, that Roger Ebert was wrong, when he said that games cannot be art . this is the game i show all of my friends when we're high and i wanna blow their minds . the music, minimalist storytelling, the art and graphics work so well ."
186.Conker's Bad Fur Day,"Now hold on to your colons and prepare to experience one of the craziest, dirtiest, most offensive 3-D platformers you've ever seen - and be ready to laugh your a** off every step of the way.. A spectacularly creative, wonderfully satisfying 3D action-platformer that -- ass joke and bloody messes encapsulated -- shines with Nintendo's very best.. This was my favorite game for a long time, it definetly has it's flaws gameplay wise, non-skipabble cutscenes, awful aiming in shooting sections, racing sections controls like ass,unfair hitboxes, and yet... This is a masterpiece, It;s probably one of the funniest games ever made, the characters and sections are memorable, awesome and (disgusting) boss battles, dark and mature themes that perfectly contrast the colorful world where Conker lives. I really doubt a game like this can be made again in this current generation and I love every minute of it. It's not perfect by any means but somehow it still deserves a 10/10 in my heart.. There&#146;s poo humor galore, but there&#146;s also sly satire, clever parody and deep belly-laughs aplenty. To say nothing of the challenging gameplay, engaging storyline and whacked-out characters.. You can't help shake the feeling that Rare threw offensive material into the game merely for the sake of offending. Once you get over your initial shock at so much swearing, you'll find a competent game with great humor hidden among all the fart jokes.. If you own an N64 and are of legal age, pick this game up immediately. It is the most fun I've ever had with a platform game, and it's also one of the most challenging.. ""We're mature!"" No, you're not. You're just a fun action/shooter/junior-high simulator. [Jan 2004, p.189]. Hilariously crude.. Even though kids shouldnt play this ,its very funny,I think its the best game of humor ive ever seen, and the first time I laugh at npcs cinematic.MUST PLAY. This is very solid. I don't think it's better than Banjo 1, or DK64, but it is still very good. The presentation of making it look family friendly is such a interesting idea and I feel they did it perfectly. My only complaint is A: The levels could have been a bit more focused. There are some levels that go all over the place and don't make sense for a level design. B: Conkers voice acting is weird and he's often too quiet.. Who doesn’t think a hammered wild little squirrel isn’t the cutest thing? This game is unique. The ideas put in are amazing but the execution is terrible in the technical department. Controls are a mess: Conker can’t walk , much less run, in a straight line. Platforming is a mess, targeting is a mess, swimming/diving is a mess. The camera issue: Oh my God!! That’s the worst of all the things that don’t deliver in this game. The music is great, lots of catchy tunes. Visuals are great considering the time this was created. Story is pretty funny and original. Some levels are extremely difficult and not well balanced. The controls already make everything challenging and frustrating. It’s a shame mechanics and execution **** because the other things are wonderful. Getting the controls and camera problems/issues aside, I had fun playing this game. Is worth playing at least once in your gaming life.. I really wanted to like this game, especially since I've only ever heard good things about it. Unfortunately, it's not good; it's extremely tedious and frustrating. The movement and controls are super clunky. It was an absolute chore to get through. Conker's Bad Fur Day is known for its raunchy toilet humor, which held up surprisingly well. I was expecting to be cringing at the humor more than laughing, considering the game is 20+ years old and humor can change so much over two decades, but I was pleasantly surprised. Some jokes still fell flat, though. Hands down, the highlight of the game is the sound design. There's so much attention to detail in the smallest things when it comes to audio, like how the buzzing bees in the first area start buzzing to the tune of the background music when you approach them and stop when you walk away. Not to mention the soundtrack on its own is an absolute banger, specifically the tracks ""Poo"" and ""Rock Solid."" 10/10 on the sound design. Sadly, the lows aren't worth suffering through in order to experience the game's highs, so I can't really recommend this to anyone.. Conker's Bad Fur Day is an excellent parody game. If you're not familiar with Conker, than you have the same knowledge that the current owners have with the series, in the fact that Mircosoft tried to advertise Conker to kids! Conker is very much not a kids game, and tries ever so hard to make you understand that in the very beginning with it's dark humor, foul language, and over sexed female **** that you understand the charm of Conker, the actual humor really just boils down to, do you like movie parodies, fart jokes, and/or gross out humor? And no, I'm not trying to suggest this humor is bad, it's just par the course. Conker, in a lot of ways, is just a game that knows what it is. Hell, the fact that you have humor ranging from singing piles of ****, bees **** flowers, and a broom that wants to commit suicide; should really tell all you need to know whether or not you'll enjoy this game. Humor is all this game really has going for **** Conker's Bad Fur Day, a bad game? Kinda? Like this game really tries to do a lot of things each and every level, but for the life of me the majority of these levels ****. For the most part, the beginning is fairly easy to start off, with basic platforming, simple puzzle solving, and humorous character interactions, but once you make it to the half way point this game becomes nothing, but annoying. From unresponsive controls, to ramped up difficulty, long stretches of no check points, and genre changes, Conker asks a lot out of the player, and with little reward or help in doing so. The Spooky level being a particularly bad offender as it has so many spikes of difficulty from start to finish that it makes anything past it seem easy. Largely Conker's gameplay starts out as a fun off the beat platformer, but largely you can't remember much aside from the frustration of the last few levels by the end of it.Would I consider Conker's Bad Fur Day a classic? Yes. Worthy of making a sequel? Absolutely. Fun to play? Hell no. Conker's Bad Fur Day is just a mess ****, with a lot of neat ideas held together by bad controls, difficulty spikes, and humor. While I certainly don't think Conker's Bad Fur Day is for everyone, it is an interesting piece of media, and one, I'm sure, opened the minds of unattended children.","a spectacularly creative, wonderfully satisfying 3D action-platformer shines with Nintendo's very best . if you own an N64 and are of legal age, pick this game up immediately . it's the most fun i've ever had with a platform game, and also one of the most challenging ."
187.Medal of Honor (1999),"Even though Gameplay is outdated, there is no denying that the technological evolution at the time was incredible. soldiers reacting to the shot in the limb in which they were hit, helmets flying as they were shot. This is incredible. We still have an excellent understanding of the war and what led us almost into it. excellent soundtrack. It's really worth it even today.. Incredible artificial intelligence for its time. enemy soldiers lying on the ground during the battle, rolling on the ground, throwing bombs back at you. It's an admirable game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game missions are interesting has a good vibe to the game that other games in the genre doesnt have if your into ww2 games this is must play in my opinion.. One of the best shooters for ps1 that I have played, the story I liked quite a lot with the oss and the gameplay I think is fantastic, I didn't like the infiltration missions so much but they are still good Without a doubt one of the best shooters. As I experienced World War indirectly, I learned the horrors of war And the historical evidence is well implemented. really amazing game, for 1999 the animations were great only the graphics are really horrible. One of the best games of the series hands down. The world was so captivating. It was very realistic for its age.. OVERALL - 91% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 10/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 8/10 I remember at the time of release this feeling like no other game. Even though it would obviously look and feel dated now, I remember feeling genuinely scared of the enemies and the missions being creative and shooting realistic. The sound effects are still great today. It felt you had been put straight into a real life history lesson and clearly inspired thousands of games.. Awesome WWII fps for its time, i used configNumber 5 to re-play this game it feels a bit strange at first compared to modern fps games but i got used to it quickly, and remember there's no checkpoint so if you die you have to play the whole level from the start. Overall it's a fun game if you don't rush and spray.. I will only say, we need a remake of this and underground exactly as it is in terms of originality for ps4. The most atmospheric fps of all time, with the greatest soundtrack as well.. Personally I really enjoyied the game, It has it all, nice graphics, one map different from the other, awesome music/ambientation and a really reallistic AI. The only issue I found was the controls, they are a bit sticky and not very comfortable to play after a few missions, but the rest it's more than ok. If you like FPS games this one will suit you very well since it is one of the best in it's type for PS1, Graphics: 9.0 / 10 Music: 9.0 / 10 Quality of Levels: 9.5 / 10 Gameplay: 7.0 / 10 Extras: 6.0 / 10 Final Score: 8.1 | * * * * * * * * |. One of the best FPS ever made in history of the video games, anybody who wants to play a classic and a excellent game of war... this is the game!. This game was a great start of a fantastic franchise I enjoyed all of the missions, the game was fair and the chapeters were unique.This game was ahead of its time although i'm mot big fan of the fps genre I truly loved this entry.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. medal of honor series was best shooter game when i was a child . i love it .. Mechanically one of the worst triple A shooters I've ever played. I also doubt it's just me playing now rather than on release as there were countless titles released by the point Medal of Honor came out that exceeded it in every way. The controls are clunky. Turning while moving reduces your speed, jumping is handled worse than any other game of its era + you need to get a run up to actually get over obstacles, and shooting is a mess. The game somewhat tries to replicate legacy 'Goldeneye' style controls despite playing on a controller with two analogue sticks, and removing the snap style of aiming, opting instead for a very slow standard aim method that you need to initiate with R2. The gunplay is equally bad. Comparing it against other console shooters of the time period, Medal of Honor is outdone by virtually every N64 shooter I've played, as well as the Rainbow Six Playstation game, which was in itself not very good to begin with. Due to the low draw distance, you can get shot by enemies you can't even see. Enemies AI is such that they don't react to gunfire within meters of them if they are not looking at you leading to comical situations where you can be engaged in a battle with one enemy and have another patrolling beside you. The levels feel completely on rails, which is not bad in itself, but miss an objective and it's either backtracking sometimes all the way to the start, or finish it up and have to redo it again. It feels incredibly obnoxious as this game carries the level design of a modern military shooter as opposed to a classic 'Doom-style' shooter with maze like design. There are also a few 'stealth' levels which involve you being disguised and having to show your papers to virtually everyone you meet while you kill people with a silenced pistol in a predetermined order. If you miss the paper presentation to any guard, even if you're not looking at them and walking to fast, the base goes on alert. They are a bit more open-ended and less linear than the combat levels, but sadly not any more fun to play. Last but not least, this game has numerous annoyances. I got shot through walls numerous times, I used a shotgun to insta-kill at medium range, despite a rifle taking two shots, even to the head, panzershrek wielding soldiers blew me up instantly from full health sending me back to the start of the level, enemies perform prefire animations lasting whole seconds, fail to shoot me in the back at point blank range and toss back virtually every grenade rendering them useless (there's no cooking available) unless I get a direct hit, instantly detonating it. They also die to their own grenade throws way more than mine. I feel the phrase 'hasn't aged well' is used more often than not to excuse the poor and overrated games of yesteryear. I cannot see this game being considered good in 1999. The sound design and orchestral score were good, yes, and the writing wasn't too bad, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the unpolished gameplay fails to reach anywhere near the same level as the other shooters on offer at the time, on both console and PC.. One of my favotites games ever. The story, missions, soundtrack - simply the best. Thanks to Mr.Spielberg and Dreamworks Interactive for a great game.. A true classic that paved the way for the future of FPS games. It's a shame that most games nowadays don't have the soul that the original Medal of Honor had.. still better than all the new cod games :) LOL the levels still hold up today, the multiplayer is ok and the soundtrack is one of the best ever made. I think that this series deserves a reboot and that reboot can be a HD version of this game.. This is the game that started a wonderful franchise of WW II shooters. With its great musical score and fluent gameplay, detailed environments and costumes and some funny voice acting (mainly from the dim-witted **** soldiers) Medal of Honor does an excellent job of making you feel like you are playing the main role in a WW II movie. When i recently played this game again the controls felt a bit weird and slow at first, but after some tinckering with the setup of the controller it was alright and felt as smooth as when i first played the game. The story mode of Medal of Honor is great, but the multi-player mode is also very entertaining. I spend many hours playing this game with my brother as a young man and we had a blast! I rate Medal of Honor 10 out of 10.. One of the best games i ever played .. well, we have here a rare gem! medal of honor was originally released back in 1999 for the sony playstation, developed by dreamworks interactive and published by EA, this game had alot going for it, after goldeneye on the n64, this is probably the first fps game many people played, but what do i think of this game? well that fact that the story was written by Steven Spielberg is an impressive feature, but the story is kinda ignored because of the gameplay, which brings me onto the next topic, the gameplay is right up there, very similar to goldeneye in a way, you pace through a level, shooting **** and completing objectives, this might not be a biggie today, but in 1999 it was incredible, and all on the playstation as well! the level design is excellent, although you will get those levels that you will hate, but there are loads of good ones, the physics are rock solid, they are almost realistic, **** throw grenades back to you, and shooting them in the head will make their helmets fly off, the level design is excellent, with **** bases and deserted villages to explore, search every corner!, the graphics are a joy, immersive and gritty, they capture **** bases or occupied villages perfectly, i have some criticisms though, the controls are not so great, the default controls involve, the left analog stick being used for moving and turning, but the controls can easily be changed to a more managable setup in the options menu, there is no minimap either, but because the levels are easy to navigate through, it is not needed, somtimes the objectives are a bit cliche, occasionally you will get the generic find the documents or plant the explosives objectives, but the gameplay doesn't involve just shooting ****, sometimes you will get an undercover mission that will involve disguising as a ****, complete with fake credentials that you will have to show to the guards, or get out your silenced pistol and just shoot them in the face, this adds some variety to the game, these gameplay elements along with stunning graphics and rock solid physics make medal of honor a must have for any playstation collection, you can easily get this game for under 5 dollars/pounds these days, it has aged brilliantly, you can shove call of duty ghosts or battlefield 4 up your ass, cos medal of honor 1999 is where its at!. The first Medal of Honor title doesn’t hold up well when played today but at the time it was certainly one of the better FPS titles available on the PSone.. Medal of Honor is the first title in the long-running Medal of Honor series of video games. It was released for the PlayStation in November 1999. The story was created by director/producer Steven Spielberg. In Medal of Honor, the player takes the role of the fictional Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson, a former C-47 Skytrain pilot in the Air Transport Command who was later recruited to the OSS. [2] The game takes place near the end of World War II, (mid 1944-mid 1945). The goal of the game is to complete objectives, such as destroying enemy positions, and kill enemy German forces in the process. The game also includes a split screen deathmatch mode, pitting two players against each other in various maps. Players can also unlock several secret characters after completing the game or through cheat codes, from notable historical figures such as Filipino patriot Jose Rizal, playwright William Shakespeare and even outlandish characters such as a German Shepherd dog and a velociraptor with a The Lost World: Jurassic Park design.. This game will always be in my mind what started my FPS gaming history, as well as ignited my love for WWII and gaming in general. For its time, the gameplay, graphics, controls, and probably most memorable: the art, narrator, and music, had no equal. In some ways, they still have no equal. Truly a classic. You cannot call yourself a FPS lover without going through the fires of war that is the original Medal of Honor.. It's incredible thinking this game was a PSX game. The graphics and gameplay were simply amazing for it's time. Probably the best entry in the franchise.","one of the best shooters for ps1 that i have played, the story I liked quite a lot with the oss and the gameplay I think is fantastic . the world was so captivating. it was very realistic for its age . i remember feeling like no other game at the time of release this feeling like no other ."
188.Rock Band 2,"I finally got the opportunity to sing ""Down With the Sickness"" by Disturbed. I have also played this game so much I forgot I own any other game aside from that.. Just as fun and addictive as ever (in 2023). Nice variety of songs over time and genres. Fun character creator and career mode. No way to view your high scores per song/difficulty without replaying each one to the end - a baffling exclusion that deters one from grinding for better ratings (which I liked doing in Guitar Hero 2). I've only played with the guitar controller so far. As a drummer, I fear it may feel wrong to play in drum mode since the music doesn't directly reflect what you play.. Taking the formula of Guitar Hero and adding the option for both vocals and drums to be played alongside the guitar Rock Band 2 makes no real effort to cater for the single player but does make for a great party game.. Song list that can only appeal to people who can nicely fit their musical taste in a predictable box and think they can gain substantial musical knowledge from having a subscription to the Rolling Stones magazine.. one of the best music games ive played thus far. has a great track list you can import all the songs from RB1 for just $5 and all the DLC songs you downloaded can be used as well . this is the ultimate party game to get together with your friends and play . the carear mode is very long and will keep you busy and unlike RB1 can be done solo of you feel like playing by your self now. the RB instramints still **** so use the guitar hero guitars if you have them or get one trust me they are so much better then RB's . the graphics still **** . looks like it belongs on the PS2 but graphics arnt as important in this kinda game but still they could have done a better job . the new challange mode is also nice addition .. Rock Band 2 has a large variety of genres on platform. The option of 2000 (At time of writing) songs ranging from Death Metal to Nerdcore to Funk to Rap to Trance. From Megadeth to Gun's n Roses to Snoop Dogg to Bob Marley. The option to import all the songs from Rock Band 1, Lego Rock Band and Green Day Rock Band allows users to keep on playing their songs on one disc and future editions of the game. World Tour bring a much longer and varied playthrough rather than Rock Band 1's play one song, next! play next song, NEXT!. Single users can play World Tour now. Realistic charts a.k.a single notes rather than a ensemble of three note chords. Weekly Download content announced every friday on **** Better graphics and colourschemes. (Have you seen the main menu tiger! D:) Rock Band Network allows even more songs for 360 users and soon to be PS3 and Wii Character Creator could do with a makeover. All you need to know is that I have been playing RB2 since the weekend it was released and it still holds my attention now. Best value for money gaming ever.",rock band 2 is a great party game to get together with your friends and play . has a large variety of genres ranging from death metal to Nerdcore to Funk to Rap to Trance . no way to view your high scores without replaying each one to the end .
189.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i think this game is great the dlc was wonderful and i love that they perfected this game BUT i think its over stayed we need new mario kart wii and ds were examples of mario kart at its peak this is really good but its over stayed its a wii u game that was updated and its the only mario kart on the switch that's not from the online emulators its been over a decade we have seen 2 open world zelda games, odyssey, new animal crossing, a new pikman, but no new mario karts. It's a good Mario Kart game but nothing compared to its predecessors. Going from something like Mario Kart Wii to this makes it feel quite bland and basic. It's still a really good experience, it has good tracks, and won't aggravate you as often as other games in the franchise.. Mario Kart formula got perfected. And there are so many remaked traks from other games. Really fun.. Amazing truely amzing such good gameplay never felt such a fun and energetic arcade racing game !. If you want to play a Mario Kart game and don't know what to choose, just do Mario Kart 8 Deluxe because it has tracks from past games and has so much stuff that you can't get bored with.. Its the best fun racing game that i ever played! music is awesome, tracks are awesome,also very nice that Nintendo released the booster course pack!. Gets REALLY fun once you start understanding how to do mini-turbos and take optimal lines.. yeah its cool to play with your little brother or your little cousin, i dont know its an family game. this is the game that you dont really think about and you say its mid but then everytime you play ityou have an AWSOME time AnD THE MUSIC SLAPS. The game is stunning in all aspects. there is plenty to do in single player, but I believe this game shines in co-op/multiplayer. When there are more people playing there is a certain feeling you can get from the game that You wish you could always feel. Giving it this mixed review because of the downgrade and how clunky the controls feel compared to its predecessor MK7. The expansion pass looks really nice especially with some notable titles like Waluigi Pinball and Coconut Mall and it can be fun with friends however i feel that the soul of Mariokart is diminishing compared to Mariokart DS where every character had their own allocated karts now its just random collabs might as well call it Nintendo Kart.. So effing addicting, I can't stop playing this game. It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!. An excellent racing game for Nintendo Switch users who want a family and friend fun filled time. A lighthearted and very good racing game for those who like competition and having fun with their family.. Pure fun. Nothing more to really say, its my favorite mario kart game. The drifting feels so nice and there are so many great maps.. It is ""just a port"" from the Wii U version, but with some nice additions. One of my Switch games, that i will always get back to. Especially with friends.. It gets pretty boring after a while. Plus, I think Nintendo got quite greedy with the booster packs and whatnot. Nevertheless it’s still ok.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. personally speaking, this is the king of party games. Mario Kart 8 is my first Mario Kart game, and I am so grateful for the amount of joy and pure fun it brings to me and the ones that I care. It has arguably the best map design for the same genre, and it is absolutely fun to play. Of course, one can get as skillful and competitive as one likes, which is again a common feature of all Nintendo games.. mario kart 8 wii u but better, which says a lot given that is already a 10.. Honestly this is by far the worst game I have ever come across. Default racing options are purely luck based and almost all maps are very poorly optimised, definitely never tested. Single player mode is deliberately set up in such a way that you have to keep retrying. I completely fail to understand how a functioning adult could enjoy this monstrosity.. What a great game. You'll spend hundreds of hours with this game alone and with your friends especially. With a great track selection (Expanded as well by the addition of the new courses DLC), solid driving mechanics and a good roster of characters this a game every Switch owner should have as their collection.. Best Racing game ever - CHANGE MY MIND This game is in the same vein as Smash Ultimate. Yes, it can be a great party game to play with friends, but 8 Deluxe in particular has an element of strategy and skill involved in it. This game additonally has 96 fantastic and gorgeous tracks to master. While in og 8 was lacking, the roster has been greatly improved and now has a pretty expansive and great cast of your favorite mario characters to choose and race with. My only problem is really the online. Not only do the servers ****, but the matchmaking does as well. I play primarly in 200cc, but often get put in 150cc or 100cc lobbies with players who **** and continue to pick the same tracks over and over again. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was my favourite game ever My favourite character is Wario and bowser Wario also funny has funny quote I eventually got Mario Kart 8 in Wii U and in my birthday I got Mario kart 8 deluxe I turned to 9 my present was 16 after I got booster coarse pass. Mario Kart 8 is a very solid entry in the franchise but I wouldn't consider it my favorite. MK8's best quality is definitely its variety. The base game has 48 courses. With the Booster Pass (which I would consider a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy the base game), the game has 96 tracks! There are very few tracks in the game that I would consider bad to play and the maps look very visually appealing as well. The game also has 40 playable characters (48 with the Booster Pass) who all have their own unique stats. You can also customize your kart's body, wheels, and glider, which further modify your stats. You can basically make any build you can imagine with the variety of characters and kart builds. So I do not feel that the quantity of maps and characters are at the cost of quality. What does drag this game down a bit is certain aspects of the gameplay. While the control is perfectly serviceable, you start running into problems if you aren't consistently in the front of the pack. Unlike in most games where your items are determined by placement, in this game they are determined by how far away you are from first. Not a bad idea on the surface, but you really come into problems if first place is a dominating force. When this happens, a majority of the racers are pulling out bullet bills, stars, and golden mushrooms like it's no tomorrow. I've even seen situations on online where first place was so far ahead that people as high up as 3rd place were getting golden mushrooms. You end up getting a situation that I feel like Syndrome from the Incredibles sums up best: ""When everyone is super, no one is."" You're trying to get to the front of the pack with golden mushrooms, but when everyone else is also golden mushrooms, you're just keeping at pace instead of boosting ahead in the rankings. This item system alone makes it a struggle to enjoy things when going up against a super good player. In a more balanced arrangement of players, the problem is still there, but not to nearly as bad of a degree. Also I will say that the inclusion of 200cc, while an interesting idea on paper, is horrible in execution. Only a few tracks like Excitebike Arena really actually benefit from 200cc while the vast majority of tracks suffer on it. As a whole, it's a solid inclusion to the franchise that definitely has plenty of characters and tracks to keep it interesting, but certain aspects hold it back from being rated higher.. The best Mario Kart game full stop. A must buy for anyone who owns a Switch. Great for all ages and skill levels.. Very fun racing game, the best on the console! The graphics are stunning for the switch and it runs at solid 60fps!. This game can become so easily addicting, whether it be playing alone, online or with a friend group. The graphics are absolutely phenomenal, and the controls are very smooth and allow for some very creative manoeuvres that can put you in the lead with enough practice. there is a wide ranged of customization and character selection, from The Legend of Zelda, to Splatoon to Animal Crossing. While the online servers can have some issues, they're relatively smooth and allow for gameplay that feels like there's someone playing with you offline. The item distribution feels a lot more balanced in comparison to previous instalments, giving people at a disadvantage the chance to come back from even the toughest of predicaments, while also giving players in the lead the possibility to defend themselves from attacks. Overall I love this this game and think it's second only to Mario Kart Wii, and highly think anyone with a Nintendo Switch should give it a try.. The best game ever to play with friends. And that's it, I am just stalling for minimum characters now.. Even though we should get a real sequel by now but this is really jam packed with all the good stuff that you ever wanted in a Mario Kart. The game is very good, but it seems that Nintendo is deliberately not revealing all the aspects of this opus (which is very regrettable). But the game is still fun to play on its own, with family or friends. I would still have liked to see more characters like Diddy Kong included in the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really goodgame for all ages. Doesn't get boring, really unique gameplay and visuals. I played Mario Kart on the SNES & N64 when I was a child and had a blast. I bought this thinking it would be something fun to play & relax. I got to 150cc and could not be bothered to put up with the ridiculous amount of b.s. that goes along with it. If I want to get stressed out & irritated by stupid crap then I'll go outside and interact with random idiots in real life. You people who play games like this competitively need to do something more constructive with your lives like planting trees or picking up garbage on the side of the road.. This is the best Mario Kart game of all time. The visuals are amazing, the driving is the best it's ever been, there's good rewards for driving good and being careful, and great punishment for driving reckless and tossing randomly. The kart combos are INCREDIBLY balanced, and any playstyle could work! Bagging, frontrunning, and so much more is fun because of the driving!. Very pretty, but the gameplay is much inferior to Mario Kart Wii. The races are monotonous. Mario Kart has never had a game this good since Mario Kart Wii. The graphics are sensationally mind-blowing and the controls are as smooth as butter. This game also fixed the issue Mario Kart 8 had with the battle mode, with there being not enough good battle tracks and there was only a Balloon Battle game mode, making it seem like it was rushed. What really makes this game a 10 are the DLC tracks, 48 of them to be exact, which really brings this already excellent title into God status. Solid 10/10.. Mario Kart 8 was already an amazing entry in the series, it is probs the best arcade racer to date, however it did have some issues, such as battle mode which MK8D aimed to fix by introducing new characters, new items and a revamped battle mode and it worked, throw in the DLC tracks it is simply the best arcade racer and not much comes close.. Favorite game on switch, and it's one I play the most. It's the best mario kart racer.. This game has great replay value. Lots of kart customizations, a variety of characters, and tracks ranging from easy to hard. The graphics are beautiful and mechanics are polished. One issue that I have are connectivity issues, frequently disconnecting during in the middle of the race.. I love this game although the spark has kind of gone out. I understand this is the definitive mariokart and will eventually go back to it but I cant say its better than Wii considering I just have gotten sick with all the mariokart I have played.. The best of its kind. No kart racing game comes even close to the perfection of Mario Kart 8. The graphics, the driving, and the online features, all serve to an amazing experience. Imagine a game being viable for 10 years and everyone's first choice in this genre. The game was made so well back then that even the new DLC maps and characters seem worse than the core game.. So fun. I love playing this with my sibling, it's a shame that you have to pay for more courses and characters though, but it doesn't matter, there's no problem with the original courses, they are all still fun to play, all that matters is to have fun. The definitive Mario Kart experience out there and everyone should've tried this game atleast.. It's an amazing game, I get to brag about how I got first place. It has cool powers up. Nothing wrong with it.. the ideal way to play mk8 deluxe is probably on a trip, like on a plane or bus. this was actually my first experience with this game, while i had the wii u mk8, i was overwhelmed with how good this experience was. but at the day it is still mario kart 8, im not good or bad at it, but it is reliably fun to play. i prefer smash, tho.. I wish the real Mario Kart for Nintendo Switch. Not a port Wii U.... But DLC is fine. This game is like the first time I ate ****. Only worth remembering when I’m drunk..

Basically pinnacle Mario Kart. Not the best at everything, but excellent still. Racing is as good as it was in 2014, but Battle mode is far better than on the Wii U.. A great and fun game for everyone. I 100% the game getting all kart parts and 3 stars on every cup. It was fun but a little grindy if you want the gold glider. The tracks are good, but they could have chosen better retro-tracks, the DLC solved the problem. There are a lot of characters but did we really need a row for the koopalings? The battle mode was improved a lot from the WII U version and even tho coin runners is not as good as renegade roundup it's still fun. The time trials on 200cc are pretty challenging, but easy on 150cc. The VS mode is perfect if you want to 1v1 someone or just chill and drive around the track grabbing coins with no one throwing items at you. The game is very balanced and the item distribution too. The online is actually pretty okay, with some lag here and there but not bad, still hate the fact that you can only chat with the NSO app. If you want to 100% the game, it can get a little grindy because of the coins, since you can only get 10 per race. Overall it's a really good game and a must-have for switch owners of every age.. The best kart racer ever made. Though the new tracks are better the game is still a must buy for anyone with a Nintendo switch. This is a great game for friends and family. Just a fun time and a great game.. Basic game - have been waiting more from it boring - i have play for 40 min and bored absolutely average game i dk whyit is so expensive and popular. A really fun racing game that I have enjoyed since the Wii U. I personally rarely dabble in online play but it functions well enough from my experience.. Really great game for the solo, couch multiplayer and the local wireless. Beautiful, good gameplay, and a lot of tracks with the DLC. The bad thing is the trial mode. Due to the nintendo politic, who want us to pay and pay… We are not able to transfert ghost without the nintendo online! Even between users on the same console, or in local wireless between two consoles (as with the nintendo DS). They are able to do that, but they just want us to pay. It’s really a pity, because even in the same family, when we are not able to play at the same time, the ghost system should be a great solution.. This game looks so much smoother then previous versions. Awesome game that can require a lot of skill and is plenty of fun with friends and family. Very frustrating at times but you never know when you are going to pull ahead into first place. The remake of old maps is cool and brings back memories but I'd rather see a bunch of new ones. Plentiful amount of items. 9/10. Great game. I loved the challenge of getting 3 stars in every grand prix. Also playing with friends is awesome of course.. THE BEST GAME EVER I'm a huge Nintendo fanI'm a huge Nintendo fan and the series of Mario Kart It fascinated me. Whi It isn't at the First Place. Mario Kart 8? Simply the best! Mario Kart 8 with DLC booster course pass? Even better! What else must be said?. The game is very good, its local and online multiplayer works very well, the textures are very polished. The battle mode is very good, the game has many options. Without a doubt the best game I have ever played.. The absolute worst once you hit 150cc plus. The game isn't even the same as the amazing 50 and 100cc. The AI model changes to attack the player instead of just going for first which completely bricks any enjoyment of the game. If anyone tells you it's a skill ****'s not. It's bad game design. If you win its 100% luck. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece and is by far the best Mario kart game of all time. The smooth controls great online play, competitive fan base, 4 player multiplayer, unlockables,. Fun game to play with all members of the family from toddlers to gramps they will all have a lot of fun. Thumbs up, thumbs down, it's not my favourite, but still, it's a pretty solid game in itself.. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best Mario Kart game by modern standards. It looks the best, has the best soundtrack, plays silky smooth, 96 courses all of which vary from decent to great (Wario Mountain being a standout). It’s peak Mario kart. The ability to hold two items heightens the party game bull**** elements, whilst the time trials allow you to appreciate the razor precise controls. The online even seems to work. This is the definitive Mario Kart (so far). It is jam packed with content and there’s almost no notes. Like Smash Ultimate, it feels like the series perfected. Like Smash Ultimate, the next step is to get experimental. Less content but more innovative ideas. But for now, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a near perfect game.. The ultimate multiplayer game on switch. Endless fun can be had here with all courses being exceptional in design, sadly though, the dlc courses do feel a bit low effort. Otherwise this is a incredible game of fun.. The definitive Mario Kart experience, and it gets still updated years after its first release (even if the new tracks from world tour appear easier and less inspired than the original game ones). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It has funky Kong so it is the best game known to man and we will always love it after 10 years. Simply amazing. The booster course pass doubles the amount of tracks in the game. Playing it online is definitely the way to play this game, as offline playing can become boring after a few hours.. Battle mode is the epitome of casual fun gaming.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really loved to play Mario Kart DS when I was a kid. After a long time I got a Switch and this game and I got to love Mario Kart again. It's kind of random at times, but the racing is pretty fun and with friends around you it can be a great time (or you're raging to moon and back).. pathetic game never playing again. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is one of those games by Nintendo that is the definition of ""blockbuster"". It is amazing, it is jaw-dropping and it is packed to the brim with content. Although this was a title on the Wii U, it's ability to have a low skill floor for new players to jump in and a high skill floor for seasoned professional players. This game feels tailored to everyone and everyone's skill level. A five year old to an 80 year old would have blast with this game because it is so easy to pick up and play but so hard to master when you see these crazy world record speed runs of tracks on YouTube. It is simply incredible!. Yeah boys once again another awesome game. It is pretty chill, for all skill levels, and more competitive players can learn many difficult techniques and shortcuts. With DLC the game gets even MORE tracks and characters. Takes quite the time to get bored.. I hate this game because once I start playing online, I really cannot stop. I keep telling myself ""just one more track"" and in the end, I often play 1-2 hours more. It's incredible how a racing game can reward skill and at the same time make it exciting when you're last place since you get higher chance of getting broken items that will greatly boost your speed or destroy all opponents at once. Smart item management is key to success in online play (but also in solo champion mode, which is quite challenging at 200cc). It never feels dull because you have to pay attention to so many details at any moment, and you know you might drop suddenly from 1st to 4th or 5th place during the rush in the final lap if otherwise not careful. In Mario Kart, the outcome is not decided until the very last second.. Beat game if you have friends. This game is so fun and cool and pristine! . . . . .. this game is great, but ever since the DLC its became even greater! the new characters in the dlc just made this game great, it also expands on base mario kart 8 on the wii u and just adds what that game should of had.. Same level than the mario kart of the nintendo ds. Ok the game is ok, but the controls are so clunky, so it is not the best but it's still good in its own right.. The best game on my opinion it has good graphics a lot of maps and characters :). My only real ""issues"" I have with the game is how many of the character selection slots are being taken up by basic reskins of other characters in the roster. Like Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, and eventually Peachette as of the announcement of wave 6. The other being the amount of, in my opinion, basic Tour maps their shoving into each of the cups. Overall though, this game is a blast to play with friends and even online if the repetitiveness of the races isn't a problem for you!. Best racing game of all time, hands down!. It's mario kart, everyone loves mario kart. This version has so many racers and courses, endless fun.. Second only to Minecraft, this here, this game, is the second best multiplayer game ever made. Buy it now.. A very fun game, it has a great variety of scenarios, Classics and new, to play with friends. Mario Kart 8 DX is, by far, the best MK game in the series so far. It's wide variety of retro and nitro tracks makes each one memorable in it's own way. Finding the fastest shortcuts is incredibly fun and working on time trials is one of the best parts of the game. Although there are several problems with the local multiplayer, it's one of the best games on the Switch for this. The only drawback is that the Online mode is filled with people playing with maximum combos and overly complicated tactics, but this can be overlooked as singleplayer is, in my opinion, the most fun way to play this game.. This game is a must play for anyone that buys a switch cuz it's the best Mario kart game by far. Theres not that much to really work for, and what there is barely does anything, once you've unlocked all the parts, you've pretty much seen it all. But it is a amazing game with plenty of replay value.. I like everything in this game! It is expensive BUT very fun. The DLC stages are cooler than the others, so I want them without the DLC.. I found this game a little overrated. Yes, it's fun, yes it's bright, but after a couple of races it gets boring.. This game is a masterpiece, nothing more needs to be said, this is best played online with friends. This game is crazy. It's an absolute must play and is always fun. Nintendo really nailed it with this one. The characters, tracks, and karts are all well made and exciting to use in gameplay.. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is fun to play with other people, but gets boring when on your own. The AI's seem to get items when they want to, and have as many as they want. That said, it is still a good game and is worth your money.. It might look expensive at first but sometimes becomes discounted a little. Worth the money in any case.. Easily one of the most fun games of all time. Still playing this game to this day and the DLC keeps making ti better. Definitely the most technically impressive and polished version of Mario Kart. Could've used some sort of single player content like DS.. An amazing game, and the dlc just makes it even better. Great for playing with family, friends and online.. People keep hitting me on the last lap they seem to have more items that hit me than anyone else. I recently purchased Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for my Nintendo Switch and I must say, it's an absolute blast to play! The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth and seamless. The selection of characters and tracks is impressive, giving players plenty of options to choose from. I especially love the addition of the new battle mode, which adds an extra layer of excitement to the game. Overall, I would give Mario Kart 8 Deluxe a solid 10 out of 10 and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging racing game.. + Chaotic fun in all the right places + Roster of tracks (new and retro!) is absolutely astounding + Graphics are delightful and just about as good-looking as it gets on the Switch + Dual-items mechanic makes its much-needed return + Racing and kart control is slick and feels great + Battle mode is vastly improved over its Wii U counterpart + 200CC is incredibly fun. Best mario kart game yet. Amazing courses and characters. Very fun and satisfying to play. The online works pretty well. Best racing game you can buy right now.. Must play. Controls are easy to learn, but there are a lot of advanced techniques, tricks and shortcuts that take a lot of practice to master. Make yourself a favor and watch a few world records of some tracks in Youtube so you can see what I'm talking about. Online is so addictive and funny and even today on July 2023 there are a lot of people playing. Tracks are well designed and some are quite challenging at high speeds. Battle mode can be hard to understand at first, but once you get it it's amazing. It takes time to unlock all of the vehicles, wheels and gliders so expect hours and hours of fun. You can also buy the DLC to unlock more tracks, I highly recommend doing it because they are also well designed and there are more tracks to come in the next months.. I could play this game every day honestly. I love Mario Kart, but Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best from the series and my favorite racing game of all time. Inject more racing games like this into my bloodstream Nintendo.. One of the most fun games ever and the best Mario Kart, love to play it online and with friends. Hate the blue shell though, why a power up that doesnt help the one who gets it and is only good for making the 1st place get 2nd, but thats not why it isnt a 10 haha just the one thing i dont like about the game. Love the stable 60 fps and wish Nintendo would pursue for it more times.. This game is the most rigged game I have ever seen!!! Never before have I been leading the entire race with a large gap and suddenly without any obstacles in my way I start getting hit by absolutely everything when I'm about 300 feet from the finish line to always end up in 3rd,4th or whatever! Makes me want to throw my vonroller right out the window. There's not much to say about it, at least being a casual Mario Kart Player. The mechanic is fun, and getting good at it is satisfying. To do that, you will need a good understanding of the environment around you and how powers should be used effectively. Also, the car's personalization can be matched with your gameplay style. Graphic-wise, the game is pretty good when docked. Also, the art direction is what makes the difference right here.. The game is cool, but it is not compatible with the game boy advance, and you can’t eat the game cartridge.. Following the booster DLC, this game is hands-down the best Mario Kart package ever released. Dozens of maps and characters make this casual kart racer ever more replayable.. What am I suppose to say here? It's a Mario Kart game, and a damn good one at that.. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is undoubtedly the finest kart racing game ever created. With its captivating gameplay, stunning visuals, and an abundance of content, this game truly redefines the genre and guarantees endless hours of fun for players of all ages. One of the standout features of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is its impeccable gameplay mechanics. The controls are incredibly smooth and responsive, allowing for precise handling and satisfying drifts around every corner. The combination of skill-based driving and the strategic use of power-ups creates an exhilarating experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout every race. The game's track design is a masterstroke of creativity. From iconic classics like Rainbow Road to exciting new circuits, each track is meticulously crafted with vibrant visuals, intricate details, and exhilarating twists and turns. The diversity of environments ensures that every race feels fresh and exciting, while the gravity-defying sections and anti-gravity mechanics add a whole new dimension to the gameplay, making it truly exhilarating. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's roster of characters is extensive and delightful. With beloved Nintendo characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser, as well as the inclusion of guest characters like Link from The Legend of Zelda and the Inklings from Splatoon, the game offers a wide range of options to suit every player's preference. Each character has their own unique attributes, encouraging experimentation and adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay. The game's multiplayer mode is where Mario Kart 8 Deluxe truly shines. Whether you're playing with friends locally or challenging opponents online, the intense races and fierce competition make for unforgettable gaming moments. The online matchmaking is smooth and lag-free, ensuring a seamless experience even in heated races with players from around the world. Furthermore, the amount of content packed into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is nothing short of astounding. With a staggering number of tracks, karts, characters, and customization options, the game offers an almost limitless variety of gameplay experiences. The addition of the expansive Battle mode, complete with unique arenas and thrilling game modes, provides even more opportunities for multiplayer fun. Visually, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a treat for the eyes. The game runs flawlessly on the Ninten",i think this game is great the dlc was wonderful and i love that they perfected it . but i think its over stayed we need new mario kart wii and ds were examples of mario kart at its peak . going from something like Mario Kart Wii to this makes it feel quite bland .
19.Uncharted 2: Among Thieves,"Certainly one of the best games oat. The graphics are great for a 2009 game. The characters are perfect the plot is interesting , the mechanics are amazing and the vibe is unmatched. A true masterpiece that is better than almost every modern game.. While I don’t believe it is the best Uncharted, this game is a MASTERPIECE. The combat and climbing, besides some leftover jank’ from the 1st installment, is an improvement in every conceivable way. The story, while still simple, is better than the 1st because of Lazaravich, and because the game is more of a “globe trotting adventure.” This game has a lot more action set pieces, and all of them are fire. While it still has some jank’, Among thieves is a MASTERPIECE. 9/10. most overrated game ever? its ok,id even say worst in trilogy,had good moments but had many more annoying ones. My goodness. I don't know where to start. As it comes to graphics; the game is stunning even after all these years later, plot is superb and of course story telling and actors are best of the kind. BUT as it comes to gameplay itself, I have a lot of complaints about this game. First of all number of foes is just disgusting. If I were to count how many times did I die because of this... I am primarly a PC gamer, but this game even on normal difficulty is just too hard and not fair in many cases. That's why it is an 8, not 10.. One of the best sequels of all time. An upgrade in every single way, significantly improved gameplay mechanics and physics, way better characters, decent puzzles, and a pretty interesting story. This game caught me off guard, not gonna lie, I expected it to be good but not THAT good, I had so much fun playing it to the point where I actually finished it in 1 day. The pacing is literally perfect, the game never gets boring, it's always firing on all cylinders from beginning to end. Definitely very impressive for its time, and it still feels great to play, it actually aged very well. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10. 9.6/10. Absolutely amazing. Hasn't aged well honestly but was mind blowing at the time.. Uncharted 2 was touted as a massive improvement over the first game, but I still found it lacking. The set pieces are bigger and the graphics are better, but the core issues remain, especially with the writing. Once again, characters miraculously appear exactly where they need to be, and the plot progresses through a series of unbelievable coincidences. The absurdity of stumbling upon hidden locations by pure luck without any real direction is just too much. It breaks immersion and makes the whole experience feel contrived. The gameplay is still overly linear, and the combat doesn't feel satisfying. While the characters start to show a bit more personality, it's not enough to overcome the glaring issues in storytelling. It's a step up from the first game, but not by much.. Increasing the scope of the original with higher stakes, new stealth-based mechanics, and more cinematic moments, Uncharted 2 earns its place for immersion, at the cost of all the flat characters.. my first ever game on a playstation system and what ignited my love for third person shooters and story driven games. super addicting multiplayer too. Uncharted 2 is a massive step up from the first game. The story is fantastic, brilliant acting from the cast. The in game banta is great and constantly had me laughing. The graphics also hold up quite well and the varied environments all look decent and stylized. Unfortunately the gameplay, both combat and climbing is mostly the same from the first game. For this reason I cant give it a 10. Look at a lot of reviews and they will say the same thing about uncharted 1s mechanics. The team took that feedback and didnt improve it at all. Nate will just take cover behind random things, jump to his death randomly or no shoot what you're aiming at. There is a ridiculous difficulty spike near the end too, I was playing on normal and suddenly in chapter 25 I'm getting insta-killed? It made the last couple of hours infuriating. AND AGAIN, WHY THE HELL ARE DODGE AND COVER THE SAME BUTTON. I do not see what the fuss is about its a very good upgrade from the first game regarding the gameplay and I found the ending very good but i dont think this game deserves all this fame its getting. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game brought us the train scene, for that reason alone this is the best game ever. Arguably the best Uncharted game. It has the best pacing by far, and it feels like the perfect action blockbuster with a nice light tone that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Lots of heart, likeable characters, a great time. The train level is iconic—really epic. Naughty dog knocks it out of the park.. Really bad game, don't play it Uncharted UnchartedUnchartedUnchartedUnchartedUnchartedUnchartedUncharted. Better than the first one, this game impressed me with the story, voice acting and interactive scenes, that were all total chaos and I loved it. Still, gotta point out the things that I didn't like as much such as the combat, which was really annoying, and the climbing didn't get much better since the previous one. I mean, those fights right near the end of the game were really a pain in the ass, but I enjoyed the game in general.. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, often regarded as one of the greatest videogame sequels of all time, and rightfully so; it manages to improve upon the first game in literally every single way possible, which is impressive. First of all, the gameplay is much better, the combat system feels more satisfying, and the platforming and the handling feel more precise. The gameplay loop still gets a bit repetitive after a while, but playing the game is fun all the way through. The story and the characters are much better too, and the dialogue and the humor as well. Visually, despite the outdated details, the graphics aged very well; the game looks quite gorgeous at times. Also, the set-pieces are simply amazing, they're much better than the set-pieces in the first game and arguably some of the best in the entire series. Other major improvements over the first game are the pacing of both the gameplay and the story, the weapon variety, the unique locations, and even the puzzles. It's just insane how much this game improves over the first game, seriously, the list goes on and on... Pros: + Fun gameplay + Interesting story + Great characters and nice humor + Awesome set-pieces + Improvements over the first game Cons: - Repetitive gameplay loop Narrative: 6/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Content: 8/10 Characters: 8/10 Music: ?/10 Graphics/Audio: ?/10 Final Rating: 9/10 - Amazing - Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a beyond perfect sequel and just a banger **** in general despite showing its age in few areas, and it's also arguably the best game in the series even to this day. Do I recommend it?: Absolutely, you can even start with this one if you don't plan on playing the first Uncharted game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite Uncharted and with my favorite story. The atmosphere of adventure that this game conveys is simply spectacular. Everything here gives you the feeling of being inside the story, not to mention the performances of our beloved Nolan North, Richard McGonagle, Emily Rose and others who do a great job too. Although the ending of Shambhala doesn't really please me, it's still great to see Nathan get into countless messes there. The graphics are beautiful to this day and have improved significantly from the first to this one, the soundtrack is incredible too and even though the third one has more iconic scenes for me, this one has the most eye-catching atmosphere of all, even more so than the 4th.. Most overrated game of all time doesnt deserve its rating but the ending was decent. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily the best Uncharted game of all time to this day!! Nailed great story, great setting it was in & great character development. Good game! This game has improved on its prequel in every way. The story is perfect and because the main characters are so well written, you can forgive them for having a massive kill count. Way too little of Sully though.. I am a huge fan of the 4th installment, but 2 is an absolute masterpiece. the vast variety of location and incredible story is just wowing. Good story but mid combat the villains good and story is best in the franchise but thegunplay isn’t that great. Uncharted 2 shows what an interactive Indiana Jones movie should look like. Great visuals, gripping situations and nice story moments create a decent action game to remember.. A perfect game. Encompasses the golden age of the PS3 era with picture perfect graphics at the moment and ditches to games like The Legend of Zelda and Resident Evil 4 which released the previous year.. This is by far better than Uncharted 1. If you played the first uncharted game and didn't like it, I understand, Uncharted 1 ****. But Uncharted 2 is SO MUCH BETTER than 1. Please, do yourself a favor and go buy it and play it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Overrated. Didn't care for the setting, dialogue was cringe, villain too. But, overall the story was fine. It wasn't bad but gameplay was boring. So much climbing in this series. Could have been much better without.. Ah, the old days, I just finished it, I recommend you to play the whole series, try it, you won't regret it.. Such a great sequel. It is like they took everything from the first one and just made it better.. A million times better than the original .. One of the weaker Uncharted games in the series, action sequences are portrayed better in its predecessors. Main villain was undoubtedly one of the best in the series, very intimidating and a very creative final boss fight. Overall, it is a decent game in itself, but Uncharted 3 and 4 are much better.. Still believe this is the best Uncharted game out of all. It was the game that opened my eyes about gaming. The story is catchy and funny, action is exciting. Character interactions are way more dynamic. Level designs and gun shooting were massively improved. The art direction is top-notch. Everything about this game is what an action-adventure fan can ask for.. Couldn't get through the first 3 hours the game too boring slept through the first hour, and the plot was too dragged, why do you need 5 games for a thief that only lives by luck. the game is so good , but some parts of the game is too hard for no reason (train missions for example) , and since I am against the policy of console platform exclusive games and I played the game on garbage rpcs3 in my PC and I had bad performance and quality (720p 30fps average) I can't give the game more than 7/10, I gave ""Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception"" 8/10 because I played the game at 4k with 45fps average and that was the much better experience. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really good game with really good story. The mechanics and story are good. This was the first Uncharted game I played. I'd give it an 89-92%.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brilliant, amazing and full of action. This game will take you to places you have never been before. A great game held back by some very frustrating controls and a poorly designed final boss fight. Thankfully the forgiving checkpoint system saves a lot of the irritation that comes from the character not responding correctly a sizable portion of the time... and falling to their death or being blown up repeatedly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A more stylish, fleshed out version than its predecessor. A story that offers more depth and in game mechanics that are certainly smoother.. I still remember this being revolutionary for that ps3 generation. Every gaming studio need take notes from naughty dog, they are indeed the Kings in this department ""story driven games"". Among thieves was the greatest game I have ever played until tlou, so it still holds a place in my heart. A Masterpiece by all counts.. Best action game **** good, naughty dog's **** so iconic.Perfect storytelling. 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. The game generally runs much smoother than the first entry, which is greatly appreciated. The graphics are also much better without overheating my PS3. The plot is still really padded, though, and some of the 'walky talky' segments wear thin quickly. The gunplay is generally not much better than the first game, which for a game that's part platformer, part third person shooter, that's a problem. Also, the platforming being overly scripted and 'clingy' doesn't help. I never got into these games when they were new because they seemed incredibly superficial and can see now why that this game (or series, really) didn't deserve a second chance.. Story is typical treasure hunter stories but what is bad about that? Really cool also characters and plot of finding Shambala. Graphics are really cool and multiplayer was well made. I mostly enjoying random attacks from helicopter. But what makes me dissapointed is gameplay. I prefer if game have less violence in this case. Im not some moralist but in this case gameplay is one shooting and killing spree instead of adventure. Other thing was it feels like corridor game sometimes with one forced way. In some games you dont have feel even its not open world but there I had that feeling. So thats why I rate this game 8 and not 10.. Ancharted 2 is a wonderful game, I completed it for the first time at the age of 11 and I’m replaying it to this day, I recommend immersing yourself in the story of Nathan Drake, an incredible plot and excellent combat awaits you, I advise you to go through the remastered version on PS4 or PS5. HOLY CRAP NON-FRICKIN-STOP ACTION FROM HEAD TO TOE AND THE FRICKIN TRAIN SEQUENCE AHHHHH. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its not the best uncaharted like most people say, but still a great game.. This was the peak of the action adventure genre in it's time. At that point in history, Naughty Dog's magnum opus.. The best Uncharted Game, and one of my all time favorites. Please please please play Uncharted 2, you won't regret it I promise. The best game in the original trilogy! I've spent years in the legendary multiplayer! Loved everything about this game! To me it is the greatest PS3 game of all time.. Absolutely love this game, played it at least 3 times, truly a top tier game. Pretty good!. Not my style of game. Gameplay is simplified and the characters are a bit annoying. Visuals are stunning though, best graphics on the PS3 at the time.. One of the most overrated games on playstation. A plot that is based on clichés and stereotyped characters. Advise against. An all around improvement to Uncharted 1, better set pieces, more colorful and detailed, better shooting, story and pacing. There are some bad things I don't see a lot of people talking about though, the game is kinda glitchy (at least the Nathan Drake collection version) the end portion is kind of weak, and the final boss in the hardest difficulty is absolutely god-awful, he is so unfair and frustrating that it just makes you want to stop playing and just watch the final cutscene on YouTube. I only managed to beat him because I accidentally glitched into a wall where I could shoot him, but he couldn't hit me (happened twice, but I accidentally glitched back in and died the first time) Overall, a very good game, and a great sequel 7.5/10. A perfect game and is one of the best sequels ever with great story characters and action scenes. One of the best adventure games. With one of the best protagonists. Copy and it's worse than Tomb raider. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fortune hunter Nathan Drake returns in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, a third-person action-adventure/shooter created by award-winning developer Naughty Dog. Down on his luck, Drake is lured back into the treacherous world of thieves and mercenary treasure-seekers he had sought to leave behind. When a mysterious artifact propels Drake on an expedition to find the legendary Himalayan valley of Shambhala, he finds himself embroiled in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse against a fugitive war criminal who’s after more than just the fabled riches of the lost city. Caught in a web of deception and plunged into an increasingly deadly pursuit that tests the limits of his endurance, Drake will be forced to risk everything - but has his luck finally run out? [SCEA]. I played the Remastered version of Among Thieves as part of the Nathan Drake Collection on PS4. I enjoyed the first one but Uncharted 2 is an improvement on it in every way. It’s still got the fun Indiana Jones adventure style, witty dialogue, interesting characters and engaging gameplay but has much better graphics (even for a remastered game that is over a decade old, this ice canyons in the Himalayas were absolutely gorgeous even now), varied locations and loses some of the more annoying game mechanics. Highly recommend it and looking forward to playing the next one!. Even till this day I can not find anything wrong with this game. Gameplay, story, characters. It SO damn exciting.. perceft game nathan drake amazing handsome sully is godfather thank you naughty dog. Graphics: 6/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 7/10; Atmosphere: 6/10; Music: 7/10; Summary rating: 7/10. This game is a pure masterpiece, this game starts in one world and ends in another world and it's great how well this game has played with our minds that when we reach Shambahala we can't really believe that a robbery in Istanbul and those abandoned houses in Borneo were all the same game. The gameplay of the game was really great, you can't really describe how fun and enjoyable this game is, especially Borneo, where the beauty of the gameplay reaches its peak. Personally, I am more interested in the gameplay of the last of us, but this game also has a really beautiful gameplay. The story of the game was also really enjoyable, mostly because of the feel of the game, Nathan has a really interesting character in the beginning, he secretly has a relationship with Chloe and has sex with her while Chloe has a boyfriend, and In one of the museums in Istanbul, he kills his guards to steal one of the statues there... At the beginning, Nathan has all the characteristics of a bad boy, and Nathan's character in this game is really great, the story of the game is really pleasant, this adventure is for Finding Shambhala is really beautiful. I can really say that Naughty Dog is a true god in the world of video games and has never made a game less than a masterpiece.. Still one of the best games I’ve ever played. Great story, great voiceovers, although very linear. The fussy controls cause you to plummet to your momentary demise about 120 times but it still doesn’t overshadow an epic game.. one of the best openings in video game history, uncharted 2 is such a thrilling experience, gameplay is perfect as usual as expected from naughty dog.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Such a wonderful Story Game top graphics excellent Story and fun mechanics the Characters are loveable and greatly writting the Boss Fights and Level Design are excellent Just a great Game. This game is real goat **** After all this years I can play this goat Story is masterpiece. Nathan Drake shoots, leaps and quips around the globe in another Lara-beating action adventure. Not much different from the first game, but that's no bad thing.. I love the game for its climbing mechanics that are very good and search for treasures, it has a lot of action and adventure and a very interesting story, I recommend that you play it since it is a good game. What is the appeal? I just see a bunch of cliché stereotypes quipping for a MacGuffin. Oh and the gameplay is mediocre. All you do in this game is climb ledges then shoot with pea shooters against bullet sponges. But the graphics are nice. Enjoy that because you know that's all that secretly matters. Well at least there is much excitement to be had anyway in certain set pieces.. I believe it's not necessary do a review. It's a masterpiece. Anyway, it seems to be that the characters are more sensible and I may have noticed more. A point to remark is the stages, above all you have arrived in Tibet and Shambala. These seights are beautiful the same as the end.. The game is an evolution of the first in every way. The graphics look better, the snow effects on clothing were ahead of their time, parkour is faster, there are more weapons in reference to the first game. The landscapes are beautiful and the plot, if not super dense, is not silly. The pace of the game is good and keeps you hooked from start to finish. As a negative point, I only leave that the game is sometimes treacherous in terms of jumping on platforms, and the difficulty seemed higher than ""normal"" even when you are playing in ""normal"" difficulty. Very great game Nice graphics physics and everything is nice Do recommend And really good storylin. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. I played the remaster on ps4 Great game. Even in 2023! Has literally everything in it!. Very good game. Nice gameplay - nice beginning with the train. Everything balanced. Very nice emotional tension among the game. The history is a huge improvement from the first one and will have you hook to it all the game, the new characters are as lovable as the OG ones and makes you want to know more about them.. Huge evolution from the previous game. This sequence got better in almost every sense. Gameplay-wise, it just feels more responsible now - even with the slow sensitivity and aim acceleration problems. Playing this in a DualShock is still painful but pretty doable. The guns are varied and stronger, and so are the enemies, but at least it feels a little fairer now. Scenarios are not repetitive as the last one and the climbing - even being ""fake"", is better since is more cinematic. The story is cool. The dialog and characters overall got even better, as the cutscenes. Level design feels challenging - in a good and bad way -, there are good sequences of action, and the train one was pretty good. On the other hand, this game didn't age that well for one specific element: the script. The way Uncharted 2 relies on that is kinda cringe sometimes. A good example is the boss fight on the train. I shoot the guy 100 times - I'm not even exaggerating - and threw grenades at him and he just refused to die cuz the only way to really kill him was face to face. To be clear, he was kinda unprotected, with his arms exposed. Like, how idiot do you have to be to think that gameplay section was ok? Another thing that I definitively don't recommend you is to play this game in the higher difficulties. Man, this game is casual in so many ways, but not in how hard can it be. Why? Cuz is unfair. The enemies don't have a good AI, but they will try to hit you behind the walls you are covered with - even if they don't actually see you. They will throw a lot of grenades and let you with critical HP in like... 1 second - when the time required to auto-heal is absolutely insane. The worst part of it is that the game forces you to play it like they want. The variety of gameplay here is minimal, and that's why this game is hard. The final boss is a great example of how Naughty Dog is bad at doing those things at that moment. It's so boring and random that oh my god. It was a good game afterall and I do recommend it. But yeah, there are some red flags about it.. Absolutely spectacular. The 2nd best uncharted game. The gameplay is still incredibly fun to this day.. In my opinion the best Uncharted game. I rank this as my second favorite game ever. Please play it!!. Pure masterclass. Naughtydog at their prime. I can't say which Uncharted I like the most, but they are all stellar 10/10. Amazing game. Naughty dog never disappoints, highly recommended if you enjoy adventurous and fun gameplay.. The game speaks for itself. Words can't describe the rush that I got when I played this game for the first time. Loveable characters, exhilirating story, the best villain in the whole series (in my opinion), and much more! If u still haven't given this game a try, you're missing out on one of the greatest games ever. enjoyable game to play over and over again just because of the fluid stealth combat. UNCHARTED 2: Among Thieves is one of the best games on the PS3 that is EXACTLY perfect! However, I can't give it a 10 because the story is certainly cooler, but I wish the characters were revealed and why they showed up here and are hunting for treasure, and I understand that Uncharted is about gameplay, but like Naughty Dog showed in Drake's Deception they know how to bring out the characters. So 9.5/10.. Naughty Dog manages to make one of the greatest sequels of all time with improved cinematics, graphics, combat, action sequences, even climbing and overall movement. Combined with better characters and story, Uncharted remains an amazing series.. This is SO MUCH of a beautiful experience it’s hard to talk about it without mentioning it or mentioning the PS3 without it. This game is simply amazing. The gameplay, the story, and setting is ON PAR to perfection. 100% masterpiece because THIS truly made the PS3 beat the Xbox 360 IN TERMS OF SALES.. Decently fun 3rd person shooter with a handful of exciting set pieces. The gameplay is basic and serviceable, mostly supported by the quality shooting galleries and set pieces. Characters are very charming. Biggest criticisms is the tedious and drawn out climbing sequences and the plot which boils down to Drake goes to x place reads a scroll/statute/tablet/journal ect that says go to other place where he will once again read a scroll/statue/tablet/journal ect.. The gameplay is generic, but the setpieces are great and improve this game a lot. Everything is better than in the first game, but it´s nothing crazy. Good fun and the tone excuses a lot of the stupid stuff.. The best players need top Minecraft servers. And there are loads of good Minecraft servers out there, A LOT! However, we’ve filtered out the cream from them. From PvP to Battle Royale and even RPG, the best Minecraft servers house separate multiplayer worlds with their own rules and gaming styles. ****/author/su/. this is the best game this gen i have just beat the games and it's amazing it was about 14 hours for me i really take my time to find all the tres i def say get this game if you have a ps3 if you dont get a ps3 and get this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing action game. Great gameplay, visuals, characters. This is the best uncharted game. Uncharted 2 is one of best games which I ever played and I think that everybody who has console to play it, should has this game in his/her collection.. Like its predecessor, it doesn't do anything particularly well: shooting remains basic although maps are now much more interestingly structured, adventuring segments are still mechanically poor, puzzles terrible and the narrative merely decent. What makes Among Thieves so decisively better is the way in which its multiple elements efficiently blend together to create exciting set-pieces challenging the player to move and fight in highly dynamic scenarios, with shifting environments and moving hazards.. Love this game. It has amazing graphics, soundtrack, story, characters, and gameplay. There's also plenty of medals you can get for achieving certain things which can keep you coming back for more. This really was Naughty Dog's magnum opus until The Last of Us came out.. Great sory, characters, pacing, score and combat. Probably the best PS3 game ever made. Crazy replayable.. The best Ps3 game I have ever played. Uncharted/Naughty Dog was the reason you would buy a PlayStation 3. The voice acting was great. The story was better. Above all the action was so mind-blowing it felt like you were in a movie actually doing the stunts with the people. This game is the best.. Being my favourite game of all time. The game that got me taking gaming seriously. This rating is a little biased. But at the same time, this game has the power to get people into gaming in general. That’s insane. If you don’t play games but like film, this can get you into gaming hardcore.. Fun game with a great story and fantastic characters. The main villain was pretty bland but it is an older game so complex villains didn't really exist.. After I finished boring first ""Uncharted"" second part turned out to be much better.""Uncharted 2"" is much more dynamic, movement of character and parkour has flow, previously Nathan Drake had unnatural and clumsy movements. Plot has unforgettable moments so far I still remember chapter with hanging train. It's my favorite part of ps3 trilogy.. The Uncharted series is probably my favourite game series of all time. Many people say, that ,,Among thieves´´is the best Uncharted game. I, personally prefer Uncharted 3 and 4 but the game is incredibly great anyways. The story is typically Uncharted like, so it´s great and fun.. It's really the best PS3 game It's really the best PS3 game It's really the best PS3 game It's really the best PS3 game. This is the golden age of Naughty Dog. The Tibetan temple is one of the most beautifully designed sections in a game I have ever enjoyed.. It's an awesome video game and also the greatest part of the uncharted collection. It has great characters, interesting story and really nice puzzles and the best point at this game is, it really feels like an action-movie.. The Uncharted 2 is one of the best game with gameplay machines and controls along with the story. When it comes to the pacing, action and adventure, this is the best game out there. Pretty good, probably the best in the Uncharted series and definitely an improvement over Drakes Fortune. A much better version of the first game with better combat and story, although it spams too much enemies towards the end it is still a great game.. What can I say this is basically Indiana jones the video game. A genuinely great linear adventure game. The characters are unique, and the voice actors do a phenomenal job. Gameplay is simple and fun. Also, the ending was the best in the series with a great final boss fight. All of this combines to make the best Uncharted game in my opinion.. NAUGHTY DOG is taking firm steps towards becoming the best company of today and in the future, this game is just as perfect as other games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic adventure. Spontaneous interactions between the characters made the game extremely realistic and made me feel like I was inside the game. Gameplay, story, presentation of the story, level design, everything is amazing.. Okay baby baby mommy baby baby princess baby baby mommy baby baby princess baby baby mommy baby baby princess baby baby mommy baby bab. A must played game, stunning graphics, great characters and a great sequel one of the best in a series. Difficulty is not extremely and gun play is smooth as well as platforming between obstacles. Please play this game and the series if you haven’t yet.. Uncharted 2 improves on the original in every manner possible. It even adds in great multiplayer.. This is the DEFINITION of a uncharted game. If you want to get a feel of what to expect from the series play. this. one. It's incredible, it holds up for it's time and the characters are as charming as usual just as the last game and this game in general just does everything better than it's predecessor. If you loved the first uncharted game you'll have a ball with this one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story: 7/10 Gameplay: ","Among thieves is a masterpiece that is better than almost every modern game . as it comes to graphics, the game is stunning even after all these years later . but as it comes to gameplay itself, i have a lot of complaints about this game ."
190.The ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Collection,"Two of the most beautiful and touching games of all time on one disc making the collection have some of the greatest value out there if you want toexperience these old titles in their best form.. If these games are considered art, then I'm sorry to say that our version of art is boring, hard to experience, and kind of annoying. Not to mention pretty sexist.. This is a team ico masterpiece would recommend to anybody with a playstation.. Absolute boring trash both games. I rather play with sand instead of this garbage. Both of these titles I have such nostalgia for from PS2. Wonderfully created atmosphere with a music score that absolutely **** you in to these worlds. Instant classics that magically put you in the shoes of the protagonist and living the adventure. These will always be part of top games in my memories. Highly Recommend.. Two excellent games, both worth the price of entry alone. As a package it's great, but be aware SOTC can be found in remastered form on PS4 now.. ICO did not test, but the shadow is without exaggeration a masterpiece, a bunch of memorable titans, a cool open world. This collection includes two of the most unique games ever created, designed by Fumito Ueda and developed by Team Ico. Ico is an adventure where you have to escape from a castle along with a mysterious girl named Yorda. You solve environmental and platforming puzzles while also protecting Yorda from shadowy enemies who want to take her away. Shadow of the Colossus can be best described as a ""boss rush game"". The objective is to defeat 16 Colossi. There is an open map which you have to explore, with your magical sword guiding you to each Colossus after 5-10 minutes of traversal. Each Colossus is a platforming puzzle you have to solve, with most Colossi featuring literal platforms on their body, and you defeat them by stabbing their weak points. These games didn't sell too well when they launched during the PS2 era, but they both paved the way for the rise of many artistic games with a minimalist narrative, left open to interpretation by the players. These games had some drawbacks on PS2 (floaty and imprecise controls for both, rather short both of them at ~6 hours to beat, horrible frame rate for Shadow of the Colossus), and the PS3 remasters are a notable improvement in the image quality department, but the imprecise controls are still here. Bluepoint Games chose not to touch the games' code in these ports, but they are much more playable and enjoyable than the original versions. Bluepoint Games would later go on to remake Shadow of the Colossus from the ground up for the PS4.. This game is worth getting a PS3 for I cannot recommend enough, ICO is one of the sweetest and best small stories I have seen, The theme song is so amazing that I have it on my my phone and I have listened to it in the last 7 years. Shadow of the Colossus Is one of the most sombre in emotion filled adventure you can have, everytime you fight a Colossus it is a Arsenal you will never forget puzzle. two of the greatest PS2 games in one package just go out and buy it. Without having previously played the games in its original version on PS2, this is a great collection to try these great titles. You could write more thoroughly about each game, but I'll be brief; both videogames are good for their challenge, their characters and their narrative, they can leave a lot to the interpretation of the gamer, they are very moving and challenging. A great epic experience at the end. His bad points is that Team Ico doesn't know how to perform a correct physics of the characters and their mechanics, and the camera ends up being frustrating and become another enemy. These two weak points almost ruin the gameplay experience.. Dying to buy the new remaster. SotC has completely changed the way I think about video games and given me feelings that I thought were long forgotten. 11/10. You very rarely will find a remaster this good that changes and adds only what is required for the previous to be better. In the case for Ico and Shadow of The Colossus, the remaster is able to improve on all outlets without sacrifice to the experience. Ico now has co-op to control Yorda, the final blow Wander deals to the Colossus is slowed down to be climatic and both of their framerates are now consistent at 30 FPS. A trophy system is added too, but if you are not big on achievement systems than it won't bother you. On top of that you get 2 excellent games that still provide outstanding art, music and an experience that feels entirely different than most games even still today. The issue for this however is this will not appease everyone. As all games people have a certain preference for how they play their games. If you want shooters, big open worlds filled with quests and such, or anything like that then these games will not likely be played or want to be played by you. The calmness and more art-like style they bring is what Fumito Ueda (director of those games) wanted. If you are a art gamer and have yet to play this, then buy this or rent this on a PS3 or PS4. You will honestly love the experience for both. Taking a girl out of a castle or riding in a landscape taking down 16 giants might not sound exciting, but sometimes less is more and every confrontation and event feels far more powerful as you progress. They are not long either, but length has always been a dirty term for games saying if it isn't giving you 60+ hours of content it isn't worth your time. This is not even close for Ico and Shadow. They both are superb at what they accomplish and achieve with such little to go off of. It brilliantly allows your own interpretation to take place where it's never trying to be too smart or witty with itself. It respects the ideas and conversation players will come up with universally and that is really special to me and many of Team Ico's fans. The Ico and Shadow of The Colossus Collection serves as a bundle of great art games that deserve your attention if you like that certain type. The updates and fixes the previous might have had add more to the greatness those games bring. While not graphically great when held to modern standards it has concepts that far exceed those same standards with ease. Shadow of The Colossus especially is one that I consider to be one of the best games of all time and even playing new games today, they are only shadows to this colossus ****.. Ico is a positively archaic experience that has aged poorly. Abhorrent controls, hopeless AI, appalling camera, redundant story, uninspired enemies and graphics so bad they are like a drill bit to the eyeball. 0/10 Shadow of the Colossus is lonely and depressing puzzle adventure game which is infinitely better than Ico. A metaphor for mankind being selfish and destroying what they do not understand for their own purposes 8/10. Shadow of the Colossus is one of the best games ever. Go play it. Buy or download the soundtrack. Dream about the forbidden lands. And ICO is one hell of an underrated game. And I'm saying this after playing The Last Guardian. I think ICO is the second best game of Fumito Ueda over TLG. I really love this HD Collection. Is a must for all PS3 owners. 10!. Well, my score is for Shadow of Colossus, for I haven't had the chance to play ICO properly (I have the original one, and I was too young to even complete an hour of it). I bought it right on release years ago (the PS2 version) despite I hadn't heard anything about it (we didn't have all those fancy gaming websites back then, just magazines that came up monthly). So I played it, totally naive of what I was going to find during the journey, and I absolutely loved it. Yes, it's so empty, the game was bringing the PS2 to the maximum without exploding, due those huge creatures moving and trying to defend their lives (yes defend, not attack you). It was empty, but was that kind of beautiful emptyness, letting you know that place was at the very end of that world, a forbidden land forgotten by the hand of the men. And you are fighting those creatures with a sole sword wielded by an inexperienced boy, all to resurrect his beloved girl... with that fatale end for the boy. The story wouldn't catch your attention, but it didn't need to, with those challenges ahead. Even with that, you end up worrying about your poor horse, knowing that is digital you can't help but feel sad at the end. Damn even some colossus you don't want to kill, because they are innocent creatures and some of them won't even fight you, all to save their own lives. Oh but also there's the music... THAT is music. Even if the scenes aren't great, don't have impressive cutscenes, nor dialogues, that music speaks for the game. I havent tried the HD version, not I will, I don't want to ruin those memories back in 2005. This is one of those games that, like Journey, isn't looking for everybody's attention or approval. This kind of games has its own public, not a mainstream game.. I own both games on Playstation 2, but back in the day I never finished any of them. Luckily I got the collection for free on Playstation Network, decided to give them both a playthrough. Both games suffer heavily from clunky controls and bad camera angles. ICO is a lot of repetitive puzzles of jumping around in a big castle, and along with that you get an AI that you have to lead through the entire game. Sure, it's OK AI, but more than 10-15 times have I had to wait for Yorda (the girl you're leading around) to find her way. And what is up with her climbing ladders so extremely slow? ICO took me about 7 hours to complete, you should be able to finish it much faster though. I had higher hopes for Shadow of the Colossus. I remembered that back in the day the frame rate was really poor, luckily that wasn't an issue this time around. However Shadow of the Colossus has the same clunky controls and akward camera angles. You fight giant beasts, or Colossi as they're called. In between the fights you ride your horse trying to look for a new boss to beat. There's little else to do. There's 16 Colossi to kill in total, the game lets you know that from the start. It gets pretty tedious fast. All in all I think most people give these games a good grade because of their good graphics and amazing soundtrack. The atmosphere's in these games are great. But for me as a player, there has to be some nice gameplay as well and on that point neither of the games managed to satisfy my needs of good gameplay.. This is a wonderful collection that features two of the greatest games ever made by the legendary director, Fumito Ueda. Shadow alone is enough to make this worth your while.. The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection is a video game bundle that contains high-definition remasters of two masterpiece of PlayStation 2 for the PlayStation 3.. The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection is a video game bundle that contains high-definition remasters of two masterpiece of PlayStation 2 for the PlayStation 3. I do not have much to say about this game, except that it is one of the best I've played. The excitement, the soundtrack and everything it conveys. This game deserves to be called a masterpiece..

I recently played through both of this gems for the first time and I would play them again. I have to say that I played Shadow of the Colossus first and despite some unresponsive controls, I really loved the game. It's just a great sense of achievement to defeat these well designed bosses in this world and I also love that the game doesn't hold your hand to much. Ico came second and I was expecting a less spectacular experience because I read through some reviews first. I had some rather annoying moments with this game, because yorda's got the AI you would expect from an 13 years old game. Nevertheless, I don't regret playing this awesome puzzle plattformer. I think the games still hold up pretty amazing and deserve to be experienced by all of you. I feel now well prepared to get my hand on the last guardian when it hopefully arrives in 2016.. Both games are really great, ICO was very short but it felt complete when i finished, SotC was just amazing... I just regret i didn't play any of them on the ps2. First off, Ico is about a boy of the same name. First thing I noticed was that he had horns. Unusual, but I wasn't questioning where he got the horns. Apparently having horns in his village is a bad omen, so these two village elders ship the boy off to some ruins and lock him up in a prison. Ico doesn't know what is going on and neither do I! Luckily, the prison has worn away and begins to crumble when Ico tries to break free. After some struggling, the boy falls out and smacks his head on the stone floor. As he helps himself up and gathers his surroundings, I noticed that there are several of these prisons. Seems like a lot of children had horns and were forced to exile. Now this game is one of those types that has virtually no tutorials. I like these kinds of games. The player doesn't need someone telling them how to move or jump unless it is done through an unusual method such as hitting two buttons at once. The controls were pretty simple, so figuring out things as I go was a cinch. Eventually Ico stumbles across a dark and eerie room with a few cages hanging here and there. In one of them is a girl, probably older than him as she seems to be taller than Ico, and she just looks so sad. Ico calls out to her and she seems to notice, but looks so helpless as if she was completely overcome with hopelessness and dread. This girl, Yorda, just doesn't think she can escape. Fortunately, we are here to prove her wrong. Since it has been over a year since I played this I have to try and remember what happened next. I'm sure a stick was involved and some creepy shadow creatures attack you, but basically you manage to set Yorda free. This part just gets me every time: to progress through this game you must hold Yorda's hand and guide her through the entire castle and break free of the time-weathered walls. Sure, she could just follow you, but sometimes you just have to hold her hand so she can keep up. It's just so touching. It's the little things like this that make gamers grow attached to the characters. Trust me, the rest of the game is puzzles that require both people to solve, shady creatures to fight, and moments that tug at your heart strings and make you weep! Difficult? Maybe if you rely on tutorials a lot. Fun? Loads of fun. Aesthetically pleasing to the eye? I see nothing that comes close to this game. The graphics aren't meant to be realistic. The game has it's own art style and everything just looks so smooth. Imagine this: there is a painting before you and you think ""What if I could interact with this painting?"" Ico feels just like that. A beautiful series of paintings that makes the player feel enlightened, calm, and just so happy. And that's just the first game. The spiritual successor to Ico, Shadow of the Colossus delivers so much more! SoTC, as some call it, lives up to Team Ico's expectations. Graphics are in a similar style, controls are simple, the goal is pretty apparent, and the story grabs the player and doesn't let them go for even a moment. SoTC starts off with a young man named Wander. He's just minding his own business (as I am lead to believe) and some voice from above tells him to kill some Colossi running around. Seems legit. Wander takes his sword and his faithful horse Agro. Now as a player, Agro is going to be very helpful in taking down these Colossi as the horse is useful for travel, moving and shooting arrows, and excellent for reaching certain areas. The game has nothing else in between the Colossi. No other enemies, no mini dungeons, no puzzles. Just a starting point and the expansive land surrounding it. Wander uses his sword to reflect the sun's light and this somehow shows the way to the Colossi that needs to die next. Never have I seen gameplay like this. Pure boss fights that are amazing, exciting, and filled with sheer, epic combat. Wander must climb the Colossi, find a glowing symbol, hold his sword ready, and thrust it deep within the creature's flesh! Of course the Colossus isn't going to just let you kill it. They shake, they swipe, they run, they do all they can just to make Wander fall off. Keeping a good grip is necessary to winning the fight. Each fight is different, too. Yes, they all require the player to climb, but bringing the Colossus down requires strategy. I will never forget each and every fight I had with these things. Sometimes I got a vague hint when fighting, but figuring it all out for yourself is the most rewarding feeling in the world. I think that just about sums up the two games without spoiling anything critical. Both show emphasis on companionship and look amazing to boot! I highly recommend anyone reading this to try out these revived classics sometime. It will be worth every minute of your time.. Shadow of the Colossus was horrible. The controls were bad and unwieldy. The sound track was good and the graphics were OK but that does not excuse the game for its poorly designed controls. The game was so horrible that it has killed my love for the PlayStation 3. I would not recommend this game at all.. If I could give it a 20 then I would. Ico is a 10 and shadow of the colossus is a 10. I dare you to finish either of these games and think differently. These games are so good that they validate video games as an art form and prove the difference between film and video games. They are landmarks.. Shadow of The Colossus is the greatest game ever period (in my opinion) and when I saw the remastered HD version for PS3 I had to get it (having ICO on the same bundle as well is a massive bonus). Shadow is as near to perfect as a game can get in my opinion. Is it the best looking game ever, no but the sheer sense of scale you feel as you travel the land is great and the scale and size of the colossi is breath taking when you come up against them. The game is essentially 15 boss battles with little to nothing to do in between other then travelling from the temple to hunt down these beasts now that may sound boring to some people but for me it wasn't you don't need to fight hoards of enemies the colossi are enemy enough and the stars of the show, As I said before the colossi are amazing to look at and you are just the small speck **** up against these giants with your only help being your trusty horse Agro (who is amazing!) and the puzzle/strategy element is trying to figure out just how you will bring them down. It was odd as well in a game where the colossi are labelled as the enemy for you I felt slightly guilty each time as I downed them and they fell to the ground. Even though the controls can be a little annoying at first and the graphics are not amazing but it just didn't matter to me for some reason as the gameplay was amazing and I wanted to defeat these 15 colossi to see what would happen in the end. It's simply my favourite game ever. I had never played ICO before so it was a bonus this was included and I must say although I did not like it as much as SOC it's a great game and very enjoyable.. 2nd pass. ICO: 9/10. SotC: 7/10. Of the two, I enjoyed ICO a lot more. Puzzles were lucid, gameplay was enjoyable, next to no troublesome mechanics or anything to annoy the player, near-perfect. Though I prefer the aesthetic of SotC, I found it repetitive and frustrating, mostly due to the horrendous camera and the troublesome controls, which a lot of the time were greater foes than the colossi themselves. Poetic and artful, beautiful, even, but not a great game.. A nostalgic return to two of the most beautiful games ever made, proof that games can be a form of interactive art with such a broad use of emotions often through the most simple of means. This is definitely a game for the generation adores something deeper, something more immersive, not the simple game/CoD generation who need everything handed to them on a plate with lush ""grafficks"". With the HD sheen the graphics do look improved, both games also make a brilliant use of extreme lighting to really set a dark atmosphere with piercing light coming in from outside. Ico depends more on the emotion, the urge to protect thus the gameplay has a lot of co-op style mechanics whilst SotC is a more wide open adventure with character stat growth and progression through eating fruit and lizard tails. Personally I didn't experience the same problems with the camera, since you simply press the position reset button and regained control of it, I actually found the disorientation felt more realistic either way when you were tossed to the ground by one of the colossi. Ico's controls are simple with SotC adding more mechanics due to the variety of colossi and the need to climb, jump and stab. The soundtrack on both games is also immense, especially on SotC with the music changing depending on the stage of the battle, it had the knack of making you feel you really were facing a towering fiend. A very unique set of games where you really do get the feeling they were trying for something different in an experience unlike companies who pump out the same games over and over with a lack of originality... yet they get brilliant reviews and sell by the bag load.. The HD hasn't made ICO or Shadow of the Colossus appear any newer, however, when it comes to Team ICO, age doesn't exist. The classics that helped capture the PS2 era and visualize it, in case you missed them, ICO and Colossus give gamers -- casual and traditional -- the opportunity to mine into their dazzling beauty and simplicity. And despite the demographic maybe missing your average action/adventure audience on a more rewarding scale, there's no denying the impact they'll leave during your experience. Pros? The HD helps introduce ICO and Colossus to the newer era, whilst retaining all the glory experienced during their debuts, respectively; cleaner, crisper pixels; widescreen; breathtakingly beautiful visuals, especially the Colossi sequences during Colossus; excellent -- and eerie -- sound design, specifically the whistling winds while exploring the dungeons in ICO and the vast expanses in Colossus; simple, yet emotionally involving concepts; excellent trophy system; great value. Cons? The camera and controls in Colossus are annoying at first glance; ICO and Colossus share a minimalist concept that might seem sketchy to some players.. The HD updates are done perfectly. The convincing colossi look as though created for PS3, and the trophies add meaningful challenge and invite for a deeper exploration of the games. The box-art can be turned inside-out revealing all-page artwork for ICO (front) and SotC (back). The extras are not remarkable. A few themes that look PS2-y and a few video clips that take up much HDD space, and you can find on Youtube. As for the games, how much bland gameplay are you willing to sit through for the unique, sublime peaks of these two games? I'm talking about the mediocre combat and the less exciting puzzles in Ico, as well as the transportation and more awkward climbing moments in SotC. The peaks show unique qualities. The beautifully simple logical coherence of Ico, and the impressively grand and inventive fights of SotC. They would be even better if the player had a chance to work in different ways towards a solution. But the games are designed to be solved linearly, with every next step lying more or less obviously before the player. Plot is not the focus of these games, but they both end with generously well told cutscenes. Each game clocks in at less than 10 hours (ICO only 7-8 hours), so in full, they don't feel like quantitatively more value than any regular 'big' PS3 release. However, when these games work, they are uniquely atmospheric, lyrical and mythical. They are as far from the FPS/sports segment as you can come on the PS3, and in bursts they revive your faith that video games can express a sense of otherwordly magic.. Ico was boring so I turned it off after about an hour. I got towards the end of Shadow of the Collosus. Shadow is such a great **** bad it's executed poorly. The controls are immeasurable to wear it's hard to look around and the horse is just a mess to deal with. The camera freaks out nonstop so that I can't see anything. If you get knocked down in the game by an enemy then you cannot ever get back up before he hits you again. The nicest thing I can say about this gay is that it ****. I will never play a Team ICO game again.. Shadow of the Colossus is an amazing game. The collection is worth it for that game alone. However, Ico on the other hand, is a prime example of a developer being Artsy for the sake of being different. Nothing about this game stands out. The art design, point blank, ****. It's grey. Gray, Gray and more Gray. The castle is gray, the sky is gray, and there is nothing interesting to look at in the entire game. there is no art on the castle walls. It's a big, empty building with nothing to see. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is nothing to hear. In doors, there is no music. Outside all you hear is wind and the ocean. It's not interesting. What the biggest problem with the game is though, is that the quest, honestly, offers nothing. Yorda is quite possibly the worst companion in a video game ever. She says nothing to you. She offers no help. She just stands there like a drugged up crack ****, having you do all the work for god knows what reason. You have to manually drag her around the entire game. She will literally do nothing if you leave her be. She just stands there. The two characters cant understand each other, so there is no dialogue between them. It's just dragging this weird, albino chick around for five to ten hours. And that's when the game is enjoyable. Then there is the combat. Oh the god awful combat. You swing your stick around at monsters hoping to eventually get them to fall over. It takes forever, and is incredibly boring after the first few combat sequences. Coupled with the fact that there is no reason to attach yourself to Yorda, you'll eventually just wish that they'd take her and the game would be over. The puzzles are annoying, but at least it isn't the dull combat. They're difficult at times, but not by design. The game tells you nothing, so half the work for the puzzles is figuring out what exactly it is that you can interact with in this bland, gray works that Ico inhabits. Ico all boils down to being just a very drab, dull, bland game. If you enjoy it as a bonus game, go ahead. But do not buy this collection for Ico. It's just not that interesting. Buy the collection for Shadow.. Amazing Game The Story Never Gets In The Way And Has A Big Impact At The End Its A Tale Of A Wander Who Will Risk Everything For His Beloved But Seems Like So Much More When U Finally Learn The Truth There's 16 Colossi To Defeat All Offer A Unique Challenge That Requires You To Use Your Surroundings The Music Masterfully Done There's haunting tunes, there's peaceful tunes, and heroic tunes that make you feel unstoppable the bosses even look like real life creatures in a way like horses, bears, lizard etc. Otherwise This Game Does Everything It Set out To Do Its Unique, shows how boss fights should be done, and shows games can also be a piece of Art I Only Give It A 9 because other then Time Attack and Hard Mode There's No Much Else Do I Would Like To Perhaps Have More Animals To Inhabit The Lands Just So It Doesn't Feel Has Empty But I Understand its a design choice and its does it well with the feeling your in a land long forgotten by man bottom-line if you haven't played you owe it to yourself to play it at least once but its not for everyone now to play Ico. These classic games are from a time when graphics were not great and controls were clunky as hell. Of course this is a comparison with current generation games. I may have enjoyed this collection more if the games had been remade rather than re-released.. I really can't enjoy this game, Ico looks dated but with a simple and good gameplay while Shadow of Colossus looks yet good visualy but the gameplay feel horrible and i really tried to enjoy this because everyone calls a ""masterpiece"", but even considering me a player i didn't like.... Casual gamer, but ICO was beautiful to say the least. Very innovative for the time and the scenery was just epic. Japan, I bow to your creative brilliance. Next, on to Colossus.. The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus HD Collection for the PlayStation 3. My favourite game of last generation in high definition. SOTC deserves the utmost praise for it's sheer brilliance in storytelling and awe inspiring visuals, the only thing that could be better is if they completely remade the game with this generations graphics. That would be amazing. I have no problems with these games and will not spoil a thing. I recommend this to everyone, but be warned the games will not cater to everyone, the gameplay is a mixture between action adventure and puzzle gaming. DO NOT READ A WALKTHROUGH it will defeat the object of learning the strategies of the games. Either love or hate the HD collection is a wonderful game and you should try give it a shot.. SOTC I never played this on the PS2, but judging it as it is, it's a big disappointment. The controls are terrible, and the graphics are just OK I can imagine that it looked good in its day, but time has moved on! There are much better looking and playing games out there. ICO sorry, just not for me the continual bleating from girl just got on my nerves. I made it about 30 minutes in before turning it off through sheer irritation.. One of the best experiences I've been through in gaming. So why the 8? The controls and camera are very poor, but if you are persistent, you will get used to them and beat the game. Great boss fights, environment, and soundtrack. It would get a 10 if it weren't for the physics problems on cliffs and the colossi.. Wow. This game is bad. I have no idea what all the fuss was about. I tried to play it twice once on the PS2 and once again on the PS3 when the collection came out. There is nothing interesting going on here you ride a horse and climb on top of a couple of big monsters. I think i would have more fun watching someone play a bass masters fishing simulator. I never played ICO because of how bad shadow of the colossus is. I was so disappointed after all the buildup and hype. I have never been as disappointed in a video game as this one.. There can be no argument that these games are something of an acquired taste I would never universally recommend them. There is a quiet, elegant feel to them both that could be lost on some gamers, but ultimately for me they are probably the best games out of Japan for the last ten years, and are certainly in my Top 10 of all time. SotC is probably the better of the two with the awe inspiring colossi giving the game the edge over the more intimate castle environment of Ico. That said, the relationship between Ico and Yorda is one of the sweetest captured in games. I long for more games like this and can't wait for The Last Guardian (if it ever comes out!). Highly recommended to anyone who likes to play games that feel a little different (If you liked Journey, Braid, Year Walk etc you won't go too far wrong). Just a small warning the ending of SotC can ","the shadow is without exaggeration a masterpiece, a bunch of memorable titans, a cool open world . ICO did not test, but the shadow is without exaggeration a masterpiece . the collection includes two of the most unique games ever created ."
191.Metroid Prime 2: Echoes,"The world with its light and dark sides is exciting. It's often a bit difficult to find out exactly what you have to do or where the next destination is. Sometimes it's even very frustrating. The sandy, dusty world is less varied than in its predecessor. The saving stations are very rare, luckily I'm playing on an emulator. Sometimes it's really annoying that the locked doors have to be opened again with special weapons, but there's no ammunition available. Then you can go everything back again. As player, this game is sometimes more like a labyrinth than a shooter. For those, who really like to walk, search, walk, search and walk again, it's good. But I by myself liked the game more when watching it to streamers.. My favorite Metroid game and one that I think is underrated. The game was actually challenging unlike most Nintendo games made after the N64. Dark world was a cool concept and was executed amazingly. I was never scared of when I found a portal to the dark world I was just exited.. The sequel to the best game ever made which even more amazing glorious level design done by one of the best studios ever retro studios.. This game had the potential to be equal to Metroid Prime, which is one of the greatest games ever created, by being a perfect counterpart. Its strengths are the higher difficulty, more focus on combat and the better use of the morph ball ability by combining spider and boost ball. However fans mention the reduced backtracking first, as strong point, when they argue, why Metroid Prime 2 is better than it's predecessor. This is true, yes, unfortunately it is one of the reasons why Metroid Prime is the better game, because Metroid Prime was built with the backtracking in mind, which leads to more options to play through the game, the more powerups and abilities you gain. This is not the case here, so the replay value suffers of the more linear design to reduce backtracking. Furthermore the game is more action paced, with way more bosses to fight. The problem here is, that the higher amount of bosses in total doesn't add the quality value as it should to compensate the los of atmosphere compared to the first Metroid Prime. But the worst thing is the endgame. After beating Quadraxis this game reaches it's low point. The backtracking comes back with the sky temple keys, which are the equivalent to the chozo artifacts, only worse, because it is always the same scheme and you are not able to collect them sooner in the game unlike the chozo artifacts. The other reason the endgame is so bad are the two remaining bosses. The Empereror Ing is horrible, at the first phase of the fight targeting his tentacles to open the core is simply frustrating due to the fact that you are not able to look and shoot up that high. Because of these control limitation, the light beam is the only option that works and even that not in a reliable way. The second phase is completely unnessecary. The last phase is a confusing mess, where the hitboxes are strange and the Empereror Ing only acts like a bigger version of the Warrior Ings. After you defeat this frustrating and disappointing boss you face the other one with a time limit. The last Dark Samus fight is easily the worst of the three in the game and suffers from the same control limitation. You can only look and shoot up to certain height before the control becomes inaccurate. Empereror Ing and the last Dark Samus fight are exceeding these limit which results in frustrating fights that are not fun. This game make some good choices and offers a complete new experience instead of being a simple clone of it's predecessor. Unfortunately there are more bigger problems than solved one's in total.. Metroid Prime was a brilliant reinvention of a brilliant series with the sole flaw that there were not enough save points; this is doubly so for its sequel. It's very easy to be exploring for an hour, stumble into a boss battle and die before you have worked out what it is you are supposed to be doing and with no checkpoints you are sent back a literal age. It can be hair-tearingly frustrating and a testament to just how good the game is that you will actually start again instead of throwing it out of the window! Again, a superb piece of game design but again, not for the impatient.. It's like Metroid Prime, but better. If Metroid Prime is already a 10, this is a 11. Challenging game with lots of puzzles and exploration, graphics couldn't be better, creative boss fights, platforming, and deep story.. This game takes every aspect and element from the first Prime game and improves it's formula in every single way. One of the greatest games ever created.. Imagine if Metroid Prime 1 was a lot harder, way cooler bosses/enemies and a more interesting story? Well that is MP2. But to be honest the worst part about it is exactly it's difficulty that is sometimes even unfair. But if you have a lot of patience you're going to love this one. I wrote a review for Metroid Prime Remastered recently, saying it is my least favourite in the trilogy. I immediately take that back after revisiting Prime 2. This is my least favourite playthrough of Prime 2 (my 3rd playthrough) and it reinforces my feeling that as I keep revisiting older games I start to notice I like them less and less as time goes on. Metroid Prime 2 is a good game. I think it's the worst in the trilogy (I'll play Prime 3 afterwards but I don't think it will change this time around) but it's still fun. 2 however comes with the most problems: If I was complaining about Phendrana Labs in Prime 1, well, the underwater section of Torvus Bog blows it out of the water completely. It's so much worse. And in general Torvus Bog is just really bad and really boring. The constant 10 second transitions between Aether and Dark Aether, the multiple encounters with invisible enemies, far before you get access to the Dark Visor in order to deal with them (also they close the doors during several of these encounters to force you to defeat them), the cumbersome beam ammo management, the multiple poorly designed boss fights. Oh, how I hate Boost Guardian so much. Chykka, Amorbis, Alpha Blorg and many others aren't much better tbh. The final boss battle against Emperor Ing is so painful to go through. Thankfully, Sanctuary Fortress is really good. It almost makes up for how bad Torvus Bog is. Fortress is honestly one of the best locations in all of Prime, it's really fun. Prime 2 is still bogged down by a lot of annoying little things and this last playthrough of mine really disappointed me, but I still recommend the game although like I said it's easily the worst in the trilogy imo.. Arguably the best of the trilogy. It is darker, harder, and more oppressive than the first. Some of the best boss battles of its era.. great game, it got awesome gameplay, graphics and story. it's definetly my favorite game of the trilogy. Bad gamedesign ruins this game for me. I wish this game was better and that tedious to complete.. In my opinion, this is easily the best Metroid prime game. I honestly do not understand why some others think so negatively of this game compared to the first one when in my opinion, Metroid Prime 2 improves on almost every aspect of the first game. First of all, the story is better. The luminoth make for a interesting new addition to the Metroid franchise, and give Samus a interesting new enemy to fight, instead of just making us fight Ridley for the hundredth time. The second thing that is better is the gameplay. The combat feels so much better designed for the gamecube controller, and fights are more focused. I also love the new light world and dark world mechanic because it makes for some very interesting puzzles. One thing that I personally think makes the game better is that it is much harder than the first game. However, I can understand how this may not be a positive for some people. The boss fights are also way better. They are much longer and have cooler objectives. The last thing I think the game does better is the world. I can understand why someone would like the world better in Prime 1, but I think that Torvis Bog, and especially Sanctuary Fortress, are 2 of the most unique locations in the entire series. Agon Wastes is meh, but you rant there for a super long time and I think the other 2 locations make up for it. This one thing that I think this game doesn't do as good as the first game is the soundtrack. Prime 2 has some killer songs but they just don't hold a candle to the songs in the first game. Overall, I think that this game is much better than the original, and its a shame that it gets overlooked so often. If you have played the first Metroid Prime, then this game is a must play.. I can't stand this game. Anyone giving this more than a 4 is goddamn insane. The game is gorgeous, some of the best graphics of any gen 6 games. But that doesn't mean anything when the gameplay is so terrible. The Dark World, which is half of the world, literraly hurts you. You'll see yourself run from one secure light source to the next, trying to figure out where to go at the same time. Since the world itself hurts you, you'll also spend nearly 5 minutes waiting in each light source you come accross to restore your health. So, walk for 1 minute, stand still for 5, rinse and repeat. The game might have been good it not for the Dark World but it ruins the game. Please Metroid, stop trying to be Zelda, you really fail at it. Ennemies also take forever to kill. Not that they pose a threat. They're all so predictable and easy to dodge. But they have so many HPs they take forever to die. I know you get light ammo to kill ennemies faster (which you need to replenish...seriously, replenishing BEAM AMMO in Metroid?! What were they thinking?!) and a light armor, which prevents you from losing life energy in the Dark World. But you get the armor near the end of the very long and boring game. I never could endure the game long enough to reach it, not once in the 3 tries I gave it over the years. Also, I know backtracing is an issue in most Metroid games but this world basically having 2 duplicate maps just makes it so much worse. Seriously, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 3 and yes, even Metroid Prime: Hunters on the DS are all masterpieces in my book. But Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is the black sheep of the series. One that seems to be there just to remind you of how amazing the other 3 are. Here's hoping that Prime 4 will not be like this one.. Pretty dang good game I'd say, had a lot of fun. I liked every location in this game I've been in so far(I haven't beaten it yet, I'm up to power bomb guardian), and the core concept of a lot of things this game does it great. It rivals prime in it's music design, and while prime has great graphics compared to modern games, it doesn't compared to the other 2 prime games, because this game looks GOOD. The controls are... well, you know gamecube primes controls, but they do work thanks to the lock on. This games puzzles are awesome(and I don't like puzzle games). I enjoyed getting lost here. But that's the problem, I DID get lost. And while, especially in the second main area, it was fun at first, it DOES get annoying after a while, and this game is way easier to get lost in then in every other game. The enemys were all fun to fight, BUT they were definitely spongy without the light and dark beams. The bosses are also great, SUPER fun, but they have quite a bit of waiting to them to get the weak spot(I didn't really have a problem with that personally but other people did) I only really had a problem with 3 of the bosses, but even then I still had good fun. I LOVE the dark world to death, apart from the times it nodded me in the wrong direction which was more then once but other then that it felt awesome. This game uses different takes on combat and exploration than prime, making it a fresh experience. But I've mentioned quite a few problems in this, so it won't get to high. On a tier list it'd probably be near the bottom of A tier, and for an out of 100 review score, I'd say I'd give it an 81 at minimum and an 83 at most. but since I have a scale of 10 here, I'll give it a 8.. Its not as good as Metroid Prime, but it still is one of the best games the Gamecube has to offer. Its the perfect sequel for the perfect game. No es tan bueno como Metroid Prime, pero aun así es uno de los mejores juego que la Gamecube puede ofrecer. Es la perfecta secuela para un juego perfecto.. Masterpiece in atmosphere, level design and environments. It's a very difficult game. But it's not too hard to overcome.. I'll admit that the switching between worlds thing confused me a bit at first, but this game is still just as good as Prime 1 in every way. Hopefully Prime 4 will be just as good as these. Each game in this trilogy is an absolute masterpiece, but Prime 2 is my favorite Metroid of all, having played a version of all the games. As with all these games, Prime 2 has excellent environments and the combat mechanics are essentially perfect (I play the trilogy version with motion controls, which is a night and day difference for aiming). While there are some cooler upgrades in the other games, this one I think has the most compelling sense of exploration, which is obviously what Metroid games are known for. Prime 1 might just edge this one out of the number one spot, but it’s a close call. This is a must-play for anyone who enjoys the genre. Total work of art.. I don’t think it’s as good as the first game but it’s still an amazing game my only problem is that the light and dark world swapping can be a bit repetitive because it plays a cutscene everytime you swap. Very good game, but it is hard to be a sequel of one of the best games of all times, still an excellent game, but I hated that dark world and those pylons. The first metroid prime was the fondest memory i had as a child. Its music made my skin tingle and its bosses produced fear that I had not experienced up until that point. Likewise echoes doubles down on these positives with added variety to its madness. The only con i had was some areas feeling washed out in terms of aesthetics and color. The ""Forgotten"" sequel to metroid prime, a sequel that not only measures up, but far exceeds its prequel. Perhaps the only negative point is how completely difficult it can be for some, but I say it from now on, it is totally worth it, from its setting, its history and its exploration. Another point to mention is the fact that beams have ammunition, a correct way to balance it for some and perhaps a nuisance for others.. Metroid Prime 1 and 2 are my favourite games of all time for two reasons. Atmosphere and Gameplay! Echoes can be pretty hardcore in being a Metroidvania. But if you like the genre, Prime 2 might be the best in the series.. The game is great, with a fun distraction with multiplayer. The loading takes seconds, and the dark-light world gimmick is fun to mess around with. I like the less handhold and faster travail of the linearity. Even though it has flaws, I can look them over.. Slightly less than Metroid Prime, it is a 9. Great music again but game on the darker side. Some bosses were programmed too difficult too. The saturation factor does not allow for a 10 too.. This game follows the giant steps of the first Prime with courage and honor. The second entry of the Prime series gives birth to a new soundtrack, which Is outstanding (Kenji Yamamoto I love you) and new environments filled with information, ruins, new creatures, lore everywhere! In Prime 2 you'll meet the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness. For some people some darkness parts are tedious but the experience that Echoes gives us is from another world (I'm so funny...). The bosses' design on Prime 2 is way better in my opinion than Prime 1 and the gameplay, controls are just perfect. AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS OF THIS GAME: MULTIPLAYER. Crash the soul of every roommate/friend/sis/bro near you with this awesome multiplayer mode. When I was younger I spent hundreds of hours playing this mode with my cousins, back in the day was gold. If you are a fan of the Metroid series but most importantly, Prime series, you should play this right now. I give this game a perfect 10.. In time for Metroid Prime 4's announcement I decided to warn people about this game. As a long time fan of the Metroid franchise it's frustrating that this game was designed for a narrow audience that likes their games brutally unforgiving. Nintendo typically makes games with a balanced difficulty to challenge the player. I've completed every Prime & mainline Metroid game to this date. I've only given up several times one the NES original for being unfair & frustrating. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind hard. I've defeated the Unamed King in Dark Souls 3 & felt rewarded. In Prime 2 we get leeway to ease the challenge only by collecting every hidden upgrade in the game. That's fine but this game punishes for exploration. When you revisit sections you have to battle enemies who like to run around at top speed, that lock you in rooms, which then go invisible, & take way too long to inflict damage upon. Not till the end of the game when I combined light & dark suit power into my inventory was I able to cope with exploration. There are some boss battles that require you to switch between ball & suit. It becomes so riddled with difficulty spikes that I wanted to actually smash my controller. I had not been that angry while playing games in years. Every time a boss got too hard, I would dread back tracking to get better items because it's so easy to get lost. Not only that but the dark world drains health by roaming in it. By the time I got to the end, the boss fights became more and more unforgivable. They would place me in long winded battles depleting health bar after bar. When I died, I got sent all the way back to a save station. Had to hike back to the boss, watch cutscene, & face trial while experimenting to find weak spots during battle. When I fought my doppelgänger, the boss was impossible. It turned invisible & required pin point timing to inflict a small amount of damage on. The biggest slap in the face was before I got to end game. Just like other Prime games you need to find every hidden artifact possible. First game was mellow by comparison. I mean, the sky keys are like finding buried treasure while being blind folded. This game is overrated to no end. As a positive I wouldn't mind replaying this game if they ended up remaking it with less frustrating bits. Under the difficulty lies a gem. It **** to hate this game over a programming decision like that. But then again how did Nintendo not think they would alienate a lot of fans by choosing to go this route? PS. The Prime series had some moments, but I've never seen any enemy from the original except for Ridley. In 2 we don't even get that. No basic enemy types are familiar. We never got Mother Brain once. Just some odd looking thing at the end of 3 that needed to be shot in the back of its head while pointing up with a Wii remote that couldn't detect off TV motions.. No game is perfect but any game as good as this one deserves high praise. I don't give 10s. If I had to... I would rate this a 9.5ish sort of game. It's just about as good as the first one. Better in some ways. Worse in others... Some of the power ups are more bad ass. It also has a much darker and scarier theme which is kool. The menus however are not as easy to get through like in the first game. Also navigating the world in this game is more of a pain than last time. There is multiplayer on the plus side. I haven't tried it yet so I can't comment on that so don't take this review too seriously. Regardless though. It's more of the same good old metroid prime so you know it's good. Nothing wrong with more of something that's already good.. Metroid Prime 2 Echoes is my favorite of the Prime Trilogy, and I'm not afraid of showing it either. Metroid Prime 2 is probably the most difficult of the series, and with good reason too. The inclusion of a Beam Ammo system was designed and based off of the existing Luminoth weapon systems, which meant the integration gimmick would be an Ammo-based Beam Cannon upgrade to make players learn to conserve their ammo and use it more wisely in a dangerous situation, and the Dark World to help players learn through trial, error, and consistency to explore and traverse the ever looming and corrosive atmosphere of Dark Aether, both inclusions added a much more gloomy, sinister experience, how all of Samus's experiences are... Near suicidal missions on abandoned installations or planets. Speaking of which, the once thriving homelands of the Luminoth now left desolate and twisted is the most expansive look at how Aether has nearly been destroyed by its Dark brethren. Each area is supposed to be depressing and bland, like the vast Agon Plains scorched by the Leviathon turning it into nothing more than a desert, the industrialized Torvus Forest reverted into a damp wetland bog, and a Holy Fortress once revered by the Luminoth for its technilogical advancements turned into a technological nightmare. You really start to feel for the beings of the Aether and how their war with the Ing turned into a one sided massacre. A common misconception of the game is that the game was made using assets from Metroid Prime, which in my eyes was actually a breath of fresh air, whether you come into this game as a new player, or a veteran of the first Metroid Prime, the controls are simple and easily adaptable. Funny how people complain about MP2 asset reuse when Legend of Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, and Kirby do the same thing and get tons of praise for it, huh? I found the lack of hand holding and backtracking perfectly similar to the first Prime game, and is perfectly befitting to the series nature, not telling me where the **** to go every two seconds like Red Faction: Armageddon and LoZ: Skyward Sword, which ironically it seems everyone is falling into this situation analysis these days, yet people hate that concept, but despise the concept when it comes to Metroid Prime 2. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is praisable like the rest of the Prime series, as the rest of the series encompasses the same streamlined exploration, and lack of handholding, Prime 2 creates new, unique, story, creatures and more tense battles that test not your patience, but your experience of the games mechanics.. 9.2 - A great sequel to Prime 1 although still not as good. Environments were still very creative and memorable, but got very frustrating once the player reaches the ""dark"" world areas. Final boss was epic.. This game has many improvements the first Metroid Prime game lacked. This is a game for anyone who likes the Metroid Franchise. The controls are the same in the first one, they haven't changed. their extremely tight, if stiff, and at times, slow to use, but is over shadowed by the fast-paced action this game brings to the table. The multiple weapons you can use can have different damage outputs depending on the enemy, which have two types, light and dark. other then that, the light ad dark beam are only reskins of the plasma and ice beam from the first game. The game a alot harder then the first one, especially the bosses. They can be so difficult, that they can take at least 3 or 4 tries to beat, especially that spin guardian. This is a game you should try out sometime, even in 2017.. A unique, artistic and worthy sequel, though often feels like a disjointed retread of the first. It's definitely a long game, if only for the continued backtracking through areas you've been through a few times before. The visors make for some cool graphical effects, and visuals are top notch (60 frames per second in 2004, say whaaa!) though the audio - primarily the soundtrack sounds rather artificial and dated compared to many other games released around the same time. The shrill synth notes and repetitive riffs had me drop the music volume down via the options screen. The thing that irks me the most about this game is the way it needs to be played different from all the Metroids before. Take Super Metroid on the SNES for instance - you'd pass a yellow door and know to come back later when you had the Power Bomb. Now, you've got the cool 3D map in Metroid Prime 2 so you've got an even easier job of finding a path back to the door. So you get the power bombs and decide to make your way back - HOWEVER, due to being locked in a 'side quest' of 'Collect the 3 keys' you'll find yourself locked in a section of the game world and unable to progress until you complete the menial task. This kind of momentum breaking distraction occurs several times over the course of the game and combined with the disorienting transitions between the light and dark Aether I found myself unable to play the game for long without becoming frustrated at the 'stabs in the dark' approach to discovering the exact predetermined way forward. Don't even get me started on the overuse of the Morph/Boost/Gravity Ball in this game. Is it 2? 3 bosses that depend on its almost exclusive use? Not a terrible game, but the worst of the console-based Metroid titles.. Metroid Prime 2, it's basically Prime 1, but the pause menu is tweaked to make it a LOT better than the one in Prime. It is VERY hard if it is your first time playing it, but not too difficult for you to never play it ever again, it requires a lot of patience. The new power-ups and beams are much more intuitive than the ones in Prime. The music is pretty good, and the better graphics are very nice. I would highly recommend buying and playing this game.. Finally finished Metroid Prime 2 today. I give it a 4/10, but please read why. I enjoy exploration in video games but it has to be rewarding. It seemed like the items in Prime 2 were nothing more than elaborate keys to get to other locations. Most items were literal keys. While I get that's kinda the point to exploration games, in Super Metroid the grapper had utility on top of swinging around. The hookshot in Zelda had hella utility besides going from point A to point B. The Screw Attack is the worst, as in Super, and pretty much every other metroid ever, the Screw Attack turned you into a spiral of invincible destruction. In prime 2, again, basically another key. It let you ""jump longer"" and had virtually no utility outside of that. But the worst part was, that each time you obtain a new ""fun"" item such as the morph ball, bombs, ect, they LITTER the area with doors and areas you can't reach until you get a DIFFERENT item. Like, haha, congrats you got this piece of **** bomb ball. Betcha wish you had spider ball tho don't cha? Guess you'll be back HERE again, won'tcha **** My final rant just deals with the lazy ""get behind them"" combat that is common with 90% of bosses and several VERY annoying enemies. It leads you to holding L to lock on, right or left on the stick to strafe behind them, and attempting to double-tap jump to quickly dash to the side. Problem #1: You can't see where you're dashing to. You take damage, fall off cliffs, hit walls, ect. Horrible. Problem #2: As you double tap jump, often times you simply JUMP up in the air, which actually SLOWS your strafing down causing even more frustration. Problem #3 is that it's hardly telegraphed whatsoever if you're far enough back behind the enemy to hit that precious weak spot, and if you miss, you'll take another 30 seconds to charge up another shot and by this time they've done their little 180 hop and are facing you again. Another problem is that the enemies rarely drop anything worth value (no exp) so by the end of the game when you have enough HP and armor, you're basically roaming the halls of the game going from point A to point B taking tiny amounts of damage the whole trip, completely ignoring enemies. Quality gameplay. That being said, the graphics were pretty and samus wasn't some crying whiny ""I'm just a girl"" sex object. She was samus. Seriously the art design and detail made up half of my 4/10 rating.. Continuing the successful formula of Metroid Prime, Echoes provides a similar, yet visually unique experience for fans of the series. They made some minor improvements from the first game and there are a couple details I'm not a fan of. Overall, the game is just as exciting and visually pleasing as Metroid Prime. The scanning mechanic is improved and the graphics are tweaked to give the game it's own feel. I did not like the ammo restriction for certain beam weapons but having a limited supply of certain ammo types does require a certain strategic approach to some situations. Echoes is my least favourite of the Metroid Prime Trilogy but is still a fantastic game in it's own right.. If you played Prime 1, all you need to know about Echoes is that it's darker, more complex and more difficult. Other than that (and slightly superior graphics) it's more Metroid Prime, which is a good thing.. This right here folks is not only the BEST Metroid game, but one of the best games of all time. Metroid Prime 2 is everything I want in a video game. It has AMAZING gameplay that is fun and challenging. The exploration is fantastic. This game is also home to some of the most atmospheric songs in all of video games. Areas such as Torvus Bog and Sanctuary Fortress are very interesting to explore and have great atmosphere. The sense of isolation, while not as good as Prime 1, is still very good. If you haven't played this masterpiece, I feel bad for you!. Even though this game is harder than the original, I still finished with a higher percentage than the first. That says something about how enjoyable this game is. Amazing graphics, which are enhanced a bit on the trilogy-version on Wii, along with those great motion-controls, making the game intuitive and amazing to control. This is such a master-crafted game, so much thought is put into it, a true masterpiece indeed. If you haven't experienced the Metroid Prime trilogy, you've missed out on the top 10 greatest games ever made.. While not quite as good as the original, Metroid Prime 2 Echoes still contains the excellent immersion, atmosphere and level design. It is also darker and more challenging than Prime. If you didn't like Prime you won't like this, but if you did you'll love this also.. Graphics: 9.8 Sound: 10 Gameplay: 10 Fun/Story: 10 A beautiful, natural and darker sequel of Metroid Prime. Perhaps not having the same surprise factor, but a really great game.. Very good sequel that builds on a lot of tried and true. That is not it so fascinating as its predecessor is logical. Despite it offers tons of gaming fun.. Hmmm... I loved the first Prime, absolutely loved it. This one I didn't love quite as much at the beginning. Maybe because it just seemed the first game couldn't be topped, and for some reason this one didn't reel me in right away. I even quit playing it halfway through. Then when I came back after a six month hiatus and tried picking it up again, I seemed to enjoy it much better. The further you dig the better it gets.. A solid and safe sequel to one of the best games ever made. It's not AS good though. It has a few pacing problems as you will be backtracking a lot, through light and dark. The dark world has the same layout as the light world so you'll be going through the same areas a lot. Being the hardest out of the series didn't make it more enjoyable. But if you persevere you will find that Prime 2 does do a lot of things right like Prime 1. 9/10. I'm giving this an 8 since the levels look the same especially Dark Aether. Sure it supposed to be dull and colorless since, well its Aethers dark twin. This game is a little more suggestive then the first Metroid Prime since enemies now are a lot more scary looking and sounds from them sound very vicious. Multiplayer is so so. Metroid prime 2 echoes is my absolute favorite in the series. ","""dark world"" is my favorite Metroid game and one that I think is underrated . the game had the potential to be equal to Metroid Prime by being a perfect counterpart . it's strengths are the higher difficulty, more focus on combat and better use of the morph ball ability ."
192.Out of the Park Baseball 17,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Found it a bit inpenetrable as a non-baseball fan, but I do appreciate the level of depth and number of different ways the game can be played. Would love Football Manager to take a leaf out of this game and allow DoF and maybe even Chairman modes - just because a mode is less active/immersive it shouldn't be taken off the table. Best pure sports sim by far. No competition for realism by any other franchise, including football manager. Only gripe is the non updated rosters throughout the season, but they have made this easy enough to fix in game.. Game is great, but your review must be 150 characters long, so let's stretch this out. One idiot actually rated this a zero because it had a better rating than a DLC for The Witcher 3.. How the heck did a broken baseball simulator beat ""The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine""? This game lacks proper coding and design, making it utterly frustrating to play most of the time.. Something smells fishy here in metacritic land (a 3.5 user score?...c'mon this is just stupid)......this is by far the best baseball sim....flat out ever. The scope and depth of the game is mind boggling. For a serious baseball fan...this can't be beat. I've been playing OOTP since version 2 and at this point, I really can't think of anything this sim is lacking. You can pretty much create any kind of baseball universe you want. And the depth of statistics is perfect for a stats junkie like myself. This game has kept my attention in it's various incarnations for well over a **** that says it all.. It's a very complex game with great detail, but you know there's something wrong when right out of the gate, they're telling you all about God mode - and you'll need to use it, because the simulation breaks every few hours without making adjustments for when things go wrong and the game errors out. It required far more time and patience than I was willing to give it, and after 4h, I was still unable to figure out the results of most of my choices. Feedback is very weak. Both the games I played through, I was stopped because my team had weak leadership and I couldn't figure out how to resolve it. Leadership is not a stat which was ever presented to me. After some Googling, you're apparently supposed to look through players bios to see who likes to play pranks, because they're leaders and prevent bad team chemistry. ??? Bad feedback systems. Actual baseball games lack any excitement, which is about how I remember real baseball. You're there to improve averages, so games don't count for much given how many there are (the primary benefit of micromanaging games is it sort of helps you understand how numbers translate to play - but again, feedback is very weak), and once they're boiled down to a fatalist game of probabilities, it feels particularly hollow. I've never encountered a game demanding I do so much observing and testing for such great lengths of time for so little mechanical information. -But it's the best sports simulator I've played, by far, and it reminded me a lot of the fun I had when I was using NREL's System Advisor Model, given they have a near-identical GUI.. This game is fantastic, realistic, and addicting. By far the best baseball game on PC and the best sports simulation game put there. It is so in depth in everything and there is really nothing else I could ask for. If you are a fan of baseball and are looking for a game where you are the GM or Manager or both then this is definitely the game for you.. The Game is Nice . It is an inspiration to all stepping up to play Professional. It has a nice UI and it is somewhat like Fifa . This is a favourable game.. No multiplayer = no game. Who plays single player games anymore, besides chess? This isn't 1990. Include multiplayer, this is the INTERNET AGE, no one wants to play games alone anymore.. It's obvious this game isn't what the fanboys say it is. Still has the same problems as past versions of OOTPBB. Basically it's just another money grab with a few new perks like the animation on the field which most didn't want anyways but the idiot (imho) developer put it in anyway Now he's suffering with bad reviews of the game. Trading isn't really improved as the AI is just as dumb as ever. AI managers/coaches aren't unique as I see the same strategy every one I play against. Recommend: DO NOT BUY anymore ootpbb versions until he fixed the AI extremely better than it is.. Not a game for everyone. OOTP is a text based baseball sim. But if you've ever played and enjoyed sports sims in the past, ootp is the gold standard. I won't get into every feature, there's isn't enough time. But one big addition this year is Authentic minor league systems from 1919 through 2015. So while playing a historical career the game will adjust the minor leagues, as well as import real historical players into the ammy draft, all done automatically by the game. Pretty much everything in the game is adjustable too, so you can make your game as complex or as simple as you like. Whatever fits your playing style.. Absolutely no notably interesting improvements over old versions. Financials are still a mess, AI still does not know how to deal with contracts, nor how to draft (trivially easy even with scouting at very low), and the AI still makes horrible decisions with personnel in games. They added 3d stadiums which is lame as hell. This is not a 3d simulator and people do not buy it for that purpose. The addition of MLB licence added nothing to the game. The changes to manager rating remain completely nonfunctional in every way. The bad news is this version crashes a lot. There are multiple crashes every season and there is no error log or anything to figure out what is wrong. On top of that, the developer is still telling their fans to go to review sites and rate the game very highly distorting the true score of the game. Minus one point for this years version. Don't bother with it. You can buy 2015 and not notice any differences.. I've been playing for years. Great game if you love baseball,sim/management games. It's no where near FM but is heading in the right direction. Just a few things to mention. Markus, the developer is active on the forum and patches the game frequently. Yes, the forum has a few fanboys who will flame you if you don't agree with them or criticize the game in any way. They're in every forum but for a small community it can be toxic. The game play is great and there only a few issues I have. The first is the Scouting. It's not where it should be. If done right it could be so much fun. Finances need to worked on. Trading has gotten better but can be improved. I give it a 7. It's a great game with room for improvement.. This is a good game. When you first start playing, you'll be somewhat amazed. However, you'll notice some shortcomings and begin tweaking the vast amount of options. This will lead you to the OOTP forums. It's then, you will understand all the 10 ratings you see here. It's not the developers fault, but they have some posters that aren't doing them any good at all. They dominate the threads and are rude and above all, never wrong I decided against joining the forum. It's not worth the trouble of dealing with fanboys who have thousands of posts and little between the ears. I was going to give the game a 7, but all the 10s and after reading the forum, I settled on a 6. This game has enormous potential.. This is the best sports game, period. If you are a baseball fan and always wondered if you could run your favorite team better than the real GM, give it a shot. The possibilities in OOTP 17 are endless. You can run modern teams with real rosters, historical teams (all seasons from 1871 up to 2016 are included) or even create your own fictional baseball world.. I started playing OOTP in 2012, and I'm amazed they keep finding new ways to make it better. I love the new 3-D and GM ratings. Unbelievable! Easily to best baseball simulation. The depth and ability to customize to any level the user wants makes this a must have for any baseball fan. This game doesn't really have any competition and has a boat load of options that will enable you to create your own custom baseball world if you so choose. It isn't what I expect from a 'text simulation' game. The player evaluation model is horrendous. The scouting model doesn't resemble anything like baseball in the real world. The AI, especially the handling of players, is broken and doesn't resemble real world baseball. And finally, the game has a lot of bugs (too many to count). I'm sure some of these bugs will be fixed, however some things (scouting, trading, player handling, AI depth charts, DH handling, etc...) need to be rewritten. One example... If you have a super star player that has a chance to break a few records or hit a major milestone, don't be disappointed when he is riding the bench and/or is sent to the minor leagues. Since the AI has direct access to his 'ratings', he doesn't have to falter first to be demoted. If you can overlook the bad, the game has a lot of good.. I have been playing OOTP series since version 5 and OOTP 17 is hands down the best version of the game yet. If you are looking for a game that lets you run a baseball team from just about every aspect, this is your game!. The best keeps getting better. OOTP 17 simulates the experience of running a baseball franchise in an immersive experience that can't be beaten. If you truly love the game of baseball, this is the game for you.. I started playing OOTP in 2012, and I'm amazed they keep finding new ways to make it better. I love the new 3-D and GM ratings. This game is just so great, I've already spent most of my spring break playing it. The best version of the game for sure. A game for all the sport simulation/management game. Let you do whatever you want. You can create your own league, play with an mlb team, go back in the past and remake the history. There is so much to love about that game.. This is a game that had a lot of promise and potential, unfortunately ignored glaring issues persist and new issues appear. The major pluses: licensing has allowed use of all major and minor league players and logos. You can create real life organizations from the Major Leagues right down to short season A ball. A major plus! The 3D engine has grown by leaps and bounds and the graphics presentation is enjoyable. Gove are the days of OOTP being strictly a text based sim. Then there are the issues, which don't seem to get taken seriously unless you have some predetermined number of posts on their message board. In ""Historical Exhibition"" mode I had the AI play a relief pitcher at second base. I also had the game totally ignore the fact that a relief pitcher made it into the game. You could see he was in the game by go9ing to the screen that shows the current pitcher. You could see he had fatigue from pitching. But he didn't appear in the box score. The response from the head developer: This problem does not exist. The Fantasy draft is completely broken. It doesn't display starting pitchers. If you go to a league in the first round of the daft and have the system sort starting pitchers, there are none. I started a season in 1994. If I go to the fantasy draft, like I said no starting pitchers. If I do a search for guys like David Cone, Randy Johnson or Jimmy Key, the come up in the search field. Try to draft them... nope, not happening. I have tried this several ways: with the most recent patch, uninstalling and reinstalling an earlier version or even going all the way back the beta version, which I secured by pre-ordering the game and the problem still persists. I guess if somebody who has a couple of thousand posts in the forum ahs these problems they'll be addressed. Right now the game gets a low rating but the one saving grace is they do patch frequently, so maybe this issue will actually get fixed.... we'll see.. Hands down the best sports management game of all time. I have played a variety of Baseball sims (season replay and management) a variety of other sports sims and it is not even close. OOTP 17 has become more user friendly and more deep each year and now with this year with the 3D game finally mature enough to be enjoyable and **** is pure magic. I am a war gamer (the chit pushing kind)primarily and an occasional RPG player and that said the best game on my hard drive is OOTP and probably the most **** real close. If you have even a passing interest in Baseball or find you enjoy management games of any sort, you owe it to yourself to purchase this game.. Unbelievable! Easily to best baseball simulation. The depth and ability to customize to any level the user wants makes this a must have for any baseball fan.. The gold standard for baseball sims. The purchase includes all 29,000 players to ever play in the major leagues. This year's version also adds the real stats of every minor leaguer in history for the past few decades, all without having to pay extra for season disks, roster sets, etc. The game is officially licensed by MLB, includes 3D play when playing out individual games. Also includes the ability to play any historical matchup ever -- to decide whether the 1927 Yankees, 1976 Reds, 1929 Cubs or your favorite team were the best in history. Can customize this so specifically that you can manage every game or be the GM executing the front-office deals all the way to the frustrations of an owner who won't give you enough money for free agents, forcing you to use all of your best skills to recruit the best prospects and build for the future on a shoestring budget.. If you are seriously considering a baseball simulator... there is only one real option. OOTP has been the king of baseball simulation since Puresim went the way of the dodo. Don't even joke by suggesting baseball mogul. If you are a true baseball fan... this is a yearly must purchase.. If you're into baseball simulation games - especially from a financial and roster management standpoint - this game is the gold standard. The depth of the game is truly stunning. You can start in 2016 with the current MLB rosters or at any point in baseball history back to 1871. Or you can create a completely fictional baseball universe. Every version gets better and OOTP 17 is no exception.. Three things make OOTP the best baseball simulation on the market. 1. Realism. It is by far the most realistic baseball simulation around. 2. Historical. No game is as serious and deep when it comes to the history of baseball, and this year you even have historical minor leagues. 3. Customization. No game has the amount of customization that OOTP has. Most eveything is optional, and you can turn off anything you don't want to use.. The best ootp yet by far, the platinum standard for baseball simulations. the new relationship ratings for coaches and historical minor leagues provide a new depth I never knew was possible and I have been playing this since OOTP2... Amazing Amazing game. Since coming out I have played this none stop.. The best sport manager game I have ever played, leaves Football Managers, Basketball Managers and the other stuff in the dust due to incredible depth. Gives you the ability to start today as manager or GM of any club in baseball, play any historic season, or gives you the opportunity to create your own fictional baseball league the way you want it. The new and improved 3D engine for games makes the games even more funny to watch and the management and especially trade part gets better every version. Another big plus: Savegames can be imported out of the previous year's version, no need to start a new game every year, play with the newest version but with your old save.... This is such a fantastic game! The game is very in-depth on the ""basic"" settings, and is fully custom down to the details that you are looking for in a game. You get to put yourself in the GM's shoes and be the final decision-maker for your club, or you can just be the day-to-day manager. Want to start a fictional league? Go for it! I also have to say that the development team has been doing a great job with updating the game, and they do a great job listening to user feedback. Great game!","the scope and depth of the game is mind boggling . for a serious baseball fan...this can't be beat . the game lacks proper coding and design, making it utterly frustrating to play most of the time."
193.Metroid Fusion,"I liked Metroid Fusion a lot, don't get me wrong. It did wonders to push the worldbuilding forward, the atmosphere was super tense, especially the SA-X, and the game offered a unique narrative, but I feel like I don't look back upon this experience as fondly as the others in the series. It's just so hard to place my finger on why I feel this way. I guess it's because the first 50% of this game seemed really slow to me. I found the inclusion of Adam to be quite annoying, as his expository dialogue, while plot relevant, appears far too frequently in a row, mainly towards the beginning of the game. There are a string of Navigation rooms that you can go to in a row, and it really broke up the flow of gameplay for me. The game is also way more linear than the other games. Not to say that exploration wasn't interesting, it was, but unlocking security level after security level was way too formulaic for me. Not to mention, these areas are mostly self-contained, which makes this feel like less of a unified world. To be fair, it is set in a space station, so it makes sense, but it also is less interesting to me. Yes, it does get a lot more dense towards the end, but that further highlights to me how slow the first parts of the game are to me. Pacing issues aside, I absolutely love every other aspect of the game. Despite the areas feeling more self-contained and less open, exploring them was still a treat. The bosses are a lot of fun, and the mystery and atmosphere stand well above a lot of the games in the rest of the series, which is REALLY saying something. (I'm between a 7 and an 8, but I can't bear to give this game a yellow rating). I remember loving this one as a kid. I played both Zero Mission and Super Metroid right before this and compared to both of those this one really just fell flat for me. Don't get me wrong, Fusion is still a phenomenal Metroid game, but compared to some of the other entries in the series it just feels like it's missing something, but when I categorize everything to try and find that missing link I can never quite put my finger on what that is. It seems to check all the boxes but is missing the X factor that the other games nail. I still love this game, atmospherically it is one of the best, but something about it leaves me yearning for more.. I enjoyed the game and I think it's good. I tried to my best to like it as much as possible, but I can't. The linear progression by no means is objectively bad, but it holds back the game from standing out. For a game that decides to ""focus on combat"", a majority of the bosses I outright just did not like. I liked the story a lot, though, and for a series that is usually stuck in the cycle of ""Oh no! The pirates and metroids are back in trouble, and Ridley has been revived for the 20th time!"" it really does stand out and paved a good direction for the series going forwards to Dread.. amazing visuals!the game is super fun and additive , i really enjoy playing it with my friends, recommended.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the one that made me love the franchise, I love the difficulty. I love the bosses. I love the linearity but still makes it feel like a metroid game at it's core, it's well structured that made it blend with the story seamlessly. I love the combat. I love the atmosphere. I love the power ups and I ESPECIALLY LOVE SAMUS.. One of my favourite games! It was terrifying to play through, and kept me on my toes at all times. Rating 9/10 because some parts of it felt a little unfair.. Better Than Super Metroid, Worse Than Dread, This game is the best looking metroid game, and the scariest (assuming its your first playthrough) also The SA-X Is Like 100x cooler than the Emmi's. This game is immaculate. The graphics, controls, story, and most of the gameplay is top notch. the atmosphere is arguably better than super Metroid with the SA-X being an amazing antagonist. the creepy music and vibes of some areas heighten it a lot. despite this game being very linear It still felt like a Metroid game and was very fun! There were a few bad boss fights and near the end there was a section that was just annoying but overall a amazing metroid game.. this is a game that you will want to play now and again and that will be different on each return. This game is amazing and its just so fun. I'd give it like a 92-94%. The story is just so good and the bosses are so fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it's surprisingly immersive. The dark and detailed environments, the smooth animations, and the eerie alien designs create a sense of isolation that's crucial for the Metroid experience. It's like a visually haunting melody that sticks with you. Gameplay: It's that classic Metroid exploration formula. Samus is back, and the level design is a labyrinthine masterpiece. The addition of the SA-X, this menacing version of Samus hunting you down, adds a layer of tension that's like a suspenseful crescendo in a thrilling symphony. Soundtrack: Now, let's talk tunes. The music, composed by Minako Hamano and Akira Fujiwara, is atmospheric and haunting. It perfectly complements the eerie ambiance of the game, creating an immersive experience. It's like the soundtrack to an intergalactic horror film, with each track contributing to the overall sense of unease. Story: And the narrative – it's a bit of a departure from the usual Metroid formula. The incorporation of an AI, the eerie atmosphere, and the underlying sense of dread create a story that's like a dark and mysterious ballad. However, the narrative is a bit linear compared to other Metroid titles, like a song with a carefully plotted verse-chorus structure. The linearity might irk some fans who crave the open-ended exploration of earlier titles. Some might appreciate the change, but purists might miss the freedom. In conclusion, ""Metroid Fusion"" is a standout title for the GBA that successfully marries the atmospheric elements of the Metroid series with a more structured narrative. The tight gameplay, immersive graphics, and haunting soundtrack make it a must-play for fans of the series. While the linearity might not be for everyone, it's a bold experiment that pays off more often than not.. The best gba game. An amazing experience from start to finish. The space station setting and overarching narrative really add to the horror atmosphere that Metroid is known for. The effect of this is that the game is quite linear, which is bound to put some off, but it also meant minimal backtracking which I was grateful for and the game really opens up and encourages exploration towards the end. Movement and animations feel really smooth. Bosses can be harsh, but fair. It is impressive that this is a GBA game as it is console quality. My only complaint is that it is very short but I'd rather that than for it to have been unnecessarily padded.. I'm torn on this game, it has some amazing elements, it plays with the formula, but the level design is very frustration-inducing.. Good aesthetics, story and sound. Plenty of gadgets as usual in the franchise but without any innovation. The game is quite well balanced. Good difficulty curve with several hard but not frustrating fights. As any game of this franchise after a while it fells too much on a ""find the hidden block"" feature that I personally don't like a lot.. Follow up to the best 16 bit console game of all time, Metroid finds its true home on the GBA. A perfect blend of shooting, platforming and adventure that the overly convoluted 3D reinventions never quite recaptured.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horror is still used in Metroidvanias to great effect, but I think many games in the genre reduce their horror to specific areas: Hollow Knight, Ori WotW and even Metroid Dread do this. However, I think that Metroid Fusion is a bit of an exception, managing to make it feel like a threat could strike at any moment. The terrors that lay in wait within the game's main setting, the BSL, are always magnified by their teases or appearances beforehand. You might be informed of a boss, only to reach its abode and find nothing but bones; a moment of relief, **** suddenly by the realisation of its meaning. This isn't to say that Metroid Fusion is perfect. There are moments where the game expects the player to perform the classic Metroid manoeuvre of bombing each individual tile on the map until you find the path forward. In some regards it works well, as the game acts like you have accessed areas you shouldn't have, which works well for the narrative, but fails for the gameplay. If the route you expect the player to take is so well hidden that it feels like the player is performing multiple sequence breaks, then it might be a little bit too obscured for its own good. Despite this, I feel the core game makes up for the few shortcomings that are present.. Fusion is essentially a 2d horror game while being a pretty linear game about exploration. Now that doesn't sound like it should work, but goddamn does it work well. The Metroid team decided to make this game something different and new from all the previous titles while retaining all the good parts the series is known for. Terrifying, difficult and exhilarating.. This is the Metroid that marked the end of the fun in the series, and the game trying instead to go for a high difficulty platformer more than a game of exploration. The Japanese symbol for difficulty *must* be the same one they use for ""lazy programming reclassified as intentional"". Samus' wall jump is abysmal, and her space jump is somehow even worse. The button for jumping and shooting are in the exact opposite order they should be. There's a button to make her aim diagonally up but not down. The SA-X looks more like Samus from Super Metroid, almost identically, meanwhile the real Samus looks like an NES cartridge puked out a Samus shaped pile. The game is *decent*, but for me marks the wrong turn at Albuquerque for me; it eventually led to the remake for Samus Returns, which debuted quick time events as something you do to every enemy. They doubled down on this for Dread, and Fusion is squarely to blame. (What happened to y'all hating QTEs? That's all Returns and Dread are.) I'm writing this due to the rerelease on the Switch GBA emulator (let's call it what it is). They could absolutely allow you to rewrite button mapping (people who say it's harder than it looks are covering their own laziness; emulator creators showed just how easy customisable button mapping can be, ESPECIALLY on an emulator). This is just classic Nintendo: when they're good they're amazing, but when they're bad you feel the need to swab yourself for any unwanted used car salesman DNA.. A LOT of stupid trial-and-error where there's one special block somewhere that you have to shoot/bomb to progress and you have to figure out where it is without any real hints. So the game manages to be both restrictive in its linearity, because you always get told where to go and what to do by your bossy computer and you CONSTANTLY run into dead ends and locked hatches (the interconnected world design of other Metroid titles is totally absent); while also being very frustrating and confusing because you often don't know what to do to progress; which almost deserves an award of some kind. Enemies and bosses can be pretty stupid sometimes in that it can be nearly impossible to dodge their attacks, unless you have superhuman reflexes or you shoot enemies before they even appear on your screen. The boss arenas are also typically way too small, giving you no room to dodge and you always have approximately one nanosceond to shoot the exact right millimeter where the hitbox of the boss's weak point is, which is kinda BS given the very restrictive controls and aiming. To add onto all this, Samus' cringe monologuing and her dynamic with her insanely bossy computer (seriously, who programs an AI like this??) also sets up Other M.... One of the Best 2D Metroidvania game ever. It’s also for me the best Metroid game to play for the first time. Absolutely wonderful graphics, beautiful soundtracks, best difficulty and the best Bosses in the entire Franchise.. Metroid Fusion is a great game just wish it wasn't so linear but still its a great game that gets a 10. It's not bad, but i played it right after Metroid Zero Mission and i couldn't avoid the comparison. Repetitive, less freedom than in ZM, and the story is not very good. Too cliché. And something that i don't understand is why the levels are so easy but at the same time the bosses are so hard.. One of the best games in the franchise. The game focuses more on the narrative, at the expense of being more linear. However, don't let that mislead you, the game still has many moments where you can explore and find the way to the next objective by yourself.. Fascinating and well-designed, Fusion is a more accessible Metroid title with its narrative structure, but it still has the blisteringly hard bosses that make you earn your victory.. An incredible, creepy, and excellent game destroyed by an absolutely brutal final boss fight sequence.. Game that I hated at once, but latter I'm fall in love. Tough bosses and spooky atmosphere. One of the best games ever made for sure.. Exciting story and incredible boss fights! It is a close second to Zero Mission for me, tied with Dread.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good - good old metroidvania gameplay. The animations are nice. The weapons feel great to shoot. - the progression is more linear, which I personally prefer. - space jumping and wall jumping are easier to execute. The introduction off ledge clinging was also great. Bad - still too many hidden blocks. A few really ambiguous ones that I couldn't be discovered unless I bombed and power bombed every corner of the level. It's not only a waste of resources, but also time. - i hate how hitting up during a diagonal jump cancels the momentum of the jump completely. This really threw me off. This made fighting some of the bosses very annoying.. Metroid Fusion is the 4th game in the Metroid timeline and continues the adventures of Samus. When it comes to this game, it's a very solid entry in the Metroid series but there are some flaws with the game that really holds it back from being great. The SA-X sections were a great idea but ended up being pretty lame and didn't happen too often so it didn't really leave an impression on me. The game is also way too linear for a Metroid game and it really frustrated me how much the game tells you where to go. However, it's not all bad as I think the difficulty is really nice and the boss fights are really good. The environments are surprisingly really well made and I love seeing them. Overall, Metroid Fusion is still worth playing but it is too linear. If it was more open like Zero Mission, I'd give this game a 9.. What a phenomenal game! The utter power I felt as Samus once I collected all of the possible powers felt incredible to handle. What else can I even say? The controls, music, exploration, atmosphere are all just as good as they always are. A super addicting must-play that might be a bit linear but incredible nonetheless.. this is easily the worst mainline metroid game. the bosses are horrible if u didnt get a ton of energy tanks. the game is very linear its not even a metroidvania tbh but even tho its linear you still get lost because to progress you have to shoot random tiles that look the exact same to everything else. the dialogue is just annoying. and i see people saying the game has a sense to fear which is hilarious to me because the sa-x encounters are scripted as hell. this game does litteraly nothing right theres no point to play it.. Playing this for the first time and even today you can see how great this game is.. sound, gameplay, atmosphere.. epic!. My favorite video game of all time. Bosses, atmosphere, tension--all absolutely phenomenal. And the story is incredibly intriguing.. Shockingly good. Doesn't have quite the exploratory feel of Super Metroid, but you still get to draw outside the lines. Holds up to the best Metroidvanias even 20 years later.. It's like a compact focused and condensed Super Metroid experience. Atmospheric and tense, also bosses are one of the toughest in the series.. I enjoyed playing it, it was as good as Super Metroid. They did a really good job with the story. I was able to connect better with Samus in this game. The parts I don't like. 1_ The difficulty of the bosses. I died a lot and it made me tired, but I enjoyed it more. It could have been a little easier though. 2_ A more linear map than Super Metroid. There are sections in parts and sometimes you can't go where you want. The previously open door is closed in gray, which limits free exploration. 3_ Difficulty collecting the X parasite. Sometimes it runs too fast and I can't catch it. Sometimes it turns into a new enemy. 4_ Some hidden paths are hard to find. Sometimes it can bother you a lot. But all in all, it's a fun game and a good story.. In no way is this the best Metroid game, but it is definitely a great one. It's take on exploration isn't very Metroid of it, but it still feels like it is even it if isn't, and the old backtrack formula comes back near the end of the game. The artificial environments are done really well, and that plus the more on-edge atmosphere that this game goes for, makes great immersion. The bosses become a little to frequent towards the end, but the general boss design in this game, may be the best in the series. This game's story is really well written and feels like Metroid, and it has an awesome difficulty spike that while may not be the only tough game in the series(echoes and SR), it's definitely the most famously difficult one, which is NOT a bad thing(and I'm not good at video games and I'm saying that). it loses points though because of to many bosses near the end and the firing in random directions adventure aspect of the game is done wrong on multiple occasions. I'd give it an 88 if this was a 100 scale, but it's not, so 9/10 it is.. This game is the best that I play in 2D, have a great story and provide an incredible gameplay with some stress sections but is perfect, is my favorite Metroid game I ever play.. Another highly enjoyable entry in the Metroid series of games. Fusion is far more linear and story focused than the other main series entries, which I appreciated, as it lead to a number of engaging narrative moments. The addition of the X parasite as the main threat is great, and makes this title feel distinct from it's predecessors. Visuals and sound are top notch as is usual for the series. The challenge level is somewhat unbalanced at times, the difficulty of bosses fluctuates at an unfortunately constant rate; for some reason the bosses in the middle of the game are by far the most demanding. Overall though, Fusion ends up being a highly worthwhile Metroid game that builds on the series and takes it in exciting new directions.. The Metroid series does not disappoint! While this game may not be as well-done as Super Metroid, there is still so much polish and attention present here. The gameplay is fun and the story is well written. I would recommend it.. Even though it is a little bit more linear than other Metroid games, It is still a great game with great bosses, map and secrets. Must play. Aunque es un poco mas lineal que otros juegos de Metroid, sigue siendo un gran juego con muy buenos bosses, mapa y secretos. Debes jugarlo.. A true gem,if you like super metroid get this thank me later, see you next mission. It directs you more than the other installments, but It make up for it with a more involved story. Even though you are mostly locked into one path, it still gives the sense of exploration. Unfortunately, if you try to go away from your objective, you sometimes get pretty far before finding you can't move on and have to backtrack. It's an annoyance for sure, especially if you've been trained by other Metroidvanias to always look for all the secrets you can get before going where you're supposed to. Also, why is the space jump always so hard to control? Anyway, other than that it's an incredible game that should be experienced by any fan of the genre.. The perfect experience of ambience on metroid. Definitely the best metroid of all, but only if you come with the idea of ​​enjoying the game and not of ""Playing the same"". My first thought playing this was that it was one of the best games I've ever played! it has an amazing story line, great game play, and some quite intense boss fights! overall, the game is a legend with only a few flaws, such as some parts being a bit too challenging for where you are at in the game, which force you to keep trying at that part till you get it, but other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this game! love it!. The first side-scrolling that installed a sense of horror in my playthrough as a child.. Metroid Fusion definitely lived up to its reputation as a fantastic game. This game was the first of the 2D Metroids to have a large story presence with constant dialogue from Samus' inner thoughts, and a direct narrative from her computer AI partner Adam. This led me to immerse myself so much more in the story that was going on compared to the other games which was far from rejected. The difficulty was also kicked up for this game quite a bit, I definitely died more in this game than I did in Zero Mission or Samus Returns, but that only served for me to improve and get better as a player. Between the really interesting story and the very solid gameplay, Metroid Fusion continues to make me happy I got into this franchise. Fusion is Fear, isolation, conflict and success. Gameplay: the gameplay is just perfect, it feels like super metroid but with some nice additions. The level design is awesome, they put you in really extreme situations and make you feel the pressure. SA-X situations and set ups are awesome, how they use the sounds when she is not being seen on the main camera, the way she looks at the player the first time...everything is really nice. As i previously said the level design it is just perfect, the only ""problem"" could be that you are guided the whole game, and in that part it lacks the exploration and the ""oh my god im alone in a huge planet"" feeling. But they use the guidance to create great situations and create amazing bosses bit by bit (nightmare and SA-X sudden encounters, im looking at you) Graphics: Pixel art at its finest. GBA possibilities are awesome and the development team knew it. Music: great atmospheric pieces like sector 1 (perfect for the initial set up) and others really unique and different in some way like Nightmare's theme make this a memorable ost. Overall: an incredible game, go play it at night with earphones and enjoy the fear and isolation! Just play it!. I've recently completed this game on the Wii U...what a great game!! It is the best Metroid game I have played so far (Super Metroid 1994, Fusion 2002 and Zero Mission 2004). It had everything I like in a game besides the hidden items...simply cannot find them sometimes...I had to look on the internet.. I played this game 6 years ago when I bought a 3DS. I decided to replay it in anticipation of the new Metroid game coming out this weekend. I've not played any Metroid game other than this one, and while I anticipated the plot to be light, I didn't realize it would result in the game being only about 10 hours long (4:45 on my playthrough- I guess I died a lot?). A lot of the game seems to be involved in finding secrets, but I found this to be more tedious than enjoyable- basically, I found myself throwing bombs at every wall and floor in hopes of finding a secret, or a place to advance the level. In fact, it seems that at least once every level you have to bomb an inconspicuous part of the wall in order to advance, or find a secret corridor as a ball. It didn't make me like the game any more, which made me wish it had been more straightforward and less frustrating. I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable, although one-sided. Samus is a killing machine, but she takes a lot of damage when she gets hit. Luckily, most of the enemies don't have ranged attacks, so it's easy to avoid most damage. Boss fights were slightly more challenging- basically, I would spend one life in order to find the bosses weakness, die, load my save, and then abuse the weakness through brute force. Not too difficult, until the final boss, which provided a real challenge. Overall, I enjoyed the game and its mechanics (due to the quick pace of the game, upgrades came fast and furious, which was enjoyable), but I hope that the new 3DS game coming out introduces something a little beyond what we see here.. My first introduction to the metroid games and it has hooked me, this game is a masterpiece, it looks stunning on the GBA and plays just as good with the controls feeling spot on, this game has me very hyped for the upcoming samus returns and has made me a metroid fan. It is really impressive how much atmosphere this game mages to project, with a combination of great visuals and soundtrack, truly a masterpiece.. I was never a huge Metroid fan, but playing Metroid Fusion as a child was an amazing experience for me and a great hook to the decades long franchise. Even as an adult with a critical eye Metroid Fusion is nothing short of absolute brilliance with the way it handles its shooting/platform/exploration style. Its story is very well done, with the pacing of the next big around every corner feels genius and never dull at all. The atmosphere is surprisingly spectacular, with a touch of a dark element that almost at times makes it feel like a horror game more than a shooter. The SA-X are outstanding in putting tension and even dread into players when forced to run from them. Some of bosses also have this sort of creepy and dark aura about them that made them unsettling to fight (and this mind you is all on a handheld game where compromises are made instead of being put on a console. IF Metroid Prime is the magnum opus of Nintendo's console shooters (and all shooters in general), then Metroid Fusion is the magnum opus of Nintendo's handheld devices when it comes to 2D shooters. The only drawbacks are minimal, but perhaps the difficulty could be a bit hard for newcomers. I definitely was overwhelmed when I, a noobie, had to rush to a reactor core system under a time limit and fight everything along the way. Some environmental spots are not as clearly defined and traps can be a bit cheap. The Frost X for instance can go through walls to attack Samus, which I can say is a bit unfair. Nitpicks aside, Metroid Fusion is a brilliant handheld game that can still please my adult mind as much as when I was a little kid.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 8.7 - Came close to being a 9/10, but the main flaw of this metroid game is the cheap difficulty at times, specifically The Nightmare boss. Otherwise, it still has the core elements of metroid that are good along with decent environments and missions.. I'm a big fan of 2D sidescrolling platformers. I also love Sci-Fi. And atmospheric games? There's nothing better. Metroid: Fusion is a perfect version of all these things. As a sidescroller, it feels good to play, with Samus' missiles being incredibly satisfying to shoot and her controls tight. Everything looks and sounds amazing and the enemy designs are some of the best I've ever seen (and some of the bosses are gaming gold). The game gets legitimately scary; not only are you all alone in the BSL station, but occasionally you'll encounter a particularly frightening enemy known as the SA-X that is far more powerful than you. These sections of the game become a sort of stealth mode where you'll have to hide and wait for the SA-X to pass you by. One part in particular stands out: a terrifying section where you have to run directly past the SA-X, in full view, and shake it off before it can blast you to pieces with its lasers. The game's reasonably lengthy and is pretty difficult to 100%, so it's probably worth whatever you're paying for it. Especially since it's so darn good. It's also my favorite game, by the way. Just putting that out there.. A game that anyone can enjoy if you like games with good mysteries and a story well worked, with a comfortable gameplay and levels with interesting level designs. I recommend this game. Some people seem to think the game is too linear, but to find all the items I can guarantee you will be fumbling around for hours. I personally think it's a great balance of story and exploration. I think the gameplay and level designed has been refined from Super Metroid (which is a great game as well, don't get me wrong). This is probably my favorite Metroid game so far.. My personal favorite 2D Metroid game. The music and graphics are great. The gameplay is very polished and the boss fights are some of the best in the series. Metroid Fusion also has great atmosphere. The only flaw about this game is how linear it can be at times, but besides that this game is a must have.. Yeah, the computer guide is annoying, and you don't have as much freedom to explore, but this is still a fantastic game. Love the WiiU version -- plays so well and looks great on the gamepad.. An excellent GBA platformer. Great story, more action-packed than previous Metroid games, great soundtrack and beautiful visuals. While the game is very linear, in contrast to previous Metroid games, this game is excellent and easily one of the best games on the GBA.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My first Metroid and it was a great experience! Such great mix of exploring, adventure and action in 2D that was just amazing for that time. The bosses were really unique and challenging. That is for sure a must-buy.. Excellent game faithful to the SNES title. Too bad Nintendo stoped making theese. It would accompany well enough on DS and 3DS parallell 2D games to the franchise.. It is like Megaman and Castlevania in a cool scifi setting with evil space parasites! Best Metroid on GBA because it looks and plays better than Zero Mission.. Metroid Fusion is a near perfect 2D adventure game. The controls are pinpoint precise, the music and sound design are excellent and the famous atmosphere of the Metroid series has been carried over exactly. The difficulty is just about right too. There are some challenging bosses to be dealt with (namely the SA-X chase sequence and Nightmare) but nothing feels over-the-top unlike Metroid Prime 2. the level design is fantastic too. Due to the game's more plot heavy nature, you've always got an objective to take care of. This makes the game more accessible than previous Metroid games. That said, the game still gives you more than enough exploration to do and parts like the AQA labyrinth will have you scratching your head and begging for a guide! Basically speaking, I love Metroid Fusion. It's one of my favorite 2D games of all time and a worthy successor to legendary Super Metroid.. Metroid Fusion is a great game. The graphics, controls and music are excellent in the game and these are things that I have come to expect in the Metroid series.. Metroid Fusion is not only my favorite metroid game but one of my favorite games in general. Now most people write this game off due to it's linear approach because most metroid games pride themselves in being non linear. But Metroid Fusion decides to go linear and it actually works for this game. its also quite a lengthy game too. PLEASE pick this game up I just can't do it justice.. A good game that might seem like loads of fun but also frustrates with a high difficulty level. Since the save points are rooms that you find throughout the levels, there might be unnecessary travel between a load point and the bosses you will almost invar","the first 50% of this game seemed really slow to me . the game is also way more linear than the other games . the bosses are a lot of fun, and the mystery and atmosphere stand above a lot of the games in the rest of the series ."
194.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is best game ever and blood andvine is best dlc ever.. The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine is the second and the last expansion to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a legendary action RPG game. This expansion was released in 2016, a year after the release of the main game. Simply put, this is a work of art, one of the best expansions of all times, hell, one of the best gaming experiences of my life. What a great way to end the Witcher trilogy. All the great aspects of the main game are kept and, if anything, enhanced and expanded upon. The story takes place a couple of years after the events of The Witcher 3 and deals with a completely unrelated subject in a new, truly fantastic region. Namely: Geralt has to deal with a powerful vampire in the duchy of Toussaint. So a completely new story and a drastic change in scenery. But the game still keeps the magnificent Witcher atmosphere and stays true to the lore and to the fans' wildest dreams. The scenery itself could not be more different from the war-torn Velen or the weather-worn isles of Skellige. The duchy of Toussaint is a small, secluded land where time has stopped and the virtuous knights-errant fight villains and monsters (and windmills, naturally) and save maidens in distress. Toussaint is so brilliantly colorful that it truly feels like a fairy tale land. But first looks can be deceiving and (in a typically cynical Witcher way) the game lets you explore and unearth all the carefully hidden pain, suffering, lies, machinations, deception and horrors which are hidden just underneath the surface of the fairy tale. I really loved it so much. The characters are new and interesting (with one unexpectedly returning good old friend) and are very well written and believable. The side quests are very diverse, fascinating and full of that good ol’ dark, gritty, cynical Witcher humor. The main story is fascinating with several huge, but believable, surprises. There is a plethora of new monsters, many of them returning for the first time since the original Witcher game, thus beautifully closing the circle. There are many new Witcher armor and weapon sets, each with a very interesting quest. Gwent is back in full swing (this time with a new faction). Well, all of that together makes one of the greatest atmospheres that you can imagine in a video game. It’s new and yet still the same. Exactly how we like it. Oh, and it is pretty big for an expansion. It took me about 40 hours to complete Blood and Wine on a PC Master Race playthrough. Obviously, no microtransactions and no SJW. I must admit that I never gave CDPR the trust that they (so far) deserved. All four of their major games (W1, W2, W3 and Cyberpunk) I underestimated before release and even though I was proven the fool four times in a row, and even though I truly loved all those games, here I am, about to do it again. But I dare to say, this time, it is warranted, and I am far from being the only one to be skeptical. I am talking, of course, about the first trailer for The Witcher 4. I always knew that they would never be able to stay away from the world of Witcher for long and so here it is, and I must say, based on what I have seen in the trailer, I am far from impressed. You know exactly what I am talking about. Sadly, CDPR is not the company it once was. Many talented developers have moved on and the company itself has moved towards catering to modern audiences and I do think this is going to end well. Time will tell and if they prove me wrong for the fifth time in a row, I will truly be the fool (and glad for it).Anyway, Blood and Wine is a perfect example of how to make a great expansion to a great game. How to give the players something new and yet stay true to what they all loved. Absolute masterpiece. Final Verdict: 98 %. Would give ass to play the next part today<3333333333333333333333333333333333. Great expansion of the already very good main game. Even more interesing quests and characters.. B.O. R. I. N. G. So many chores to do and the story not intriguing to me, and the combat system is meh, just like the base game. Gameplay is slightly boring, story good though, still it's a game not a movie. The best game I've ever played. I'm waiting for the Ukrainian localization in the new part. I hope in the near future the developers will inform us about the possible release date. The ceiling for rpg storytelling and this entire art form called video game. Fairy tales with different choices and endings fascinatingly told in the best dlc ever made.. This DLC is a dream come true, beautiful scenery, music, history and combat. Blood and Wine IS THE DLC OF THE DECADE, no other!. Easily one of my favourite games of all time. Now that the bugs are ironed out the game is just such a joy to play. The narrative is superb, build diversity is great, sword play feels good, signs feel good and death March difficulty is extremely fun and punishing. side quests in this game feel like main quests in others. Definitely a great time and holds up modern day.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. *Blood and Wine* is an extraordinary expansion that adds hours of high-quality content to *The Witcher 3*, taking Geralt to the enchanting region of Toussaint—a vibrant, idyllic land inspired by medieval France. Beneath its charm, however, Toussaint hides dark mysteries and a supernatural threat that only Geralt can confront. The story is captivating, exploring themes of honor, love, and monstrosity, and it introduces memorable new characters and moral choices that test the player’s **** expansion also offers a wide range of new activities, including an advanced mutation system that allows Geralt to unlock new abilities. Side quests are crafted with the same attention to detail as the main storyline, featuring moments of humor and eeriness that add a variety of tone and atmosphere.Visually, *Blood and Wine* is a triumph: the brightness and vivid colors of Toussaint contrast beautifully with the darker environments of the base game, creating a unique visual experience. The soundtrack is equally rich and captivating, with melodies that reflect the lively and noble character of the region.Overall, *Blood and Wine* elevates *The Witcher 3* experience, delivering a beautiful, immersive adventure that is as engaging as it is expansive.. It is 2024 , 2025 is lurking and still not a single GameDev has managed to ever deliver a game that would be even close to this phenomenal experience. I am currently replaying the game for 5th time. Top to bottom , as every time, still I manage to find some new things. It's even more amazing now with the Redit Tool they added to it. Brawo.. For a dlc this blew my mind how big it is. Its just wow. Its longer than most triple a games, better looking, better story, better characters, its just a game on its own, thats still one of the best rpgs ever. best DLC in history! the classic top quality from CDPR. has the dilemma of choice all the time making people follow the story from the beginning. blood and wine set an unreachable bar for DLC quality and size!. Good interactive movie but terrible as a game. One of the worst games I have ever played.. The best game in the world, try this game, this is truly the pinnacle of the game, I have 530 hours in this game and I was not bored even for an hour of 530 hours. play this game. I almost cried man. the witcher 3 is an experience I think I will never relive again. Everything in this game is top notch.. A completely new experience and as exceptional as the original work itself. In fact, it is fair to say that The Witcher 3 would never be what it is without this complementary masterpiece, in fact, because it is so incredible, it has become mandatory.. Thought it was the right expansion for The Witcher 3. I especially loved the design and the story.. no one will complain about it this the best DLC in historic from the best game ever. The base game is 10/10, Blood and Wine makes it an 11. Masterclass in making a DLC.. ""Blood & Wine"" is a transcendent DLC that, much like Hearts of Stone and the base game, left me in awe. Words can scarcely capture the emotions I experienced while playing it. The story is intricately woven, rich with depth, and brought to life through exhilarating missions, epic boss battles, and unforgettable characters. The new map is a masterpiece of design, offering a fresh and authentic atmosphere that stands out brilliantly. The soundtrack is a work of art, sending chills down your spine and drawing you even deeper into the world. The abundance of new side missions, weapons, upgrades, and intriguing places to explore adds immense value to the game. It provides a perfect and satisfying conclusion, further cementing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as the greatest game ever made, and establishing Blood & Wine as the best DLC ever created, in my opinion.. best dlc I've ever played an entire new world with it's beautiful landscapes and architecture, fascinating characters and touching story. The best dlc i ever played.100+ hours gameplay,very good,interesting main story and very good ending of Geralt's trilogy.. best dlc of all time new map more cards for gwent goated story more of geralt nothing beat that. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing expansion that enhances the experience of the best game via narrative, art direction and gameplay. I couldn't have asked for a better add on to my favorite game of all time.. Perfect story,better than game. If you played the game, you should play this DLC. DLC it was perfect. amazing dlc, but arguably the hearts of stone expansion was better. but thisis till worth playing. Beatiful game without any problems! Best story, best characters, combat system is actually good if looking at other games.. A truly masterpiece,I don't know how you can do a better game. This is really in touch with the source material, there are thousands of references to the books along the game, wich makes it beautiful unlike the series adaptation. Blood and Wine is the crowning achievement of Geralt of Rivia's story. The magnificent scenery of the fairytale land of Toussaint, a captivating story with numerous twists, new Witcher skills (mutations), and an enhancement of the Witcher gear, expanded by the addition of the new School of Manticore. An absolute gem!. One of the best games I have ever played in my life. It's really a masterpiece. Great atmosphere, great writing, great almost everything. I didn't finish the game because I am not a big fan of the particular genre, but the game is really, really good.. am rating this as a DLC inside of the game, not the game **** OF THE BEST RPGS EVER MADE10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I am rating this as a DLC inside of the game, not the game itself. Is perfect, it add a new whole area with a lot of quests and content, an epic storyline with different endings and tough decisions. Even it adds new soundtracks. Itis brilliant.. This, along with Elden Ring, Red Dead Redemption 2, the last Zelda games and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are the best open worlders ever made. Period.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This expansion could stand on its own as a separate game. Great story, great music, and introducing more characters from the books.. The best game that humanity has created !. One of the best, and maybe the best expansion in history for a game. The story is as good or maybe better than the base game. Toussaint region is very nice like the new mutagens mechanics added in this DLC.. Feels more like a new game than a dlc. CDP created a new game and called it an expansion.. best game ever. I think game is good. but ı confused how I play. because of this when I was 3 level ı went to level 20 monsters. I think firstly you should read the informations. if ubisoft was publisher of the witcher they would've sell this as the witcher 4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine is the best expansion for the game, hands down. It features some of the most varied and interesting questlines ever seen in a game, as well as the beautiful and engaging environment of Toussaint. The story is gripping, and the choices you make have real consequences that shape the game. The combat is some of the best we’ve seen in the series, and the character interactions and dialogue are top notch. The array of new enemies and monsters you get to face off against in the expansion makes it one of the most exciting and challenging experiences in the series.. Absolutely marvelous afterword for the Witcher saga. it is a story of Geralt settling-up in some far-far-away land. There will be no main characters from the original saga and this is good thing because Geralt is starting a new life there.. The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine DLC stands as an extraordinary augmentation to an already renowned and outstanding franchise, which is regarded as one of the finest RPGs in history. This expansion excels in every facet, encompassing a captivating storyline, a meticulously crafted world, and well-developed characters. It stands as the epitome of gaming excellence. Additionally, its substantial value for money is undeniable, boasting an abundance of content that far surpasses that of recent AAA titles, rendering them pale in comparison.. A beautiful send off to a great character with a beautiful scenery that differentiates the dlc from the rest of the game. This game is LEGENDARY! One of the best games of all time. The story, music, characters, the world, it's all so good! The developers poured so much of their love and passion into this and it absolutely shows. Don't hesitate, play this absolute masterpiece!. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. MASTERPIECe! A fresh breath after the main game which is actualy great but a bit pessimistic and gray.. Beautiful end of whole series. I was sad and happy seeing the last scene, a lot of emotions.. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. Very nice addition to the main game. Touissaint is very climatic place with excellent wine. Now this was truly an expansion to the game unlike Hearts of Stone. An entirely new land was created with Toussaint, a duchy under Nilfgaard, and boy was it beautiful. The sun shone, it never was rainy and gloomy, and I didn’t have to hear one hacking cough in a crowd or pamp-pamp-pa-ram. The main quest line was great; it really held mystery and intrigue that you slowly unraveled as you went along. It never showed its hand too early. The characters were fleshed out and ones that were in the books were given greater backstory. I had a ton of fun with a part of the payment Geralt is given for his contract. It was a real nice touch and something that Geralt truly deserved after a lifetime of being on the road monster hunting. I don’t want to say too much as that would spoil the story but this was a really great expansion and the ending was a beautiful wrap-up to Geralt’s story. This was a far superior product than the base game. It was obvious that CDPR learned from it; the animations, the cinematics, the quest structures, the characters, all were better here and had me actually caring what the end result would be. I could feel the love and care that went into Blood and Wine.. Blood and Wine could be a stand alone game, the fact it is a DLC is outstanding. It opens up a whole new map, with numerous side quests and an intriguing story. Touissaint is gorgeous, like stepping into a fairy tale. Probably one of the best DLC ever released.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. Better than the original game .. Personally, I like Blood and Wine more than the main story. It's definitely because of Toussaint and the characters but honestly, this expansion is better than a lot of full RPG games!. whole new game that much much much better than stone hearts and tbh may even be better than main game! i really loved it. For 20 dollars you get: - awhole new zone, as large as velen at least - dozens of hours of new quests -awesome new gear - awesome new way to spend your perk points by a new mutagen upgrade system - amazing new characters, with awesome fight scenes. - new player house/ villa 10/10, a DLC for The best game of all time, what are you waiting?. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 10.. What a good story and a very different setting in contrast to the original game.. For joining to henocide of innocent people. We will still play your games but we will not pay for them. one of the best games I've ever played one of the best games I've ever played. Could have been a game itself, Blood and Wine is an absolute masterpiece of an expansion. Even though its main story isn't anything crazy, it's still interesting and the new additional characters are great. Toussaint is the best map in the entire game, it's very big, looks gorgeous and there is a ridiculous amount content. I can sit here and talk for hours how insane the amount of content is, so many things to do, so many interesting side quests and storylines... it's honestly groundbreaking. Last but not least, there are also some new armor sets and weapons which are pretty cool. This is without a doubt the best expansion I've ever played. Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.. It will be your in top 3 game iam sure. Trust me you want to finish this game. And dont forget play Blood and wine DLC at any way you can. One of the best pieces of DLC ever released, could have easily been its own game.. its one of the best dlc i've ever played, new map, story, u can even have own home. just great, recommend it. by far the best dlc in video games history and it's not even arguable since no dlc has ever come close to this masterpiece.. Blood and Wine is a step back from the original game. I did not find the majority of the quests very interesting. On the other hand, the graphics look a bit better than the original game. Landscape is more beautiful and thus, it is more fun to ride Roach in Blood and Wine. In terms of characters, I have found Regis to be one of the most interesting ones in the Witcher universe. Other than Regis though, most characters are pretty forgettable, similar to Blood and Wine quests. Finally, I had to lower down the difficulty when fighting Dettlaff due to the sudden spike in difficulty. Dettlaff boss fight offered a challenge unlike any other encounter in Witcher 3, but not necessarily a more enjoyable one. Overall, I can recommend Blood and Wine if you have enjoyed both Witcher 3 and the first expansion. If you did not find them very interesting, your experience won’t get better in Blood and Wine.. 9/10 ️ - Amazing (after completing the DLC) A new, beautiful land, many new features and side quests, and a long, very good main storyline. Many hours of great fun and a satisfying ending. I'd like more. Unfortunately, this time some side quests are just repetitive time stuffers. Not all of them, so there's still a lot of really cool stuff. As many others who weren't impressed with the main game, i also tried this dlc and while it's long, it's basically same thing all over again.. SHORZZ / The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine: It's not like a dlc, it's like a new game. As always, they both increased the quality and stayed true to the book. For this Dlc alone, walking around Tossaint and experimenting with atmosphere, vampire hunting and music is truly worth the experience and time.. I rather watch paint dry than play this again, what a joke ****. So many bugs, story is meh.. Overall huge waste of time, played it 6 hours or so, then gave up. I was like ""why am i playing this boring game?"", so yeah. There's so much better games out there. Graphics were ok i guess, everything else is generic at best.. Pretty bad dlc, i would rather recommend playing something that is actually good like Spider-Man 2018, Half Life 2 or Red Dead Redemption 2.. I didn't like the main story, so i was hoping maybe dlc is better, but sadly it's even worse than main game.. A DLC with about 40 hours of content which they could have easily call it The Witcher 4 and released it for 60$ instead they called it a DLC and sold it for 15$ Awesome epic quest hunting the beast of Beauclair, amazing soundtrack, beautiful new region, new armour and weapons sets, more witcher gear. New items, new dye system. So much top quality side quests. This is a totally different experience than the main game but with the same quality if not. better. This is a must play if you liked the base game! 10/10. Alongside hearths of stone, blood and wine is arguably the greatest video game DLC ever made. The Dlc is so large it could be a a game on its own and it does pretty much everything the base game did. With a beautiful area to explore and a story worth playing experiencing, it is certainly worth the money. When we talk about the best game in history, this game is true masterpiece and has no weaknesses. The best DLC ever made. It is so good that the best expansions from others games looks like trash compared to this one. The story is excellent, with amazing characters like Regis, who is returning from the books, the soundtrack is terrific, the gameplay was improved by adding grandmaster witcher armors and new relic swords, Skellige Deck was added and the side quests are one of the best in the entire game, especially ""The Warble of A Smitten Knight"" and ""A Knight's Tale"". Also, this dlc is more then 20 hours long and it is very cheap, what shows how much CD Projekt Red valued its fans and not the money, unlike most of the companies out there.. This is how DLC should be done! Вот как нужно делать DLC!. Unlike the original storyline that is long and boring, Blood and Wine provides you 5 hours of great cutscenes and 3 hours of okay gameplay. This DLC is a better interactive film than Heavy Rain and Detroit. It literally highlights positivities and buries negativities of the original Witcher 3. One of the best DLCs ever. And I'm not even starting about non-story positivities of this DLC.. Best DLC ever. You get so much hours of gameplay, many other game studios could make 2 games out of it. And the quality of the DLC - same as the main game. Touissant is breathtaking.. Blood and Wine is the peak of what an expansion for a game should be. Hearts of Stone was pretty good, but this is on another level. From the atmosphere to all the callbacks from Witcher 1. Overall an epic experience.. The best DLC for my favourite RPG game. Completed fully with all sidequests. i want to know who thought that doing a fight with an enemy that that turns into a indestructable heat seeking missle that stun-locks and kills you when you get hit once in the beggining of the DLC? Oh and did I mension that you get ""help"" from a knight that can also die and restart the fight? Oh and his AI thinks he is fighting a drowner or something and just runs into the monster and dies every minute. Oh i didn't mention that you take around 0.5% of his health in one hit and he instantly hits you back takeing 90% of your health? And this is just an example im currently a few hours in and i'm stuck on a enemy 5 levels below me that insta kills me for some reason?! Aside from that the DLC has been great but combat is kindo a big part of an RPG as well as ability to progress a quest that you ""could have done"" when you were 5 levels worse. Very good DLC, in my opinion, the best in the game, and it is really worth buying and playing.. CD Projekt Red's DLC policies are one of the best in the industry. It's very cheap and very, very well-made. The expansion could be a separate game for all I care, it's just so exceptional and huge.. The best DLC ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. how this is a dlc i mean how this is a DLC ? i played dlcs before alootttt still cant belive it. omggggg the story the world charechater details it just woooow legendryyyyy. This expansion is a gift for us gamers, its a huge expansion with lots of high quality content, new beautiful area, amazing new story and characters, gameplay improvements, better enemies and boss fights and amazing new music. Its the best DLC for a game you can buy, its cheap and its great content. If you give this DLC a low score you are disgusting, this DLC is the best example of what DLC should offer for $ you pay, it does not steal your money it is not a cash grab, it respects you and rewards you with worthy content.. Repetitive,clunky, horse riding **** ......,...................,........... one of the best DLC ever created is almost an new game,the map is beautiful and huge. Blood and wine looks more like a whole game than a DLC, something that I think has never happened in the gaming industry. Excellent story, gameplay, characters, graphics, setting, little to say. It's the best DLC ever AND AS SUCH i give it a 10.. That’s how you make paid Expansions, Learn a bit AAA studios. 20$ for 20hours of QUALITY playtime.. it's not just an add-on. it's a full self-esteemed game. masterpiece, than's cdpred for all the hours I've spent in blood and wine and all witcher 3. If I thought Hearts of Stone was completly detached from the main story, imagine this DLC. It goes all in with It's premise in the title, contains, again, great characters and story. But you could say out of all the stories presented the one of the sisters Annarietta and Syanna have the weakest ending (Out of all the possibles).. This one is even better than a common game. It’s big as Witcher 3, and please, buy game with that addiction.. Best DLC I ever played in my entire life, fantastic story, fantastic new characters writing. New monsters, new atmosphere, new location called ""Toussaint"" is nicely welcomed, feels like a complete new game, still a lot of new content added, side quests are as good as the original TW3 game. This DLC sometimes seemed even better than the main game.. Very intensive DLC for one of the best games ever made! Feels like DLC as it should be. If you were not played it before... buy and play it now!. One of the best DLC ever made, full of new content. Excellent expansion for a incredible game.. This expansion was good, I liked the story and the location. + interesting characters.. Growing up, Bethesda used to be my favorite RPG maker. Now CDPR has taken their spot. Witcher 3 is not a game you hop in and out of 5 minutes at a time, but if you wanna sink 40-50 hours into some of the most compelling storytelling and breathtaking scenery youll find in a video game, this is well worth it. I wish I could erase my memory and play it again as a first timer!. DLC of the decade for me, clearly the best DLC of all times. It doesn't mean there are no flaws. Nevertheless, I've spent the most time in Witcher world than other singleplayer games. I recommend every person on the world to purchase this game on GOG to support developers. Any other game that will beat Witcher 3 is Cyberpunk 2077. Polska górą!. Great game, with good gameplay. Amazing Story with good write characters. Excellent create world.. Incredible expansion, could have been a game itself. Even though the story isn't anything spectacular, it's still interesting, and the characters are amazing. Toussaint is the best map in the game, it's very big, it looks fantastic and there is so much content, 100% worth playing!. Theres Regis what more do you want. And also Shani how can it not be **** amazing.. When the DLC is better than the main game, blood and wine is the best dlc ever made it makes the witcher 3 which is already a masterpiece even better. the story is amazing with well written characters and the world is beautiful and they improve boss fights and gameplay in it, they also add new gwent set of cards and new soundtrack its like a main game packed inside a dlc, deserves 10/10 and if i can give it 20/10 i will, if you enjoyed witcher 3 its essential to play this.. It's like a mini Witcher 3 with a new map filled with great little stories and adventures. Every great aspect of the Witcher 3 feels more focused here, while many of the base game flaws are addressed. The overall quality and length for the price are almost unmatched, and the experience by itself could pass as a standalone game.. Video game made art. This might be the most impressive and enjoyable experience I had playing any video game ever. Elevates video games to new levels. Looking at any part of the landscape is like looking at a mastercrafted piece of art. The characters and the story are delicious. You feel like your answers will get one or another character killed so you are mindful about what you answer and really puts in in character.. IMO this DLC was apotheosis of all games created by CD Projekt RED. Wild Hunt had certain flaws, because the story in it was too large-scale. On the contrary, in Blood and Wine developers found golden ratio of the size of story. Small quests are awesome, and main story is thrilling and had unexpected turns.. Great Expansion Pack! Indeed a must play on its own. Though there is not much development concerning Geralt as a character, it leaves plenty of room for the other characters to get their own lights. A very mature plot and very intriguing as one progresses more and more, but side quests can get a little tiring from time to time, something that would not be a problem if you consider that as a way to get back to the main quests and get as less distractions as possible. Not to say that the side quests are boring or anything, in fact it is really impressive how the developers can still pull out fresh and interesting side quests, but there are some side quests that will make you want to finish them already and move on to some other more interesting things to do. Talking about the new map, it is really glorious, different, marvelous, absorbing and quite well contrasted from all the other maps already placed in the game; one can feel the owe when discovering these new lands once again. Even the people can differ a lot from the folk from the north and Nifgaard. The people of Toussaint are even more polite! The new system of character development, involving the creation of new powerful mutagens, is satisfactorily justified with a really interesting side quest to get them activated. Overall, a very pleasing story to enjoy. Characters with their own motivations and way of thinking that make up for a great story that wil put a nice ""goodbye for now"" to this incredible universe. With, yet again, another really pleasing and nostalgic surprise at the very end of the main story... well of course it's CD Projekt Red so it might depend on your previous decisions from point 0 of the game.. Honestly my favorite of the two dlc's. This Story is INSANE the farther you get into it. Literally the only thing keeping this from a 10 in my opinion was the fact that because it was in a hotter realm, they decided to add mosquito sounds when bugs were near by and that just annoyed me personally. This DLC is a must play if you haven't for some reason.. This is how you make a great DLC to your game - other developers should learn from this... I just started playing this game in 2019. Now after hundreds of hours into the game I can comfortably say that this has been the best game I have ever played!. While the spectacular world and the beautiful backstory surrounding the characters will awe you, the main story unfortunately comes extremely short and below average quality of typical RPGs. There is a clear effort put into the sidequests of the game but the main journey that the characters take feel quite forced and limited due to the nature of the game needing to finish the Wild Hunt arc of the story in one game. The controls of the main character feels extremely stiff due to wanting to emphasize the stylish nature of combat Geralt takes. This is ","the Witcher 3: Blood and Wine is the second and last expansion to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt . the story takes place a couple of years after the events of the main game and deals with a powerful vampire in the duchy of Toussaint . the side quests are very diverse, fascinating and full of that good ol' dark, gritty, cynical Witcher humor ."
195.Final Fantasy VI,"Greatest of all time. Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. Legend among legends. Peak Final Fantasy.. Play the SNES version for F sake! it's called FFIII! Yea in the west it used to be called FF3!!. I have to say that Final Fantasy VI is by far my favorite Final Fantasy after beating it. It blends story, character, and atmosphere better than any other Final Fantasy game I have played so far. Kefka does an amazing job as a villain, and the cast of characters are largely fun to interact with and feel unique from each other both mechanically and visually.. Amazing game, and a good port. The extra summons, bosses and dungeons are great additions. Very disappointed at quality of the music compared to the original, and despite the hardware limitations i wish a better work were done to remaster or change the songs.. I always think that pixel art has been very mature, so in my opinion, the picture performance and details of FF6 are still enough to see now. The characters' facial expressions, small movements, and micro-expressions can all be well expressed. For example, Locke and Sally's embarrassed expressions after blushing are really vivid. In terms of systems, what surprises me is that there are many characters in the game, each of which has its own unique system. The dog is so cool... But since I learned the creation and automatic resurrection, I have started to create the world plus the soul of the magician, and the three-star ring has no brain output. My personal favorite part is the portrayal of the character image and the plot performance of the game. While the lines of this work are short and concise, the expressiveness of the characters and the appeal of the plot are not diminished at all. It provides players with a feeling space that can only be understood. Although Tina is the heroine of this work, except for the few descriptions of gogo, snowman, and Mogu, each of the remaining characters is portrayed in a very balanced manner, and the characteristics of each character are almost from the appearance to the ending. are unchanged. From the old man to the child, the flirtatious king and the bear-like younger brother, in a memory of the castle, show the different pursuits and realistic responsibilities of the two brothers, deep in self-blame until the world collapses and want to resurrect their girlfriend Locke, who redeemed her past self with the remaining power of the phoenix, and the shy Sharis who longed for acceptance, dedicated an eternal classic picture on the night of the opera, The dull Jiayuan who doesn't understand machinery and loves his wife and children, shed tears in the farewell of the magic train, and shed tears in the nightmare, and Lim, who vividly showed the image of the little adult with the words ""pervert, ten years old"", hit the enemy behind The old naughty grandpa who jumps up happily, Jessia who misses his friends, everyone's partner who is not good at talking but gentle, Tina who is gentle and strong, Use just a few dreams and the last line to portray the still-existing shadow, the reliable pursuer, the Mog behind the world after the collapse, oh yes, and the cheap purple octopus (how, again Is it me, angry? Angry?). . . . . . Everyone has their moments of brilliance. As for Jefka, it's hilarious and wicked throughout. At the end of the game, during the final battle, everyone found what they wanted to protect, love, people to protect, wife and children in their hearts, friends and relatives, the mission of governing the country, my elder brother, and people who accepted me , grandfather and grandchildren, friends' wings, companions and everyone who went to the end. . . . . . As long as there is hope and something to protect, the world is far from being destroyed.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Strong port of the best RPG on the SNES, and one of the best RPGs ever created. A GBA essential purchase.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this sixth game in the series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If this is not the greatest RPG of all time it sure is on the list for the debate. Great to see this amazing game portable! A true classic.. The Best RPG of the History. Period. El mejor RPG de la historia. Punto..... final fantasy 6 is the best final fantasy game. and kefka is better than sephiroth. not even close. Information: . The original game is from 1994. There are N versions for various platforms that are just adapted versions of the original with almost no changes. . The review is based on what was possible at the time of release. So, you can't demand better graphics for a 1994 game. Historical time matters. --> Positive points: . Not having a defined protagonist (it's up to the player) was creative. . It brings a classic RPG experience that for beginners will be fantastic and solid for veterans. . Good sidequests --> Negative points: . Random encounters battle system. In a J-RPG supposedly the player should explore, but the random encounters move the player in another direction. . It doesn't explore antagonist's point of view. Why did he do it? What is his motivations? Ex: Kefka or Empire ways was a mystery all game long. . The larger plot is shallow. The antagonistic side is very bad and only does evil for no clear reason and the protagonist's side is very good and only does the right things. Shounen anime style. . Unmemorable characters. Due to their excess. Example: Do you remember the name of the little girl who likes to paint?. An amazing story unfolds as you lead a big roster of heroes against the vile plans of an evil emperor (and a his diabolic jester). Every character feels vivid and special, with his own backstory and motives. The scenario is outstanding, with numerous breathtaking, sad or hilarious moments and some unforgettable twists. One of the best RPGs of all time!. Bad -can’t feel level ups because it switches your party a lot, DQ4 did this well -Magitek Factory is a convoluted mess -feels like little parts of story are missing, you don’t understand why a character changed -this mine cart video is **** -sad music vibe is too constant -shops still open when city is on fire and everyone is running around, very immersion breaking -lots of people sadly putting their head down and sayings someone’s name with a dot dot dot -people will just say stuff to each other out of the blue, like will I ever be able to love someone, when it makes absolutely no sense and you’re supposed to think it’s soulful writing, it’s bad, I think most fans played this when they were just starting teen-hood and thought because it was sad it was cool adult writing Good -art design minus ponytails -exciting surprises -atmosphere -Espers add a cool and slightly confusing layer to leveling up a character. Final Fantasy VI is almost a cult not only within the series but in games in general and enhances everything that has been done so far. Breaking the commonplace in which the series found itself, the game takes us out of the fantasy environment and puts us in a more futuristic, almost steampunk universe, a model that began to be followed by the successors. So expect to see several steam engines and technologies, metal castles, not to mention the darker tone that the game automatically acquires. The plot tells a world that forgot magic, a thousand years after a great war between mythical entities. Rebuilt by the power of machines, an empire wants to have the power of witchcraft in its hands again by collecting creatures called Espers. This is where the game begins, with two soldiers talking in the snow, using huge mechanical armor to get around and among them is a third person, a quiet girl with green hair, her name is Terra, the only human born with magical powers. After an accident, she ends up joining a rebel group that fights against the empire and its greed for power. This is where the interaction of the characters, their motivations and personalities comes in. FF6 has developed its cast in such an incredible way that it is admirable today, being one of the great pillars created within the franchise and for which it is so popular and relevant today. With a cast of 14 characters with a lot of personality and charisma, there are touching stories of sacrifice, such as that of Locke or Edgar and Sabin, when they take away who will inherit the throne. In others, the scenes are of pure desolation, of mourning. And there's the famous Celes opera scene, one of the most memorable moments ever seen anywhere. And this is not only reflected in the development of the game, but also the combat is greatly interfered by its individualities. Each character has a pre-defined class that assigns them with particular items and accessories and a unique command. Locke, for example, can steal items from enemies, while Edgar fights machines that have special effects. Sabin has blows like fighting games and Setzer uses luck as a weapon. There are definitely no main characters, everyone in the group is important and you will learn to tap into the potential of each, and there are even parts where the player divides the group into a few units and controls them all - one at a time, of course - in a kind of real-time strategy. The game is notoriously divided into two main parts, the first more focused on introducing the world and the characters, and then twists and turns come in and the second part comes in., which is practically an open world with secrets and places to explore. So starting from this act, you need the famous grind, common in any RPG of the time in order to make your team more competitive to adversity, but in Final Fantasy VI it is done in an incredible way, becoming much less boring than usual and rewarding a lot well the player, either with items or even with scenes that further develop the characters that could pass beats. And I can't finish the analysis without mentioning the excellent audio work of the game, considered by many to be the best soundtrack in the series. Composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a recurring name throughout the franchise, it is difficult not to be touched by the melancholy of the theme of the character Terra, for example, as well as the ""Aria di Mezzo Carattere"", from the famous opera scene that I mentioned. And the piece that plays in the final boss is one of the most epic songs I've ever heard, with a duration of 15 minutes that extends into a spectacular battle.. Brilliant game. One of the best for its time and one of the best final fantasy games. The story in this game is one of the best I've ever seen in a video game. It's incredible well written, interesting and very engaging. The characters are amazing. It has a very large cast with some very memorable party members. The music is unbeatable. One of the best soundtracks ever made. The graphics where amazing for its time. The bosses where amazing. The combat was very diverse for its time. FF6 is not without its flaws however. The randomised battles can be a pain at times, there are times where there are far too many battles. The difficulty can also vary from being too easy to too hard. The middle section and the final section for example are way harder than most areas in the game. There are also a lot of forgettable party members due to the size of the party. Some characters feel underdeveloped. There was also quite a bit of grinding required in this game. It is highly recommended you play with multiple different members and level them up extensively to even have a chance at the final boss. If it weren't for the flaws in this game I would probably rate this game as highly as FF7 and FF9, but with that being said it is still one of my all time favourite RPGs ever made thanks to its brilliant soundtrack, world and story.. This game tells a great story and it has 14 main characters. Also, if you are a beginner to series this game is pretty easy (this was my first FF). Great game. The Best RPG Game Ever! Have Very Good Story, Gameplay, Characters And More!. Final Fantasy VI is the best RPG GAME ever made. Great story, awesome gameplay, very very very good music (the best music of all games) only lack graphic quality by nowadays standard... I hope Square Enix will make a better FINAL FANTASY VI REMAKE soon on PS5.. An amazing port of the best RPG of all time. This game is amazing. Beautiful, engrossing, challenging, surprising, I could go on all day. If you haven't played this classic, do.... The benchmark among Japanese RPGs and a template for the next RPGs like Final Fantasy 7 back in the 90s. Interactions and the deep role-playing related storyline was never told in such demand like in this game. Everyone, who has knowledge about the genre RPG, knows the requirements and important criteria of this game category, will quickly notice the quality of this game, acknowledge the unique depiction of character depth and why it's still the best Final Fantasy game and a masterpiece in the role-playing game history. One of the best role-playing games ever made....... If forced at gunpoint, I would still choose FF7 over FF6. FF7 is the type of game that makes me want to play other Final Fantasy games including 6. FF6 just does not have that same charm. The towns are repetitive. 14 characters is great in quantity, but lacking in quality, especially in story exposition, something FF7 achieved way better. The story of FF6 was bland, the villain even blander, like some ripoff Joker. The bosses were jokes too, all super easy to defeat once the right magic and equipment were obtained. FF6 gets too much hype among Final Fantasy purists. If there is one thing I agree on, it is that FF6 is the one in serious need of a remake. Who knows: improve the graphics to modern standards, and FF6 may become so much better to play. Then can one seriously compare 6 and 7.. As a long time fan whom played every title from the series, Final Fantasy VI is hands dow the best of the best. A fantastic plot, exciting mechanics and interesting characters, a whole lot of them. There is a reason why Square wanted to remake Final Fantasy 6 first before moving on to Final Fantasy 7. Unfortunately for us the fanboys won out... well, maybe it's not that unfortunate, FF7 was a dumpster fire ****. An while it may have been many peoples entry point into the series, the plot was a dumpster fire with uninteresting characters. I think I the remake will do wonders for the game and transform it into the legendary game it's believed to be.. Masterful soundtrack, wonderful graphics, fun game play, intense story, great characters. It doesn't need anything else. What an incredible game!. One of the best game of all times, with an incredibly captivating story, a dreamy soundtrack and mechanics that revolutionized the genre, the gba version was the first to bring even more content to the adventure without changing the original experience too much, it is a game that will remain in history as a master piece.. MY ULTIMATE FAV FF GAME, BAR NONE! a masterpiece in gaming, oh muh gawd this game is amazing, seriously get this game, the story and characters and are amazing, the battle system and enemies are the best FF has to offer, and the villain is easily the greatest most hated villain in FF, and maybe in video games all together, I can't say enough good things about this game, pick it up today if you have the chance.. Not counting the awful sound mixing, this is the freatest version to play ff 6. It's the game we all love to play for hours for the amazingly well constructed world you can explore and great characters you meet(and an outstanding villian). The tihngs holding back this game is that through the secod half the game becomes really easy and the custom mechanics for your characters are so simplistic it's amazing to thinj they were the predcesors of ff7. But still, all the positive aspects and great world desing(both int the structure and looks of it) make for a ftantastic adventure.. Great Story with superb characters (Except the optional ones) Incredible gameplay for the gameboy era, great soundtrack that get's you hyped and sad. Has the saddest scene of all FFs Balanced combat but mediocre customization. It also has big end game content and tons of Secret weapons.. One of the best RPGs I've ever played. Amazing main characters with extreme versatility, also some of them very funny. Very good turn system for battling as well, with cool enemies and bosses. I like how the game is split in 2 parts, the first one quite linear and the second one giving you a lot of freedom to do whatever you want. The story is quite simple but by any means bad, main antagonists are very cruel. There is a very tiny point I dislike and it is Gau rages, I think there should have been a way to sort them or put the ones you use most in a different list, because when you have a lot of them it becomes very annoying to find the ones you want to use! Gau is an awesome character but that is a bit annoying. As I said an extremely minor detail, this game is a must-play for everyone owning a GBA or a way to play it!. This always been my favorite Final Fantasy, it never changed since i played this on super nintendo! For a 2D game they sure were able to deliver alot! The story is really great, the cast of character is really big and the development are surprisingly good for a 2d game ! I really love the music, searching for friend playing when everything seem desperate and hopeless, this game is truly memorable.. This is it... In my opinion, the ultimate RPG. Everything about this game truley is perfect, flawless. Story is simply perfect, the battle mechanics are perfect, the music is perfect. Haha but really there are obviously negatives in the game, but in my opinon, this is the perfect RPG. Anybody would think technology is essential to consider a game as a ""great one"" But, this is not the case with this one, Final Fantasy VI is probably one of the best RPG games ever made ¿Why? Because basically its script is one of the best i've seen in years, including ones of recent years. Great script is perfectly mixed with excellent emotional moments andmemorable boss batles. Every character in this game has a grat charisma and personality, you care of each one of them, and Kefka is in my opinion, one of the best villians ever This was the REAL Final Fantasy, before it took a novel-based approach 10/10. Game: Final Fantasy VI Advance Genre: RPG Developer: Squareenix System: Game Boy Advance (GBA) Total Score: 95/100 Value Score: 9.5/10 • Story: 10/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 10/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 9/10 • Length: 10/10 • Replay Value: 9/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Includes all of the features from the SNES and PSX versions +User Interface has been altered a bit with its text style +New Summons and Boss battles added +New Post Game Dungeon Added with its own story, enemies and bosses Cons -Due to the fact the game is on the GBA - the sound, music and visuals are inferior to the SNES and PSX versions -Some people may not like the fact that the Vanish/Banish trick is gone now -Like the SNES version and unlike the PSX version, the GBA version is censored. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. (my score is 9.5) Final Fantasy VI is undoubtedly an absolute gem of his genre. Perfectly balanced, Majestic in terms of plot and with graphics and sound production at the best, it has all the ingredients that make a game worship and timeless. Dense, grand and excellently conducted, the story can be seen as the essential quality of the title, but it is also a long adventure, a unique atmosphere and a rich and varied gameplay that make its success. It is useless to procrastinate, it is well and truly this episode, combining entertaining excellence, artistic and scenaristic, he elevate definitely the name of Final Fantasy like a masterpiece. Untouchable and unsurpassable. Oh, and do not take the ios version of the game, take rather SNES or GBA version. The ios version is a bad port not rendering justice at all to the original game.. I don't want to say that this is my favorite FF game, because I have not played all of them, but when I played the original SNES version, I fell in love with this game. The characters, soundtrack and story are all amazing. The Advance version improves on graphics, dialogue, and adds a few extra surprises. It was a great way to introduce more modern gamers to this amazing game. 10/10. The Final Fantasy -series is one of the most well-known RPG's ever, and this game is definitely in the Top 3 of Final Fantasy games, heck, wouldn't be surprised if not the best. The story is truly captivating, the characters are one of the best we've ever seen, and the gameplay is pure fun. And the soundtrack, man, THE SOUNDTRACK! Dancing Mad is definitely one of the best video game songs of all time, and the villain himself is just so terrifying that he's awesome. If you're ever gonna call ****, make sure you've played this masterpiece first.. This is square at its best. Old school final fantasy at its best. Rpgs at its best. Wonderful story and a solid battle system. It gets abit grindy towards the end, but its still one of my favourite rpgs.. I don't have many favorite FF games but this one is pretty good. Memorable soundtrack, solid and deep gameplay, interesting cast of characters and great plotlines combined together and you have a great RPG.. Final fantasy VI is a master piece of square soft and nintendo i love it. it has great characters, a deep plot i love everything of this game. ah the soundtrack its awesome!!! i loved it! final fantasy vi rules!!!. A masterpiece of role-playing perfection. A lengthy game with a great story, characters, music and customization options. Contains some new content that wasn't in the SNES original. If you like old school RPG's, you will love this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The greatest of all Final Fantasy games, FF6 is a wondrous experience filled with memorable characters, a thrilling story and some of the best music in video games.. The 1st FF game I've ever got, and hands down, the best one I've played. I fell in love with all of the characters in this game, very well developed. And the plot is also heart-warming, as you experience all of the main characters side-stories. I would want to play the original game on the SNES to see the brilliance of Final Fantasy VI back then.. Going with both the GBA and the SNES version, Final Fantasy 6 is, in my opinion, the finest Final Fantasy adventure ever. Memorable, human like characters (Kefka is an amazing villain and a wonderfully evil human being), compelling and emotional story, amazing soundtrack and timeless gameplay. All the Final Fantasy games onwards after 6 wouldn't be as good(or bad) as they are if they didn't have the important aspects 6 has laid out on the series as well as other RPG's.. This was the DEFINITIVE RPG game during the SNES era, and now it's on the GBA. Everything about the game is the same, aside from a special dungeon you may explore after the game is over for the GBA version. However, the dungeon is rather boring and forces you to use multiple parties of characters in order to travel through it. It doesn't detract from the game experience though, as it is optional. You set off on an epic quest to save the world from a madman set out to destroy anything and everyone on his path to world dominance, one of the greatest villains of all time in any game, in my opinion. It has one of the greatest endings too. Sure, you might defeat him at the end of the game, but who really wins? You have to play yourself to find out! :)",i have to say that Final Fantasy VI is by far my favorite Final Fantasy after beating it . the cast of characters are largely fun to interact with and feel unique from each other . the expressiveness of the characters and the appeal of the plot are not diminished at all .
196.Rayman Legends,"This feels like Rayman Origins with less challenge & more filler. I wasn't a fan of having to use Murphy. The online play felt coporate with its daily challenges. The painting haves less personality compared to Origin's maps & bubbles.. A decade before Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Rayman came closer than ever to perfecting the 2D platformer. (Even the rhythmically-timed music levels appeared in this game first.) The colorful environments and superb animations make this game a very enjoyable spectacle.. This game is amazing in every way when it comes to gameplay it's for sure one of my favourite games of all time easily. Rayman Legends is a masterpiece. Honestly if this game was $10000000, I would sell my kids to play this work of art.. I absolutely love this game it is one of my favourite games i have been playing it for 6 years and every time i play it i find an unmeasured amount of joy in me. These are projects that other games should look up to for inspiracion , this isthe definicion of perfect, 10/10 grafic design , 10/10 sound and music design , and 10/10 gameplay. This game has amazing level design, and that's all it really needs. Each one feels pretty unique and makes it a fun time. It takes a creative spin on running right with sliding, jumping, and fighting giant creatures, all to an absolutely banging beat with the musical greatness that this game shows at time. An original and great 2D platformer.. For me this game is filled with nostalgia, i remember playing this game for hours with my brother and we especially loved the music levels, truly perfect game and i really hope a third rayman sidescrolling game is coming out. Rayman Legends deserves attention not only for keeping up where Origins left off, but also by having a tons of amazing content that is a bunch of fun with friends. Add on the musical levels, the challenges, the Murphy level Co-op mode, and you really get an amazing package. The only seeming downside to all this is that there is little to no story in this game, but with such a great soundtrack, and even more amazing gameplay; the bad really pales in comparison to the good.. excellent game. I hope Ubisoft goes for Rayman 4 in the future . We miss this franchise !!!. Rayman Legends is my favorite game among the new Super Mario Bros. games. This game is wonderful.. Been a long time since I played this but it was great fun. I think Origins is slightly better tbh, but both great fun.. Thisngame is just perfect, nothing comes to my mind to make it even better.. Rayman: Legends (2013) is a hilarious action-packed sequel of Rayman origins. Somehow managing to be better than the amazing previous game. Rayman: Legends (2013) has great graphics, gameplay, music, and is just an all-around fun adventure.. Some of the best gaming fun I've had in years. Pure unadulterated audio-visual joy! My daughter was entertained no end even while watching me fail dozens of times. Such a great comic sensibility, including many gameplay scenes which made me laugh our loud. Better than the previous game Rayman Origins in every way.. one of the best games ever sad that this is rayman's last game tho but its still fun i reccomend anybody the play it.. Rayman Legends is, in short, a masterpiece ****, and my all time favorite game to play on the Wii U. The visuals are astounding and beautiful, the gameplay is smooth as butter and makes it fun to control Rayman and friends, the game performs amazingly and doesn't have any frame rate drops or glitches (that I know of), and the music is very well done. The content in the game is also very good, as it has a huge variety of levels in the main game as well as most of the levels from Rayman Origins, which also remains as a great platformer, and multiple modes to pick from. The only problem I truly have with this game is that the AI when you play through the various Murfy levels is kind of dumb, but even then you can manage to rescue all the Teensies if you have proper timing and skill. Another tiny nitpick that some may have with this game is that it's somewhat on the easier side, but that's perfectly fine in my opinion. 100 percenting this game was fun, and you still have stuff to do after that with the online Challenges you can try out. Overall, this game is amazing, and if you have a Wii U (or any other console that supports this game) then this game is a must have and a blast to play through.. Some of the best platforming I've played! The tons of levels are all brilliantly made and the replay value is endless. The level design is creative and each one feels fresh. The Bosses and music songs are amazing and what made me replay it. If you still have a Wii U, this is a must buy and the best rayman game in my opinion. One thing I didn't like with the game was were you controlled someone helping rayman get through areas as the rayman AI never went were you went. All other parts are truly thrilling and playing this game is a brilliant, fun expierence.. its very nice painted and i love one of the music stages ..black betty i think. A True Rarity Among Sequels Rayman Legends Not Only Improves On It's Predecessor, But Manges To Be One Of The Best Platformers OF ALL TIME!. Best platformer game ever made. Easy control, yet with progressive levels of difficulties. Variety of levels. So many different worlds, modes, and stages. Seamless 3D graphics integrated into a 2D game. Rayman and friends make legends again.. Amazing soundtrack, great experience coming out of this game. It is a masterpiece, very nicely put together. This game is a must if you own a Wii U and also try it on other platforms depending on which one you have. It is an improvement on the Rayman Origins game since it removes the few frustration difficulty elements and matches greatly to the reaction senses of the player due to great game design.. First of all I love Rayman Legends. It is a great Platformer with the exact right amount of easyness and difficulty that it needs. But the part I want to highlight the most are the MusicLevel. These have high speed but also good controls and are just extreme FUN. And thats what this game is all about. It wants to giveyou the feeling that you are a little kid again and playing videogames just for the fun. And its great in this. Please more of this stuff.. Rayman Legends is one of the best third-party Wii U titles of the 2010s, as well as one of the best video game sequels ever made. It's such a masterpiece. All thanks to its solid story, great humour, beautiful graphics, well-designed levels, incredible gameplay (My favourite moment is the music levels), balanced difficulty, a new addiction of online single-player mode and new playable characters like Barbara and Murfy, smooth controls, tons of replay value, lots of challenges, fun boss battles and awesome music. If you ever played Rayman Origins so much, then chances are, you should get this game no matter what. It's worth buying for your Wii U library. It's so much better than New Super Mario Bros U. I am very proud of you Ubisoft. I gave it a 10 out of 10.. Best Wii U game ever, best platform game ever, best multiplayer ever, best art ever, best characters ever, best soundtrack ever ... Ubisoft did really well making revolutionary platform game who make playing with friends really funny.. Putting it plain and simple, this is my absolute favourite platform game of all time, as well as one of my absolute favourite games to simply pick up and come back to now and then! With beautiful portrait-like visuals, wonderful animation, bouncy, upbeat humour, excellent atmosphere between worlds and one of the best music scores for a video game I've personally had the pleasure of listening to, it's the closest thing to perfection in a platformer! This isn't even to mention the responsive platforming, the tough, yet fair difficulty balance and the impeccable level design, which feels extremely fluid complemented by the fast-pacing of the platforming! In addition to that, the implementation of the gamepad is ergonomically brilliant; it doesn't feel gimmicky, and it rewards patience and reflexive response from both touchscreen input and the acclerometer. On another note, the music levels are a personal highlight of my experience with the game, well designed, orchestrated and fun to play, regardless of whether it's your first run or your hundreth! In short, Rayman Legends is the closest thing to platforming perfection. The difficulty curve for some levels, challenges and bosses might be a turn-off for some, but I feel that overcoming said challenges makes their completion all that more rewarding. If you have a Wii U, this is an essential platform to have in your library!. When I was asked what I thought a perfect game was this was one of the few that came to mind. I'm not a huge Rayman fan having only played Rayman 2 as a kid, that being said, aside from being a tad easy and having to use the Gamepad for touch screen gameplay segments there's nothing bad I can really say about this game. The controls were great, amazing art style, sweet music and was a real treat to finish 100%. Should have written this review 3 years ago but.. better late than never.. I was surprised how good Rayman still can be after not really following it's games since Rayman 2 Forever or something like that... with some more awesome music levels and references (the ""Oceans 12""-Level was awesome!) it could be even better. Hoping for the next Rayman game, this time without delaying for ports ;). One of the best platforms games I ever played in my life! An essential game for Wii U owners! Don't hesistate to buy this game, I promise you will have hours and hours of fun!. Excellent! Beautiful art style, a lot of different theme for the level, music is awesome, gameplay is as good as Origin. Humor is still there. There is alot of stuff to do here. Game is easier than Origin, wich is a good thing for me, as a couldn't finish Origin. Must-buy for any platformer. Only downside would be the part where you control Murphy as Rayman become control by the IA, wich can be hard to get the collectible sometime because of that. This game is amazing, but on Wii U this game even better than on Playstation 4 because graphics in Rayman Legends not really better on Wii U than Playstation 4, but storyline is same and gameplay is same and on Wii U this game published a year erlier and I think on Wii U two-dimensional Games always better than on Playstation 4 because Wii U is console for children games . Amazing 2D Game .. No one (by no one I mean everyone especially any Rayman fan out there) should ever miss the chance to get Rayman Legends, a pretty neat successful successor to Rayman Origins.. An early contender, this may be the greatest platformer I've played in this new generation of consoles. Pros: -Amazing Music -Visuals and colors that stand out -New and exciting mechanics in every world -Intuitive boss fights -Extremely high replayability -Graphics and controls that feel like a well-polished Nintendo game -Don't need to worry about life-counting, it doesn't exist -Animations respond really well to controller input, allowing me to goof of while having fun -With all the secrets and unlockables in-game, it never seems to end And the greatest thing of all... -Giving the Wii U Gamepad actual purpose (in and out of game-play) instead of pushing it aside like other games would Cons: -Slight graphical/animation errors (hard to notice, but they're there) -That one section of a specific level way late in the game on that gives out extreme frame-rate problems (RIP Wii U) (only a brief moment of game lag) -Extremely varying degrees of difficulty that does not curve, but spikes at random levels -Forced usage of the gamepad (it's fine to get used to, but I'd rather use the pro controller during some moments) -When the game starts up, the loading music is noticeably loud for some reason, but the actual game music is quiet when it starts. Weird... Middle ground: -Murphy levels (its a swing-or-miss, but they respond amazingly well on the game pad, which I like) -Some unlockables require stupid amounts of Lums (your currency, essentially), with some character costumes worth over 750,000. I've beaten the game completely, and only have 455,000. That's a lot of grinding... However, I immediately looked beyond those things when I turn the game on, as I am blown away by how much fun I had with it. Truly worth the original $60. Easily, this beats out things like Mario U and Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze, and puts this up with platformers like Shovel Knight as one of the greatest I have played in years.. This game was originally made for the Wii U and then ported over to the Xbox and PS4 systems, and it shows. The Wii U version is much more smooth. Also, the innovative use of the gamepad takes this game from an 8 to a 10. When played on the Wii U, i would argue this is one of the best platformers of all time. Super fun multiplayer too.. 9/10 Platforming GOLD by Ubisoft and better played on Wii U + Wii U Gamepad Interaction + Music Levels + Kung Foot + Characters + Level design - Not Wii U Exclusive - Some levels are bland and uninteresting. From the gameplay, to the music, to the controls, Rayman Legends is a fantastic 2.5D Platformer. Wife and I have enjoyed every minute of this game. Laughs and smile feel our faces with every leveled played. The game is so much fun.. It's simple. This is one of the best games on Wii U. This game is really fun. The level design is amazing. The music is amazing. It introduces new ideas perfectly, and there is plenty to do. Challenges, awesome levels, time trials, Back to Origins, replayability, great graphics, perfect touchscreen controls, and more. And the abilities are just too fun. If you don't have this game, go and get it right now.. A solid and challenging platformer than rivals even the Mario franchise. Any game where one of the levels involves playing along to Black Betty by Ramjam while the enemies sing it gets my automatic approval!. As of late, the 2D platforming genre has seen a bit of a resurgence, especially in indie games like Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy and to a lesser extent in more high-profile titles New Super Mario Bros. and the like. Rayman Legends, the sequel to 2011's reboot of the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, is one such platformer, and quite possibly one of the best in its genre. Rayman Legends, like its predecessor, is very simple in terms of its gameplay: Run, jump and punch your way through each of the levels, rescuing the small, fairy-like Teensies (who replace Origins' Electoons) as you go. It's actually quite a good thing the gameplay is this simple, because this game's difficulty is certainly not to be sniffed at. On some of the Challenge levels in particular it might take someone many different tries to get past a particular area of the game, and whilst at first this may seem aggravating there's no feeling quite like finally completing that ONE level. Another interesting addition is the Murfy mechanic - whilst playing, the player can control Murfy with the Wii U GamePad to guide their character through the level, by for instance moving platforms or distracting enemies, adding a little variety to the gameplay whilst still retaining the simplicity that makes it so enjoyable. There are also additional characters, but the differences are mostly cosmetic and don't change the gameplay, though in all honesty this is more to the game's benefit, since the gameplay is OK as it is, and doesn't really need any different character abilities to make it any better. Also like Origins, Legends' story is barebones, quite possibly to the overall game's benefit. Not focusing much on the story means that the player can divert their attention to actually enjoying the gameplay and uniquer art style, which are the game's main points. To summarise, Rayman Legends is the best anyone could ask from a platforming game. It's challenging, it has funny characters, enjoyable levels, it doesn't focus too much on the plot, and most importantly - It will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. Yes, it can get very, VERY difficult, but as you play it, you realise that that's the whole point: Trial and error, improving with every failed attempt, slowly but surely perfecting your strategy. And it's exactly that that makes Rayman Legends special.. This is a wonderful platformer. The art work is top notch and the sound is amazing. But the touchpad part of the game was terrible. I hope Ubisoft will scrap that part of the game in future iterations.. I have never seen a more vibrant, musical, charming game than Rayman Legends. Great level design, beautiful soundtrack, gorgeous visuals. Up there with Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze as my favorite platformer.. This game is just another complete rip-off of angry birds. The game itself is exactly the same except the graphics quality is much lower and the gameplay is significantly less user friendly.. I think this game was as good as the New Super Mario Bros, with typical Rayman charm. I wish there were more levels to rock out and platform to crazy beats. We had a lot of fun with this game.. This game is one of the best ones out there, so heres the pros and the cons ! Pros, -Simple gameplay. -awesome characters . - creative design. Cons - hard game. Rayman Legends is without a doubt one of the best Wii U games. Its level design, graphics and music are absolutely gorgeous and flawlessly executed. Fun, addictive and rewarding, this one is a must have for every Wii U owner.. Odd to see how alone I'm with my opinions and how much overrated this neat platformer is. Yes, controlls are perfect, graphics are gorgeous and basic levels are mostly awesome to play. And I like Murphy's levels because they're something really different BUT... The time limit levels, oh boy, the good old memorization and frustration from the original Rayman is back. Developers really saw that playing those f#king intense and unforgiving stages takes as long as regular levels so they made them 40! It's 30 % of the game. Okay, Rayman Origins has those skull-levels when you have to catch an treasure chest and the rules are the same but in Origins there's only 10 levels of that stuff! Daamn. And why there's exist ""remastered"" Origins-levels anyway? Makes feel that I paid twice of those. And everybody thinks ""hey, that's way to go"". Even though they're great yeah but it indicates lack of originality. So totally, 30 % of the game is directly from its predecessor and 30 % too intense one hit-run shows. The rest is really original own good stuff and its way too little. Finally, the old atmosphere from the older games is gone. Now we are just running and smashing everything. Origins has more that good old style of more relaxing and exploring. Nowadays Rayman is like a mx between Sonic and Mega Man with Crash Bandicoot's madness. I really miss that old exploring and not-so-hardcore gameplay. Overall, Rayman Legends is a good game but really not so good that almost everyone says.. Masterpiece. It's amazing what you get for $20, including most of the Origins levels that can now be played off-TV on the Gamepad. One of those rare games that is fun to play regardless of your skill level -- even better in groups, and very forgiving. Great fun.... Rayman Legends offers a lot of game for the bucks. There is so much content in this game. Not only do you have the overall game but you get mini games, and both daily and weekly challenges where you can compete with others over the net for the best score. The music is quirky in a good way and is very unique. You'll be humming or whistling for days after you're done playing. the platforming and level design is really good. It's a challenge but yet it's not cheap. The controls are good. The characters are cute and there are a lot of them to choose from. Although they are merely skins. The different character do not play differently from one another as far as I can tell. The gameplay can be so frantic and fast that it doesn't always make the multiplayer gameplay work well. This game is really good but it's not as good as Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze or Mario. If you like platformers and you've finished those other games then you should grab this game and give it a try.. Now I know this game is a year old but this was the very first game that I played that deserved a 10/10 score and i'll tell you why, Rayman Legends is one of the best games of all time! For having a great level design, great visuals and an outstanding soundtrack. This has enough challenging levels and the online mode keeps you hooked for hours. Nothing is repeditive, nothing is boring and if you haven't played Rayman Origins like myself, that's not a problem because this game features tons of levels from Origins. This game is one of my most favourite games of all time and a well diserved 10/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have owned the Wii U for about a year and a half, an I have accumulated several games for it, such as Nintendo Land, both Mario games, and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, but none of these games made me REALLY want to come back to them. Monster Hunter was cool but I didn't enjoy the tedium of having to get resources, but the killing of the monsters was absolutely brilliant. Super Mario U was extremely boring and I didn't even make it pass 6-5, just out of sheer I couldn't give less of a crap. But Rayman Legends is the first game to actually make me want to play it again, and strongly too. First off, the level design is absolutely brilliant and the visuals are absolutely stunning. I LOVE how you can choose between different characters instead of just Rayman, who is fine but that woman with the axe is unbelievably cool. After you beat the boss battle you unlock a musical level, WHICH ARE THE BEST LEVELS, I mean seriously, on the first set of levels I had a rather difficult time beating the boss, and after about 30 minutes of trying to finish it I was livid. So after I saw a new level unlock I said ""Screw it, let's at least finish this set of levels. THANK GOD I did that, because if I didn't I wouldn't be giving this a 9/10, it'd be a 7/10 because of the spike in difficulty, but these music levels make it worth it. They are so much fun and top off each set of levels perfectly. As I said earlier, there was a massive spike in difficulty when you reached the bosses, they were hard in a fun way for the first 15 or so minutes, but after that I started to get pretty irritated, wondering why they made a kids game so hard, I would say "" Do you want to increase teen suicide rates? Because that's how you do it"". Then 5 minutes later I would beat it which would make me feel rather proud of myself. Another reason is those Murfy levels. That's all on that, they are pretty cool with the integration of the Wii U game pad but I feel extremely conflicted on all these levels. On one hand, they are rather difficult if you want to find all of the blue guys and Lums. But, they are also a really nice change of pace from the rest of the game, allowing me to feel obligated in using the Gamepad instead of trying to figure out ways to use the Pro Controller. All in all, this is a great game and I strongly suggest picking it up if you have the cash and the patience. AND if you have a midget standing by to brutally assault when pissed off.. This is by far the best side scroller available for the Wii U. Tropical Freeze comes in a close second, but this is just so good! Kudos to Ubisoft for supporting Wii U and bringing us this wonderful game.. I already played a Rayman Title so many years ago... I think that was in the N64... I can't even remember the title's name. But this one is the best... when I mean best, I mean BEST. It's simple incredible how the Ubisoft gives Wii U Gamepad support MORE than Nintendo itself. Seriously... just compare it. You played Mario 3d World? Compare it... The game uses an unique and beatiful concept Art. The mechanics are incredible. The gameplay, fantastic. The level design is detailed. I think that this was the best platformer of the last year... Surpassed even the Mario 3d World, but it wont win any prize because Ubisoft failed a lot in publishing... in fact, I only played this game because of the promotion launched. I would probably never play this game if not for it. And I would probably get it in the launch time, if more marketing happened. The game is amazing in everyway. The online interaction (daily, weekly challenges and so on) are a kind of thing that I was waiting for in some Nintendo titles... never happened. Congrats Ubisoft for your amazing work! But please, use more your marketing department!. Game of the year for 2013. Awesomely fun, tons of content, and flawless platforming. A game that doesn't punish you for failing, but encourages you to succeed, without being too easy. Level design is amazing, Nintendo platformers could learn a lot from this game.. I played the original Rayman back in the day when it weas released for the Atari Jaguar. I downloaded this recently from the Eshop, and all I can say is I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Great design, great graphics, great fun. Sometimes I play coop with my 4 and 6 year old. I truly hope there's a sequel. Go Ubisoft!!. an excellent game, ubisoft almost manages to beat Nintendo at their own game with such an excellent platformer. it makes good use of the wii-u touchscreen in some levels, and there is an overwhelming amount of content to play through. This is a great game and in my opinion a must own.. A perfect example of where Platforming should go. And it's so massive ****, it will easily fill the time until the new Smash Bros. with plenty of enjoyment. The level design is genius. Never has it felt repetitive. Even the simple soccer game is great for hours of fun. The controls are snappy and movements are very fluid. Difficulty is perfect. Easy enough for my son to have fun, yet still difficult enough to for my completionist tastes. Sounds are varied, music is bright and beautiful. The level ""Castle Rock"" filled me with so much joy I had to play it 3 times. This game is polished and near perfect. Near perfect because I still view the gamepad as a gimmick, even though it fits nicely with this game. It's ranked ""10"" due to extra credit: I can use my old non-plus wiimotes for multiplayer. I am not forced to shell out $40 for new controllers! Bonus! I no longer feel regretful of my WiiU purchase.. This is a good game, but every single thing leading up to it was utter **** Remember when this was going to be a Wii U launch title? didn't happen. Remember when this was going to be a Wii U exclusive? Didn't happen. Remember when this was going to have optional (skylanders-esk) toys you could put on the gamepad to get a power up? DIDN'T HAPPEN!. INTRO: Rayman Legends is the sequel to the great platformer that was Rayman Origins, and it pioneers even deeper into the genre of 2D platforming in gaming than its predecessor, Rayman Origins. CONTROLS: Rayman Legends controls about the same way that Rayman Origins, its predecessor, controlled, smooth and fluid. Besides that, the controls are the way they should be for a platformer of Rayman Legends scale. GAMEPLAY: Rayman Legends has somewhat similar gameplay as Rayman Origins, but mixes it up in brand new twists and challenges that make me feel like I'm playing a sequel to Rayman Origins and not just a rehash. One thing I thought was a little disappointing was that in Rayman Origins, you got new powerups for each new setting you were in to help you explore, but in Rayman Legends, everything is available to you from the start which doesn't bother me that much, but it isn't as cool as being able to play a new world you just unlocked with a brand new world-changing power-up. MUSIC: The music in Rayman Legends is simple and very well attuned to the various worlds and levels you can play in the game. It's very well orchestrated and composed as well as being, in my opinion, better than Rayman Origins soundtrack. GRAPHICS: Rayman Legends goes for a less cartoonish look than Rayman Origins, and goes for a more work of art look, and it looks beautiful. (Note: The game as a whole is made with 2D art-style characters, enemies, and backrounds, but bosses are rendered in 3D which I thought was a very nice touch.) LENGTH: Rayman Legends is a much longer adventure than its predecessor especially when going for 100%, and the length of the game as well as the other aspects, makes it feel like it is worth twice as much than the $60 price tag. (not including online/in-store discounts) OUTRO: Overall this game gets a 9/10 from me, because I thought it was almost 2 times as good as its predecessor, but still it loses a point, because it just doesn't deserve a perfect rating, because there are some flaws hidden within the game, but still this is a great, creative adventure that has pioneered 2D platforming even further.. Major studio sidescrollers are few and far between these days, especially outside Nintendo's first-party lineup. A game like Rayman Legends, with all of its delightful little idiosyncrasies, is a great reason why that just shouldn't be the case. Ubisoft's platformer feels like a labor of love. The graphics have a hand-drawn quality that makes them very pretty, while the music is as fantastic as it was in Rayman Origins, the previous instalment of the series. In fact, Legends manages to outdo Origins in almost every other way, featuring more streamlined level design, more unlockables and more new ideas on display. It's obvious that the game was built with the Wii U in mind. The gamepad is used for a more fluid navigation of the various rooms of the game's overworld, and it works great. There are also gamepad-heavy levels, in which you control a small flying character named Murfy as he interacts with various objects on the touchscreen. They are a good idea, but would have worked much better if they were an once-per-world novelty (think Captain Toad levels in Super Mario 3D World). As is, they're sadly a bit overused. Controls for the more traditional stages are almost impeccable, with a great sense of feedback even in the trickiest sections (special mention to how intuitive the underwater controls are). The physics can get a bit floaty, but that fits well with the game's humorous, slapstick vibe. There are also hard-but-not-frustrating time trial stages, and epic boss fights filled with exaggeration (in the good sense of the word) and funny humor, especially on a certain luchador match. And then there are the ""musical stages"". Each main world has one of these, and they are absolutely fantastic. They use well-known rock music tracks to guide the action, making it impossible to stop humming along. One stage in particular features a hilarious mariachi rendition of ""Eye of the Tiger"", and it's so good that I kept beating it over and over again, even after getting all the collectibles in it. Other than that, the game features a lot of play options, including daily and weekly online challenges and Rayman Origins stages to unlock. This is probably to make up for the short length of the main campaign, which sadly has only five real worlds to conquer. Still, it's great fun while it lasts, and unlocking everything is gonna take a while. No, it's not quite Mario or Donkey Kong, but it doesn't really try to be. Rayman Legends is a joyous game full of its own peculiar personality, and that's one of the reasons why it's so much fun.. As a long-time veteran of the Rayman franchise, I've got to say that this game has to be hands-down the best one of all. It not only expands on what Origins brought to the table, it added so much more, and made everything easy to see, navigate, and control. Saving all 700 Teensies? A HUGE challenge. But because the gameplay is so addicting, you'll practically make it your life's mission to","a decade before super mario bros. wonder, Rayman came closer to perfecting the 2D platformer . the colorful environments and superb animations make this game a very enjoyable spectacle . for me this game is filled with nostalgia, i remember playing this game for hours with my brother and we especially loved the music levels ."
197.UFO 50,"The retro charm fades quickly due to uneven game quality, clunky controls, and a lack of engaging gameplay variety. i paid $15 for a bunch of old games? i thought i would be getting more than a few quick 'gags' of games, especially for $15. graphics should be better nowadays, if they are going to charge me $15 they should at least have the courtesy to make it look better. UFO 50 more like there are more than 50 better things i could of bought for $15 dollars. if this game was $5 i would consider buying it, so i will at least give a 2.. A really cool collection of games. There are a handful of really cool games in here so even if you do not gel with every single one, there is bound to be a few you dig. Everything is a bit different and you really look forward to what kind of game is coming up next. The standouts for me are: WarpTank, Vainger, Night Manor, Valbrace and Mini & Max. Those 5 stand out about the rest, but there are over 20 really good games in the collection. The other ones are not bad, but some suffer from some difficulty issues. I know they are going for some old school mechanics, but a lot of these games are almost ruined with how brutal it is at times. It's like they made a cool game and then the fun is **** out by dying in one hit. It's funny because the era of games they are emulating were much more forgiving than some of these titles. It just **** when you start to play a new game that seems really cool and then it has a brutal death penalty or just a mechanic that makes it unplayable. For instance Golfaria, the golf adventure game is a great idea. I would have played through it all. But, the unnecessary stroke limit on the movement ruins the game in my opinion. Those complaints aside, it is a super cool collection with hours of difference FULL games to play in here. One of the best games of the year for sure.. Pretty fun little hodgepodge of ideas. I'd really say only 15 or so of the 50 were actually fun enough to keep playing, but I like the spirit of what they were trying to do. Great little snacky fun but not a great amount of depth.. I love the concept and the nostalgia factor, having been alive in the 80's myself. However, it brings me no pleasure to say that in 2024, most of these games in the collection are hard to get into. The graphics, unfortunately, are so primitive that I had a hard time staying hooked. Among the 50 games, I counted only 11 that I actually liked. And among those, I had only beaten 3 of them. Most of the games are too difficult for me or don't offer the ability to save at certain points, requiring me to start the whole game over. I know there is a passcode terminal which may allow you to skip to the point in the game you got up to, but I never bothered. With that said, I really did enjoy Mortol, Kick Club, Block Koala, Camouflage, Campanella, The Big Bell Race (beaten), Warptank (beaten), Pingolf, Night Manor (beaten), Elfazar's Hat and Seaside Drive. Mortol II was a great concept, but I struggled to progress and lost patience. Cyber Owls was cool, too, but too difficult for me. But honestly, I would rather just play some games that actually existed in the 80's. Regardless, kudos to the team who put a lot of effort and love into these games, as it really shows. The pixel art is fantastic and some games have some good soundtracks.. Wow! At first you might think OK these games seem ok but they get under your skin and quickly become utter classics. Whats my favourite? Porgy....Mortol...Moon Cat....maybe? but today I'm loving Party house! and ive heard Grindstone is amazing and i haven't even started that one! Amazing collection!. Wild to see negative reviews for this, but there is definitely filtering quality to this game if you are unwilling to engage with the premise or are simply adapted to (or possibly warped by) modern gaming. These games reward reflexes and muscle memory but also critical thinking. They are riffs on games of yesteryear, tweaked in ways the developers thought were interesting. It is retro gaming recreated with the benefit of hindsight by a team of artists who did not rush their work - I can see how it took 8 years. There is a meta story of the studio behind the game, unveiled in tidbits and clues throughout - many of the games have credits full of recurring fictional names so you can see who worked on what or speculate on the studios behind the scenes drama. You don't have to play or even enjoy every game - a lot of these are from niche genres that aren't made anymore and I see a lot of people straight up stumbling on Barbuta, agame that essentially laughs at the player on their first attempt to play it but beating these games and setting a high score will reward you with the kind of sense of accomplishment you probably haven't felt in year from modern gaming.. this game has been on my radar for a few years, but damn this is probably my game of the year. this is a monumental achievement in game development, like you'll be surprised at how well realized each game is, and there's 50! i am a very big spelunky 2 fan, and this exceeds my expectations. i love the meta story about uncovering this company's track record of games, seeing how they build on the last. not to sleep on the ""older"" games in the collection, as magic garden is in my top 3. theres a little something for everyone here, as long as you can keep up with the unforgiving nature of most of these games. i love how figuring stuff out is such an integral aspect. side note, definitely mind the very first game, it's clunky to high hell as it's meant to be their first game.. Based game with tons of genuinely amazing games, not every game is a 10/10 but the overall package is.. Some great games (and ideas) in here but my guess is that a lot of people won't invest the time into some of them that they require. Very much reminds me of a high-end version of some of the multi-game tapes I used to get for my Amstrad or Spectrum back in the day (err, mid-80s). My favourite so far is the Lords of Diskonia - a strategy game where you travel across a map, acquiring resources and then battle firing monster 'discs' against each other on a top down map. One level left to go.... Honestly very overrated for being ""artsy"". Idk if people did never play old games or why they're excited about it now in this collection, but i can't see anything amazing about these 50 games. Quality over Quantity.. Holy guacamole. Been waiting for this game for years and did not disappoint!","the standouts for me are: WarpTank, Vainger, Night Manor, Valbrace and Mini & Max . the other ones are not bad, but some suffer from some difficulty issues ."
198.Madden NFL 2005,Fantastic game and it is very in depth new maddens aren't even comparable!!,fantastic game and it is very in depth new maddens aren't even comparable . new maddens isn't even comparable to the original maddens .
199.Against the Storm,"Amazing game. It's a city builder, resource management game, but the whole game is based around lootbox like mechanics RNG. There are multiple layers of this, from the random events you find in glades, the trader that comes your way, the missions you are given, the favours and types of creatures in your city... and even more! This is not a bad thing, it means you are constantly trying to solve problems and find the resources that you need to improve your situation. It's not supposed to be easy. You're supposed to make it work! So many times I've almost lost and come back and it felt so good. The people that gave this game a bad user score, just don't get the game. Ye ok, the graphics are a bit mid, not 10/10 material, and some of the art style a bit... unique, but the vibe is actually very distinct and novel. If you don't like city builders, then don't play this game. It's a city builder. If you DO like city builders, then this is the battle royale of city builders, loot at every corner, new problems to solve with every turn, truly challenging and rewarding if you win, (which is not a given!) I loved it!. Such a lovely game. Spent countless hours and already reached max level. Best progress was prestige 2 and this game still gets me playing it more. The recently dlc is ok and gives a few new buildings and a new playable race. Some companies give this kind of content for free and prefers to sells cosmatics only. This game forces you to buy it for further progress and archivments. The dlc can be cheaper elses or on sale but without the game does not feel the same. I really love the idea to play over and over again in different settlements with random generated maps and startoptions like races and goodies. So this game got me for quite a while until the recent dlc.. I don't like the fact that the village resets every time you finish a chapter. When I play a building game, I want to see my city expands over the time.. It does consume a lot of time, but it's not really suited for someone who struggles with management games like me. Managing things is already challenging enough, and then you add random elements to the mix.... Wow what a fantastic indie game that blew away my expectations. Literally every aspect is well crafted, well designed and useful. I have spent a total of 122 hours just to beat the game, which is phenomenal value for the already low price. This game is about managing resources, extraction, production and consumption of your settlement's population and fulfilling their needs and the orders of the queen. It really makes you think strategically and have fun while doing it. Although the learning curve is steep, I felt very capable after about 10-15 hours of gameplay. The more I played, the more I became cognizant of all the little decisions I was making and what the impact would be on my settlement. This game is also a roguelite, so each run is going to be different and rewarding. When you fail, you receive experience and resources to help you upgrade and advance on the next run. Others have mentioned that the game gets repetitive and boring. I have not really felt that to be the case because each run plays out differently and utilizes your upgrades along the way. Sure, the maps don't have much variety, but the way each settlement develops and the events that occur are going to differ each time, keeping things interesting. The game has little to no bugs and felt like a complete package. The graphics are simple and pleasing. The sound design is great. Be prepared for a lot of mousing and clicking since there are times where you really need to stay on top of what is going on in your settlement. There are also periods where you can relax and just watch your workers do their thing. The difficultly design is very well balanced and introduced to the player in a good manner. You start off with an easy difficulty and as you achieve the goals, the game requires you to step up to the next higher difficulty as a requirement to progress. You can't just play the entire game in ""easy"" mode. But the more you play, the more upgrades you will be able to make, and therefore make the game a little easier with each successive run. It does feel weird to ""win"" a settlement and then exit it and move onto the next one and start from scratch again, though you do have the option to keep playing the current settlement. But that's what a roguelite is all about. You achieve the goals and move on, which keeps things fresh. The game also allows for a high degree of creativity since you can design your settlement the way you see fit and take different strategies to achieve objectives. Things will be different for each player. The main game sure is time consuming, and I normally don't have patience for time consuming games, but this one was thoroughly enjoyable all the way because there's always something to strive for and you feel like you can just do a little better next time and progress.. This is the game I’ve been waiting for since first playin Caesar III back in the late 90s. The key problem with city builders is the sameness, which the roguelite qualities of this game masterfully dispel. The player MUST adapt their approach with each new map and the self learning moments are constant. I’m a couple hundred hours in and still ravenous for it. GOTY for me personally.. I cannot stress how incredibly fun this game is to play. It is an incredibly unique RTS city builder with rouge-like elements that succeeds in every way. The gameplay has incredible depth and variety to it, with each run being a little different from the last. It is very polished, and the devs are incredibly active and responsive to the community with constant updates and patches being added to this already beautifully crafted game. I love everything about this game, and it’s clear the devs do too.. You can win in a wide variety of ways. The characters are cute and go well with both the background and the atmosphere. Overall, I play with long breaths, but the challenges of every moment are urgent. I'm convinced...well I mean more than convinced since there are literally copy and pasted reviews for this game everywhere on steam (check for yourself. 0.1 play hours with copy and pasted reviews. Just check yourself.) ... that the reviews are very very inflated artificially for this game. Over 10k OVERWHELMINGLY positive reviews since DECEMBER? FOR THIS!? It looks like OG WoW graphically, and plays like watching paint dry if it was somehow based on **** RNG where the paint dries slower or quicker depending on the RNG. Its a below average city builder with ""rogue lite (lol no)"" mechanics. Ok. 10/10? What? WHERE DID THIS TEAM OF ""6"" PEOPLE COME FROM? WHO IS THIS DEV? WHY DID I GIVE THEM MONEY? And yes, I ""understand the game"". Whats there not to understand about gathering resources? The game is just MID. And the design and core mechanics are DUMB AND BORING.. Fun and engaging. Each map play differently which helps keep players engaged. However, gets repetitive mid to late game after you unlock a few seals.. Against the Storm merges city-building and resource management with roguelike elements in an unexpected yet brilliantly executed combination. At first glance, merging the steady progression of city builders with the punishing, progression-resetting nature of roguelikes might seem incompatible. However, the final product miraculously maintains the complexity of city-building alongside the thrilling unpredictability of roguelike games. The result feels akin to a real-time strategy (RTS) game's single-player campaign, albeit without the combat. --------|The gameplay loop of Against the Storm is both fun and challenging, offering a unique thrill of discovery and rewarding careful planning. Unlike traditional base-building games where progression feels relatively safe and linear, here, every step forward is fraught with risk. Having invested over 150 hours into the game, I find the gameplay loop has only recently begun to frustrate me, which makes it a big success by my standards. --------|The core gameplay revolves around two main elements: world progression and settlement management, interconnected through 'cycles.' A cycle represents players' time to navigate the map and prepare for the world storm. Establishing a settlement within a cycle requires the player to earn a certain number of victory points, which consumes a number of years, based on player decisions and luck, from the cycle. Upgrades from the citadel can streamline the settlement procession, enabling further exploration and seal mending. This cycle of settlement building, upgrading, and seal mending is the crux of the progression experience, enriched by a vast array of environmental factors, world events, structural modifiers, and storm hazards. The necessity to adapt your strategy due to the random distribution of blueprints and the wide range of difficulty options significantly enhances the game's replayability.--------|From a gameplay perspective, Against the Storm encourages players to explore, strategize, and refine their build orders to meet increasingly challenging scenarios. However, the game does start to slow down around the mid-game, particularly after 50-70 hours, as citadel upgrades begin to feel less impactful. --------|One feature I would love to see is the ability to save or reserve a favourite settlement. Many players are drawn to city-building but become captivated by the game's fast-paced challenges. Allowing players to maintain a 'main base' for late-game grinding would add depth and encourage continued engagement, even during the final grinds. It would also lend significance to decorative elements, making unlock decorations feel more meaningful. Thus, I believe having the option to retain one settlement would greatly enhance the replayability of the game. --------|Overall, it is a fantastic and addictive gaming experience. It is a great game with tiny flaws. 8/10. Against the Storm isn't a bad game. But is a case of false advertisement (at least classification) and questionable game design. This game is positioned as roguelike city-builder, but it's actually more like pseudo-roguelite city-puzzler. Instead of ""pseudo-"" prefix you can you use ""quasi-"" or if you feel generous ""semi-"". Main point of rogueliK/Tes is difference in gameplay. Here, almost every game is identical, you should account only for minor differences and map mods. You get to make random-based choices, but none of them is game-changing. If you have to build specific service building in some point of the map run, you will have to do it anyway. And you still have all the disadvantages of the only one save file. Why city-puzzler and not builder? Because, you are always faced with only two variants of end goals: reach high reputation of the settlement or fulfill specific map tasks. And achieve that while having resources that you have in your possession is more and feeling more like a puzzle than building a city. In its core it is an interesting and complex (only for computers, can't be imagined as a tabletop without simplification) puzzle, but still: would you be so interested to check up this page if it was a mere puzzle game? Answer for yourself. In addition, in this city game you can't tweak parameters of your game. Only what was intended. But now let me switch to the second main point: questionable game design. Do you find games fun? Thing of them as entertainment? Well, developers created a game that designed to bore you down with all the tedium. As I said, there's only intended vision, you can't tweak parameters of the game (only with cheats or mods). So, it either align with yours or not, take it or leave it. But what are you taking, besides a low-random city-puzzler? Game where you don't get better (git gud). You may encounter some troubles with the game, run to the web-guides only to understand nothing. Those guides are written by complete fans with at least over 100 hours in game, and things described in their works will make sense to you at least after 30 hours of gameplay. Game slowly unravels you city-management capabilities with upgrades and better buildings through unlocks via levelling up (by experience) or buying upgrades (by resources awarded/gathered). And you can start to feel that you've nailed it, but actually you just got better buildings and upgrades for buildings and settlement. You will not fare better in your hundredth settlement than you first city. There is not much of a development here. Anyway, your supply chain is 3 links long at maximum (resource node - refinement/intermediary product - end product). But you will enjoy your first game way more. And it will last about 20 minutes! Prepare to multiply that time about 6x time. Why? First game makes you miserable by not giving you all the opportunities, than you slowly unlock them, and later games make you miserable with disadvantages. Fundamentally, there are 4 general difficulty levels (untweakable, remember vision) and then there are 20 extra difficulties, where each difficulty represent added malus, and they stack consequently (meaning, latest difficulty is 4th level + 20 maluses combined). You gain one option to get three additional and powerful city wide upgrades, but they cost a lot, and feels like a band-aid on an open wide bleeding wound. And most sinister of it all - the game has no ending. No credits rolling. You may feel that you were coming there and coming and coming, but you will never came to that satisfaction. You and any other player had or will abandon this game. And its deeply personal when (estimates are rough): the very beginning (0-1 hour), the third tutorial (10 hours), the last tutorial (30 hours), the unlock of seal contracts (50 hours), last seal (80 hours) and thing called ""quick hand mode"" (120 hours). Ok, this game is long, repetitive and frustrating. But one may ask, is it user friendly? Well, if you had to build only one city, I would've called this UI great. There are several overview indicators, you can quickly navigate to some settings, information is available and easy to read. But…we are building plenty of cities, and I did find many features from other games lacking, especially when entered penalizing difficulties (where I stopped). There are no templates, np blueprinting option to place building for layout planning, no resource/product life after-production, there are no traffic heat-maps overlays (or any other overlays, only map indicators), after forbidding resource use/production in the building menu, materials don't return to warehouse and event resolve time estimates don't take logistics time into consideration, so you mismanage time and get heavily penalized on miserable difficulties. As I said, you will drop this game. If it will be worth it depends on one your personal trait: frustration tolerance. It is worth your money only if you will play it significant amount of time.. The game itself is cool, but, sadly, unplayable. It keeps deleting saves all the time. I joined the Discord community only to find out that the problem has been there for months and devs don't seem to give a single F about it. That's terrible customer support and terrible take on the development, my experience has been extremely frustrating and I just can't give a positive score for the interesting concept itself.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A combo of rogue-like and city builder works surprisingly well. 15 hours into and I slowly start to feel the repetetivnes... But I don't want to judge too soon.. Another glaring case of ""don't believe the hype"". EXTREMELY grindy, repetitive, and ultimately massively boring. Roguelikes are supposed to be varied and never the same : here you'll waste your time playing the same map over and over and over again. RNG is clearly against you and will systematically avoid giving you the things you need to progress; according to the devs, ""that's the point, you'll have to change your strategy ! and make the best with what you got !"" Except when the RNG decides it won't give you that crucial, absolutely necessary building even after 8 re-rolls, well, nomatter how well you play, you're F'ed. Need a building to produce cloathing ? 95% of chances you won't get it : as soon as something is requiered from orders, it just stops showing up, period. Either you got it earlier, either you're f'd. I swear after 6 random choices, RNG STILL refuses to give you what you need. A lot of things just don't work in this game (way too many ressources make the game unecesseraly harder than it should be, RNG is wayyy too prevalent, a ton of buildings serve no purpose and are just mild variations of the same things). Worst part is the RNG, except you can remove ""random"", because the system is purposely unfair and actively works against you : if you're lacking 1 single building that would solve all of your problems, be sure you'll never, EVER get it. TLDR : overly complicated mechanics for the sake of being overly complicated, EXTREMELY repetitive (you seriously feel like you're doing the exact same thing over and over again), and the most agressively unfair RNG I've ever seen in a roguelite.. One of the best city builders I've played. Since many things are randomized, such as which buildings you'll have access to and what resources are available, every town turns out differently. The crafting recipes can take several inputs, and many buildings make the same things at different efficiencies. So players can't set up a strategy that will win every game. There are always new problems to solve. Definitely recommended.. A remarkable achievement in blending compelling video game genres, and pushing the boundaries of both in the meantime. With a graphic style that evokes Warcraft 3 nostalgia, this is a must play game of the year.. Extremely slow and boring, also don't see anything new here that hasn't been done a hundred times in other roguelite or city builder type games.. Incredible game. I suspect this will inspire many other roguelite city builders in the future. I can't stop playing. It scratches the same itch as CK3 and Civ ala the ""one more turn"" mentality, but perhaps to a greater degree. Serious bug in 1.02R of gamepass version. Saves would be wiped out randomly. Dev doesn’t care in their discord and keeps telling people how to transfer save from gamepass to steam. My other games on gamepass are fine so their claim that issue is from MS side is ****.. One of the best games I've ever played. Don't buy this if you're looking for a city builder.. So far, I haven't seen anything special. If you don't like city builders, this won't win you over.. I love games where you have to manage your resources in the adversity. Unfortunately, most of the time, as the game gets longer, it's getting repetitive and tedious to play (I'm looking at you Civilization!). Against the Storm is perfect with its ~2h game approach, once you conquered the unique challenges of your run you are rewarded and can go to the next city. ""Unique challenges"" is the key here, the diversity of situations that arise is super important for a game that would otherwise be repetitive. They nailed it! With a huge amount of modifiers: Biomes, races, buildings, bonuses, ressource nodes etc. While keeping everything altogether in a way that it works! This game is a pearl of game design! Soundtrack is amazing too! A bit tough the first games to get into it but well worth the investment! I'd recommend it for anyone that loves strategic games!. This is what you want from a game! Perfect for high IQ people who wants some challenge.. Takes the best aspects of city builders, RTS, and even Rogue lite, or card games and rolls it into a hard to describe but incredibly addictive and deep game. I especially love how they encourage a reactionary play style that rewards being able to adapt and solve problems. If you enjoy anything at all, you will find this palatable.. On first glance, the a citybuilder roguelite didn't make much sense - you want your city to grow and grow and grow, right? So why would you want to throw it away by making the game a roguelite? However, after trying the demo, I was amazed - the combination's genius! How has nobody thought of this before? (or at least I haven't heard of such games) Turns out, to me (and probably many others) the idea of late game in city builder/4X games sounds fun, but it's actually the most tedious part of the game - you just have so much to manage that either your gameplay really bogs down, or you just can't pay attention to much and just watch the numbers grow. The devs of AtS realized that the most interesting part of these games is the early and mid game, where you don't have everything yet and need to solve many problems for your city to survive. By cutting down on the late game and putting a victory screen in your face after you reached that point (with an option to continue the settlement if you really want to though), Against the Storm incentivizes you to engage with the best part over and over. And thanks to the constant unlocks, map modifiers, and the simple fact that you don't have the same buildings available every time, every run feels like a fresh puzzle - you can't use cookie cutter solutions, you gotta use what is offered! One thing I can't omit is also the excellent focus on the UX and QoL features. I've been put off from a lot of management games due to them having some really annoying ways to do basic or repetitive stuff. In AtS, the devs listen to the community's suggestions on what the pain points are and it really shows - the game feels very polished. There is a lot of convenient settings and hotkeys, but the game doesn't overwhelm you with them - it lets you learn at your own pace and discover cool new ways of doing things from the tooltips and Aunt Lorie's hints.. It start a bit badly, but I haven't played such an enjoyable game for a long time.. I really try to avoid rating games 10/10, but Against the Storm truly deserves it. It is a perfect mix of city building, resource management, roguelite served in a relaxing but definitely not boring form. Every single settlement you build is a bit different, the pool of available buildings and buffs is changing. The ""tree"" of industry (raw->processed->product etc.) is more like a gigantic net where you can use like 3 or 4 intersecting paths to reach any product, depending on available resources, buildings, buffs, etc. When it comes to the art style, Against the Storm is simply beautiful - I love both graphics and music. Together with relatively non-punishing and flexible game mechanics it makes the game extremely relaxing (even on higher difficulty levels, to some extent). And on top of that - devs are very friendly and responsive. Game is very polished, actually it was looking almost complete even 1 year before release, when it hit Early Access.. An intriguing little game that keeps making me come back to it. I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed at first and the game was getting a bit repetitive - but just in time, new elements started getting added in and the game gets more complex as you progress. My main criticism would still be that it evolves too slowly and doesn't do a good job of showing players what they're playing for and towards. But once you see where it's going, it goes from being average to being quite good.. I know that game is repetitive and has a lot of room to improve, but the game is just captivating and i can get lost in it for hours over and over again. Music is fantastic and devs seemingly improving the game. Highly recommend it to people loving the genre.. I don't particularly like this genre but this has become one of my favorite games. Perfect mix of roguelike and city builder, great problems to solve, just the right amount of RNG and every playthrough is different!. Amazing city building/strategy game. Currently in early access, it is being polished and updated every two weeks and the work done is great. The game solves one of the main problem with this kind of game: the late game. In short, there isn't one. Every match is a new random location and you have to adapt your strategy based on the tools and modifiers you are offered. You have to please your settlers, please the Queen and then suddenly, by solving every small piece of the puzzle you win. If you like Dwarf Fortress but want a more relaxing challenge for a couple of hours this is the game for you.. So far really great city building rouge like game. Each level (city) has unique challenges and is never the same. Devs are consistently updating. Only reason a 9 right now is due to being in ""early access"". I like this game so much. Easy 60h in two weeks :D Soundtrack is cool and overall atmosphere and world is so beautiful!. This game is good and relaxing... a balance of mixed goal of playing to win or playing to chill the game design is great I love the icons and the artwork, the theme of everlasting rain is unique and I haven't found a game that combine this concepts perfectly. 10/10 I love this game. I just can get enough of this game. I have done almost everything there can be done, but with every update I come back for ""a few more games"". One of the best games I ever played and I love absolutly everything about it!. Fun game with a strong atmosphere to it. Fun to see it change throughout early access. Very addictive and fun game. I usually don't buy early access games but i gave it a shot and I'm really glad that i did. Even if it's early access, the game is already really fun to play with tons of replay value.. I'm an avid enjoyer of city builders/colony survival games as well as the roguelite formula of slowly expanding gameplay that repeatedly starts from square one with changes and improvements over time. Against the Storm is an incredible take on mixing those two concepts together. The design is pleasant if a bit minimal (not as minimal as some pixel art projects though. 3d models go a long way in an indie game). I love that I can play a scenario/town/expansion/whatever in about an hour an a half. The devs are engaged and communicative. Well worth the money. TLDR; If you enjoy colony/city building games but dislike how many hours they take, pick this game up.. This game is at early access right now (24/1/2022).This review have 2 parts: The game itself, and my opinion about the developers. The game is a strange new formula that i haven't seen before. It mix roguelite elements with a classical building game ¿Strange mix true? It is. The game will be a succession of ""runs"", each one different to the others. In a ""run"" we will have to do a few ""missions"". For each mission we will have to choose biome, how far we are from our main city, and we will have to choose wisely, as more difficult is the game bigger is the reward. In this main city we can develop permanent updates and unlock recipes and blueprints for buildings. The game revolves around this missions, where you basically spam in a procedurally generated map, where you will have to choose your inital blueprints between a few options that are pseudorandom. You will discover another blueprints during the mission ( but always choosing between options). we will have to survive to a succession of rain-light-storm cycles, and after each cycle we will receive new settlers and some random traits, both chosen between a few random options again. This mechanic make the game very enjoyable, as you have to adapt to each biome and combinations of buildings each mission, opening a lot of options and strategies. You can be a hard explorer, requiring to resolve the problems that this way have, or you can try to manage to make a sustainable community, looking for places to make farms and some elaborated food. The options and combinations are gigantic. On the other side the developers are very concerned with the game. They listen to the community suggestion and try to implement that ideas. They update the game very often, some of them being reworks or ""basic"" mechanics, adding more complexity and flexibility, new biomas, new traits, new buildings, etc. They are kind people that clearly make a hard effort to build a consistent game, beloved by them and the community. You can see it in each mechanic, the style of the game or the updates. In resume (and sorry about any english fail i have make, it is not my main tongue) If you really love building games, and want to try something fresh this game is ideal. If you really like roguelites, and want to try something fresh, this game can be for you too (but not if you hate building games). And in general, if you love to manage and try to obtain the best on each situation, this is clearly your game. For me, this game fulfilled all the expectations that i had with frostpunk( and that were never fulfilled by it). I'm surprised by how clever this game is and how much I like it - enough to sign up for Metacritic to write a review. If you're a fan of Anno or Banished I'd really recommend it.. Even that the game is at its fairly early stage of development it is very, very enjoyable. I love how each new settlement you play you're given random buldings to choose from. Would definetly buy this one again once it's out on Steam. My current favorite game! I'm about 100 hours in and am loving it. They handle the learning portion of the game extremely well. Having to adjust your gameplan on the fly based on what you bring with you, what upgrades you are offered, and the map layout is a lot of fun. The pause mechanic is great too. Great job :). By far one of my favorite games. I can't wait for it to come out on Steam so I can buy it again.. Tons of replayability, interesting gameplay, beautiful art design and the development team that listens to their players. Even in early access this game has a lot to offer and it's only getting better. The only thing I don't like is that it's an Epic games exclusive so the Steam release will be later than I'd prefer.. TL;DR - Developers listened to the community and made changes quickly after the game was released. When I first got the game a couple weeks ago I was not winning many games and started to get frustrated since I was not sure what I was doing wrong. I kept at it, tried different strategies, and got some levels and upgrades from the city. After this recent update, I'm winning games and really enjoying the game. I'm not sure if it was the update, me leveling up, or me just learning mechanics and creating strategies, but I'm having fun. I would like to see some UI / quality of life changes going forward. For example, if you have a building selected and have go into 'build mode' the selected building is blocking 1/3 of the screen. My instinct is to hit esc, but that closes the build mode and the selected building. Yes you do have the scale UI option, but that didn't work for me. QoL change I would like is a way to see that buildings are making what at a glance. I find myself clicking around cause I have a building in a tight space that I forgot about and its using all my stone.","the people that gave this game a bad user score, just don't get the game . the graphics are a bit mid, not 10/10 material, and some of the art style a bit... unique . the people that gave this game a bad user score, just don't get the game ."
