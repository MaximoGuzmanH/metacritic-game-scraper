386.Sacrifice (2000),"Eurogamer's review aged like milk. Basically, the reviewer had skill issues and blamed it on the game. Truly shows the guy was a beginner, lol.. a true masterpiece, story, gameplay, graphics, humor it's all there - only a few minor caveats with bugs here and there - the ai is very simple and just tries to rush you on later levels with overwhelming force. ""Most underrated game of all time"" has been overused to death... but Sacrifice is a strong contender for the title. Of course people who played it loved it (as the ratings here shows) but it's a mostly forgotten game with no chance of an HD remake, sadly. It's such a shame because the atmosphere, music, design and *especially* the gameplay are truly unique. It mixes action RPG with RTS elements to perfection. Each solo campaigns are unique because you can choose a different god each time and gain a unique set of spells and units by the end of the game. The controls are really smart and well before its time. Having a RTS game controlled from the ground without being a complete mess is a tour-de-force. (bonus point for the death and save/loading having an actual in-game, it's part of the many clever things of this game) PLEASE PLEASE make an HD remake of that game.. Sacrifice follows a very unique approach. It mixes real-time strategy with 3D third person perspective. And this idea works out wonderful. The graphics and gameplay are nearly perfect! Clearly a must-play!. Immortal classic that should be remember. Innovative gameplay (RTS TPP), good story and interesting lore. Graphic aged badly, but it's still the game of my childhood and one of the most original strategy.. Long ago this game was released and I installed in onto my PC. Little did I know I was about to have the most memorable gaming experience of my life. I remember staying home 'sick' and playing this ALL DAY. The single player is fantastic, the story is fun, and the multiplayer was one of the first of its kind. In fact, the multiplayer exist till this day. The Steam community has kept this game alive. In a nutshell, this game was similar to a early World of Warcraft but much more streamlined and simplified. In fact, WoW didn't come out till 2 years after Sacrifice. I think WoW stole some ideas. Nonetheless, give this game a shot. Even today it holds up.. Fantastic experience working on this game and I still play it every Christmas holiday. It's one of those games that you can play again and again. i have worked on many games but I keep coming back to this one. It has everything you need from great gameplay to strategy. Admittedly the learning curve for a beginner is steep but once over that curve it's pure pleasurable gameplay.. With an impressive story, phenomenal and unique gameplay, Sacrifice is easily one of the best and most underrated games of all time. The storyline is intriguing backed up by splendid voice acting. The player can make various choices throughout the game that impact the path you're taking and the spells you'll be able to acquire. A memorable soundtrack fitting to the game backs up the fun gameplay and the scale of the spells you'll be able to perform. Massive battles, interesting Wizards and Gods to choose from, one who plays this game won't forget it easily. The Scapex Editor that comes along with the game it's also a very impressive feature that allows the player to create his own scenarios to the game. For me it's a 10/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone out there that wishes to try something new.. Most innovative game of this genre. Graphics are really nice and story is thrilling. The game offers a large variety of endings. Game mechanics are easy to understand and both soundtrack and voicing are perfect.. It is a beautiful masterpiece that any gamer can't afford to miss. It has a sad story though it is one of the least known gems in the world and was way ahead of it's time. PLAY IT! it's gaming history.. This is one of the old games i played together with ""Clive barkers"" undying. And again is a monolith and one of the few hybrid RTSRPG games that really work. The story is fantasy with a bit of a twist. Think Discworld kind of absurd humor, but with serious tone. The story in itself dont sound so great , its basicly a mage that made a deal with a demon to ""destroy his enemies"" that kind of destroyed that world, and now follows the mage over different planes wrecking havoc. But the gameplay! its immersing and clever! You steer your mage on the battlefield commanding dragons and druids , combined with excellent graphics for its days, and a soundtrack that still blows me out the window, it makes a battle , feel like a titanic clash ! The Soul Gathering system is also fun and makes for awesome multiplayer skirmishes and needs to be played to understand correctly. This is a game i recommend everyone to try, and for the low price its now selling for, you get one of the best handcrafted rpg hybrid in history, in my own humble opinion. Truly unique strategy game with it's alternative approach, beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, different gods and excellent story and voice acting. 9/10. A lot of things could be said about this overlooked gem ****, here are some of them: Innovative, imaginative, fun, funny, weird, engaging... I could go on and on. There are no bad sides to this game that I could think of. Pick it up and have some fun.. I play a lot of game, but Sacrifice is my number one. A fantastic story, beatiful music and great gameplay. In addition you have a chance to serve for god which you choose. That`s fantastic.. An excellent game with lots of innovative ideas. Great story, and a very nice touch with reloading ""this is not what actually happened"". The artwork was amazing for the time. Really one of the best games ever, and surely one of the best in the RTS genre.. A very much underdog game it got passed up by a lot of others and that truly saddened me, this game has a mix of RTS and a magical FPS system too it, you're down in the fight and controlling the units is surprisingly easy for not being above the action. The game is charmingly funny and while the story is not the most engaging thing in the world it is quite fun to play through many times over for the branching and changed story lines. Many different endings phenomenal voice acting (including Tim Curry) It is quirky fun and an overall enjoyable game and is in fact one of my favorites of all time.","""Most underrated game of all time"" has been overused to death . but it's a mostly forgotten game with no chance of an HD remake . it mixes action RPG with RTS elements to perfection ."
387.Pikmin,"Pleasant little real time puzzle game reminiscent of Kirby. A bit lacking in excitment but nice and relaxing to play.. The game play formula of this game is just amazing. You can multitask so much that it makes it a blast to see how much you can do at one time. This is one of the most repayable games I've ever played, it's short and sweet and every time I'm done with it all i want to do is play it again. It's super unique and besides a few glitchy elements the whole game's great.. The best pikmin game, this games time management system is so fun, and its just super relaxing to play, cause while you still have to get stuff done, if you go at a decent pace there is no worries of failure. So charming and fun! Perfect length too. This is a really good game. By far has the best combat mechanics in the series. And has a fun to collect but not too overwhelming collectable. The balance between the types is the best in the series. There are some cons to this experience. This review is based on the switch version. The pikmin get stuck on everything and are very stupid. Its impossible not to get at least one pikmin death without something stupid happening. The game is too short and can be beaten in one sitting. The game lacks many proper boss fights Swarming feels clunky sometimes and often fails. The forest naval is really annoying and I hate it lol. The game lacks a proper challenge mode that the other games have. Overall the game is really good for its time and incredibly fun! Great if you have some time to kill and the gameplay loop is very addicting, and it has great enemy design.. A nice and original puzzle game, i remember having some fun watching my friends play it.. The Good • The areas are very well-designed along with wonderful music and visuals. • The progression is very good. • Olimar is a wonderful character and full of charm. The Bad • The Pikmin AI is jank. They tend to trip and get stuck on things, meaning you’ll have to suddenly stop to help them. Overall Pikmin 1 still holds up as a game I want to come back to, even all these years later.. Pikmin is an extremely fun game, but relatively short and for a brand new series at the time and now this game was a great example of an exciting new series coming and showcases the GameCubes capability's whilst having great art design and graphics for GameCube standards. Great debut.. I enjoy these little characters and animals however pikmin can sometimes be really stupid and trip over or do stuff that I didn't tell them to do. The start to one of the best video game franchises ever! Must play since they ported it to the switch!. Why do the pikmins always stuck on the road? And they turned me into one of them at the end. Is this a bad thing? Maybe to be a pikmin is a happy thing. Who knows.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game in the Pikmin series. Very addicting with very high replay value. Great atmosphere and sense of isolation. The maps are extremely well designed. I know some people think the game is too short, but I disagree. It’s the perfect length for this type of game.. Solid game. Pikmin excels in its visual and sound design, as well as how everything is communicated to the player. The game's main goal of collecting 30 parts in 30 days is established immediately so you know the means of escaping the planet. It lets you get right into doing whatever you want with only a few tutorials in the earlier days, and the game opens up quite a lot past the first three days. I can see myself coming back to this in the future to improve my score, since the game is quite short and easy to get back into replaying. This game is an excellent and enjoyable experience and I believe it's a contender for Miyamoto's magnum opus. The only reason this isn't a 10 is because the sequels have much more content and features and the Pikmin AI gets a little funky at times.. If you ask me anything about this game I would be baffled. I never understood Pikmin in any shape and form, and the strategy guide failed to bring any clarity to what I was doing. This game has a timer of 30 days, and you collect random objects as part of your mission. The game’s title comes from the creatures that are the staple of it in Pikmin. You pluck them out of the ground, and then you try to build an army of them to complete your tasks. I cannot really say anything more about this game when I simply could not understand it at all.. You grow plants and make them fight, honestly the original Plants Vs. Zombies. Jk, this game is a masterpiece, and everyone should play it, if it gets ported to switch buy it, its graphics look very good on the Gamecube.. PIKMIN is easily my all time favourite game. However I acknowledge that Pikmin is not perfect and suffers from being hard to describe from a genre perspective. I would Highly Recommend PIKMIN to anyone.. This is how you how'd other Nintendo fans that you were hardcore and mentally insane. Pikmin 1 is the most **** unfair, game you'll play and that's why it's amazing. This game doesn't hold your hand it doesn't care about your feeling it will beat you for not learning its mechanics. Pikmin 1 and 2 force you to think and understand everything. This game is intimidating to first-time players but you'll slowly learn about bomb rock usage, Pikmin importance, how fast enemies can kill your Pikmin, Pikmin Path AI, how to avoid tripping, etc. Pikmin 1 has a lot of similarities to old arcade games in all honestly because the game its self isn't that long and beating it isn't the point. The point of Pikmin master the game beat it in, as few in-game days as possible. Pikmin is a series that more people need to try and while its difficulty can be overwhelming at points it's well worth it in my opinion.. Pikmin, another great franchise that was born in Nintendo's most innovative period - the early days of Gamecube. Pikmin is far from being a perfect game but it has all the charm of a cult classic. Over shadowed by the innovative Luigi's Mansion, Pikmin was frequently overlooked by Gamecube gamers. That was a HUGE mistake! Pikmin has so much to offer. It has the fun of any great Nintendo game packed into an intriguing and simple story mixed with the need for strategy to survive in the game. The game is quite short as time is of the essence in the game. A must have game for Gamecube collectors and nothing less than a classic from generation 6.. A great game for sure! I love the strategy and having to handle multiple tasks at once. But it can be tedious at times choosing what colored Pikmin to use. Other simple quality of life improvements are in the future editions. But still a solid game as long as you are willing to sit down for a few hours.. The first Pikmin game is a very enjoyable game even today and started the phenomenal Pikmin franchise. The gameplay loop of battling enemies using the Pikmin and repairing your ship by locating and retrieving the ship parts, is very rewarding. And planning out how best to tackle a day to get the most done is very fun. However, the game shows it age at certain times, with plucking new Pikmin taking ages and some enemies being invincible during attack animations. In addition to the main game mode, it is a challenge mode where you can see how much you can collect and how many enemies you can defeat in one day. The soundtrack is in my opinion the best part of the game, my god the soundtrack is amazing! I have made a more in depth review on my YT channel. [link omitted per site rules] Final score: 7.5. infinitly replayable, awesome level design and fun gameplay. Pikmin is a joy and one of the Gamecube finest titles.. Oh boy! I said looking at my game to play it. I want to be honest Pikmin is an awesome **** big part of it is the **** of course, the sweet feeling of choosing which Pikmin come with you.like opening a new phone **** people saying this game is boring are the **** you know how to play, you will like this game!. My personal rating for ""Pikmin"" (GC): 7,4/10 - Good Gameplay: 8,5 Video: 7 Audio: 7 Scope: 4,5 Balance: 7,5 Story: 6. Fresh idea, entertaining game, game design could have been better since I got stuck with not finding the yellow pikmin and having to restart the game. 8 is a proper score I think.. A very unique game and interesting game mechanics. The story is weird but weird in a compelling way that makes you want to finish the game.. an absolutely fantastic game, for a gamecube launch title it looks and sounds absolutely stunning with nice vibrant colours, incredible models and sound design. the gameplay is unique and works well with very few problems like movement and aiming (which is fixed in the 2009 re-release on the wii), the games difficulty can be brutal at times to players new to the game but upon each re-visitation you come to understand and improve upon the game. while this game does have it's problems they are few and far between - the major one is as stated before the inability to move and aim at the same time in opposite directions - while this can be annoying it only truly affected my experience when it came to the final boss fight, another issue i find is the pikmin themselves getting stuck on terrain and me losing them or falling through bridges causing them to drown because their AI path-finding buggers up but as stated before this dint effect my experience. overall a fantastic game worth a purchase (get it on the wii if you can).. My favorite GCN game................................................................................................................................................. Pikmin is a series I adored from the start and for amazing and great reasons. The games never get old and are original and have great gameplay. But the second one IS better.. At first, this game got me confused. I look at it again to realize a tiny adventure is actually great to view but I'd probably get lost and get myself in a sticky situation if I played this in any platform.. Great game, but a bit short. I've always loved the satisfying feeling of taking down the big enemies in these with such tiny little creatures. The music is peaceful, and the imminent 30 day countdown always gives a sense of urgency to gather up all the parts of your ship ASAP. The 3 Pikmin types provide you with allot of environmental puzzles (such 1 type being able to swim, while the other 2 types just drown) to make you strategise about how to get to certain areas without killing the majority of your army. Great fun!. This game is one of the better titles for the Nintendo Gamecube. I like its originality especially. While there are some annoying glitches they don't make the game unplayable in the slightest. My only complaint is that it's very short.. This game is just amazing. Why I give it a 8? Because, you are on a time limit. Even though its on a time limit, its still an amazing game! I suggest to get it, as long with Pikmin 2, and as long with Pikmin 3, if you have a Wii U.. One of the most creative games to appear in nintendo, hugely entertaining, challenging and beautiful. It is very funny to play. Sequels have been quite good but this first episode deserves the highest rate. Saludos.. A true masterpiece, this game will challenge you, hard. Play it, you won't regret a single second. I would of given this game a 10 if it had not been for the tight stiffness of the controls, other than that, beautiful game, thanks Nintendo!. Awesome game, but the difficulty is way too hard at times. Extremely original and addictive. I really don't like how there's a time limit to finish the game and a lack of boss battles. Besides those flaws, the graphics are still good by today's standards, and the player will stay intrigued for days trying to get all of olimar's ship parts back and growing your pikmin population. The sequel improved on all of these problems, and it is a better game, but if you love nintendo, do yourself a favor and buy this game, and it's 2 sequels!. Having crash landed on an unknown planet Captain Olimar has only 30 days in which to rebuild his spaceship and escape before his life support system can no longer function. He soon finds himself aided in his quest to recover his mission spaceship parts by strange creatures known as Pikmin. Essentially a real time strategy title the player can order these Pikmin (of which there are three different types with different functions and abilities) in groups of up to 100 to collect said parts, as well as other valuable objects, over the course of thirty days. Of course everything is not quite that simple and Olimar will often find himself face to face with carnivorous beasts, which will eat Pikmin for breakfast if given the chance, as well as all manner of environmental puzzles to solve. Featuring a level of charm that only Nintendo seems to be able to deliver Pikmin is amongst the very best strategy games available on any console and should be part of anyone’s collection.. A pretty fun little game that's really colorful and something different. Gameplay is unique but does get a little repetitive. Overall: A decent title that tried really hard to be something new. A shame the novelty wears off too quickly.. One of the most magical experiences for the Gamecube, Pikmin offers gamers a wondrous world and great gameplay. Managing your Pikmin and time wisely, collecting your ship parts, and avoiding danger all at the same time offer a challenge that some may be turned off by. This game stands up to the title of one of Nintendo's great IP's.. Pikmin was a game that differ from those that are on the marketplace. The game has brilliant music that is calm and peaceful which is a great plus when making a plan the only problem with the game is the time limit it made me feel like i needed to hurry up at all times!. A remarkable experience that any GCN owner should have already had. Pros: Adorable, addictive, and original gameplay; rich in color; overall, it's fairly challenging and packed with witty puzzles and obstacles. Cons: The length is peculiar; annoying camera; repetitive sequences.. Incredibly fun and addictive this game is worth playing even now if you own a Nintendo Wii, I hope the next gen version of this game lives up to the expectations.",the game play formula of this game is just amazing . besides a few glitchy elements the whole game's great . overall the game is really good for its time and incredibly fun .
388.The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series,"A masterpiece. Good story, perfect characters, great voice actors. One of the best games.. Such a good story every character has a own personality and story most of the decisions are so important and effect the story this game is near as masterpiece. This is a game that lies to you constantly, trying to give you the illusion that your choices are influencing the plot. In reality, there is only one ending. Puzzles are far too basic to recommend it if you're looking for a point & click game.. one of the best story ever and one of the best zombie games ever its the walking dead. Whatever you doing right now you stop doing and play this game. The characters, the story, the twists, the backstabs... This game is literally perfect. Like we need more games like this. I played a lot of story games. Like a LOT. Yet I have never seen a game as amazing and beautiful as this. However some deaths are weird.. except for that, the game is PERFECT. I would literally give the creators my kidney just to see another season of this game. The fact that there's no games like this puts me into depression.. This games story is amazing and the characters feel like actual people but my main problem is the choose your own adventure aspect, the game gives an illusion of choice when in reality there is none almost making it meaningless.. This game really impressed me deeply. The choices are very good, but there is only one bad aspect; ""usually"" it does not affect the result. For example, what I think would have been much better was that it was definitely a good ending and that you could not continue other games with this ending. I know it would be very difficult, maybe the producers wouldn't be able to handle it. But it's still a good game for me. I won't deduct points for these shortcomings of the game because it has many good aspects.. --------------I can stand and clap for this game forever------------------------ they proved that no amount of interactivity like in other games of this genre can compare with a good story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The classic telltale weirdness is here but the story is amazing. everything in this game is memorable.. I love this game but man; the PC port, with Xbox anyway, is tragic! A camera glitch, where the camera will go all the way to one side from time to time, that is a minor annoyance in episode 1 makes episode 2 actually unplayable. That's not hyperbole, the game's actually unbeatable because of that glitch.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This has to be one of the best story games out there! The characters really grow on you and the game isn't afraid to show you everything that happens when the world goes to shi!.. Great Story, great characters, choices (for the most part) matter, This series has been amazing to play. Currently almost done with S4 E4.. Best game Because Good story perfect characters gestures (s2 and s4) Good graphics and Perfect characters (Clem,Lee,Kenny). A masterpiece it was one of the best game i've ever played in my whole life with such a amzing storyline a great thx to those who made this game and made us happy for a such a beuatiful 8 hours,thank you so much,also characters were perfect and they realy handled and matched the storyline and many..many beautiful action scenes that we saw in the game,it was perfect and amazing i whish i could remove this game from my memory and play it again,it was a real masterpiece. As someone who has never seen or cared to watch any of the TV show, I thoroughly enjoyed this episodic adventure. This is probably Telltale's best and most well told story (outside of The Wolf Among Us). You really feel attachment to the strongly developed characters and while ""Choice's Matter"" seems like trope now, it did have a lot of meaning in this game and you really cared which decision you were making.. The story is beautiful, the characters are beautiful, the emotion is very good, the entrance of the music is really legendary....... I mean, simply incredible. Incredible. The way it ended... I mean, just incredible. This is one of the greatest games of all time. And that's in spite of how much i disliked that one option in particular, a seemingly innocuous one, had a very bad impact on the game's outcome. Fortunately, I replayed it to right the wrong. The ability to watch Clem grow up, through the struggles and strife, to meet so many incredible people, and so many not so incredible people that need to be overcome. To have the ability to really deal with the problems through the choices allowed, it was just incredible. The story... it was all an amazing experience. To go through the heartbreak, and grow through it even, it was amazing. There few a couple games that are able to capture not only a story or a scene, but also to encapsulate values, and TWD does it incredibly well. And its made even better by the fact that you can make the choices that lead to what values you deem fit and get out of the game. Clem, Lee, Violet, Javi, Kate, and more. This is one of those games that is able to transcend being just a game.. Generally when I've seen this game, I already started loving it for the fact it's a topic about zombies (I was years old), now... Nothing changed after playing the whole trilogy. Story, gameplay, the idea of having hard choices, drawing-kind style and zombie apocalypse atmosphere is making this game one of the best games ever made :). This game more than perfect because Lee becomes a character which is you shaped and the choices that you made directs the game. The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series delivers a gripping narrative, emotional depth, and impactful choices that truly shape the story. The character development and intense decision-making make it a standout experience in the gaming world. A must-play for fans of compelling storytelling!. It's perfect. For me one of the best stories in gaming, if not the best. It's so emotional and every single episode has so many good plot twists that leave you flabbergasted. Also the gameplay is actually pretty good and gives you a lot of options. The game has so many endings and can end in different ways. It's not scary, me as a man who doesn't really like horrors play it. The only games that can come close to this story-wise and genuine interest are probably Red Dead, The Last Of Us and Uncharted.. It’s not perfect but The Walking Dead is one of the most important advances in interactive fiction for a generation, with some of the most memorable characters of any video game.. A videogame that revolutionized choice-driven games and spawned a new genre of telltale like videogames, from which bestsellers such as Until Dawn and Detroit: Become Human take inspiration from. Excellent story and gripping characters throughout all games, with the Final Chapter closing off the series on a great note despite the rough times at telltale in 2018. A must-play classic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was the first time a story in a videogame captivated me. Before this I really only played platformers and stuck to nintendo consoles. I experienced this whole game with my best friend at the time. Man that ending hit so hard and it really changed my outlook on storytelling in games. Yeah the choices you make all lead to the same story outcome, but the story and characters are so well written that it really doesn't matter to me that much. This game helped shape me into the person I am today. Play this game!. the first season is 10/10, the others chapters are not in the same level, but i mean, still better than the tv show.. The one game that, after all these years, still sits in my head.. It’s not perfect but The Walking Dead is one of the most important advances in interactive fiction for a generation, with some of the most memorable characters of any video game, and a very good story.. Great storytelling however dad always dies. It is a death sentence. Love live Kenny.. Highly recommend. My favorite tell-tale project and their most iconic for a reason. Clementine is one of the more interesting gaming characters you get to see actually grow up and your decisions actually factor into the type of person she ends up becoming. Numerous endings to each season although the decision-making itself throughout each episode does feel a little shallow at times as a bunch of the decisions just feel like slightly worded variants of the same answer that does not really affect much. But a great art style, solid story, and incredibly interesting cast makes this a great interactive game to play.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Great story, this is a game that is truly a piece of art, a must play for anyone that admires a game that can touch your feelings.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There's a remastered version available now, together with all the other games in the series, The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series, which is superior to the original game in terms of visuals and overall presentation. The remaster does a great job of bringing the game up to today's standards, although the original game still holds up well in terms of graphics. I highly suggest you consider playing the remaster because it is superior. The story in this game is a part of the comic books ""The Walking Dead,"" but you don't really need to know anything about them. You don't even need to be a great gamer to fully experience this. This game is so well-crafted that anybody can enjoy it. By far, this has been the best gaming experience I've had. I never thought it would be possible to feel something like this in a video game. The character interactions, exploration, puzzles, dialogues, and choices – everything is amazing. I cared deeply about each character in the story, and they all left their mark, whether positive or negative. I eagerly anticipated what would happen next at every moment, and I never experienced a second of boredom. Truly astounding. I did realize that this isn't the type of game with completely divergent routes altering the entire experience from A to Z. The choices do matter, but to a certain extent. They alter the story's delivery, while the core remains intact. This doesn't bother me, honestly. Some choices hold greater long-term weight, while others have more transient impacts. You can never be sure which is which. These choices can reshape characters, how they engage with you, even certain scenes. Consequences are present – don't forget that. They might not lead you on a wholly distinct path, transitioning from zombies to aliens, but they are significant, believe me. However, certain elements will always persist, yet the game's craftsmanship ensures you'll never predict which. It's a unique experience that will remain indelibly etched in your memory, defying comparison with anything else. It thrives as a video game, where you assume control of characters and engage with others. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what Telltale did with this game that made me love it so profoundly, but they certainly achieved it. For real, I even shed tears at the end, and I have no qualms admitting it. The emotions I felt for Lee and Clem in this game, surpass anything I've experienced for characters in other stories. Do yourself a favor and play this, regardless of your gaming inclination. Basic English language knowledge is all you need.. That was a great one. Is kind of a shame that any of the other Telltale games reached what they promised. No matter what you do in those games, you always end up seeing yourself in the same spot you would have been if you had made different choices.. The game is super cool. I literally cried at the end of the last episode of final season. Strongly recommend to play. I played all 4 seasons in two weeks. Can't imaging that we will not see more episodes and Clem anymore. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Another narrative game or with a lot of dialogue / cinematic but whose available dubbing is only English. The other communities such as the French, Germans, Russians, etc... are neglected. My money will be better at other studios.. One of the best stories in gaming history with one of the strongest protagonist of all time. The supporting cast only benefits the game and makes you generally anxious when it comes to their safety. This is one of the few tell tale games when the choices REALLY matter and it adds to the games replay value. I'm only docking a point because I feel like the main antagonist (although well motivated) is bit of a reach and playing this on the ps4 port, I found some glitches (not game breaking but a little annoying) however if your wanting an emotional story with a hint of terror, pick this game up.. One of the greatest stories ever told in the zombie medium, delivered in the usual bland Telltale package. The choose your own adventure elements don't do much to elevate the story ultimately, The illusion of choice ****.. Hundred times better than a tv show of walking dead. the story is very realistic there are almost no logical mistakes which makes to fully feel the apocalyptical vibe. The story is excellent, characters are well-made.. I've never played a game like this in my life. This game is one of the best story games in the world. Those who didn't play should regret it. Gameplay - 7 Plot & Characters - 9 Storytelling - 9 Pacing - 7 Music & Sound - 6 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. the first video game that me cry. this is still the best game out of all the walking dead series.. This game really excels with giving the player meaningful choices. Characters are grounded and act consistently so the game frequently poses dilemmas that will have near and far reaching consequences. Your choices matter in this game and when the characters are so well voiced it means the consequences hit so much harder. The relationship between the two main characters is sold so well, making for a fun and sometimes emotional game.. Pretty phenomenal storytelling and characters, and the father-like relationship between Lee and Clementine is easily one of the best pairings in videogame history. As an interactive experience, it's easy to see that decision making often leads to binary ""A or B"" choices, that arguably don't affect the game, that being said Telltales Walking Dead will **** you in with how character relationships progress and/or falter. Overall, a roller-coaster of emotions.. A beautiful blend of story telling and making you believe you’re not just in a video game. This is truly a work of art and a masterpiece on its own.. I don't think a game series has ever brought as much emotion out of me as TWD by Telltale. As the name of the studio suggests, this is an interactive story rather than a game. If you are okay with this type of media, TWD will be a joy to experience.. Every choice in The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series reflects on you and affects your relationship with the other characters.. ITS BETTER THAN THE MORB MOVIE SOME HOW I cant believe this game changed my life now I'm based and i hate furrys and i hate anime and this game has no furrys or anime man so its a win and so gud i cant believe that this game only had 6 episodes and got a lower rating than Zelda ocarina of time i love this game so much and Kenny is a Christian man like me. I can only think of one game I like more than this one, so I guess this must be my second favourite game of all time. I really tried to come up with one. I even did research. Come to think of it, I also can't think of any books, movies or TV shows I'd rate higher. So it might be my second favourite piece of media of all time. Crazy. The final season is close competition, but this season is much more proficiently written. I rarely felt like I didn't want to choose any of the available dialogue options or that there was something important I wanted to say, but there was no dialogue option for it, or that the characters weren't acting sensibly. The important choices you have to make are, for the most part, genuinely difficult. Giving the player a limited amount of time to decide was an excellent idea because you could spend a lot of time weighing some of them up. It took me a long time to realise how difficult it must be to get that right. Telltale really made it feel effortless. And yet, I don't think I ever made a choice for reasons the game hadn't expected, which is a common source of frustration in adventure games. The emotional core of the game is the relationship between Clementine and Lee, an 8 year old girl and the history professor/convicted murderer who finds her alone at the onset of the zombie apocalypse. In the back story to this game, Lee found his wife in bed with another man, fought with him and killed him. As the player, you're forced to reconcile this fact with the kind and caring father figure he becomes to Clementine. Lee is wise, but pragmatic. He admits to making up his parenting philosophy on the fly and, for the most part, also can't fall back on the general ideas about parenting that even non-parents would be aware of. They lack the nuance required in the new, much more morally ambiguous post-outbreak world. In almost any other game, and most other media as well, Clementine would have been a standard child-shaped McGuffin. I get the feeling Telltale was aware of that and worked hard to avoid it. Thankfully, they didn't go too far in the opposite direction and make Clementine feel like an adult or an exaggeration. Season 1's Clementine is cautious and innocent, but savvy and resourceful. She's optimistic, but not naive. She's brave, but worries easily. She's loyal and has an immense capacity for empathy and understanding, even for people who have done terrible things. You build a relationship between the two characters gradually and realistically over the course of the game, mostly through small acts like cutting Clem's hair short to make it harder to grab. Say what you will about the ""dadification"" of video games, but this game made me want to learn about adoption. That's pretty powerful. It turns out that there are more adopters than potential adoptees in my country and fostering is usually at least a part-time job. The other characters are all pretty interesting as well, but you get the idea. And yes, I cried.. The best story-driven game ever made. Disregard the sequels or risk severe disappointment.. This was the first time a story in a videogame captivated me. Before this I really only played platformers and stuck to nintendo consoles. I experienced this whole game with my best friend at the time. Man that ending hit so hard and it really changed my outlook on storytelling in games. Yeah the choices you make all lead to the same story outcome, but the story and characters are so well written that it really doesn't matter to me that much. This game helped shape me into the person I am today. Play this game!. As this is TellTale's first ""hit,"" i can forgive some of the flaws. The gameplay is boring, there are bugs and glitches, the graphics and animations are far from perfect, but the story is the most emotionally engaging that TellTale has ever put out. The writing isn't their best, but it deserves this rating purely because of the emotional value. The relationship between Lee and Clementine and the characters themselves are something i'll never forget.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Masterpiece from Telltale Games Telltale Games are well known for creating great story based games in which the objective is not to murder every soul in sight, collect some hidden treasure or set the fastest time, no, its all about telling a story and letting you decide how that story will end. With The Walking Dead, Telltale does it again. An amazing game in which I literally cried at the end. When a game can do that to my rotten black heart, that means something. Because the focus here is based one hundred percent on the story, I will not say anything about it. This is something you need to experience for yourself. Let me just say that it is themed around the famous comic and TV series: The Walking Dead. That part was obvious, but it also completely original. It has some characters and locations from the comics, but is otherwise completely new and fresh. You collect different items that you can/must later use to progress. The game is on rail and apart from some mini games and puzzles, it plays itself forward, after the right choice or response has been given. It gives the feeling of an old school point and click game. The game can end early when making the wrong decision, in which you need to start over. The whole ending and which characters still live and which dies is entirely up to you. Based on your conversation with characters and your actions, it will dramatically impact the outcome. For this reason, you can play the game over again multiple times, and get many different endings. The Walking Dead from Telltales looks beautiful and makes good use of the cell shading graphics. The sounds and music are nice and fits the game well. The biggest strong point of this game is the connection that you establish with the characters and especially, the main character. You get really attached to them. You cannot stop playing because you want to know what is going to happen next. I found the game a little short, but this can be the fact that it is just so damn good that you keep playing for hours on end. This was my first experience with a Telltale game and it was a beautiful experience. Like I said, I cried like a baby at the end of the game and they were tears of sadness but also joy. The joy of finally playing a good game in the year 2013, the year that I completed this game fully. Definitely recommend this experience to anyone.. One of the best stories I've ever seen in a game, superb characters, superb narrative, superb everything.. this is one of those games you dont expect to be good in 2022 but definitely still holds up. The finale made me cry, the story is probably even better than the show, would recommend. cool ................................................................................. Great story with great characters and an excellent ending, I would say it's better than the show.. first game to ever make me cry not only did it make me cry because waiting for new episodes was a drag but the ending is sad. That's what game-movies should look like. Amazing story. Amazing characters. This game gave me nothing but huge amount of emotions.. the game is good for its time. liked. now I just print the text to fill the characters for feedback. This is one of the best games ever made, it's story is so good. The Walking Dead from Telltale was the first game that made me cry. I loved playing it with my cousin, good times.. this game is exciting from one of the few that made me cry mainly because of LEE at the end. absouloutley heartwarming story, the charachters were amazing the diaulouge was fenomenal and the graphics were beautiful for its time one of my favourite story games ever. This game is one of my favorites, due to its interactive story, how it catches you in chapter after chapter, the characters are awesome, you literally cry every second and how this season ends just leaves you wanting more and more.. best game I've ever played. I could never get over this game. BEST GAME EVER. Just perfect, story, character, everything is excellent. Feeling this game. And more words are not needed.. Basically, the best telltale game released by the studio. Too bad it's over already because it had the potential to go for 2-3 more parts.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best season of Telltale's Walking Dead. It mostly focuses on walkers' as the biggest danger, but also includes several conflicts inside of the group, and covers all the possible threats and problems survivors can face in zombie apocalypse. And i can not but emphasize the fantastic chemistry between two of the main protagonists, and how powerful ending feels like because of it.. One of the best games i have ever played. Even though you are not a fan of the twd, it catch your attention.. not so good technically, but really nice plotly. i won't complain about choices cuz its extremely stupid, plot is great, you dont think about matters of your choices generally, you just play. atmosphere is great, but game is too slow, sometimes its too boring. but overall its good. The border between film and video game becomes blurry, and the result is a unique interactive experience. This is a game about the choices that define who you are, and how the story adapts to those choices.. Absolute masterpiece, beautifully written, well developed characters and everytime I replay it, it makes me cry for days.. this game is an incredible display of storytelling. the graphics and game play are amazing for 2012 along with the great writing and thought that went into every second of it. amazing!. Its a great interactive story, i had never watched the Series or read the comics for The Walking Dead, but i found this game a great emotional experience. However, the game sometimes has graphical bugs and glitches, and it crashes and soft-locks for seemingly random reasons, but the rest of the game is great, 7/10. Stunning game with great story. I highly recommend to play all seasons and experience uniquely feelings like I did.. This has to be one of the best stories in a game that I've ever played. While the characters are very average, they are just regular every day people, the interaction you have with them creates an attachment, and emotional bond that you can't have with film. A game that is exciting from the very beginning. Great atmosphere of the zombie apocalypse, horror and hopelessness. Your every wrong word or action can lead to something big. You sincerely worry about the heroes and try to help them, but it doesn't always work out... The ending of the game also makes you cry. 10 out of 10.. The Walking Dead is an episodic adventure video game developed and published by Telltale Games. The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with events occurring shortly after the onset of the zombie apocalypse in Georgia. However, most of the characters are original to this game, which centers on university professor and convicted criminal Lee Everett, who rescues and subsequently takes care of a young girl named Clementine. Lee becomes a protective figure to her to help reunite her with her parents. Kirkman provided oversight for the game's story to ensure it corresponded to the tone of the comic, but allowed Telltale to handle the bulk of the developmental work and story specifics. Some characters from the original comic book series also make in-game appearances.. This has to be one of the best stories in a game that I've ever played. While the characters are very average, they are just regular every day people, the interaction you have with them creates an attachment, and emotional bond that you can't have with film or books. This is the first game that has had me tear up during its saddest moment. So because of that alone, this has to be the best, most immersing story I've ever experienced in a game. This is definitely worth playing.. I have never once had a game illicit a serious emotional response, but this game did thrice: anger when I found what a stranger had done, frustration when I found someone in our party had lied, and regret when I realized I had to let a friend down. And this is the spoiler-free version of the review. After playing this game, you'll no longer wonder why Hollywood is losing out to the video games industry.. This is the game that introduced me to Telltale Games. As a Walking Dead fan, I had high expectations, but this game managed to make my high expectations feel mediocre. The storytelling, the characters, the decisions all felt meaningful and alive. One of the few games that managed to make me think about the choices I made. a MUST PLAY.. It's a game that changes you. There's a HeartBreaking story, and you can feel the feelings of your character and how it impacts on other characters, it's in my top 5.. You’ll experience a storyline like no other. The relationships that you’ll establish to these characters are so strong and the soundtrack is just the cherry on top. I love games where you get to create your own storyline, based on the choices you make and Telltale’s The Walking Dead, does it like no other. Must play!!. the chemistry between Clementine and Lee in this game is amazing; the choices you make have serious effects on the future and the way other people in this game behave to you the atmosphere built around the apocalypse of the zombies is really terrifying and sad after finishing the game, i found myself depressed for a while and that's how you realize a game is awesome in storytelling. The best game I have ever played. Being a really big player in games of different genres , my heart will always belongs to this game. STILL NOT BITTEN. It’s better than the show would you believe it ! Great touching story and unforgettable moments, the characters and choices options are great, the ending tho made this game way better and surley most famous, a 8.5/10 highly recommended. One of the better games in this genre. I was very engaged to the story the entire time due to all the difficult choices and sacrifices.. The drama is never overdone and that is the one thing I absolutely adore! It never goaded an emotion out of me unnaturally. The pace of the story never lags, the main characters feel well rounded. The voice acting has been deftly handled, EVEN for the secondary characters. For me, it's some of these small details that make it more than just a mere game. Hands down, 2 of the most endearing characters I've encountered in a gaming format ever. And I ain't going to lie, 2/4 seasons can be strong tear jerkers and I mean you could hold back the emotions but the moment the credits roll, damn... I couldn't dare to mention which, for I might spoil it for the ones who enjoy this particular format of gaming. Well worth the hours spent.. Best ever Story game with unexpected twists and turns which takes us into the character .. An excellent game with a fantastic story! Very deep characters, which makes us have a special affection for them. This game has a incredible story. I am talking about just season 1 because ı didn't play the other seasons. This game is like interactive movies. I like the gameplay and ı love the graphics. The graphics looks like comic book and ı love it.. Best game I've played. I usually play competitive FPS games but I like this game were you have to make interesting decisions and with a very good story. If you want a game like Fallout or Skyrim with less looting and more story, this is the best.. Summary: Powerful story, amazing game, will be remembered by many players.. the masterpiece. after this game you can have depression, be careful. Also your heart will cry after ending(. Supposedly my assessment does not reflect the state of the games, because a lot of people (like me) complain about poor graphics, little progress with newer parts and old mechanics, but these are typical elements of almost every game, and TWD from Telltale is, as everyone knows, a ""series "" with elements of choices and Quick Time Events, so the story is the most important thing here, and it is wonderfully written and with each part I was looking forward to what would happen next. It's the same with Season 4 because I hope Telltale will bounce back and bring us some new Clementine or AJ adventures.. a horrible game for earlier times pros none cons horrible zombies horrible people [no offense] horrible graphics too gruesome horrible plot terrible writing toxic fanboy-ism. Absolutely the best possible game I've ever played in my entire life. The game has such a smooth experien","this is a game that lies to you constantly, trying to give you the illusion that your choices are influencing the plot . this is one of the best story games ever and one of the best zombie games ever its the walking dead . this game really impressed me deeply ."

39.The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition,"This collection is good, no doubt about it. But I’m not sure anyone really wants to play all of these games, especially the earliest Zelda’s. So that leaves you with just two playable games. And to be honest Ocarina is the only one of the two you need to play because the Majora doesn’t offer you anything more, Ocarina is the best.. so no point in buying this, just buy a quality copy of Ocarina.. It's just rereleased Zelda. I prefer playing games on their original consoles.. I cannot believe this collection happened. Would be unheard of in today’s world. Great value.. Because it is a collection of past games and not another mainline title i have not much to say, just all the games here are amazing (except adventures of link). Anyways two of the best zelda games and of course the original, if you think it is amazing cause in gamecube era there was no virtual console or online so there was no way to play past games and thus the CE is brilliant. Best collection of games ever. This was many kid's introduction to classic zelda games, as well as the 2 N64 epic masterpieces!. One of the best game collections in history was just missing A Link The Past but it's still great. The Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2 Adventure of link, Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are the games that this collection holds. Excellent. It is a nice way to play four different Zelda games in the gamecube, ocarina of time, Majora´s mask, and the first two zelda games for the NES.. I had to have this was sad when it got too scratched and couldn't play anymore. Better for n64. this game offers some of the greatest games of all time the n64 games run great and the nes version runs just like the original amazing. This package offers you almost all of The Legend of Zelda games ever released. Have no words. It has 4 Zelda games in one disc. Totally worth it. Highly recommended.. Still one of the best game collections ever. I was fully introduced to the Zelda series with this, and at the time, this was the ultimate way to experience those classic games, with the solid presentation, timeless gameplay, pretty good emulation, and neat extras. Of course, now you can play all of them on the go with the 3DS, but having them in one disc (that came with the system!) is a real treat. Still highly recommended for any enthusiast of Zelda or good games in general.. Not a definitive collection and the older games haven't aged well BUT there's enough quality here to make this a great purchase. If you can find it!!!. A great collection with 4 classics. The best buy for the GameCube. The legend of Zelda: a true classic and still fun to play today! Only for die-hards though, as it is not easy. 8.5/10 Zelda II: the Adventures of Link. A different approach to the franchise as it's a sidescroller that feels like Castlevania or Metroid. It hasn't aged as well as the first but for the time it was a great adventure! 7.5/10 Ocarina of Time. 10/10 best game ever for a reason. Majora's Mask. 10/10 my favourite game of all time. If you really dig for it you will find all kinds of hidden themes to a depth I've never experienced in a game. Myamoto's hidden masterpiece.. Face it, if you don't like this collection you just aren't a Zelda fan. This is one of the best ports I've ever played, feeling just as fluid as they did at first. This allowed me to play three Zelda games I couldn't have experienced otherwise, including my all time favorite, with the same music, nostalgic graphics, and adventure of any Zelda game. I'd rather ignore the Wind Waker demo and the other extras and just play the four games we've been offered: The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Ocarina of Time, and Majora's Mask. If you're a Zelda fan and haven't experienced these games(or only experienced their poorly ported controls on Virtual Console) then I give this my highest recommendations.. three of my favorite zelda games on one disk? zelda 1, 2, ocarina of time!?!!! ohh yes!! You can't go wrong with classics! you know you want it, must buy for gamecube owners!. This game offers you almost the whole Zelda experience in one game. Each game responds exactly like they do from other consoles. If you ever find this collection anywhere, get it! You won't be dissappointed!. Without a doubt this is the best idea that Nintendo had created during the time the console was active, having the best collection of a legendary series is not worth it, in fact much MORE worth it in all levels, so if in any case you see this collection lost in the video games stores , do not even think in letting this alone, this is a MOST own collection, that has to be in your library.. Easy 10, never played the Zelda's before and got this from a friend. Playing through all them now on my Gamecube and it's sweet; if you see it anywhere, BUY IT.. Two amazing N64 games plus two good NES games, all on one disc? Count me in! The only thing that could have possibly made this better would be the inclusion of A Link To The Past, which is a strange omission here.","'ocarina' is the only one of the two you need to play because the Majora doesn’t offer you anything more, 'ocarina is the best' 'i cannot believe this collection happened. Would be unheard of in today’s world.'"
390.Monster Hunter: World - Iceborne,"Almost perfect extension to the incredible base game, introducing higher difficulty. Only flaw is the endgame grinding for upgrades and ranks otherwise would be a 10. Several free additions of monsters like Fatalis and Alatreon makes it an amazing extension. The upgrade from the based game is unreal. The end game system is grindy but not boring.. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne - An Essential ExpansionMonster Hunter World: Iceborne, the expansive DLC for the critically acclaimed Monster Hunter: World, delivers an exhilarating continuation of the Hunter's journey into uncharted territories. Developed and published by Capcom, Iceborne expands upon the original game with new monsters, enhanced gameplay mechanics, and an intriguing story set in the chilling Hoarfrost **** Iceborne, players resume the role of a skilled Hunter, tasked with confronting formidable monsters both solo and in cooperative multiplayer hunts. The introduction of Hoarfrost Reach, a vast arctic ecosystem, adds a refreshing layer of challenge and immersion. As players progress through the story, they unlock more areas within Hoarfrost Reach, each brimming with unique environmental hazards and **** standout feature is the attention to detail in simulating the harsh cold of Hoarfrost Reach. Players must manage their stamina by consuming hot drinks or seeking warmth in hot springs, adding a strategic element to exploration and combat. The addition of Raider Rides, a fast travel system utilizing tamed creatures, streamlines traversal across this expansive landscape.Iceborne introduces innovative combat mechanics such as the Clutch Claw and Flinch Shot, enhancing the Hunter's arsenal and providing new strategies for engaging monsters. All weapon types benefit from expanded upgrade paths and additional combat moves, enriching gameplay diversity and **** expansion also introduces Master Rank, a new tier of challenges that push experienced players to their limits. Master Rank quests feature tougher enemies and offer rewarding new armor sets, encouraging continued progression and **** narrative in Iceborne is more compelling and believable compared to the base game. The discovery of a mysterious song and the emergence of a powerful Elder Dragon, Velkhana, drive the Hunter to confront imminent ecological threats. The story unfolds through captivating encounters and leads to climactic battles against iconic monsters like Shara Ishvalda and Fatalis.While Iceborne received widespread acclaim for its content and gameplay enhancements, some aspects like the Guiding Lands may not resonate with all players. The concept of an amalgamated habitat is ambitious but may feel disjointed compared to the cohesive environments of other **** conclusion, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne is a must-have expansion that enriches the Monster Hunter experience. With its captivating narrative, challenging gameplay, and extensive content, Iceborne exemplifies Capcom's commitment to delivering exceptional post-launch support. Whether you're a seasoned Hunter or new to the series, Iceborne offers an expansive adventure that's well worth the investment.Iceborne stands as a testament to the ongoing success and evolution of Monster Hunter: World, setting a high standard for future expansions and reaffirming the franchise's place among the best in the action role-playing genre.. Let me start off by saying that Monster Hunter World: Iceborne has been one of the biggest influences on my taste in games ever since I had discovered it in late 2019. It takes brave leaps in trying to steer the series in a new direction to widen its reach on audiences and has far exceeded everyone's expectations. Every weapon polished and perfected with the patented Monster sheen allows it to coalesce beautifully with the masterfully crafted environments teeming with various and vibrant endemic species, and that is not even mentioning the wonderful roster of monsters it has in it's lineup. One can argue the most important part of a ""Monster Hunter"" game are the monsters themselves and Monster Hunter World brings new depth to new and old monsters from the series. The monsters truly feel alive , as if you're observing and hunting actual creatures to do the wonderfully designed monster ai meshing perfectly with the aforementioned environment , coexisting to create an idealistic paradise for any aspiring or veteran hunter. Progression in the game is very well paced offering the player something new at every turn so you're never left feeling bored or unrewarded for your efforts when hunting a Monster once or even multiple times. Aside from the main hunts there are fun side activities one can partake in if you ever feel the need to take a break from the action packed hunts. Some of my favourite are being able to customise your room and truly make it your own by filling it with various ornaments and adorable pets which brings me into another side activity. While out on the field you'll notice you can capture certain animals to become pets in your room which is a perfect way to introduce the player to truly explore every nook and cranny of the map to see what hidden resources or secrets await your discovery. A lot of what you discover will ultimately serve one purpose, to help you become a stronger hunter. The game is cleverly designed in such a way that as your in game great improves over the course of your journey so do your skills at a relatively similar rate meaning you'll never feel overwhelmed or underpowered at any point during the game's course. The multiplayer can be integral to your experience if you are the type of player who seeks that sort of thing and I am happy to confirm that multiplayer integration has been delightful, whether it be with random online players or your own close friends you'll never seen to find yourself lonely. It is for all the points I've stated above that I will highly recommend looking further into the world of Monster Hunter and I hope that anyone who has read this will have seriously considered picking up this absolute gem **** as their next big adventure, and I hope to see you in the new world because I can assure you that you can never go wrong if you decide to play the game. Happy hunting!. Iceborne is without a doubt an absolutely outstanding video game. With gaming as a subscription, freemium gaming, and battlepasses saturating the online video game market it’s often hard to come by a game with a company that actually cares about players. Frankly, I thought such a thing might be impossible until I started playing Iceborne. Capcom, throughout Iceborne’s active life, constantly released content for this amazing game. Any avid player knows this, but even further we saw every limited time quest become available both during the pandemic to help support staying inside as well as after the game’s development stopped. From there things only get better. Even though Iceborne’s development has been stopped for years just a few days ago we saw an update released for the game. Why? To make it accessible to steam deck players. Honestly, if that doesn’t scream the greatest game ever made I’d have to assume you’re just deaf.Iceborne doesn’t just offer Capcom’s undying support, it also has virtually endless hours of content. With more than 70 large monsters and 14 different weapons you have what is nearly 1,000 different fights to learn, study, and master. You can easily put hours into any one of these fights, and that completely ignores amazingly designed events fights. More often than not “difficult” games end up feeling like developers seeing just how much **** they can throw at a wall until players simply cannot beat whatever has been thrown at them. Iceborne does nothing of the sort. Both Fatalis and Arch-tempered Velkhana are amazing examples of this. In both of those fights, if you are skilled enough to see it, you will always find your mistake. In my now 1000 hours on Monster Hunter World (as of starting this review I was completing my 999th hour) I have never once found myself frustrated with the game, only myself. Iceborne creates an environment for improvement like nothing else. At least nothing else with dope ass dinosaurs.Though it pains me to do so, my integrity as a writer requires me to present at least one counterpoint for why someone might genuinely dislike Iceborne: The Skill Curve. If you aren’t ready, and you are built for it, Iceborn can beat you down like someone beating a dead horse about how great the game is. Many times have I tried to get my friends who are less attached to the game to play it with me and many times have I failed. Between the skill required to use any one of the weapons, manage when and how you dodge attacks, or simply even just where to get useful items Iceborn does not provide ample support. But I do not believe that makes it a bad game.Just because the player is bad, the game does not instantly become bad for catering to them. Some of the greatest pieces of literature cannot be appreciated by someone with a fifth grade reading capacity and that doesn’t instantly characterize them as low quality. To somehow determine Iceborn as bad based on a lack of skill alone is simply rude. Iceborne is a great game, and if you aren’t great enough to see that, then don’t play Iceborne.. That DLC is so enjoyable like playing a new MH game, everything is detailed the story is petty good it catch me in a few hours the fights are pretty tough but fun, I hope playing soon a MHW 2. 1 new world and 1 new copy paste world. No new weapons same boring machanics. Bosses have so much health you will get bored to death. PERFECT expantion, it fixed every gripe i had with MHW, and bumped it up from a 7 to a 10 for me. 1000 hours of gameplay is enough for my cave-man monster hunting brain to say: ""game good, me like"".. Just awful. Monsters have way too much HP and it’s after the main story. It takes 40 minutes to kill one. You could get better armor and weapons to kill them faster, but guess what - they are locked behind even more pointless grinding. And it’s not resource grinding, it’s master rank grinding. You need to reach a specific MR to unlock specific monsters for further upgrade. And it’s all wrapped it the worst character control that I’ve seen in AAA game ever.. I came to this game from Monster Hunter: Rise, and to be frank I really wish I hadn't. The pacing of this game just wasn't what I was looking for, I fully understand the appeal of the slow combat and taking time to prepare for each hunt, but the game itself just felt slow and tedious in all the ways I appreciated the least. I loved MHR for the thrilling, fast paced combat, and how smoothly each hunt ends up playing out, but MHW:I felt as though each hunt went for a little too long, and there were a lot more quests that seemed to be intended as time sinks rather than meaningful gameplay.. It improves on the base game in almost every way, from new weapon combos, to new builds, events, quests and so on. It only misses the 10/10 mark like the original game for its introduction of the Clutch Claw, which has two undesired effects: - If you're playing solo (it wasn't my case), you will have to dedicate a lot of time to using it efficiently every single fight, and it can make the gameplay repetitive, boring and anticlimatic - If you don't use it, you will directly be missing out on mechanics, damage and opportunities, making it feel like an obligatory tool to use. Besides that, it is still definitely worth a buy, and at the very worst, you can ignore the clutch claw like I did until halfway through Iceborne.. Monster Hunter: Iceborne is not a perfect expansion but is still a ton of fun and a fantastic experience. I would recommend Monster Hunter: Iceborne.. i have 1500 hours in Monster Hunter World Iceborne absolute masterpiece Capcom has done great service to the fans with tons of free content the expansion iceborne is so big i think it's even bigger or similar length like blood and wine in The Witcher 3 which was already a + 20 + 30 hours full game Iceborne is not a DLC it's not an expansion it's a full game just like The Witcher 3 Blood And Wine. My original review was critical of the DLC on release because of the copy n' paste with most the monsters, but with all the free updates and additional monsters; This has been some of the best Monster Hunter content we've ever gotten. Some of the toughest and fun fights I've ever experienced was in this DLC and it was an amazing experience.. with more than 500 hours playing the game, worth every single penny, the best game as a service of all time. It improves upon the base game in every way. No longer is endgame gear like health regen prone to sheer randomness, now you can focus on exactly what you want. While it does take a very long time to get, at least it's not repeating the same fight(s) hundreds of times praying for a hero streamstone for your weapon to drop. Also Fatalis. Fighting Fatalis, triggering the Dragonator at 3/4 of it's HP, then hearing the Monster Hunter World theme play throughout the rest of the fight, as you and 3 other players try to take it down, is one of the most epic gaming experiences known to man.. Iceborne manages to take the QoL changes that World made to the series, and render them completely moot. Combine that with a lack of a compelling story, poorly programmed monsters, mechanics that do not work and terrible balancing issues, and you're left with an expansion that's best left unplayed.. Belive me its not just and expansion pack pack! Iceborne includes so much contents even more than many full games with 60 dollars tag! This is a respectful way to treat your costumers and also your beloved game. A fantastic expansion (you consider it as a full game!) for a fantastic game.. One of my favourite games ever. 890 hours in and still love it. Endless replay ability and is an expansion done right. Constant free content and patches. Absolutely love it. Literally the best game I've played in my entire life, 1000+ hours and I'm still not even getting tired of it, amazing graphics and gameplay just out of this world.. I ended up putting more hours into this expansion than into the main game. probably one of the best expansions ever made.. This could easily be the sequel instead of just an expansion, definitely makes the experience of Monster Hunter World as a hole even better and especially for me as a trophy hunter the fact that has its own Platinum trophy makes it even more awesome, still getting free title updates the game likely will last much more.. No plot and no characters with traits or progression. Only monster grinding with gear progression system. Pretty bland.. I loved MHW before and now I love Iceborne. I can't count all the amazing feelings and moments I had with this game and its expension. You really can see all the love and detail that the developer have spend at this game. I can understand why people are angry about that game I can see the problems but MHW I is more than that. It is a masterpiece and it's worth the price. Slaying giant monsters was never so much fun with this many different weapons and combat moves.... Bigger than original game. More than this. Excellent this. Stylish and beauty. Best game for me, after 1200+ i'm love this game bigger and strongly. Capcom - respect!. The very best DLC ever made. Over 800 hours played. So much extra content that this expansion feels like it's own full game. Best game ever made.. this is how you do expansion! other devs need to take notice. totally worth it. no **** it's extend the game to feels like a complete sequel. daemn! worth every penny. This expansion to Monster Hunter: World is probably one of the best expansion in gaming history. This expansion adds so much to the base game! This expansion can be considered as a sequel/entirely new game rather than an expansion. Everything this expansion adds to the game is a positive thing in my opinion, I see no negative side to this expansion. It adds in new combo to each weapon set, a new story, a new variety of armour set (most of the armour set looks AMAZING!), and of course MORE MONSTERS! I hope they continue to support this game. The only downside to the game is the matchmaking (SOS) which isn't so great but besides that, everything else is great.. Absolute trash as expected, nothing more then a total reskin of the vanilla game, fits in perfectly with the greed trash of today’s gaming that goes hand in hand with the single digit iq gamers.. Incredible dlc. A lot of the problems of the base game are now solved. The added content is enormous. My only problem is the event formula and the lack of variety in the end-game meta (optimal equipment). This game is great! Unfortunately, the load times on PS4, and the time it takes to get things done in general, keep this from being a 10/10. It's amazing, but it's not my favorite game.. After having spent over 500 hours on the base game, I was super excited to play Iceborne. I certainly wasn't disappointed: the expansion has so much new stuff to do, it's almost like you get a MHW 2! There's a lot of brand new monsters, a story that's about as long as the original one, and with the new hunter rank, you get to kill even all the old monsters again in a stronger version. Definitely worth the money - this is how all expansions should be.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An expansion that makes even the base game look small, plenty of old and new monsters to hunt. The added difficulty being a nice bonus for the hardcore fans with storytelling having improved too.. Iceborne is the expansion for MHW with the introduction of master rank. It is also the tradition of MH series, which is called ""G"" before. As a player who has played through almost all MH series, I think Capcom has tried their best to make things right in MHWI. Many classic monsters were remade by HD models with much more abundant details and new movements. The production and upgrade of new equitments are always additive. The introduction of claw is also interesting more or less. Many new methods to deal with monsters' movements have been created. The gameplay before clear is absolutely fascinating. However, the design of later game period is terrible. Guiding land was absolutely **** I can't understand why it could get through as the main gameplay content after game clear, especially on the basis of their interesting, additive ultimate quests in MH4U and MHGU. In former MH with G expansion, the later gameplay experience is full of challenges of course, but the designs of monsters allowed players to face the challenges. But in MHWI, what I saw was only the repeating experience repeated over and over again. It is still a good expansion for MH of a new age, but regretfully far from great.. At first you may think this is a expansion just one or two new things but this is a Brand New game added to the base game and it's awesome. If you loved World, you are going to love this. Plenty more monsters, plenty more weapons and armour sets to craft. Guiding Lands is fun and you can spend hours in there just wanting to hunt one more monster. The only drawback I’ve found is jumping into guiding lands with randoms or firing an sos from guiding lands doesn’t always work out. Lots of times I’ve jumped into a guiding lands and the session dies immediately or after a single monster hunt. Likewise, I’ve had people join and it not been the monster they want so leave the session. This issue can be solved by playing with friends or lfg. The graphics, great, monsters are really fun and challenging, the story is ok but nothing special, that’s not what I play this for though. The grinding, crafting and build diversity is what makes this game so satisfying and there is tons of it. I’ve hit master rank 130 and I’m yet to augment my weapons. That’s how much playtime this thing has before you can get a fully optimal build. Want to do this with every weapon? You’re looking at hundreds of hours. You really get your money’s worth. There are no loot boxes, and devs constantly add new content for free. A true masterpiece ****, for what it sets out to do, it nails.. The end content design is a mess. The various purposes of the party members have allowed them to separate and die in a reduced zombie rush game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Overpriced and overated. Sure its a decent game as mhw but cmon... $40? To much recycled content and make things harder by adding tons of hp on monster and insta kill attacks.. not fun at all. IF foi really want to play wait for a price drop and better online gameplay.. Wow. While I am not the biggest fan of the Monster Hunter Franchise, this expansion is pretty **** lit. Just get it. Nothing else has to be said!. The monster hunter is a fun game at it's core, but there are just so many bad features that just add up to me being more frustrated with the game rather than enjoying it. I'm afraid there is no going back for me after games like dark souls, sekiro, bloodborne. The hitboxes in Monster Hunter are a last century, who hasn't been hit by Diablo's or Nergigante's shoulder slam while standing on the other side of the monster? Or by random charge attack while standing behind one? Or have their charge blade clip right through the monster's tail without doing any damage at all? The typical fight is supposed to follow a routine more or less, where you fight the monster normally, monster eventually enrages, monster eventually tires out allowing you to deal a fair bit of damage. What really happens more often than not is monster just flees to another area right after the enrage is over, making you chase it through the map. Or some other monster drops in for a turf war making youi watch from sidelines, fun the first time, annoying when it happens for a 100th time. These are not the only examples of this, but basically the feeling that I generally get is that of being cheated. I've played through vanilla MH, it was OK. But I've made a mistake of buying the icebourne, you know how all the people rave about G-rank this G-rank that, and how the master rank (HM equivalent of G-Rank) is where the game is going to be at. Well it is not, it's just more of the same crap, except now it takes 3 times as long to kill everything. The expansion is overpriced, at 40€ it adds just a single new biome for a total of 6 (and a 2nd one, which is kind of a mix out of all existing biomes) and a couple of new monsters + reskins of the previous ones. Is it harder than the original, well technically no, but simply by virtue of taking three times as long people are bound to make a couple more mistakes during the fight.. They really screwed MHW with this update. Half of the monsters in this DLC have unblockable and unavoidable instant kills because Capcom forgot what good game design is. This this DLC is trash and not worth the 40 bucks Capcom is asking for. If they do another DLC like this I hope they actually put some f**king effort into it. Also would be nice if the servers could stay online for more than 12 hours at a time.. Frankly speaking, none of any PS4 games are able to play up to thousand hours except MHW and now even has Iceborne DLC. More new weapons and armors with some new skills and the new way to hunt monsters.. Iceborne is a massive expansion that introduces new monsters, gameplay mechanics, weapon balancing, skill adjustments. Won’t be surprised to see this game as Game of the Year contender again. Love the Monster Hunter series and this one is no different. The only reason I dont give this a 10 is because older monster hunters had better balanced weapon and armor trees. Also better looking. Capcom, let MH be what it is and it will never steer you wrong. Sure, I'm probably biased... heck, I've spent over 800 hours on the base game before the expansion even came. But let me tell you, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne is one of the best expansions we have seen in years. Not only for the sheer volume of content added, not only for its customer friendly approach, but for the level of polish and inovation that was brought into this already massive game. Clutch claw takes a little bit of getting used to but when you figure it out, it provides some of the most satisfying moments during the fights. Armors look better than they did in the base game and everything is simply bigger, better, more polished. This is the ultimate version of MHW and I bet it will be played and loved and enjoyed for many years to come. If you're a fan of previous entries, do not hesitate, this is clearly a 10/10 experience. If you're not particularly fond of the game loop these kinds of games offer, this is still the best one out there and if you ever feel like trying, you should give this one a go :). Amazing expansion to a amsxing game, this dlc is like the old ones of yesteryear its almost big enough to be a standalone game. Inly complaint is skinds for gear seam lazy i wish they enabled transmogs.. Such a great game, no mistake accept for joining each orther we need to watch cinematic first 9.5 /10. Best game ever, expansion feels like a new game. Recommended buy for everyone.. This feels more like a sequel rather than an expansion. 30+ new monsters. Maybe 60 new set variants (haven’t confirmed that) but sure feels like that amount, gameplay tweaks and much. This is one of the best dlcs I’ve ever played. Witcher 3 quality, without a doubt.. Amazing if you loved the first game or have always loved monster Hunter then this is the best its ever been.. I've been a fan of this game and Monster Hunter World was my first entry into the series, everything about this game felt right and was expecting the same but whilst it's more or less on par and it delivers, it does however the menus can feel quite bloated with the sheer amount of options, and some fights can take a long while to clear if you're not prepared to geared.. Everything you might want as a fan of the base game. Tons of new content (with more on the way in the upcoming months!). Also - it seems to run noticeably better now (at least on PS Pro). The only negative I can think of - not a lot of unique weapon designs unfortunately. Still, an easy 10.. New stunning monsters. BIG really BIG Expansion not a normal dlc. Love the story, the music, the fighting system!. Out of all of the game expansions and dlcs I have played, this is by far the best one. Most game expansions add content that is only as much as a 1/2 or a 1/4 of the current game. Iceborne has so much content worth playing in it that this could be the only game that you would have to play all year. Tons of content, with over 20+ new and unique boss fights with their own cool armor, and improved + fun game play all combine to make a great experience. Although if you are a person who is interested in story telling, this game isn't for you. But that's not what games are, games are meant to be fun. And this game is a real ball of a time. It demolishes every known dlcs' content from ever other game to exist in the past decade or two.. Iceborne is a phenomenal expansion that adds a massive amount of content with the addition of master rank, and adds itself onto the base game content in a fluid and fantastic way. This is definitely a must play for all MHW fans, new and old, and those who are looking for the added challenge of master rank! Highly recommended. I was in love with MHW, played it around 400h, got the platy and finally put the game down. Then this gem released. This expansion is something beautiful to me. It adds a new rank with which you basically have a reason to fight all the previous monsters. It adds new monsters, a new area, moves, weappons, armor etc. I cant write down all the good stuff because it would make this too long to read. Just buy this expansion if you already have world. If not then first buy world and beat it. Thank you MHW Iceborne developers for making this masterpiece.. This is DLC is almost as big to be called a game on its own. Best DLC ever!. The game is actually pretty good. New monsters (and reaccuring old ones) are amazing fights, a new snow area to fight in with nice little details (like snow on armor when you're submerged in it), and the new gathering hub looks amazing. Tho I cant help but feel a little cheated by both the lack on effort in most of the weapon design and the fact that the 'legacy monsters' have the Low Rank look for the older games.. Despite it's flaws here and there... Monster Hunter World Iceborne is the best version of monster we have ever received.. An amazing “addition“ to an already excellent game. This is one of the largest, content heavy expansions you will play and more than justifies it's price. This is the equivalent of the ultimate versions that previous monster hunter entries have done. My one and only gripe is that some of the weapon skins are just not up to par, disappointing because the rest of the game is outstanding. 910 due to that fact. Keep it coming Capcom.. Iceborn have a bug and I cant play but i play on other PS4 mas I love , Is funny. Perhaps the best expansion of all time, essentially doubling the amount of content in the game, including new monsters, areas, mechanics, weapons, armour and more! Most of the new monsters are great, the new area is expansive and gorgeous to look at, and the new base area makes using all of the facilities such as the smithy and canteen a lot faster and practical. The clutch claw is a mostly good addition that makes slinger ammo something you will actually bother to pick up although it doesn't mesh well with certain weapons playstyles. The one big downside is again the weapons however, as like in the base game some weapons are stunning whilst others are simply the basic bone/iron weapons with some tufts of fur or monster skin stuck onto them. However, due to the sheer amount of content, value and fun packed into this dlc and the long awaited difficulty boost for veteran players, this is one of the best dlc's released in the past decade and is definitely worth every penny for players who can't get enough of monster hunter world, particularly those who have exhausted the base game and are looking for a new, fresh and more difficult experience. This is literally the best expansion to a game I've ever played! Intense hard fought battles against some of the best monsters in the franchise!!! This is an easy 10/10. I was waiting to play the game ever since it was announced and as the release day came closer. Capcom kept revealing more and more monsters and i was mind blown! This is how you make a game, this is how to treat DLC. I was so happy and bought a physical copy and gave my friend my old MHW so that he will get into this awesome game with me. The story is alright. But i think it is better than the vanilla game. The Grind is awesome and addictive and wanted to keep me playing for more. I haven't finished the game yet but i can say i will be worth it. The new regions are amazing, New Monsters put up a great challenge. New weapons and Armor is so badass!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing expansion! It adds everything the game needed, now it is a complete and proper MH experience. This is one of the best if not the best MH games, don't be deceived by people who are salty that it is not on a certain system ;). we love you capcom! please keep making these incredible games! keep going!!. Doesn't reinvent the wheel BUT -- it makes the wheel better, adds another 25-30 wheels, doesn't rip you off (charges a fair price for the wheel) -- and is a pure delight to play. Anyone who loved the original MHW will love Iceborne. Easily 50-100 hours of quality content if not multiples of that depending on how deep into ""endgame"" you want to go. It's clear that the devs/publisher love the IP and respect their player base.. What the hell else do you want from a DLC? This is DLC is almost as big to be cal","Several free additions of monsters like Fatalis and Alatreon makes it an amazing extension . the upgrade from the based game is unreal . the introduction of Hoarfrost Reach, a vast arctic ecosystem, adds a refreshing layer of challenge ."
391.Dead Cells,"A unique masterpiece roguelike. You can feel the quality at every section of the game. A very strange combination of roguelike and metroivania but a very fun game whis a lot of refences to other games the character is hylarious. Very punishing but equally rewarding and enjoyable roguelite which does an excellent job at staying interesting throughout every run. DLCs aren't needed to enjoy the game, but they add lots of new and unique content whilst staying cheap. Soundtrack is incredible, Movement and fighting feels great, and meta progression succeeds in making noticeable differences whilst still keeping the game challenging. Overall great game, a must buy for any fans of the genre.. If you like dying after wasting 30 minutes to an hour of your time trying to get through difficult and frustrating levels of gameplay and losing all of your progress only to start right back at the very beginning of the game doing the same stuff over again only for it to happen again over and over and over and over and over again, then this game might be for you! I, personally, hate this game, and have no idea why some people hold it in such high regard. Maybe if you're a masochist or something. It does have some fluid movement and animation, so I'll give it that, but otherwise... I made a huge mistake purchasing this game. I wish people would understand that games, or for that matter ANYTHING, in general do NOT have to be super difficult to be satisfying and/or rewarding. Think of all of the things you enjoy, and I'm certain that some of those things aren't challenging AT ALL. Yet somehow there's this belief (myth) among some game developers and their fans that a game HAS TO BE super difficult in order for players to enjoy it. If that were the case, explain the popularity of Pokemon, or the numerous card games out there, or turn based RPGs and strategy games. How about roller coasters, or skydiving? Are these super challenging things? Because a whole lot of people enjoy these things. How about maybe making a game that's FUN, and not super frustrating? Shouldn't that be the focus of game developers? It doesn't seem to be the focus of this game at all.. One of the most soft yet upbeat soundtracks I have ever heard for a 2-D platformer but that’s where the charm ends. The gameplay quickly becomes frenetic, landing quick blows, running out of the enemy’s range then repeating the process.. the best metroid-vania I have played, I loved the difficulty and its playability. Season 1. the hammer is the best weapon. the hammer is the best weapon the hammer is the best weapon.. A bit linear over time (no DLC). Fortunately, the difficulty mode scales at an appropriate rate to be constantly demanding but beatable.. Dead Cells is a very good game, its graphics, gameplay, weapons, skins, etc. They are practically perfect, they deserve a 10/10.. one of my most played games on steam, of which I have yet to see the actual ending.just so good with so many weapons, bosses and enemies, giving it an 8 only because the roguelike/roguelite genre still doesn't fit my taste that much.. It's a great game with awesome movement that feels very free. There is so much to do and a lot of customization so that anyone can have fun at their level.. Not a fan of rougelite/like but this one is pretty fun, the fast combat is awesome made me play it for 20 something hours but I gave up on beating the game since it got really boring for me not because it became bad but rougelike just not my kinda game.. Just best 5bc for the first time. This game is an absolute blast. Very good lore, soundtracks that fit the scenes very well and the gameplay is highly engaging. I’ve personally never felt so happy beating a game and I highly recommend those who haven’t played and looking for a challenge to give it a go.. This is a solid roguelike. It is very satisfying to make builds, but i haven't gotten to a game breaking point yet. the bosses are okay, but leave much to be desired. they clearly put a lot of effort into it, 8/10. Truely one of those rare games, where you can see the passion the devs had for it. Gameplay is amazing and wow, that Soundtrack has the be one of the best in the whole gaming world.. After the early game buzz wears off and the game becomes an interminable grind, it was obvious to me that most people who reviewed it didn't take the time to get into the mid-game. The loot system, which is the heart of a roguelike, is rubbish. Most of the weapons are terrible and if you don't luck into one of the very few overpowered ones, like the lightning whip, you have no chance of a deep run. Boring, poorly designed game.. Dead Cells is simply an exceptional video game that is so much fun to play… it helps the player forget about the 100 previous attempts of being battered and beaten by the randomly generated hoards of monsters and deathtraps. Never have I played a game with such tight controls and gameplay (even for the Nintendo Switch!) And with tons of accessibility settings to make the difficulty more palatable, I can safely recommend this title for everyone.. Best roguelike I’ve ever played. Challenging and fast paced. Procedural maps do the job with keeping the player playing over and over again. Really addicting. A game thats type is Rogue like and the game really shows rogue like's special features. You have a lot of choices, weapons and abilities for end game. You want to try again with other option to finish game and you never get bored. The game is getting harder when you finish game and take the soul. For example, you can fill your health flask at first but you can't do it when difficult is getting harder. Even though I have played over 120 hours, I do not unlock many things. In conclusion the game has very enjoyble game content and you can spend a lot of time with the game. It’s just amazing. It’s replayable and the gameplay is amazing. The art style is stunning.. An incredible rogue-like dungeon crawler with creative weapons and decent difficulty.. No exhilarating action, the map is difficult to understand and monotonous. Terrible system that returns you to the beginning when you die.. Probably the most satisfying metroidvania like game I've ever experienced. I often find many rouge-likes to feel grindy after a while but this is one of the few that I could not stop playing, a rarity for me and this genre. The art, the music, the combat are just incredible.. Dead Cells is fun. I don't particularly think it's anything miraculous, but it doesn't need to be. The core gameplay and progression is enjoyable, and the game looks lovely. Perhaps I simply played it for long enough that it started to grow somewhat mundane, but it's worth a good playthrough if you're interested in a decent platforming roguelite.. Quite frankly one of the best games I have ever played. And I was skeptical, because I don't usually commit to single player games, let alone indie games with indie-style graphics. Add to that that I used to hate roguelikes with a passion. Then I saw my friend play this. And then I tried it. This was almost a year ago and here I am, still raving on about how great Dead Cells is. Insanely smooth combat and movement, satisfying gameplay, rewarding skill without at any point being frustrating, and also adding a bunch of options to help out those who aren't too nimble with games too. Absolutely awesome. And now I can't stop playing roguelikes, all thanks to Dead Cells. The people who made this game are legends. Thank you.. Simply the best Rougelite i have played so far. Great Game Play. Different Seeds. And high difficult. Played over 300 hours.. Good presentation, controls and visuals. Decent game but not as good as Hades.. this game is so bad. the gameplay looks very cheap and lazy. you can have fun with this one. this game is so annoying. the game is very empty with a big lack of content. One of the best rogue-likes out there. Lots of areas to choose from so every run is different, great progression and gameplay. Better than Hades and WAYYY better than Returnal.. An incredibly addictive actioner with satisfying graphics, music, characters. Even a bit of dark humour. Sadly, the game is let down by its repetitive design – you have to beat the entire thing without dying six times with nearly impossible difficulty to reach the true ending. And the revelation of the protagonist’s true identity made me retroactively dislike my experience playing the game.. By far one of the best roguelike games. The combat is perfect with incredibly smooth gameplay, and tons of variety in weapons, items, builds. The music is amazing as well. Also, even though the lore isn't the main point, I have to say it's actually interesting. Absolutely must play.. this game is so empty with no good options. the lack of content is HUGE here. Quite simply one of the best Switch games ever made. The port is ALMOST flawless. There are two issues i would like to address: Long loading times between levels and hickups during gameplay when the game streams level data. Luckily the hickups has become less of an issue with the continued updates, but it still makes me crazy once in a while. Addictive gameplay for sure, but the difficulty curve is just too much for casual gamers. Don’t expect to venture too far in the game for your first 100 or so runs.. Very fluid movement. The combat feels precise and accurate. The gameplay is hard, but feels mostly fair. The bosses are exciting and varied. Most of the areas are fun and novel, with at least one being extremely frustrating. When you die though, there is just enough progression that keeps you coming back to do better and better the next round.. Get it if you are up for a big big challenge. I kept dying, got frustrated sometimes but I kept coming back to it and will probably do from time to time! The game does a good job of unlocking things as you play, to keep some sense of progress. It also shakes things up a bit by programmatically auto generate each level. Definitely a game one can spend countless hours with. Everyone hating on this game for the difficulty never played ghosts and goblins resurrection which costs 30$! Go play that game then come back to this one. This game is easy mode compared to that crap. Love this game a lot but i gave it 9 instead of 10 because back then without the dlc, it got stale after the first 150 hours, put well into 200 hours on the xbox one version. Considering buying this one with all its dlc soon for the switch! Cant wait to jump back in. This game is made for ns! I love every visit in toilet with ns and this game. I never got bored of starting from the beginning as every time you feel closer to achieving final victory. Also notable to mention is technical achievement and art style. Pure fun this one, well done developers!. Almost perfect. My most played game. Slick controls, where you characters moves precisely as you wish which means any failure is yours alone, huge variety of weapons and pathways, incredibly satisfying combat, constant development - no run wasted - man, I just LOVE this game. I’ve only rated it 1 off 10 to give the devs something to strive for ;). Dead Cells must hate Hades because this would look like the perfect roguelike if it wasn't being compared to it.. ‘The Prisoner’ awakens in a long abandoned prison, and it is soon implied that he has been trying to make his escape for a long time… Dead Cells is rouge-lite action platformer that sees the player trying to complete a series of levels with death meaning a return to the start of the game, albeit with the ability to unlock new weapons and powers for subsequent attempts. The gameplay is fast paced and entertaining with a variety of different play styles available depending on the upgrades chosen, and the many different enemy types each require the player to learn how to best handle them. Much the like excellent ‘Hades’ its incredibly addictive as you challenge yourself to push on a little further each time, and when you do finally make it to the end (It took me 19 attempts), its a great feeling of accomplishment.. This game is difficult AF, at least to me. I'm not the most skillful gamer at all, and I've had a tough time even with Ori and the Blind Forest, but Dead Cells just feels grindy and mean to me. It's really stressful to run through its levels under the time limits to get the free cells, in order to then get the upgrades. The combat itself is fun and enjoyable, as is the movement and even the gloomy vibes; but the enemies can deal too much damage and then you die in an instant losing many cells. It doesn't help that the game doesn't have a story (at least as far as I have gone), unlike Hades, where dying is a necessary part to move the game forward and the blow of a cheap death is softened by new dialogue.. Dropped it after ~10 hours of play. The gameplay can be fun and fast-paced, like an old-school beat-em-up. But, the overall style / gameplay / story is too same-y from run to run and so I got bored.. Definitely the most well-rounded rogue-like Metroidvania out there. The pacing of the progression and unlocks is fantastic - the major unlocks are spaced out and keep you wanting to play the game more, and the minor unlocks are your choosing so it matches your play style and gives you a steady sense of getting better. The combat and controls are extremely tight, once you start mastering your equipment and learning the enemy patterns you’ll have a really strong sense of control over the game. The controls and combat are so well designed that I never experienced any frustration when I die, I always felt like it was my ability and limited mastery of my equipment. It truly is an addictive game. The pixel art is good but nothing to get very excited about, the sound design is fine but you’ll hear the same music and side effects so much that you’ll end up tuning it out. Overall, if you’re a fan of the Metroidvanias and roguelike games, you have to check this one out.. This game is perfect for Switch, I'm not good enough to complete it, but went up to 3 BC, and I absolutely loved every minute of it. I'm not usually into games like this, but this one is exciting.. Of all the irs on Switch, I spent the most time in it, it was amazing, all the boss cells were passed, the assemblies were tested, Easter eggs are open, achievements are open. This is such a cool roguelike platform hack and slasher! It does everything the game set out to do!. Remove the glitches from the switch version. You never know when it's going to crash. I have never played a game that crashed so much.. With over 100 hours played, I can say this is the finest rogue lite ever made alongside Hades despite the vast differences between both of them.. This is the best I've played in years. I kept coming to the game even if it was harder than I will like games to be. At first I thought that I will quit this game because of dying over a billion times, but I kept coming back and eventually this is my 2nd favourite game, alongside The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild. The soundtrack is great, amazing 2D metroidvania style gameplay, and overall fascinating game. The story is I will say mediocre, but the combat and pixelated graphics make up for that. There are a lot of weapons and outfits to choose from, and gameplay, even though extremely difficult, is the most amazing.. Classic rogue play. Don’t be surprised if you lose track of time playing this game. The lack of a more compelling story makes it lose a few points, but still a great game.. Wow, as a hold schools gamer, I consider Dead Cells a master piece. Took me more than 80 games to beat the final boss. What a journey! If you like pixel art, that game is perfect, nice colours, graphic and fast animation. It’s really gore, so it’s not for kids. It would be too hard for them anyway. The upgrade and combination of weapons are really well balanced. So the gameplay controls and visuals are awesome for me. I have nothing to complain on the audio. I really like the music at the end credits. The value of this game is … crazy. How that game can be so cheap. For a completionist, there are a lot of items to discover. All stages are randomly created, so you not get bored. So it’s a 10/10, let’s get back to the game and try to beat the game faster! Have a good gaming session. Cheers,. One of the best Rouge-like/action games i have ever played. Smooth combat and great art direction. The weapons and abilities are always fun to experiment with. The bosses are challenging but fun. The way you unlock new items is very cool, by killing enemies they can drop ""cells"" and with cells you can redeem them in a type of shoping list that grows with every item you can unlock and you are able to unlock them by finding blueprints or scrolls with the item on it in different levels by killing enemies. this game is a must play if you like action games.. The game is quite difficult, and as it's a roguelite, you won't be able to memorise the layout of the map. The game doesn't hold your hand either, so you won't have to sit through hours of tutorial to get to the real game. The enemies are a bit standard, the timed doors can be frustrating at times, and the game has a rather underwhelming amount of bosses, but honestly, my 100+ hours into the game speak for themselves. It isn't for everyone, but if you want a hard game that feels good to play, get Dead Cells. It's quite addictive.. Dead cells = really good pixel grapchics! Dead Cells = great music and sound! Dead Cells = perfect gameplay loop! Dead Cells = obscenely huge amount of content! Dead Cells = a development team that listens to the opinions of its players! Imho Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites game ever created!. Dead cells is beautiful. I love the game. I'm not good at it, but the success of progress feels good. I'm not a huge fan of how you progress, having to grind back to the furthest reaches each time you die gets kind of old fast. I get it, rogue like and such, but it feels needlessly annoying once the earlier parts become super easy after you get enough upgrades. That being said, the fighting is tight, and amazing considering it is a 2D platformer. It out performs most 3D games with combat of ANY sort outside of 1v1 fighting games of course. On the Switch this game is well suited. You can choose lots of controller layouts, take it on the go, and the game is great to pick up and put down too and is good for shorter gaming sessions. This is why I always loved handheld consoles, games used to be made to be picked up and set down. Overall, there are a few flaws, there are lots of tactics you can choose and almost all of them have pros and cons. Nothing is too OP or UP. No matter the platform, get this game if you have the reflexes for it.. Some of the tightest combat and controls I've ever seen in a platformer. The weapon, skill, and item selection is varied and provides a lot of variety and replayability (which is core to the gameplay since it's a roguelite) and a great sense of progression. Most of the progression though comes from your own improvement as a player as your skill and understanding of the enemies and hazards improve. This definitely gives me that great ""one more run"" feeling after I die, which is essential for my enjoyment of the genre.. This is by far the game I have played the most in the past 2 years. Always finding new things, new ways of going through he domes and trying new weapons/powers combos, getting to the new difficulty level, those are the things that make this never ending game a hit. I find it very addictive and with such a smooth game-play and diversity of play. A fine game, but I found it hard and repetitive and it failed to draw me in. Go with HADES instead.. Dead Cells is one of the most satisfying action games I've ever played. It takes the progression system of a Metroidvania and transforms it into a procedurally generated action roguelite with a steep but conquerable difficulty curve. Dead Cells delivers on everything from its fast and intensely gratifying, free-flowing combat to its wide variety of interesting weapons and upgrades.. I've been playing this game on and off, for some time, and despite many gripes like many weapons such as the Spartans Sandals being entirely unreasonable to use, I've generally enjoyed it. At least until I got to the Slumbering Sanctuary and had any love for the game violently **** out of it by the Caster and Golem enemies. Both of which can knock off upwards of 75-80% of your HP in a single hit. The Caster can teleport across entire sizable rooms if you try to get within melee range, while throwing fireballs that can be painful to dodge between frequently having several things to deal with at once. The Golem, on the other hand, if you get within in a mile of it, *will forcibly teleport you to it* endlessly, while obliterating your health with it's near-zero windup attacks, making it incredibly hard to deal with, considering you get maybe two seconds after a teleport to hit the deck before getting punished for existing. It's a special moment when I get the urge to uninstall the game on tilt, and fairly unprecedented that I actually follow through with it. Considering you are required to go there at least once to get the a rune, such poorly designed and generally inexcusable enemies are not something I can tolerate. If you can look past these issues, along with the aforementioned issue where some weapons exist only to be unlocked, disabled and forgotten in custom mode, I could recommend this. However my time with the game is done for the foreseeable future.. It's ok, it's good not great. After playing Hades this game feels very shallow. I'm realizing I'm not the biggest fan of rogue games but it's fun for a run or two. I just don't find it addictive like others do.. Dead Cells is a rogue-lite metroidvania that nailed the gameplay right on the head. As much as a full playthrough takes only about over an hour, you will spend hundreds of hours to get there especially if you intend to beat it on harder difficulties. The reason? Dead Cells is hard. It is hard, but fair (similar to Dark Souls) and most of the time, you will learn from your mistakes and improve on your next run. You can choose to invest in Brutality (melee), Tactics (ranged) and Survival (health) builds and the gameplay changes dramatically depending on your build. I did not find the builds very well balanced and whereas choosing brutality can make the Hand of the King boss a piece of cake, Tactics will be much more useful on Conjunctivius. There are 5 hard modes the last of which will unlock an extra boss. I would recommend to beat the game at least once more in the 1st hard difficulty, since I’ve enjoyed my hard playthrough much more than the entry level difficulty. I wholeheartedly recommend Dead Cells. You will get addicted to its gameplay and love trying different combos of gears and mutations which will offer immense replay value. More importantly, you won’t find many games where moving is so fluid and action so satisfying.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I put in about 5 or 10 hours in this game. A certain enemy, when he showed up, killed me easily every time. When he wasn’t there I got a while farther. I felt progression in my personal performance, as I began to master the enjoyable gameplay mechanics. However, it didn’t translate well to how far I was getting in the game. I felt how far I was reaching on my runs was more determined by the randomness of the game, and that wasn’t fun. I’ve played and enjoyed a number of hard games on the switch as well as a number of roguelikes. I purchased the physical version of this game for $30 used and had previously read a lot of hype on this game. I feel as though it didn’t live up to the hype.. I can take 2 points to this game for really good art-direction and smooth controls. And that's all the pros that game have. On the other side this contras: - endless grind, that quickly became boring - ""procedural generation"" of game levels that really is a fake. On 3rd game levels and next you can easily see that they don't differs so much from time to time. - lot of items, that you can unlock, but... Much of them you will not using any time - you have a real chance to be killed by one enemy's punch, no matter how much stats you have. The game generate situations, that you really can't beat sometimes. And of course you should play again from the start after this. Why? Because devs think this is ""hardcore"". But they wrong, this is not any kind of hardcore. I call this ""we want to make you think our game is hardcore, but we don't want to work on game balance"". In result, we have visually beautiful game, that looks and controls really cool, but with broken gameplay mechanics, that kills all the fun of this game.. I am sick of procedural generation. Procedurally-generated worlds feel so dead and pointless. Why do I want to explore a world with no soul, no intent behind its making? An endless widget search? Watching numbers go up? These might satisfy my gamer lizard brain, but they quickly get boring. In a game like Dead Cells, it is nominally to keep the challenge fresh, but each generation of the world is so bland that it fails to make an impression. If I can't even remember the last nonsensical string of gates and platforms, what's the point of giving me a new one? The point, of course, is to inflate playtime. It's the perfect way to stretch a 10 hour game across 100 hours, making for a more ""epic"" experience. Oh yes, you'll do the first two or three maps many, many times, because the randomness of the enemies and powerups means you'll just have to hope that this run deigns to give you a somewhat balanced experience. It may trick you into thinking you're doing well in the first two or three maps, but it will obliterate you in the next one, telling you that you need to grind out more of the few permanent powerups until you stand a chance at progressing. You will do this over and over. Oh, and there is a Dark Souls progression loss mechanic, because of course there is. Don't let the masochistic sycophants fool you, this is not fun. Combat is twitchy and trial-and-error. Putting a cooldown on your dodge in a game like this should be a crime. The beauty of a Metroidvania is in the layout. If the layout is the last priority, the game will suffer. This game suffers hard.. Simply stated, Dead Cells is fantastic. A metroidvania rougelite with lightning-fast action, a plethora of items and weapons that make each run exciting and fresh, and enough difficulty to challenge even seasoned gamers.. Good Metroidvania, loved to play it by the pool on my Switch. Very fun and challenging.. Awful game and community. Do not recommend to anyone. There are many better rouge lite games out there. This is just poor man's dark souls. Very clever, addictive, and fun to play. It is also rewarding as you make progress through multiple playthroughs. Highly recommendable!. One of the best action rouge-lite I’ve ever played. Before I bought this game, I’ve though “that game is overhyped crap”, but when I start playing this game, I couldn’t stop.. Delayed playing this for 2 years due to the Rogue-lite game play factor. Must say the whole rogue element is decently incorporated into this game, the rogue element doesn't feel like work nor is the game feeling stale after a while.. Game play stays fun,pixel art is amazing. This title has the most fluid game play i have ever experienced .. Dead Cells is easily one of the most criminally underrated and satisfying action/metroidvania games I've ever laid my hands on. Gameplay-wise, this game is phenomenal. You hack and slash your way through loads of interesting levels. Every level have a randomly generated layout, but they all stick to some variables, such as what enemies can spawn in them and what recipes can be obtained from them. After you beat a level, you reach this keep where you can obtain weapons, abilities, and more when you exchange your cells to the cellkeeper. To get cells, you must kill monsters. In the keep, you'll also be able to select a perk, which'll help you in your journey. Choose wisely, as you can only have 3 perks a life. After you beat the game once, you'll be able to equip boss cells. They'll increase the difficulty of the game and add new enemies to areas. In the spawn, there's also a daily challenge and a tailor. The tailor will allow you to select any outfit, which can be obtained by beating a boss or buying one from the cellkeeper. This game has 2 DLC packs. Rise of the Giant adds 2 new levels, new weapons, new outfits, and a new boss fight. The Bad Seed DLC adds 3 new levels, new weapons, new outfits, minibosses, and a new boss fight. In conclusion, Dead Cells is an amazing game that almost everybody can enjoy. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I held of on buying this game for ages as I read it was extremely hard and I normally gravitate towards games like yoshi which are fun rather than frustrating. In the end I decided to give it a go and I am so glad I did. While brutally difficult, you keep some pickups and get slightly stronger each time. This together with the exciting, fluid gameplay keeps you coming back for more. There are a few games like Zelda Breath of the Wild that regardless of whether you enjoy the genre, are a must buy. This is one of those rare games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ok, so. I waited until I`ve beaten the game in ALL difficulties before writing a review. So, here we go with the strong and weak points, shall we? ..... The game is a Metroidvania roguelike 2D platformer, and it is absolutely awesome. Yes, it is difficult if you want to step the difficulty up, but it is totally worth it. Let me tell you why. Pros: - Graphics: colorful, well done, with excellent artwork and art direction. A lot of Metroidvanias suffer from lame graphics or similar concepts that make them forgetful. Dead Cells make every scenario unique, with real personality. If you pay attention, each playthrough will make you notice something you haven't noticed before. - Difficulty: It gets harder in each new playthrough, but it gets easy every time you die. You die a lot in this game, but each time you respawn, you will get a little bit better. Every time you finish the game, you get to step the difficulty up and challenge yourself. I have beaten in all difficulties, even the insane last one, and I can say the difficulty get harder and harder but is completely worth it. - OST: Good one, fits right in. Not that memorable, but cool. - Gameplay: Fluid gameplay, everything works and respond as you expect. It's not like some other games where the difficulty is in lame controls, or in straitjacket limitation, where you can`t do what you want and end up dying. No, in Dead Cells, you die because you **** up. thus, it is all good. You have a myriad of choices to make, and the way you interact and fight is satisfactory. Gimmicks: This game is packed with different weapons and builds, like Dark Souls, so you can create your own style. Thus, exploring all these amazing options is hella fun. Cons: - I finished the game, and some things were never explained. That happens in Dark Souls, yes, but they get explained later, in other games. That happens a lot. But I`ve done all in this game, Beaten in all difficulties, opened every door, and some things were just never explained to me. I love this game, but they could have done better in the story. The scenery and plot elements you find left you to wonder, and that's it. - Although there are so many different builds, you will not actually try them. You will find one you are comfortable and used it forever. Want an example? I tried so many builds on my own because I like figuring things out by myself, then I equipped the following [WARNING, if you don`t want to k","roguelike is a great game, a must buy for any fans of the genre . i, personally, hate this game, and have no idea why some people hold it in such high regard . i wish people would understand that games don't have to be super difficult to be satisfying and/or rewarding ."
392.Rez,"Weak game, even in VR it didn't wow me as some other titles have. Very dated.. Awesome recreation of the original Dreamcast classic. High definition graphics really look and feel amazing. A game to experience, pretty good replay value as there are many unlockables.. What had taken me so long to play this game? I could kick myself in the ass! I been watching a lot of video for Child of Eden so I thought I would give Rez HD a try since it looked interesting. I could not be happier with the game. So simple, yet so amazing and a true work of art. Few games have been able to evoke such emotion from me as Rez HD. I absolutely love it! Most games in this genre can be ridiculously hard but Rez HD manages to find the perfect balance between challenging and frustrating. Its so perfect that I find it hard to stop playing. I skipped the gym last night because I could not put it down and I already took my pre-workout supplement so I was up for hours playing it. If you have not played this game yet do yourself a favor and get the trial. If you are disappointed you have no soul!",Rez HD is a recreation of the original Dreamcast classic . high definition graphics really look and feel amazing . it's so perfect that i find it hard to stop playing .
393.Demon's Souls (2009),"If you love everything FromSoftware has made since 2011 and you missed out on Demon's Souls for the PS3, you owe it to yourself to go back and check this one out. Knowing this was the first game that Hidetaka Miyazaki directed, the sheer amount of confidence in the design of this game is staggering. It eschews virtually every trend that was common in fantasy action games and RPGs at the time and literally invents a brand new genre. By now we're all familiar with the concept of ""losing your souls"" and the precise, methodical combat. But in 2009, there was nothing else like it. Today, in a post-Elden Ring world, none of this is novel, but it is still absolutely worth your time. Personally, I found it more approachable than Dark Souls II, which felt frequently obtuse and off-putting. Despite being the first and roughest of the SoulsBourne games, Demon's Souls rewards persistence and curiosity as much as Dark Souls 1 or Elden Ring. The world is as grim and oppressive as you'd expect, but you'll still have an avid desire to push forward and discover what lies ahead. Is it as good as Dark Souls 1? No, but few games are, and Demon's Souls does enough unique things that it still stands on its own despite all the many and more successful games that FromSoftware has made since. The 2020 remake is a testament to this, since it's mechanically almost identical to original. I personally prefer the artistic choices of the original, but if you have a PS5, it's better than not playing it at all. If you like Dark Souls, please play this game in one form or another.. Demon's Souls bounces between being great and being poor constantly. Some of the settings in the game are absolutely gorgeous. Others, while neat, fall quite short. Enemies are only dangerous in numbers, except for the spear wielding red eye knights (which I soon found myself avoiding as much as possible). Boss designs range from sub-par to interesting; most boss fights are supremely boring. Combat feels fast paced yet sluggish. Hitboxes decide to show up for work only when its in your deficit-- but then again that's a core part of Souls games. At any rate, the game has its flaws. Fun, but very flawed.. Best than Elden Ring, From software fist gem, still enjoyable despite the time. Great for the time, would be a 10/10 if there were no jank issues like maneater boss, also some boss run ups are quite annoying when learning the boss. My first souls game, instantly got addicted and finished it in 4 days. The true gamer soul starts here. Too much boring stuff nobody cares for. Why would i repedeatly farm resources in such game? Its too dark as well, has some questionable moments and what not. Not great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is probably the weakest From Software souls game, but this does not mean it's bad. My favourite parts of Demon's souls are its visuals and how punishing it is. Maybe it does not look like it came out yesterday but it has this very thick atmosphere and it has a similar feeling to those TikTok AI dark fantasy slideshows. The ending sequance is probably my favourite looking place in any video game i've played. Honestly none of the other souls games ever gave me any trouble, but Demon's Souls definely gave. At one point when I was in the poison swamp level I thought I would never beat it. By the way, that poison swamp is probably the worst video game area I've played. Somehow Demon's Souls almost plays better than Dark Souls 1 and 2. I think its probably due to the fact that there isn't that horrible mid roll from Dark Souls 1. But by no means is the combat great, it's mostly just kind of ok.. A brilliant and difficult game that has exceeded expectations and done wonders with ideas expanding on New Game plus. The game whose identity inspired a whole new genre of games we now know as SOULS-type.. Great gzame! Fromsoft knocked it ouf of the park at the start, so I feel like this must be said!. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. While overshadowed by its more refined and higher budgeted successors, Demon's Souls itself still stands on its own as terrific action-RPG. Its punishing but deliberate gameplay, interconnecting level design, and original progression mechanics started its own subgenre, and like Wolfenstein 3D to Dark Soul's Doom, despite being overshadowed, Demon's Souls has forever cemented itself in video game history for what it started.. The game that started it all. Though not perfect, it is a pretty good game and for the start of from software Souls series that would change the gaming industry.. I played the remake before this and was not planning on finishing this game, im halfway thru and im kinda loving this. Its a little bit too easy but i dont mind since im just really good. I died a million times in the remake and i felt like i already knew what was coming. Its really good because its like dark souls 1. Basically it.. I finished this game after DS 1,2,3 and ER. DS 1 is by far my favorite of the series because of its atmosphere, which is why I instantly felt at home in Demon's Souls. The whole artstyle is basically identical along with the ambience. It was a great way to get more Dark Souls, although it's noticeably less developed than its successor. There's very little optional things to discover and the bosses are sometimes incredibly easy. In general, the difficulty balancing is very odd. Flamelurker was a serious challenge for my melee character, but afterwards it felt like I was too strong for the remaining areas and bosses. That said, Elden Ring, in comparison, is so huge and the bosses are so mechanically demanding, it's nice to go into the other direction for a change. Demon's Souls is significantly more strategic than the fast paced, reactive playstyle of the modern Souls games. I'd recommend it to Dark Souls 1 lovers, but if you're more a fan of the recent titles it may be too slow for you.. This game is what made me fall in love with gaming. Even though, at 8 years old, I couldn't get past the first level, it captured me in its bleak charm. Yes, I acknowledge that this game has quite a few flaws, but I really don't care. It is by far my favorite game of all time. I mean, just look at my damn username. I've put in over a thousand hours and no-hit this game multiple times, even doing it twice in a row on one occasion. I know just about everything there is to know about this game, which makes me best qualified to point out some of its glaring problems. The gameplay can be clunky, the enemies are mechanically simple, the framerate is inconsistent, but at the end of the day, I just don't care. I love this game too damn much.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 10/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: /10. It has taken me a long time to play this game, I have passed the trilogy of dark Souls, Bloodborne and elden Ring, honestly, go for the remake, this game is too outdated and I have not been able to enjoy it. The game lag is horrible, it's too dark. The gameplay is very good, although the bosses are too easy, the levels are challenging, although perhaps too unfair. It's way below Dark Souls 1, he had very good ideas but he didn't give them the budget. Only recommended for true fans of Souls.. Few games can give. emotions like Demon's Souls. I've never been a fan of Souls-like games, but decided to try it from the first part of the series. And it's just amazing. It's a pity, of course, that Demon's Souls remained exclusive to PS3, so more players would meet it. Great gameplay and a wonderful atmosphere of dark fantasy. The complexity of the gameplay is frightening at first, but then you pull. And now you already accept every death as a challenge. A great start to the series.. If you have a ps3 you must try this game even if have the remake version on the ps5. SOULLESS FATHER STARTING THE DEATH CYCLE: Demon's Souls, as the progenitor of modern Souls-Like, launches the foundations that will later be taken up by its heirs. The player is launched as usual within an evocative cutscene that summarizes the entirety of the game world. Due to its simplicity and conciseness it manages to make clear in a few minutes the setting of the world, the main enemies, and the protagonist's ultimate goal, to kill all the demons and take their souls. As soon as the cutscene is over, the player will have to dabble in figuring out the mechanics of the game in order to manage not to die in the first few seconds of gameplay. Since there is no explicit tutorial, the early stages of the game are deliberately complex and aimed at making the player understand the target audience and the difficulty they will face. Once the initial gameplay phase is over, one will find oneself in the main hub, from which the real journey begins. ENDING THE DEATH CYCLE: The gameplay of Demon's Souls is iconic and has created a real genre, the Souls-Like. It is all based on an old-style RPG, relying on a variety of weapons, spells and armors that can give players an immense variety of combinations. This makes the game very replayable and diverse according to the player's style. One of the iconic features of Souls is the difficulty; this is based on a focal point, the dodge, built to be the main method by which a player can go from being annihilated by an enemy to annihilating it. Thanks to the dodge the player can go through virtually any attack, and the amount of invincibility frames vary according to the weight carried by the player; this varies thanks to a mechanic of transportable objects and weight, which will vary according to the amount the speed of the player's movements. Speaking instead of exploration, the game presents 5 routes available upon reaching the central hub, which will provide access to areas completely different from each other. There are also some mechanics exclusive to Demon's Souls, such as the ability to climb over small obstacles, or the tendency mechanic, a value that will vary depending on the player's actions; this value varies between pure white and pure black, and triggers in-game events, such as NPCs, weapons and invaders, depending on the two sides. PEERING AN ENEMY FROM AFAR: Graphically, Demon's Souls comes across as very dull; the use of unsaturated colors such as gray, green and orange makes the gameplay experience very exhausting and very lackluster. The use of the above colors certainly tends to give an even more pronounced impression of the game's setting, but it often makes the game heavy and tiring, even to the eye. Graphically it is not a gem, there being games released in the same vintage with far more staggeringly detailed graphics. In addition, the design of some bosses often turns out poorly. Animations often result in unnatural and clunky, and it is not uncommon to find many of them repeated for weapons even of different categories. “YOU DIED”: Audio side the game has two main points, the sound effects and boss OSTs. The sound effects remain iconic to this day and often reused in sequels. As for the OSTs on the other hand, they are still in the early days of what will be seen in Demon's Souls successors, except for a few that are very catchy. BUT WHY 7? CONS: It proves very difficult to be able to critique the father to the Souls genre after completing first the successors and then the original. The feeling one gets from playing it turns out to be that of a test to see if the genre could work, a text that is obviously successful, but that comes across as meager in many of its points. The gameplay often feels monotonous because of the colors used, the very small game areas, with few alternative routes that make exploration more interesting. The use of many of the same or similar animations and the lack of special movesets in weapons makes the choice of one's weaponry a mere DPS value. In-game bosses with more than 3 attacks can be counted on one's fingers and the few bosses with good aesthetics rely on gimmick mechanics (That is based on repeating a monotonous mechanic such as pulling a lever or completing a path by dodging attacks). The game's OSTs, as already discussed, are few and unmemorable, being very short and sparse. Finally, two game-breaking mechanics are present, namely the tendency and the cure grass. As the grass is farmable, it unbalances the game. Tendency, on the other hand, unbalances bad players too much by making them take more damage and good ones to cause more damage. PROS: Certainly the game's greatest pro is that it has given life to a new genre and tried what no one else had tried before. In addition, the already vast amount of weapons, armor, and the infamous souls lore already makes it a valiant, unfortunately immature title. RATING Gameplay: 8 Music: 5 Story: 8 Soulness: 7 _. a true gem it did not age well after 13 years but still i enjoy playing it among all the soulsborne series it was the easiest. What a great, magnificent introduction to Souls Universe. 1 Word for this, and it describes everything. Outstanding.. Dark Souls seems to get all the praise for starting the Souls-like formula, but the genre actually started with Demon's Souls. That alone puts this game high up there in video game history. But even ignoring that. This game is amazing. The atmosphere here is so good I dont think its ever been topped. I also really like how the bosses here are more unique and zelda-esque than the route the series would take eventually. That said, theres a reason why Dark Souls gets all the credit. The level design in Demons Souls is really up and down. Theres no interconnectivity the developer would be known for later. The NPCs are largely without personality. The game is short. And while the lore , world design, and combat are great, Dark Souls does all of these things a lot better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It’s sad to see that a lot of modern souls games have forgotten it’s roots. This masterpiece was truly ahead of its time. A game that encourages quick thinking and outsmarting your opponents instead of rolling at the right time. The world is masterfully created. The world tendency makes it so that your actions truly matter. Something g that later games failed to follow up. And the boss fights all feel different, and all have their own gimmicks. Well most of them.. Overrated game and saga. Frustrating gameplay instead of fun. The most capricious and pedantic games I have faced, labeled as ""hard"" when, at least with this title, is just a game with modern gaming features removed to add an unfair difficulty. You can't save when you like. There is no checkpoints. You can't pause, even if the controller runs out of battery, you are served to the enemies. Camera is crap, trophies are too much tedious and annoying to bare for a completion and the game is plain to be made to kill you. If you die you must run all the way back, kill all the enemies again to recover your souls (currency of the game and somehow the experience to make you stronger), because if you die again without recovering, all that progression is lost, just like your time. This game is a total waste of time and the fanbase is just as annoying as the very game. When you try to heal, you can't run or walk at the same time, instead, your character stops and stay there by 2 seconds where your enemies can **** you. I don't know why this saga is considered a big deal, because this is not real difficulty if you have all the modern features ripped off. How is supposed to be fun a game that need you to explore but then it punish you to do so? Is like a bad joke.. To me, this is the best game I ever played when taking into consideration it's era, obviously it is not the overall best game today but if you compare this in 2009 to any other game in that game's year of release, I think it comes out on top. The atmosphere and immersion in this game are unmatched until today.. A stellar experience that kicked off the Soulsborne series. Incredible how the game managed to get so many things right. The flaws with the game include frustrating level design and the frame rate dips often.. This is my favourite Soul game even if it isn't the best one.I think the open design and atmosphere is the best in the series I absolutely love it and it's music and feelings are the **** sadly I can say it's the best feeling it's like the gameplay leg is something after playing Dark Souls and this you can really feel how much they improve the heat and animations in Dark Souls and this just needs it but it has the best boss fights in the serious I would say.. This is where my Souls Mania Started 10/10 without a Doubt (yeah there is a Nostalgia factor, sue me). I played this game in 2022 and absolutely loved it. Obviously it inspired the souls/souls like genre of western/Japanese action RPGS. And obviously it created the series known for being so immensely difficult yet fair (Dark Souls 1-3). For those reasons it’s important to gaming. But how does the game stand on its own? I would argue it’s a masterpiece on its own. It’s creative, fun, challenging, a pinnacle of game design at the time (and still stands even today), has amazing atmosphere, great combat (better than even DS2), and a great story and cast of characters. This is simply an amazing game. Everything I got frustrated with (1:4 boss run past the dragon I’m looking at you) were never actually unfair, it was just that I didn’t take the time to patiently learn how to make it past that challenge (when I figured out the dragons attack pattern I felt stupid, just run straight). There are elements that are dated seeing as it came out in 2009, but even at that other than the graphics it doesn’t feel dated, it holds up with modern games and is better than most RPGs that have released in the last 10 years. This game is a dated masterpiece without a doubt. Give it a try, but know if you are struggling with an enemy or action sequence, just slow down be patient and learn it. This game is not about babying you and it wants you to take your time. Also pro tip listen to all dialogue, you’ll get a lot more out of this game if you do, there is some great lore and world building. Amazing game!. It's the greatest action RPG ever made, period. Far ahead of its time. Amazing graphics, visceral gameplay and a compelling narrative all tie in together for an unforgettable experience. Forget the remaster. THIS is the one you need to play. Maybe someday online will come back in an unoffial capacity.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. This piece of curve is not up to the game ! It's just awful, how could you make this crooked piece of ****. I love this game i ve played it dozens of times, there are so many ways to play, the game is challenging but mostly fair. This game is where from soft got to the next level imo.. Although Demon's Soul's is plagued by unpolished design it completely makes up for this through raw ambition and execution. Demon's Soul's laid is one of those games that not only defines a genre but generates it outright. With a bizarre and haunting soundtrack and thick and oppressive atmosphere Demon's Souls' is truly a thing to behold. I would highly recommend Demon's Souls.. Still the 2nd best game in the souls series, and one of the best games ever made. I haven't been able to get my hands on a PS5 to play the new remake, but I hope that it stays faithful to the original. The souls series have been relying on their action elements more and more recently, and it's refreshing to revisit the series before it found its identity in action, because the souls games have NEVER been good at that. Your choices really matter in this game. NPCs don't just sit around waiting for you, you really have to be careful. The game isn't difficult when compared to more recent entries into the genre (Hollow Knight, Nioh), but it's far more unforgiving than any of those games, and it's that that makes the game so special. This game is still fantastic 10 years later. The recent souls games and all the ""souls-likes"" have just helped me appreciate the game more, not less. A must play for anyone who likes difficult games, and I hope the PS5 remake helps more people experience this game.. I have to admit. This game didn't click for me at first. I rented it and beat the first area and couldn't make a dent past. right now I'm playing demons souls remake, this game is epic, and also the first ip from software that created the genre souls. I want to tell you a story, in those years 2009, I was one of the first to play this game and there were many comparisons with dragon age and what they criticized the most was the absence of history, many were made a bad game, but when a real masterpiece speaks for itself, the facts and the time made demon souls a better game than dragon age. Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 10+/10 Music: 10/10 Visuals: 10/10 Personal Score: 10+ A master piece !!. FromSoftware are masterminds for making this game, Thank You Hidetaka Miyazaki for this masterpiece! a must play for sure!!. amazing game, myazaki has done an incredible job the atmosphere of this dark fantasy is stunning. True standout game from 2009. Atmosphere, graphics, boss design. It was amazing.. Demon's Souls literally came out of nowhere. I know this because I was one of those people who learnt about the game through word of mouth and imported an english language version back in 2010. Even Sony (who own the IP rights) failed to realize Demon's Souls' potential by not even bothering with publishing the game outside Japan, because they deemed it as non-marketable. It took plenty of raging reviews and thousands of imports before Sony finally decided to supply the western gaming world with Demon's Souls. Back then all games were hand-holding players and the challenge was nowhere to be seen, so Demon's Souls' success becomes even more astonishing when you think about the gaming landscape of 2009. Sony paid for their mistake by losing the exclusive rights to a fan-favorite series and FROM Software went multi-platform with Dark Souls and later Sekiro. Demon's Souls was a rough prototype for what would eventually become the Soulsborne genre as envisioned by Hidetaka Miyazaki. Thus Demon's Souls is different and more adventurous in its design than the games that followed. Instead of an open world map with plenty of interconnected areas, Demon's Souls features 5 separate worlds, each of which is further split into 3 sub-areas. Each area is a sprawling map with plenty of secrets, twisting passages, shortcuts, traps, and deadly enemies. Bosses range from the easy ones to the more challenging ones, there's even a boss fight where you have to beat a live player who's controlling the boss (if you play offline you fight a stupid NPC boss instead). The world tendency mechanic was a nice idea but not well-enough implemented. But Demon's Souls most unique characteristic is its atmosphere, the Tower of Latria alone is easily more scary than any Dark Souls game (although Bloodborne would feature an even more horrific atmosphere later on by becoming more Lovecraftian). Unfortunately Demon's Souls ran very poorly on the PS3 (although it wasn't uncommon for games of the era to run at 20-25 fps) and image quality was lacking due to the low budget. But the game's shortcomings didn't stop it from becoming a cult classic, a game whose servers were scheduled to shut down in 2011 but popular demand resulted in the servers remaining live until Sony shut them down in 2018. Not to mention that plenty of people emulate Demon's Souls on PC through RPCS3 to this day. Demon's Souls made a huge impact back in 2009 and is an all-time classic game. Not only did it give birth to the Soulsborne genre, but inspired other game developers to make their games more challenging than before and adopt its combat system (just look at 2018's God of War and Team Ninja's Nioh games). And yes, after lots of popular demand, Demon's Souls' even been remade on the PS5, an excellent and modern revision of the original. I highly recommend Demon's Souls, whether you play the original PS3 version, the emulated on PC, or the PS5 remake.. Compared to the remake this is an absolute masterpiece in every way other than the graphics. Even then this has a much more eerie and dark tone to it while the Remake tries too hard to be eye-candy and thus ruins the atmosphere.. Masterful classic that truly stood out back in 2010 as something different, not like this weak remake that could be made by any indie studio.. This is TRUE CLASSIC. Back in 2009/2010 it was absolute standout game. Something new. Not like this awful remake.. I've been playing this game for years and never gets old to me. I'm looking forward to playing the remake on PS5, so excited about it!. The game that started the soul series, it was a unique experience you had to restart the whole level if you die and one thing i liked about it is the online experience like reading other gamers messages on the floor looking for an advice or helping somebody stuck on a boss fight or getting invaded by another player, the game could be played offline but it's not as good as being played with online connection so that you can enjoy the full game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. classic starter to legendary series!! Demos Souls is great for the experience/reward.. Demon’s Souls is a very challenging and very fun Action RPG experience, and the best game of 2009. Demon's Souls is fun not just because the challenge, but also because of its setting and world. The world of Boletaria is dark and foreboding in a very beautiful way, the gameplay is very challenging but also fair in every way, the boss battles are very well done, each boss battle has their own variety and they won’t go down without a fight, and there are no bosses you can skip. The gameplay consists of accessing different areas via the “archstone”, each archstone leads to a different location, each area has boss battles and items to collect. Each location is very different from the others, there are 5 total that are accessible. The soundtrack is another thing to point out as well, while there is little to no music in the open world, you are blasted with amazing battle music when in contact with a boss. Overall Demon’s Souls is an amazing game, the repetition of traversing the levels is very little thanks to each area being very unique and interesting in their own Demon's Souls is one of the best PS3 exclusives and the first Souls game I recommend you try out.. Great game, style, gameplay, with original mechanics, everything is at a good level. But the game is not player-friendly, and I'm not talking about its complexity in terms of the walkthrough itself, it's difficult in that it doesn't inform you in any way how something works here, where to find the object, what it does, how and why. You need to learn everything yourself along the way, by trial and error, as well as with completion of the bosses, enemies and levels. If you don't look for info on the Internet, then just to understand HOW you can kill the boss, you have to spend a lot of time by trials and errors. For this reason, I dropped game walkthrough, it is not interesting to play by the guides, and it’s a big waste of my time to find out, it’s not worth it, and in the end it won’t bring so much pleasure.. I wonder if this had been my first exposure to From Soft's genre defining Souls-likes before Dark Souls if I would have been as attached to Demon's Souls as I am. On one side, it's possibly the most unforgiving and vague of Miyazaki's games, but on the other - having experienced Dark Souls first - it's pretty easy, at least as far as Soulsborne games go. It's certainly rough around the edges, but it more than makes up for it with its challenging gameplay, dense worlds, and thick atmosphere. The MIDI-based soundtrack is so full of character - may just be my favorite of any From Software game, even if it's kind of goofy sometimes. I sincerely hope BluePoint's remake features an option to have the original soundtrack. The Nexus a wonder to explore - and that's just the hub world... though finding the Monumental took forever my first go around. There are some key aspects to the gameplay which aren't explained very well - World Tendency being one of the big ones - but it never hindered my experience. Ladder climbing speed was a bit annoying - especially in the Shrine of Storms world. I was also annoyed by the fact that, depending on where your character is positioned in the world, dying or loading out of the game sometimes sent me an entire checkpoint behind my most recent checkpoint upon reloading. This meant I would have to warp to the Nexus and then warp back to the proper checkpoint. Hopefully the remake addresses this - and includes the ability to warp between checkpoints instead of having to go back to the Nexus first. Apparently PVP was a nightmare, as well, but I never had the chance to experience it. I did get to dabble briefly with co-op, though, and had no issues there. Despite it's flaws, it's a masterpiece that I highly recommend everyone at least try. Looking forward to the PS5 remake.. One of the best games I've ever played for the PS3 and I'm excited about the PS5 remake. Didn't look interesting at first when I first play it at a friend house but when I was trying out the combat it was way better than I expected. So I went to buy my own copy and feel in love with this game. The control is nice cause you feel like you could actually control your guy that's what made me love this game. Worth a try if you live to fail and get better everytime.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is awesome. It can beat you down pretty hard sometimes, but once you come to understand it it will be a very satisfying experience. If you've played the later games, you can expect some elements that simply are not as well implemented in this game. But for its age, it gets a whole lot right, and remains worth a look at least.. I was never interested in playing Demon's Souls -even after completing the other four games in the franchise- until this year when I decided to at least check it out to pay respects to the title that started it all. This game is a primitive Dark Souls and its major flaws are really notable after playing the other Souls. However, it doesn't mean that Demon's Souls is a bad game. I don't feel any nostalgia towards it and I don't think that it's as good as the rest of the franchise but it's pretty enjoyable and I had a good time with it. Unlike the other Souls games, this one gives you complete freedom after defeating the first boss. You can play any area in any order through the Nexus hub. Most of the bosses are fine but only a few are truly challenging and the final boss is a joke. The game is hard and at first it can be tedious to farm healing items because I was used to Dark Souls' Estus Flask. Most of the time the areas are way harder than its respective bosses and there are no extra archstones after the first one, so the game returns you to the beginning of every level when you die. This didn't bother ","despite being the first and roughest of the SoulsBourne games, Demon's Souls rewards persistence and curiosity as much as Dark Souls 1 or Elden Ring . combat feels fast paced yet sluggish; most boss fights are supremely boring . if you like dark souls, please play this game in one form or another ."
394.Pillars of Eternity,"Honestly, I don't understand the popularity of this game. It's not a bad game, but to give it anymore than a 7.5 is a stretch to me. Quest outlines are vague. You never really know exactly what you're supposed to be doing. Areas are very small. It's easy to get lost and find yourself somewhere you're not even close to being leveled for. There's just several problems with this game no one ever wants to address.. I loved this game, a true crpg with tons of awesome side quests but the lore is just too philosophical and religious, and hard to understand.. The main thing bad about this game is the main quest line. Trying to find out why you turned into a watcher and your characters desire to be changed back. That is so low stakes it's ridiculous. I don't CARE. First of all being a watcher is pretty cool. It's a neat power. Finding out how and why it happened... I dunno, it's just not high stakes enough. The main quest line should involve saving someone, or some place or something where if you don't do it you or someone will die essentially or lie will be much harder. Something like that. Also many of the quests are too morally ambiguous. And sometimes you're not fully aware they are. Like who in their right mind would support animancy. Animancers are more or less turning people into zombies. But it's justified because babies are being born without a soul so they need to figure it out. I dunno, like it's kind of ridiculous. Sometimes I did quests just for experience even though I didn't think it was a good thing to do. A more grounded approach might have benefited. Yes it's different I'll give it that. Honestly, I prefer games that are more based on timing and hand to eye coordination. An isometric game that's like zelda where attacking is based on your hand to eye coordiantion but with a touch of Baldur's gate skill & numbers based stuff and more intricate role playing & multiple party members would be the greatest game ever. This is basically Baldur's gate clone and that's ok, but sometimes it feels like the layout of the world map was ripped straight from Baldur's gate. Funny.. Good game but not perfect. I def prefer this game over the newer game as it seems more full of content and more fleshed out. I haven’t completed the game. I’m at a stage in life where there isn’t as much time for gaming, and if a title isn’t outstanding, I often give up. As for this one, it’s around a 6.5 to 7 for me. I endured 35 hours, roughly halfway through 2nd act. The plot, which is usually crucial for me, didn’t engage me. Even after all that time, I kept asking myself, ‘quo vadis?’ because I honestly didn’t know what the main evil was that needed to be stopped, what was at stake, etc. I was overwhelmed with information and lore. Additionally, those kickstarter breaking-the-immersion moments, like gravestones and mini-stories, kept pulling me out of the game. The characters weren’t interesting either - After 35 hours I still couldn’t remember their names or their personal histories. What else bothered me? The descriptions of character gestures during dialogues. Especially when combined with lines spoken by voice actors, it was challenging to follow both the text and the voice simultaneously. The actor would speak continuously, and suddenly, halfway through the text, there would be two sentences about scratching their nose. Overall, I believe that if a studio can’t afford full voice acting like in Larian’s Divinity: Original Sin 2, they should skip it entirely instead of recording only selective dialogue lines (important ones, I assume). Personally, it annoyed me more than it helped.. First of all, i will say that i'm astonishedby the positive reviews this game has gottent throughout the years... Objectively this game is not good at all and far from being the masterpiece the scores it has got imply... Graphics, music and the universe/lore are all good, nothing to complain about here even though most of the lore elements are learnt through reading... which is boring, nothing is implicit, everything needs to be read... Story is original but falls short by the end of the **** ending is barely average and it feels rush. Special praise to the boring ""read again for 10 minutes"" ending to explain everything about the game as developpers are completely unable to make the player understand anything without explicit words... The gameplay is a chore... honestly i have played this game for 70h and the last 50h were boring. I have forced myself to finish the game but honestly there have been many moments when i wanted to stop and uninstall. The combat are a mess, there are too many of them, the fight system is garbage and the difficulty is way too uneven to be enjoyable. Well all in all, it is a barely average game where even the story is not good enough to save it from being forgotten.. Praised more highly than is warranted. A beautifully written story plagued by excessive unnecessary detailed cliche, such all those detailed ""dragons"", ""spell's name"". Make me feel like reading a thesis. I mean, do you really need all those incomprehensible to create so-called ""immersive experience""? I would give it a 7, but since all those reviews naively pump the figures up, so, 0 .. Amazing game and an ode to the OG Baldur's Gate games. A masterpiece. If you enjoy CRPG's and/or grand fantasy adventures, you will love this game!. From the studio that brought you STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords and Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian Entertainment delivers a beautifully crafted cRPG with Pillars of Eternity. Paying homage to ‘Baldurs Gate’ and ‘Icewindale,’ Obsidian Entertainment helps breathe life back into isometric cRPGs. Gather your party and venture forward as you embark on an adventure filled with dungeon-infested monsters, war-torn politics, and magic that allows you to read others' souls. Prepare yourself to enter the world of Eora, where your choices and paths will forever shape your destiny. Pillars of Eternity places a strong emphasis on character creation and development. Players can choose between eleven unique classes, six different races, and backgrounds that influence the players’ skills, abilities, and interactions within the Eastern Reach. Another standout feature is the beautifully crafted world that is Eora. Boasting hand-drawn artwork, you can see the attention to detail within the game. The bustling cities and ancient dungeons are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Each environment feels alive, teeming with history, lore, and a sense of mystery that beckons players to explore every nook and cranny. The storyline in Pillars of Eternity is something we come to love and expect from Obsidian. Featuring a dark and bleak narrative that explores themes of souls, reincarnation, and the consequences of the player’s choices that impact the storyline and characters–leading to multiple branching paths and endings. Let’s not forget another thing Obisidian excels at, loveable and life-like companions. Edér Teylecg; the well-articulated veteran from the Saint's War with a blackly humorous outlook on life. Aloth Corfiser; the obsessive elven wizard blinded by his duty. Or Kana Rua; an Aumaua chanter on a quest to discover the secrets below Caed Nua. With up to eight recruitable companions in the base game, with an additional three more in the expansions, you’ll find yourself lost for hours in conversation, or party configuration to suit your play style. Pillars of Eternity excels at providing a challenging yet rewarding experience. The isometric perspective and real-time pause combat system are executed with precision, offering a strategic depth that caters to both seasoned RPG veterans and newcomers alike. The variety of classes, skills, and abilities contribute to the gameplay experience that remains consistently engaging throughout the entire journey. I found myself captivated by the overall combat experience. Spending hours learning the system, reading about different buffs and debuffs, and meticulously crafting my party for the right fight. I was entranced by the wonderful score composed by Justin Bell. The music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, evoking emotions from awe to tension and enhancing the overall immersive experience. I felt the same set of emotions the first time I heard the score from Howard Shore in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Beautiful and elegant, I found myself listening to the score outside of the game. Pillars of Eternity stands as a shining example of what a classic RPG can achieve in the modern era. It successfully marries the nostalgia of the past with the innovation of the present, forging an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a seasoned RPG enthusiast or a newcomer eager to explore a rich fantasy world, Pillars of Eternity is an absolute must-play that will leave you eagerly anticipating what Obsidian Entertainment has in store for the future of the genre.. Very boring. Baldur's Gate (BG) and its successor are two of my all time favorite games. Pillars is a very successful homage to these **** game system is no longer based on the d&d rules, which is not necessary for a computer system. Many innovations are good, so there are no more single overimportant stats for one class, while the others are completely useless. At the same time, the system is confusing at the beginning, because it is not always clear how important individual stats are for a class. On the other hand, the system is much more forgiving when stats are not distributed optimally.Combat system fits, stays close to the BG feel and is mostly fair. There is a horrendous selection of spells, although fewer might have been more, because it gets confusing from time to time and it is difficult to assess which buff or debuff would actually be more efficient for the situation.Weak points of an otherwise great game are:The sidequests are fun. The main quest, however, is weak: the motivation and urgency are not very obvious... I just search ... someone. That didn't grab me at all for a long time and then towards the end you learn a bit more. As a drive for the story moderately **** own castle is built in my opinion also only mediocre sense. It is rather occupational therapy with very little influence... but you don't have to put more time into it than you want **** game world is solid but also not something special. It's fun to explore the regions, but it has little memory **** loading times are a bit long. This is especially noticeable when you have to quickly load a map (loading) into a house (loading) on the second floor (loading) and then back again...Conclusion:Those who loved Baldur's Gate will find the spiritual successor in PoE. There is a lot of love and quality in the game. Recommendation despite small quirks.. New world, new lore, new game mechanics... with all the essence of the Baldur's gate saga. Very well rounded cRPG plenty of options with a deep history and an immense quantity of (very well written) text. Some punctual strange decisions, as some illogical relation attributes/abilities or the stronghold management, impede the 10/10. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Many good improvements to the already great Baldurs Gate & Co. gameplay. So yes, here you can build up many characters, not just one and yes, it is complex :) Finally the inventory is big enough and the graphic looks well. Only the manual should have been bigger (definitive edition) The story is good, especially there are a lot of details to discover, for example the story of the world. Sound/Music are perfect. But there should be less text to read. And some cinematics to improve the presentation of the story could be great also.. These guys had a VISION. Awesome birds eye isometric RPG - cool story in a world rich with lore and side quests - all kinds of NPCs to interact with and impact your decisions/endings. Great character customization, some crafting and base building tossed in. And the UI for the combat/spell system is super easy to learn. Just the right amount of depth!! I played The White March pt 1 and 2 (both add-ons) and they really added to the storyline.. ivinity looks better but lacks the writing, both are my most recent favorite RPGs in recent memory. This will go down as the game that broug. Overall a miss for me. Too reliant on dense lore exposition, a setting that is dreary and not particularly interesting, and a story that is overall forgettable.. A well made tRPG with a gripping story and characters (most anyway). Combat felt fair and interesting, character classes well balanced and certain builds kicking arse hard.. An homage to Baldur's Gate. I liked the ending, but the characters in the game are completely unmemorable.. My first time playing a Baldur's gate-like game, and it made me fall in love with the genre, making me hungry for more games like this. Lots of customization and the possibility to create your own characters to join your party. Great RPG game.. I really wanted to like this game, as a fan of Obsidian and the CRPG genre, but after 3 attempts this game feels a bit lifeless. I would say I held some hope for it after the intro sequence, where some interesting things do happen. Unfortunately this is not representative of the adventure that follows it. It reads as an inferior Dragon Age Origins, with less engaging characters, cluttered lore and dry dialogue. It even feels a step back mechanically, which when considering this game is 6 years newer than DAO it's profoundly clear how dated Pillars of Eternity feels. I have gripes including, but not limited to: Antiquated mechanics and UI/interface Excessively long exposition dumps Flat, uninspired writing Companions that range from dull to obnoxious (Durance), but rarely likable Predictable enemy encounters which makes combat feel repetitive Complicated mechanics with barebones explanations Over rehearsed voice acting that lacks a feeling of authenticity Graphically ugly for a game made in 2015 Despite the above, it is still a serviceable game in the sense that it does evoke the nostalgia + framework of an old school CRPG, and the combat is decent enough - I will admit that I struggle to play original BG1&2 because of how dated they are and this game is just enough of an update to be more playable, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be doing a lot better. Therefore if you enjoy those games and can frame PoE as if it was a early noughties release (along with all the shortcomings that come with that time period), and can see past the plain writing then feel free to disregard this review. I'm writing this however because it has been compared to other contemporary more dynamic, inventive, exciting CRPGs that I have adored, which is why it is disappointing to me that the drop off in quality is so apparent here. Buyer beware! Despite all of this, I will be trying PoE2 next, as I have heard that it corrects a lot of the mistakes of the 1st game, has more engaging combat, less monotonous writing and optimisation of its systems. Fingers crossed.. all the 10s are overrated so you get a 0 for the act 3 difficulty spike, drove me away from the game.... It's a game for the tasteless and nostalgia obsessed. It's a terrible copy of Baldur's Gate.. Let’s describe it briefly. Advantages: Interesting lore, profound character scripts and story. Disadvantages: pretty much everything else. Graphics: was outdated even at its release. Looks like Sacred 1 game with better resolution. Sound: it exists. Nothing special. Music: couple of ambient tracks and very annoying only one single battle music track. Absolutely generic. Controls: gamepad controls are terrible. Every time when it’s need to switch from one character to another camera moves to this character. Why it’s so? Super inconvenient. Environment is also difficult to explore due to disappearing pointer. Unable to map commands queues. Basically everything is super primitive. UI and interface: poor usability, lack of information, requires lots of repetitive actions to do a simple thing, and some parts are simply ambiguous. Gameplay: Fight is nothing special, primitive point and click. Loot system is disgusting: exploration is not motivated, because usually all cheats contain random trash, and enemies most of the times don’t drop anything useful. Almost no random quests. Basically your “journey” will look like: read some dialogs - fight, fight, fight tons of similar enemies - repeat. In conclusion: Pretty solid CRPG, with lots of unfortunate flaws. Could be way better. But feels like only script writers were motivated, but not the developers of core mechanics.. Not as good as its predecessor Baldur's Gate, but a strong contender when it comes to updated visuals and gameplay. The narrative is weak and plodding at times, which is problematic in such as story-driven RPG, but there's definitely enough to keep your interest here, especially with the White March expansions.. The game's major flaw is that it's real-time with pause. That coupled with a braindead AI requires micro-managing each of the 6 party members every 2 seconds because if you don't the mages will just run into melee and get themselves killed. Real-time with pause was terrible in Baldur's Gate and it's terrible here and it really REALLY needs to die. I love isometric RPG's but only if they are done like Divinity Original Sin 1 & 2 or Baldur's Gate 3. Another huge downside: it does the same BS that the outdated BG 1 (& 2) did: only a couple of words of some conversations are voiced - and there are a LOT of conversations. Might as well read a novel and don't have to deal with the terrible combat system. PoE 2 at least added the option for superior turn-based combat, but that is only a band-aid option as the game is still designed around real-time and it shows.. I like it, an Infinity Engine type game updated. The combat is good and the mechanics make sense (a nice change from third edition's THAC0, and other quirks). The paintings and art and design is alright, but the character models aren't great. Jagged, boring, lower quality, even too much so for a PC game from 2015. There's also way too much pointless writing... I know some of it is optional backer reward stuff, but it makes my eyes cross where other RPGs don't. Walls of text, and there's some weird desync in how text is formatted and how the spoken lines come out. I'm not sure I can describe this at the moment, I'll come back when I've finished the game. Anyway, I'm not very engaged in the story, but not dead bored and lacking direction, like in Baldur's Gate post mines. The world isn't exactly to my tastes, a bit high fantasy generica, with the big crystals, etc... it's hard for me to be engaged in that kind of setting, if I'm not actively roleplaying. I'm not immersed. A more involved story and mechanics that tie into it might have helped, but perhaps there's time, I'm not very far. On the flip side, you couldn't pull me away from Disco Elysium. Anyway, I'll come back to this and surely rewrite it when I'm done.. I've read the story of the game in Blood, Sweat and Pixels (great book that you should definitely read) and it shows that the hard work that the developers went through with crafting this game has paid off, good game.. Love the game and the gameplay, graphics and story. It is a bit difficult when you start, if you don't know the RPG system from before. Once you break the code, you can create some epic characters that will be almost invincible (paired with the right team-mates).. Some good parts, but the story is very..soulless, ironically enough for a story about souls being stolen. It starts out OK but about halfway through it becomes a bit of a slog.. A generally flawless RPG game that has more depth than any single bethesda garbage you will ever chew up and spit back out. Mods keep those games alive, but Pillars of Eternity, stands on its own two feet. especially if you like Baldurs Gate, or any other CRPG, this is pretty much the best one ive played. The entire reason this game exists is to serve as a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment, one of the greatest CRPGs of all time, but it greatly falls short of the mark. Tyranny copied its combat system from this and it's just as bland here as it was there, and Chris Avellone was barely involved (even he says the story is too linear and uninspired). A good RPG doesn't need two hours to draw the player into the world, and I can't give this game any more time than that.. Pillars of Eternity is a rightful successor of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, with fantastic nostalgy vibes (and with some less fantastic oversized lore dumps but that's totally forgivable, considering the overall high quality and amount of quality content in the game). The music - absolutely beautiful - is a perfect marriage of Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate themes.. Pillars of Eternity is a role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game is a spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, along with Planescape: Torment. Obsidian started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for it in September 2012. The game uses the Unity engine. The game takes place in the fantasy world of Eora, mainly inside the nation of Dyrwood. The infants in the Dyrwood are plagued by a recent phenomenon in which they become ""hollowborn"" upon birth, meaning they are born with no soul. During the beginning of the game, the protagonist experiences an awakening of power due to a disastrous supernatural event, discovering they are a ""Watcher"": a person who can see past lives and interact with souls. The objective of the game is to find out what caused their awakening and how to solve the hollowborn problem.. Good/not great. Still i like more BG1 and BG2. Good idea with improving castle. Main disadvantage - u can easily make bad team and skill set. Its difficult to finish the game with that case. Another thing - so many magic/healer spells - without good auto AI or programming its very too much reading, browsing,... I dont at all idea remembering spells - dumb. Maybe good for board game. Its little like unused potion skills section in Witcher 3 (by almost everyone). I am facing a problem. Pillars of Eternity is certainly one of the best RPG games I know. But: it is indispensable to read and understand the lengthy texts that are displayed to you, because they contain important hints. Depending on the hardware (resolution and display), this is an imposition. And that's why I think this is one of the best games that are unplayable.. I think it was a great game in many aspects. I really loved the atmosphere especially, like the endless path with it's music and mystery (even though you thought it would never end). The idea with the castle was really fun. But sadly it falls short since it didn't really matter how much you built. So why build at all? It could have been a really fun aspect of the game though with improvments. The story and setting was also intriguing to me. However, the first part was better than the second part of the game. A few characters were really good, I liked Kana, Eder and Aloth for example. But generally I do think the game would have needed more interesting characters to choose from. The sidequests were really good sometimes, to take an example I stumbled upon a dungeon and there I found a temple with worshippers of revenge in the name of Skaen. Very unexpected and cool. The area where the game really falls short to me and made me not want to play it was the combat. The live-combat mess was just pure annoyance to me, not fun. Usually lacked tactics as well. Either you completely stomped the enemy and then it didn't matter much what you did, or you got stomped yourself and then it felt the same. I much prefer the Divinity way of doing things with turn based combat. Yes I know, you can turn it on, but a game which is not made for it in the first place is just not as good in turn based as Divinity for example. Personally I do not like that you cannot turn the camera as well, it gives you less freedom. I know this mimics the games of old, like Baldur's gate. But it's more annoying than adding anything to the gameplay. Pillars of Eternity 1 was a lot better than Deadfire, in my opinion at least.. especially when it comes to setting and story. But also the whole aesthetics of Deadfire with African italians in European clothes with weird accents just felt off to me. Anyway. It's worth 7.5 or 8/10. Worth playing once at least, for sure.. for any RPG fan. + Music Setting Mainstory World The idea of castle building - Too few good characters Combat Castle building not having any impact. Could have been better : There are lot of choices and consequences + a cool story and lot of quests but the building a team and fighting part are not well made, battles are mid turn by turn and mid real time wich made them both slow and hard, I didn't have much fun except for the firsts ones.. It took me 98 hours to finish the game. What an adventure it was. An awesome story. Each character has their own story and they are very good. Although it doesn't impress me as much as Baldur's Gate, it's just as good a game. The world is wide and there are many things to do. Side quests, dungeons are nice. You have your own stronghold and it added fun to the game. I did all bounty quests. The variety of items is nice, the abilities we use are many. In some battles, we may need to play more strategically, which makes the game more enjoyable. Except for the final boss and the Endless Path Boss, the gameplay wasn't difficult. Of course, I finished it on normal difficulty. But if you are confident in yourself, I say play harder. It will be more enjoyable. It was a great game in general, and so was the music. I definitely recommend.. It's a great game, with so many contents, a rich story, and a beautiful world. It's a dense game in terms of dialogue and quests, so, the lovers of an enjoyable reading will enjoy the game and its contents.. One of my favourite games! Especially with the White March DLC. Love the characters, especially Aloth, Eder and Kana. So happy I backed it on Kickstarter.. One of the greatest rpg's of all time! Honestly, every rpg lover must play this if he didnt yet!. I so expect this game. I want play in 2015, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But all the time just put out for my plan. And now I just take my balls in hand and buy this game. Ough. And... I disappointed. What is this game? I think this game only for geeks, who love played in Dungeon together with friends in a garage. So difficultly and not interested gameplay mechanics. And ok, if this one point, that disappoint me, but not - in game bad a plot. The plot is boring and not interested me. Don't worry. I don't want get your angry and disappoint you. I just write my emotions on a paper. Don't worry. Game is not cool ever.. This is how RPG should look like. After 5 years still the top! Many studios could learn from this one how to make a storylines and whole living world. Good job guys!. I'd say it's too difficult for the casual player, but the writing is unparalleled. Josh Sawyer is a legend of storytelling, and it shows. The plot is rich with nuance, detail, horror, and grief - but not without a faint ray of hope. I hope this genre will become more popular in the future, and Obisidan will continue to make games like this one.. Being from Baldur's Gate / Planescape: Torment generation had played Pillars of Eternity with open mind, yet I finished having a ""meh ..."" attitude. Simply in the end I did not feel engaged by either story or the characters, which I have not found memorable. In my opinion it is a dud, probably will be forgotten in the future just like Torment: Tides of Numenera.. I like exploring and seeing where the story takes me. I dislike the combat of CRPG's and since Iam in it just for the story and exploring there is an option to make combat very easy for those that want to get through the combat as fast as possible and just focus on the story and exploring. But even on very easy I was not able to beat the Adra Dragon as I found it extremely difficult. Iam sick of how ridculously hard it is and hate not being able to defeat it I find talking to NPCs with the reach into the soul thing pointless as it doesn't lead anywhere, it's annoying and I just choose the leave option as soon as it happens. At times I felt bored and just wanted to rush it though. Doesn't feel like it has enough depth. I can't recommend as I hate frustrating fights and just want to be able to get through it.. I enjoyed this game overall. I would say it is a solid 8/10. I enjoyed it, but sometimes it was a bit boring with all the political stuff going on. This game is very long if you do all the quests and DLCs (about 200 hours). The first 10-20 hours (until you get to the big hub city) are a bit boring but once you reach this city, your questlog will explode and you will fight a lot! So have a little patience. Pros ------------------- - Dark setting felt good to me, also the cozy atmosphere with the old houses and the bonfires - Dialogues are good - Complex, deep story - Good interaction of companions - Combat ist so much fun with many different spells as a Wizard - Graphics are made with love and attention to detail - Likeable companions in party - Complex biographies of companions, complex personalities - Day and Night cycle Neutral ------------------- - Story is a bit boring at times with all the gods and animancer stuff. There is very much political and religious stuff going on. - The reading is a bit dry sometimes Cons ------------------- - Loading screens every time you enter a house, enter a map or go to another floor in a dungeon. This is the worst part of the game! - Combat has some smaller problems like pathfinding problems and no transparency in fights what is actually going on. But it's not that bad. - Not all dialogues are voiced. For example, the first two lines might be voiced and the next lines not. Only mainstory voiced. - Insane amount of reading (soul texts etc.) - Per Rest system for Wizard spells: Your spells are not refilled per fight but per rest. Bad thing about this is that you can only rest with Camping Supplies of which you can carry only 4. But for many dungeons, you will need more than 4. So you will be using your Camping stuff in the Dungeon and then travel back to the inn in order to rest. This can be very annoying. I would recommend this on sale for max. 10 Euros / Dollars. Compared to other games I would say: Divinity 2 > POE > Patfhinder: Kingmaker. If you miss the old Baldurs Gate, I find this game to be substantially the same more or less, in many ways except for the ""city management."" Great very old school mechanics, wonderful rich lore, decent writing, very little voice acting but it's excellent. I am only in Chapter 1 but apparently have 120 hours (on hard difficulty) so no complaints at all really. Combat sometimes is both too hard and way too easy on Normal, so I'm not sure what to say. I suspect when I'm in areas I belong with the correct party, pausing every 2 seconds and well rested, it goes to the way easier side. When I'm not (I went too far into the keep for my level but I didn't know that) it was difficult even untenable. I wish there was some way to gauge this or maybe I just haven't figured it out. The resting system is very old school, and I thought I would really miss that, but I have to say, all it does is force me to go all the way home instead. They fix this with camping supplies which are ... cheap or expensive depending on how you spend your coin on other things, but you can only carry a limited supply I don't understand the point of that. I think better would be to significantly (1) increase the price of camping supplies (2) take the limit off (3) making resting elsewhere more risky to go back","it's not a bad game, but to give it a 7.5 is a stretch to me . the main thing bad about this game is the main quest line . i prefer games that are more based on timing and hand to eye coordination ."
395.Castlevania: Symphony of the Night,"Beutiful game, with amazing weapons. bosses etc. the lore is one of the best in games history.. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is (obviously) a MetroidVania where you play as the son of Dracula, Alucard, who is searching Castlevania to defeat his father. I will preface this review by acknowledging that this is a very old game. While I do not give pity points for games due to their age, I will acknowledge its age nonetheless. The positives: The core gameplay of SOTN is very solid. As expected, it mostly plays like a MetroidVania would play. You go around the world, fight enemies, get stronger, all that jazz. It does the basics very well. The spells are really cool, though, since the inputs for them are ""complex"", requiring effort for using them. Alongside the spells, Alucard has three forms he can go into, which are an alright dog, a cool bat, and the fantastic mist form. These form changes, mainly mist and bat, did a lot for this game, and I really appreciate that. The music SLAPS. I already heard Bloody Tears (I think) before, so I knew there was some fire, but they didn't miss at all. My personal favorite is the kind-of calming creepy track that plays in the lowest parts of the map. It's all really good, though. The bosses were mostly fun. They provided either the smallest fragment of a challenge this game had to offer or a brief time of enjoyment. They were nice. The neutral: The story existed. It wasn't bad, it just existed. The negatives: Another title for this game could be Inconvenience of the Night, because this game was plagued by so many inconveniences and annoyances that it's honestly ridiculous. So many factors clash together to create an experience that wants to make the game inconvenient for you that I genuinely don't know what Konami was thinking. The level design ranges from decent at best to abysmal at worst. Now, granted, most of the rooms are at that decent area, but a lot of them get really bad. I'm going to call out the Clock Tower / gear area for being a contender for worst area in a video games, because WHO WOULD EVER THINK THIS AREA WOULD BE FUN? It is a vertical gimmick area that is flooded with enemies flying from off the screen into you and some small enemies in the rooms themselves that aren't a threat. When you get hit by the Medusa Heads coming off the screen, you get turned to stone. Nothing happens to you during it, you just get stuck in place for 5 seconds before you can go back to your climbing. This area, alongside other bad areas, are prime examples on how NOT to do level design. The enemies, excluding bosses, are kind of a mixed bag. Some, like the big knights, are really fun to fight. Others, like the Medusa Heads, are annoying. Placements of these enemies is quite poor, with way too many reused enemies, too many enemies that felt out of place, too many rooms where the enemies were either in bloat or in scarcity, etc. And the worst part? They all eventually become nothing more than just a 1-damage dealing Inconvenience. It's quite sad since enemies are what make MetroidVanias fun, yet SOTN fumbled here as well. This game is far too easy. I died 4 times in total. 1 was during a tutorial boss, 3 were to Richter before I learned how to attack. Did not die a single time after that. And mind you, this is my first time actually playing Castlevania, so I'm quite disappointed. I don't mind an easier game, but this was pathetically easy. Verdict: Overall, Symphony of the Night has the base for a good game thrown into a pile of extremely flawed design, lack of quality control, and a lot of basic errors. I get that these issues ""are a symbol of their time"" (or some cringe ass **** like that) but that doesn't change the fact that they are still major issues that dramatically hinder this game. I really hope this isn't the best in the series because I do not look forward to playing the rest if that's the case. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night: 6/10 A-tier. Simply the best castlevania in the series, well written with amazing voice actors and memorable quotes ""what is a man?"" This 2D classic reigns supreme with alternate endings pending your completion amount, with secret weapons and a long list of fun items and combonations to help you through each boss. Right when you think you've done it all, it flips, quite literally, and there's much more to the story than anticipated. The sega saturn version being most complete by being able to use maria renard to traverse the castle. Easily one of the Top 10 video games OF ALL TIME. This is a masterpiece! Everything is perfect!! Still today holds amazingly well. The story is great, the music is incredible, the gameplay is classic , just a perfect game. Love the exploration. The title is perfect for this game, we can consider this game as a symphony, one of the greatest symphonies in metroidvanias. Totally recommended!!. The best part is that the art direction is simply fantastic—easily one of the most beautiful games on the PS1. There's so much variety in the enemies; I adore this game for Alucard's slick animation, story, boss designs, and level designs. However, there is one big flaw that makes it hard to give it a perfect score: the balancing is wacky to the point where you can end up butchering all the bosses without even dodging. Some weapons just shred the bosses in seconds, making the boss fights less engaging. Additionally, the second half of the game (the inverted castle) is too much. It’s cool, but it’s basically the same as the first area, with even the enemies being reskins. The big problem here is that it's also as long to complete as the first area, making it very tedious to finish. It was cool for maybe 40 minutes, but after that, it’s kind of ""ehhh."" Still amazing and would highly recommend.. I end up not enjoying so many games and leaving poor reviews I needed to play and post something positive. So much has already been said about this classic there really isn't much that I can post that will be of value, so I'll just ramble. As per my usual. SOTN is like your favorite comfort food made by someone you care about when things haven't been going your way. I regulary fire this up and can immediately be having fun. I'm a grown ass adult with a full time job and not an excess of free time which means that I really struggle with modern ""movie games"" You must update your console to play! You must make an account to play! You must install game to play! You must update game to play! You must sit through endless cutscenes and tutorials to play! Who exactly has time for that nonsense? **** isn't fun it isn't a game to me. Castlevania SOTN isn't just fun, it is IMMEDIATELY fun in a satisfying way that few modern games can top. I often charge through the castle as Richter waiting for other crap to install on my system only to discover that I was having a much better time playing a game DECADES older than what was just installed. And now game companies now want $70-$80 for their movie game slop?!Mf'er how about you make something fun for a start? The original PS version is the best in my opinion, but if that's not accessible to you then at least play the digital bundle that comes with Rondo of Blood (another great game that I **** at). With a mixture of open-ended gameplay elements, more advanced controls, and a gripping story, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is the epitome of the side-scrolling genre.. Castlevania Symphony of the Night really set a new and wonderful tone that was well worth doing over and over again for the series. Exploration, leveling up, and cool power ups just make SotN a bundle of joy. With plenty of secrets and being able to play as Richter, everything, save for a few small things, feels great in this game.. Simply perfect! The progression is incredible, the soundtrack is wonderful, the visuals are impeccable, the protagonist is sensational, the bosses are challenging and cool. It's simply one of the best games I've ever played in my life.. My brother's favorite game of all time. I like it a lot too, and beat it like once. He plays it to this day. Great memories attached, and tons of nostalgia. Good old days.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. rubbish i purchased this and its shert not likeing this either i like this back in the olds but not anymore. Still one of the best metroidvelia games there exist, disc games Just comfort food for me now I just always relax while playing it and it's always fun to find a new way to break the difficulty because this game is easy I mean not in the beginning but halfway through the game you will found a way to break the game, is always enjoyable so it's a good classic to return to when you feel down. The 360 port of ""Symphony of the Night"" isn't perfect, but it's perfectly fine for those that missed it on the PS1. The enhanced graphics are much sharper than the original's and you can expand the picture to full screen. However, the background music is terribly muted even when stereo sound is turned on. As far as extra content is concerned, there is none besides the option to switch to the PlayStation 1's blurrier visuals. In addition, for this game, the Xbox's d-pad doesn't work as good as Sony's. Despite the flaws, ""Symphony"" is perhaps the greatest Castlevania game ever made. I would give this $10 port a 9 out of 10.. This is a well made port. Unfortunately, it still feels lacking. Everything symphony of the night did well is still here. Not only that, but there is no loading screens and no slowdown. I was however, hoping for the Saturn and PSP content. Maybe the 2 variations of Maria would be fused together. That might be unreasonable, but as long as Maria is playable in some way. Even still, where's the saturn's item button? Or the ghost prison? Underground garden? The PSP version's better voice acting? I can live without all of that, but what happened to the infinite wing smash? Overall. I highly recommend this to anyone that hasn't played symphony of the night. This is the best version. It's just a shame that instead of being better than the PS1 version it could have been the definitive symphony of the night experience.. 5 out of 5. This game manages to take everything good about Castlevania and blend it perfectly with everything that made Super Metroid great, making a game formula others have been trying to duplicate for centuries. This game manages to perfectly blend various genres into a beautiful masterpiece. Excellent platforming, RPG elements, and exploration seamlessly come together here. The music is second to non and elevates the atmosphere to astronomical levels. The gameplay is just on point. I just can't recommend this game enough.. They put the vania in ""metroidvania""... enough said. A timeless jewel with unlimited replay value.. The best plataform game EVER,Castlevania is great but Symphony of the night take itto another level, Full of movements, magic powers, great story, Two castles an allies. and secrets.. One of the best platformers ever made with high replay ability and with a superb soundtrack that you will undoubtedly remember for the rest of your gaming life.. What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? Having never played the game previously when it was originally released on the Playstation it was something of a treat to play through for the first time in 2013. The first game I ever played was on the SNEZ and happened to be Castlevania IV which I still think is an excellent game to this day so I had a declared interest in playing SOTN. When I discovered it was available on xbox live for £6 I bought it immediately and have not been disappointed! I love the 2D graphics and the atmosphere. It works so much better than a lot of the 2.5D games that are coming out at the moment because the creature animations have a certain eerie or grotesque quality about them that only seems to be achievable in this sort of 2D. I just cant see Beezlebub or the Legion boss being as unsettling when rendered in 3D because I don't think the artistry would be there. The game does actually take some getting into and I wasn't initially all that blown away. I think this was largely to do with a significant lack of a back story and being left with little to no sense of direction when attempting to tackle the huge castle map. This is a by product of modern gaming's frequent bouts of 'hand holding' however and once I slipped back into the mindset of the good old days of the more cryptic secret filled era of gaming I was more than happy. I will say I had to consult a walkthrough on numerous occasions, particularly in order to get going but since I've gotten into the swing of things I feel this directionless style of gameplay really suits as it allows for replay value and surprises. All in all I feel this is a gem **** however I feel it won't be appreciated be all gamers, particularly the younger generation who haven't grown up with some of the balls out cryptic ridiculousness that the earlier consoles offered. One down side however is the inability to swing your weapon upwards or diagonally upward, I don't know why this was present in Castlevania IV all those years ago but has since been removed.. For a game that is almost fifteen years old Symphony of the Night holds up remarkable well. A 2D action RPG it takes the template from the Metroid series presenting players with a huge castle (home of Dracula) to traverse that gradually unlocks as weapons, abilities and equipment are (re)discovered. Being an RPG defeating enemies of course allows you to level up. Although there is no real ability for the type of customisation found in more modern titles this does make all the backtracking to find newly accessible areas slightly less of a chore than it might otherwise have been. The gameplay itself is fast paced and varied with a range of different enemy types each with their own attack patterns to keep players on their toes. Evidence of the games age is certainly visible in the rather blurry graphics, terrible script and somewhat unresponsive controls (although that last one may have more to do with the Xbox 360 pad). To be honest this is a game crying out for a modern day remake but for now you could do a lot worse than give Symphony of the Night a try.. This is definitely worth 10 dollars. While the voice acting is cheesy, the gameplay is addicting and I enjoyed exploring the castle. You're probably going to need a strategy guide as it is a HUGE game and easy to miss stuff.. I have given this game a 9, bearing in mind that it was released in 1997. The game is a 2D side scrolling action RPG and takes place in a massive freeroaming castle environment. Not that much skill is involved as the player can gain strength etc by earning experience and finding better weapons and equipment. There are lots of clever puzzles and secrets in the game. The graphics and music is also great. I thought the story is a bit silly and a player will have to make sure to read up on the internet about save rooms, otherwise frustrations will follow.. SOTN is an absolute masterpiece. Get past the steep learning curve and experience its brilliance. After you complete the first castle, you'll be extremely happy at your purchase. When you figure out that you missed the second half of the game, amazement sets in.. How can anybody hate this game? They don't make games of this caliber **** time and effort that have gone in this game shouldn ' t go unnoticed. The only thing i can complain about is at first the controls can be weird, I don't know how many times I would accidentally keep freezing time, or throwing holy waters. Maybe it's just **** music is great, The way Alucard walks looks like some funky disco/walking/dance, I felt gay playing as Alucard because of the way he walks but when you figure out the ""Y"" trick you don't need to see him walk like that ****. The acting is horrible,but who cares about that anyway? I have played many games in my day and this game to me is a 2nd favorite of mine, right next to Chrono Trigger.. This game was pretty good. It felt a bit short though, I dunno I think i missed some secrets maybe.. I think this was a classic sinse the PS1 was what the school groopies were yapping about. The game itself tells a story in it's mindless side scrolling, which is pretty impressive, and the fighting is well crafted. Worth spending your X360 points on.. This game keeps being as amazing as it was more than a decade ago, this port is everything that we needed since it keeps the gameplay unchanged and controls adapted perfectly and it has a really classic feel to it which is refreshing. There are many secrets to find in this game extending the gameplay and replay value and the RPG elements are great. The only issue I had with this game was the really difficult learning curve since its not the best game for starters. Overall this is an amazing game just like before at 800 microsoft points its easy to recommend.. Excellent atmosphere, huge non-linear platforming game, great graphics that still hold up to this day, a huge assortment of weapons and enemies, giant bosses and one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. On the downside, the D-Pad controls are WAY too sensitive (e.g. you'll accidentally use subweapons or the spell ""dark metamorphosis"" constantly) and the game is painfully easy. When confronted with a difficult situation there's always an easier way through, such as turning to mist, a bat, leveling up or equipping some weapon that improves your resistances. Even without that, Alucard is just immensely powerful and most enemies take so little health upon impact that it's a wonder if you'll ever die.. Game is awesome. i still have the psx version of the game and have it on Arcade now. (i have no ps2 :( ) still playing it now years later and love still finding out new things about the game",castlevania: Symphony of the Night is a MetroidVania . the core gameplay of SOTN is very solid . the music SLAPS is calming creepy .
396.Fable II,"Gameplay, atmosphere, art design, all top tier. all these years later this is still my favorite game. i have dozens of playthroughs and at lease once a year i pop it in and enjoy it just as much as the time before !. Fable 2 is a beautiful game, that has a fun arcade combat experience. Fable 2 was a phenomenal pillar for the Xbox 360.. The first game in the series was released exclusively on Xbox in 2004 and then brought to PC in 2005. But the fact that the second game, which came out in 2008, still hasn't been released on PC 16 years later is a big ridiculous. Fable 2 is not a good game and not playing it would not be a loss, but what I want to point out here is the hypocrisy of Lionhead and Microsoft. Probably the Lost Chapters version, followed by Anniversary and the third game sold more on PC than the terrible Xbox 360.. Incredible rpg with consequences for your choices in side quests. I didn't even notice how many changes there were until I did a 2nd and 3rd playthorugh. This game, with it's charming aesthetic and in-depth mechanics, was one of the best roleplaying game experiences I had ever had. The game does have a share of bugs and glitches, but they were never experience-ruining. The character I created, an evil, fat warrior with roguish hair and a brown nobleman's coat, was one of my favorite characters I had played as in any RPG I have played. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an Xbox.. The first RPG I played on 360. Has a special place in my heart.. Best of the 3 FABLE. Much more fun than Starfield. Best Fable game ever . Choices in this game where intresting and changing of character whit your choices were great. This game had potential to be bigger than it is but is some way it's better like this.. Microsoft just don't push them out like they used too. Here's to hoping Fable 4 isn't a complete disaster!. I enjoyed this game a lot when it was released. I just wanted more Fable and thats what i got.. its perfect like the 1st part, but The Lost Chapters is much better in atmosphere. Charming storybook atmosphere lends this adventure a unique tone. The minutia of the world does a lot, all of the emotes and real estate work and customization marriages and murders combine into a very enjoyable sandbox that is quite large at the end of things. The story is also surprisingly memorable.. Great storytelling, great charakters, fantastic soundtrack,..... This game is 10/10 best RPG i ever play. I liked that game a lot. Interesting plot where on the beginning you have a dog.. A beautiful fantasy role-playing with very emotional elements, a beautiful story, relatively good gameplay with interesting mechanics.. A very good RPG with a very good loot system. Story was interesting and the world was immersive. The world was fairly big but the loading screens between areas was quiet annoying. The morality system was interesting and the choices are nice to see. Combat is very basic but is quite satisfying gunning down enemies. One of the best areas/levels was infiltrating the tower as a guard, some of the game did feel like padding though.. One of the best games I have played in my life, really interesting rpg with good story. I’ve played this game many times over the years. I don’t see why this game would receive any hate. It’s meant to be exactly how it is. The game is a blast and transports you to another world with a great story and lots of fun. Must play rpg of its time, i think its the best of its series. Such a fantasy world. This is by far the best game of the Fable franchise which is kind of sad that it's only playable with an Xbox console.. Fable 2 isn't groundbreaking but it doesn't deserve its low user score. Its a fun semi open world RPG adventure with charming aspects and an ok combat system, the game has a large nostalgic aspect (for me) and some solid voice acting in parts. Don't expect Skyrim as the game path is quite linear, but all in all its very much worth picking up if you still have a 360 as, unfortunately, its not available anywhere else.. The best fable ever. Fable II was released in 2008, exclusively on the Xbox 360. It is for this reason I didn’t get to play this fantastic game until now. 14 years later, but my god… it was worth the wait. Story: Fable II takes place more than 500 years after the first entry. You play as Sparrow, a boy/girl that suffers from severe dysfunctional bone growth, resulting in a very weird looking male character model. You and your sister get shot in the face by the villain for being a potential hero, and after breaking every bone in your body (which subtlety explains the disfigured character model) you grow up to be the potential hero… or a greedy murderer. The choice is completely up to you, the player. Gameplay: Much like the first game, Fable II is a third-person action game. Your path of quests is mostly set in stone, though sometimes the path diverges into two ways. Your choice can have a permanent effect on Albion, though mostly on the gossip by villagers. No wonder my blade keeps slitting their throats accidentally… You can invest your experience points into physical, skill-based or magical upgrades. These upgrades will determine physical changes, but also new abilities and improving on existing ones. But as a hero, presentation is of great importance in Albion. You can make your hero as attractive as possible, or make him drink beer, eat red meat and pie until this obese monstrosity is mocked by everyone. Imagine being saved by an overweight, vulgar, poorly dressed, demon spawn that flips you off. In Fable II, that is possible! If you calibrate it right, it is even possible to operate in a morally grey area. Oh, and you got a dog that tells you were the treasure is. It saves a lot of time in comparison to Fable: The Lost Chapters. Graphics: Fable II came out in 2008, so these graphics have aged a lot… or so you would think! The environmental graphics are downright ancient by now, but the character models still look good, and animations still hold up. In fact, modern Bethesda games look like a hobo favela compared to Fable II… A very entertaining game, but there are some flaws. Time passes quickly while travelling, and in Fable II time is money. Your spouse needs constant upkeep (even if he/she is unemployed yet is perfectly able to get a job) and relationships can deteriorate quickly, leading to divorce. My advice, don’t get married in Fable II. They just became **** squeezing you for money and sex every five minutes. Also, walking up and down every region becomes a bit repetitive at times. Fable II is an excellent game, i give it a 8/10.. Here's my Fable. Once upon a time there lived a greedy Microsoft Publisher and his lackey Lionhead, and once they released Fable 1 on the PC, and they did not give the second a chance, they fed us with expectations, and then there was silence, and here in the courtyard 2k21 and still silence, I think that it's time to remind the world that there was once a good game, and in order to remember everything good in it, you need to release it on your pc, only then people will go to buy a new Fable. This is how they say, and my Fable is over, and may my words not become dust in the eyes of Microsoft and the entire fan community of Fables. ~ MY DREAM IS NOT FULFILLABLE ~. best rpg game on xbox 360 and in history.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. If you enjoyed the first part then you'll enjoy this sequel. The main knock on it was the ending.. The best Fable Game out there! Nice Graphics! Great Gameplay! Very underrated and a Masterpiece!!!. So many good memories on this game and the kinda coop thing too is very fun i loved to know how much time my friends online had sex or catch aids. Entertaining ARPG, with a good overall design and a fun sense of humour. Today it may not have aged as well as its genre and generation mates, but the story is good and the gameplay is good. It's a simple RPG, with little depth in some aspects, although at first it may seem otherwise. It lacks more varied side quests. Nevertheless, it took me about 30 hours to complete and for the price I got it, it's more than enough.. this game is amazing and simple to play, overall this game is very good you must play it.. One of the greatest role playing games ever! Amazing story, fun combat, everything is so satisfying.. I was only able to play this game recently, after passing the 3 part, I had mixed feelings, this is my favorite series, but the game really came out average, 1 part for me has already become my native and hotly beloved, 2 the part went quite far from the 1 part, the world became larger, more interesting, the same atmosphere of the world remained, the atmosphere of the fairy tale, the combat system has gained many new techniques, many opportunities around the world, demonic doors have become very interesting in content inside, in general, I really liked it, I hope that the new part will still come out and it will not be canceled. Awesome the game builds and writes its self just perfectly sometimes the game doesn't take its self seriously but its beautiful when it does the story is great but the ending is anti climactic. Fable II is a masterpiece. Fable II is a open world role playing game with a great main quest and lots of great side quests and activities.. Undoubtedly one of the best RPG's I've ever played. Even today Fable 2 holds up well. Charming, funny, dark and fun. You can be a great hero, or a dark villain. How do you want the world to remember you. It's only downside is the lack of clothes and armor in comparison to Fable. A simplistic and arcadey rpg with a charming setting, visual design and a likeable tone.. Let me explain. This game will not take long if you're used to RPGs. If you just blow through the main story and don't do any side quests you are looking a maybe a long weekend of play. The main story isn't even that deep - you basically know all there is to know within the first few hours. This is a big disappointment, because since you know who the final boss is going to be right from the get-go, and you know enough of his past to be intrigued, you are ready for an engaging story... but then they never build on that excellent foundation. Even the final ""battle"" - if you can call it that - leaves something to be desired, as the whole ""fight"" consists of pressing and holding the A button.. Well the game definitely has some good points to it, but the plethora of game-breaking glitches can ruin it for anyone. Combat is fun in this game. I like the targeting and subtargeting with guns and crossbows. It's fun to shoot weapons out of an enemy's hand and the ability to decapitate someone with a blunderbuss is cool. I like the addition of gender as a choice at character creation. Interactions with random NPCs is improved, but still not too real. Pretty much everyone, male and female say the same thing to you based on how they perceive you. The gamebreaking glitches are annoying and apparently will never be fixed. Lionhead studios does not support the game, directing you to Microsoft support. Microsoft support doesn't support the game either basically telling you ""Tough luck"" if you email them about problems with the game. The game breaking glitch that forced me to start from the beginning again was originally reported on the Fable 2 forums back in 2008 and it is now 2011 with no fix. Since you can not have multiple saves and the game autosaves, these glitches will ruin your experience if you are unfortunate enough to have one.. Fable 2 is very conflicting in many ways. Lionhead pushed the boundaries with Fable 2, greatly expanding the world allowing greater freedom and exploration for the player. Every location feels grand and lush. From the fields of oakfield to the city of bowerstone; Lionhead paid great attention to the detail of areas in Fable 2 and Albion has never looked better. The story is set a whopping 500 years after the events of the first game. Much has changed and if you've played fable 1 you'll enjoy seeing Albion in a new light. To stay spoiler free I will not be sharing many story details. That being said, in terms of story Fable 2 takes a step down from 1 in my opinion. The main villain in 1, Jack of blades was phenomenal, and his performance wasn't topped in 2. The story is in no way bad, it's very enjoyable and full of amazing moments, unfortunately it doesn't compare to 1. Weapons such as rifles and blunderbusses was introduced in Fable 2. No surprise considering the massive jump in time period. The weapons do not ruin gameplay, but compared to the swords and bows of 1, it just isn't as fun. I find it much easier to sit back and spam the ranged weapons instead of getting in with the swords. Fable 2 was a great sequel to Fable 1 and built off the ideas of 1 and made them better. But the story in 2 compared to 1 doesn't equal.. The Fable games are probably my favorite games and I would say that Fable 2 is the best one. Combat is solid, the world is unique and fun, characters are entertaining and the quests are wonderful. This is the first game I played where I felt like the choices that I made were important. I won't give it away; but I made a choice to give a lot of money to a guy and after a few in game years, an entire town was drastically changed by my actions! If you want a game that can be as dramatic as it can be silly, and you want to have an impact on the lives of every NPC in your game, then play a Fable game, any on of them. But play this one first, it's the best one.. This game, Halo 3, and Spectral Force 3 are the best reasons to get a 360. Everything about this game, the story, gameplay, action, it's all amazing. Buy it now.. I personally love this game with a passion. It always makes me feel nostalgic, while still being an enjoyable experience every time I boot it up. Though it hasn't aged perfectly, I still think it's a worthwhile experience for anybody that loves these goofy childlike fantasy games.. I think this is the best game ever after GTA V/RDR/Fallout. This game is so fantastic, i finished it over 20 times and take a different Hero. Genious conception of dynamic changing of a Hero! I hope we will take PC/Xone remastered port. One of Microsofts best games and franchises ever made. It was games like this that made me love Xbox. Why MS closed Lionhead is beyond me. Huge mistake.. This game is beautiful. The fact of how your actions effect everyone, and everything, that the people react to you based on moral standing, the landscape is beautiful. The dog is amazing, even he changes upon your moral standing. And he does tricks to The fighting system is unique to the Fable series and you will not find anything as unique as these games It's worth buying 10/10 best game you can buy. After years of not touching this game (having given it to a friend who decided to hang onto it forever), I decided to re-download a game I remember loving when I was younger in order to see if it holds up. I was thrilled to find that it did, in fact, hold up over time (for me, at least), despite having played through it several times. As a young teenager, I remember being overwhelmed by how incredible the first Fable game seemed at first glance. After playing it, I was still just as giddy. Unfortunately, however, the experience of playing the first Fable game waned as I tried to play it again. Fable 2, on the other hand, managed to do so much of what the first game did, but added a much greater emphasis on role-playing (by doing away with armour values on equipped gear, for example). And while few things will ever match how I felt the first time I played the first Fable game in the series, Fable 2 maintains the humour and world of its predecessor while adding so much that allows the game a ton of longevity. The fact that almost every piece of armour in the game can be dyed a massive variety of colours is simply fantastic. While I do think there is something to be desired in terms of the range of clothing available (no suits of armour are present outside of the DLC), there is a sizeable variety of clothing options, and this is very nice. The weapon variety matches that of prior games - while one weapon tier has been removed, the addition of multiple guns is a wonderful touch that suits the passage of time since the first game well. There are also plenty of interesting legendary weapons to be found, and using something you might prefer for aesthetic reasons will not damn you to being wrecked by any enemy. On the contrary, this game is rather easy - however, the game's ease does not detract form its quality, in my mind. In terms of the story, the interesting characters and very British humour spice up its good-but-not-great narrative. Characters like Hammer, Reaver (especially Reaver, come to think of it) and your dog (I lied, ESPECIALLY your dog) really bring an otherwise somewhat predictable plot to life. Also, the dog is wonderful. While he doesn't exactly function perfectly (nor does the breadcrumb trailer meant to guide your character to various locations, if I recall correctly), his mere presence is wonderful in an indescribable way. Also also, hitting things is fun! So is shooting them with guns, or blowing them up with magic! There really isn't too much else that I can say here that isn't praise - the series' signature sense of humour is on full display here, what with the hilarious insults the gargoyles (one of the game's collectibles) spew at you and the various murmurs of the townsfolk. I will say, however, that a character maxed out in Strength character looks a bit like a muppet, and that is a bit disturbing. I will say that the game is not overly complex or difficult. However, it is a great time. If you have never played a Fable game, but have a taste for action RPGs and Monty Python, go play this one. I feel the first game is too dated (despite being excellent), and its sequel is far too linear. This game toes the line perfectly, and while some of its mechanics are a little clunky by today's standards (especially in the beginning parts of the game), it will still be a charming experience.. Have recently had the chance to replay this classic game and I can say this was an obvious improvement in every way from the original which was and still is a great game. The sound is as good as in the original and the graphics are improved. Gameplay is just as much fun just better in little ways that are hard to define, simply better. Its a great rpg in which you get to start as a young kid and become a hero. The game is full of adventure and humour equally. Highly enjoyable. Definitely recommended if you enjoy action RPGs with a touch of great humour. If you enjoyed any of the other Fable games you will also love this one as much as I did. #PlayMoreGames. I loved everything about this game except for the very non climatic ending. I played through this game maybe 3 or 4 times, that's how much I enjoyed it. The story was spectacular, the graphics were great for the style they used. This game brings back so many good memories.. It's hard not to get **** into Fable II. The world is so charming and your choices so profound, that it's easy to look past the game's shortcomings. The punishment for death is pointless and the story carries little weight, but the experience is still immensely rewarding. It's easy to lose hours to trivial tasks, and discovering all the secrets tucked away creates a truly memorable adventure. The new ideas presented here may not change the future of gaming, but there are some noteworthy additions that make this feel completely unique. Your emotional attachment to your virtual dog will be real, making you reliant upon his companionship as you trek through these lands. In a game about choices, the wisest one you can make is to play the game. After spending a few hours in Albion, you won't want to do anything else.. This is a game worth playing and buying it's only $10 and the game is fun but around the ending it got kinda boring but still fun the ending is dumb but other than that it is a fun ride the jobs wear alright but the combat is wonderful an the evil and good was not so good but it was realy fun. this game does not deserve its bad ratings. it may be glitchy but it makes up for it with next level gameplay that isn't even seen in most modern RPG's.. Quite frankly, this is one of the best games I've ever played. My reasoning for that is a little unconventional, as at first glance it appears as a technically sub-par game with even a few bugs here and there. That's about all I can say for cons. What's left is a game with an unbelievable sense of personality and charm. It is certainly a solid and very fun, action packed RPG, and I personally spent ages replaying the game and experimenting with various build ideas (as well as buying up every piece of real estate and becoming landlord of Albion). And you have a dog! Your faithful companion never leaves your side, constantly finding treasure for you and helping you kill the baddies. Beyond that however is the humor. Fable II is teeming with some of the most hilarious humor I've ever witnessed, video game or otherwise. It jam packs that most incredibly British, dry-style of humor into ever corner of the game, from main story dialogue to town-folk interactions, and even something as subtle as item descriptions (these are often the best). The dev team's commitment to incorporating this humor to every aspect of the game is staggering, and is nothing short of brilliant. In the end, Fable II is most certainly not a perfectly made game. It has its flaws and those are obvious - but look past these and you'll find one of the most rewarding and colorful experiences in existence.. Fable 2 improves on Fable 1 in some areas but unfortunately in the process it loses a lot of what made its predecessor great. This is definitely a case of one step forward two steps back. Fable 2 offers a bigger world and more content than Fable 1 but nearly all of that content is dumbed-down. Many of the best features of Fable 1 have been completely rebuilt and replaced with something worse. It started off pretty good but quickly became one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. Gameplay was something that Fable 1 did exceptionally well. The magic system was intuitive, diverse and extremely fun to use. Each spell in Fable 1 was unique and offered a different pros and cons. It was also fun and rewarding to power up those spells. The magic system in Fable 2 is generic by comparison, most of the spells are now far more similar to each other. Fable 1 also did a great job of making you carefully balance your stats and work to get a character that had enough magic point to spam powerful spells. It was a rewarding system with lots of options for different play styles. Fable 2 removes almost all of that. Now you have no magic bar and can just spam every spell endlessly from the start. That makes magic overpowered and largely diminishes the value of leveling up or finding good gear that can replenish your magic. All you need to do is power up 1 spell to the max and then spam it endlessly. Your character also can't die so there is no sense of consequence. Fable 1 had very limited choices but at least there was a sense that those choices mattered, Fable 2 makes every choice feel meaningless. On the plus side there is quite a bit of interactivity with the world this time more than in the last Fable. You can swim now and there are a variety of ways to interact with mpcs. You can get married, have children and buy property which can lead to some funny situations but its all pretty shallow. The emotions bar is expanded but offers little beyond mild fun. Menus and UI are all simple and work pretty well. The Story starts off with an intriguing concept but that's about the only good thing about it. Almost every event and decision has no major consequence. It is boring and generic but worse than that it offers very little sense of progression or sense of accomplishment. Fable 1 didn't have a great story either but at least there was a good sense of progression. I felt like my character was accomplished by the end. With Fable 2 I felt like nothing I did really mattered or impacted my character's development. It was easy to get overpowered very early so by the end I never felt that my character had grown. The story is no worse than your average plat former but for an RPG it is far below average. The world is a big improvement over Fable 1. Every area is far bigger and more open, but it still doesn't stand out as exceptional compared to other games. The visuals are good and a lot of the visual design is appealing and unique. Towns and settlements all pretty well crafted with fairly detailed buildings and a decent variety in settlements. The lighting is good although there are a few places where it is a bit distracting. The characters themselves look a bit awkward, its kind of a caricature looking style but it works well enough. Particle effects are also pretty good just a little bit overdone when you enter into extreme combat situations. Sound design is fine the voice acting is and sound effects are both good but the soundtrack itself is very mediocre. While nothing about the soundtrack stood out to me as bat it sometimes feels a bit out of place. It rarely adds much in the way of emotional impact. Still there are a few good track. The tone of Fable 2 is an odd blend of comic relief with situations that should be serious. The problem is that lopsided tone often took me out of the experience. I found it very difficult to get immersed in the world and story. I never really found myself sympathizing or caring about any of the characters. Overall Fable 2 isn't a bad game, it is still fun to play and on a superficial level it functions well enough. The controls are good. The visuals and sound design are both pretty good. The problem is that gameplay is not rewarding, everything feels dumbed-down. The story is basic and disappointing. There is no sense of progression and most other aspects of the game are generic. Fable 2 like Fable 1 has some really good ideas but fails to really make any of those ideas work really well. My biggest complaint though is that Fable 2 ruins many of the best qualities of its predecessor and that is something that should never happen. The Fable games are unique and I think they offer something that could be really great unfortunately the execution here is very disappointing. I give Fable 2 a 65% Gameplay - 7 Story - 5 World - 8 Characters - 6 Visual Style - 8 Sound Design - 7 Uniqueness - 7 Length/Amount of Content - 6 Immersion - 6 X-Factor - 5. A major step down from the first game. Fable 2 is still a solid game but so much more was expected of this and it didn't deliver anywhere near it. Worth a one time play through at least.. I really enjoyed The Lost Chapters and everything that prevented TLC from being great has been improved here. The user interface needs to be sped up though and my dog doesn't fetch the ball, maybe he's got brain damage, not sure. Other than that I'm really enjoying the game. A lot to do apart from the quests. Fable II is one of the best game and RPG's ever, like a first one! It's very original, awesome story, CHOICES EVERYWHERE! Titan of gaming industry! Still waiting for a PC port. How this is a sequel to the first Fable, I'll never know. The Hero's guild is all but gone - there are no heroes left, no rival to grow up with and train - it's an unnecessary Player vs. the world concept, a world you are not part of. Though it was a decent game, the interaction with NPCs was hollowed out, the lore and books were boring and the fact that you use guns was a step in the wrong direction.. this is a great game. It has everything that makes a game good in my opinion. It has action,adventure,exploration,and guns... cause guns are cool. This is the only fable game I have ever played but heck, it is the best in my opinion.. the game is beautiful rich and just plain fun! i am in love with it and can't stop playing and i recommend it to everyone. The game new pause system is so cool and the map that allows me to manage my real estate it just so handy and i also love the fact that your wife doesn't leave you at random times for no reason. the combat is just plain fun and the quests and story just pull me in all i can say is that this game is great go buy it now!. Played it as a kid, I loved it, didn't play the first one though so I can't really compare it to that, but I do have Fable 3 so compared to that is freaking amazing. This game is way too short. Several great ideas, like the ability to purchase properties to bring in a constant income, are negated because (a) the games too short for that to have a positive impact, and (b) at some point you won't know what to do with that excess money anyway! People talk about Fable's charm, and while I somewhat see that, sometimes it just boils down to fart jokes and constant flipping the bird. That's not charm folks; that's child's play. Combat is somewhat more enjoyable than the original, but that's not saying much. For a game that prides itself on choice, you really only have two impacting choices in the game: be good or be evil. The story if lackluster, which is typical of all Fable games. The characters are a little more interesting. It's just not enough to keep you hooked. I struggled to finish the game, which is terrible considering how short it is! Some of the mini-games are fun though. I'm not sure I'd recommend any Fable game, and after this one I didn't even try the third (although I hear it's more of the same). Look elsewhere for fun RPGs.. This truly is an amazing game. The graphics are very good, as is the superb melee combat, which is brilliant. This is, in my opinion, the best Fable in the franchise. There seems to be an unlimited amount of things to do. Plundering, saving lives, hunting monsters, thieving, and exploring the vast expanse of Albion; one of the best open world's ever. Sure, the interactions are still too cheesy and stupid to take seriously, but when my boy ran into a cave on his own, I actually got scared. And obviously, the RPG elements work extremely well. And the entire game is extremely well done.. Fable II is a fun, enjoyable experience for any RPG lover. I think this game really shines with the combat. The melee combat is very good and the movements are very fluent, the ranged attack is quite simple, and the magic system is also simple and works quite well. I enjoy the setting, it seems more fantasy like than other RPGs but the story isn't the greatest. The story is to just find the other three heroes and take revenge on the antagonist, Lucien; I also think the ending is kind of anti-climatic. To me the story and world seems a little linear and there's not a whole lot of free roam except traveling to towns to do various activities like buying property or working a job, which is fun. This is a great game that I find to be more for gameplay value rather than tuning into the story, so it's still a very fun game.. I was thoroughly impressed with this video game. While it wasn't perfect I found the experience to be very enjoyable. There were lots of customizations, challenges, and various tasks to do. The sense of humor also helped the game immensely. I thought that was a large part of its appeal.. The main downfall with Fable 2 is, in my opinion, the fact that it is a victim of it's own success. Fable: The Lost Chapters was stunning, but Fable 2 was far less impressive. However, it was, by any stretch of the mind, a worthwhile game for the franchise. The story, I personally found, was slightly deeper and more innovative than the original, with three heroes who must come together to defeat the current ruler of Albion. The game takes place in what appears to be around the 1700's. The regions are far more expansive than it's predecessor, an","the first game in the series was released exclusively on Xbox in 2004 . the second game, which came out in 2008, still hasn't been released on PC 16 years later . i highly recommend this game to anyone who has an Xbox ."
397.Rez Infinite,"Good shooter with great design and music to relax. No characters, no story.. Played it for 20 minutes. I don't see much value in the game. It looks like a space invaders , just moving across this virtual space while you aim and destroy the enemies.. Awakening Cryptic and brief the plot is, what I could recall is that in an unspecified time in the future the world has become overpopulated by humans, and for this reason, humans have kind of migrated to a virtual place that is not called the internet but it's basically the internet, and for unspecified reasons the rate of crime has been increasing in an alarming rate. To retaliate this crime symptom, humans developed the Project-K system to take care of this issue, the system it's managed by Eden, the most advanced A.I. ever created, many assume that it has developed self-consciousness of some sort, however, given the flow and speed of information Eden needs to process it has become overwhelmed by it, and because of its presumable self-awareness, it is starting to shut itself down. The objective of the game is for you (an unspecified floating body that shoots projectiles and can evolve into ""higher"" forms) to travel to the core and find what is going on with Eden. Creative State Rez Infinite's gameplay is at its core mainly an on-rails shooter, you start as a humanoid body flying in Matrix-like stages filled with conceptual enemies and places, you can't move your character but you can rotate your aim to a full 360 degrees, you can also shoot many of the projectiles thrown at you to avoid damage. Unlike many shooters where you have to be more precise when shooting, in Rez it's preferred to lock on enemies (maximum of 8) and let the trigger go to ""kill"" them with some manner of rhythm, this leads us to one of the key selling aspects of Rez, it's music. Each of the stages of Rez features a unique track by a different musician, all of their songs are unique but felt part of the same universe. At the beginning of each stage you start with only the barebone rhythm of the music, maybe just a bass beat to go along, but as you defeat more enemies and fill your evolution gauge (basically your health bar) the music starts to gain more complexity, along with that the vibration of your control that has been exquisitely calibrated to go with the rhythm as well, so it's impossible to even for a rhythmless person like me not enter in a semi-trance state and to the very least tap your feet at music's compass, so the better you play the game rewards you with a better ambiance to keep playing well. I can't think of many games that achieve this feat, only a handful of them, and half of them are by the same creator, so he knows how to infuse music into your brain. Rez Infinite synergy between music, senses, and gameplay is nothing short of genius. Contrary to many shooters, the difficulty isn't punishing (although losing means starting from the beginning of the stage) but, I don't think the challenge was what they were looking for, after all, there is an option to play every stage without worrying yourself to get in a failure state and just relax and have a trance session of some sorts. To trade-in for the easy difficulty, the game offers several modes and challenges that add to its replay value, things like “if you hit X quantity of enemies you’ll be rewarded certain mode”. Given that it has a brief campaign (around 2 hours depending on your shooting skills) it’s possible to unlock a mode where you play all the stages but in a single run, meaning that if you lose to the final boss, you’ll have to start from the beginning, as stated, Rez isn’t a hard game by shooter standards but this will add up some challenge or a perfect excuse to play its addictive gameplay. Creation The State of Art For this re-release, a new stage called ‘Area X’ was developed that serves as some type of follow-up to the original base game. It features PS4 gen visuals instead of PS2 so it looks pretty pretty (the original game looks beautiful but, you get it), it also has a fairly new control scheme where it’s possible to move around the void and follow enemies or run away from them. To me, what makes Area X quite good is its music, composed by Hydelic, it is more in the vein of Genki Rockets work on Child of Eden (a sequel (maybe) for Rez) and, it appeals more to my current musical sensibilities and tastes, it is a brief experience but, it captures and enhances the “Rez” experience quite well. Starlight Infinite At first glance, Rez Infinite might look like a pretty game with not much depth in its waters. But looks may be deceitful as it has some things to say within its cryptic narrative and, also from a mechanical point of view it is truly marvelous with all its creative and artistic decisions. Its difficulty and the short campaign will surely be a letdown for some but, making that aside, it is a truly wonderful experience that is hard to find elsewhere. It is the perfect game to enjoy on a Thursday evening after a busy day, just you, maybe a beverage or another type of funky thing, and the ever-growing as it was living being beating of the rhythm.. it is my first music game that i played.I love it is the best. pretty difficult. Mad soundtrack & good use of VR. Wouldn't say it's highly replayable but fun while it lasts. I have to be honest... I never understand the love. The music and graphics were great, but the gameplay is just mediocre (although to be fair very few ""art games"" have good gameplay, the focus is always in the artstyle). You have to lock on on the targets instead of actual shooting, and the controls for doing this feels so clunky, and you dont even had to follow the rythm to win, just be quick to alternate between lock on and release the button or mashing it like crazy. In boss battles this is even worse because sometimes you can get shoot by behind and thats cheap. Is like they combined a 2d rail shooter using the 3d enviroment to the actual gameplay and it doesnt feel well. Also later stages doesnt introduces new mechanics and feels repetitive, along with the story, that haved potential to be interesting, but just ends. The game also have so much lack of content to be so expensive (on PS4 at least). Sure, you have a lot of game modes, but some of them are just the same as the adventure, just with a score or slighty changes. Also, no coop multiplayer? Thats a shame for an arcade style game. On dreamcast i can forgive all of its flaws maybe, because is more like a novelty/experimental game on a very old hardware, but the other newer ports is the same thing, just with better graphics. I also was hopping that Area X saved the game because all people said that was the best part and it feels unique and a masterpiece... But i wasnt so impressed. Sure, the visuals were excellent, but the mode took like 10 minutes and the gameplay i think is even worse because you can move it, but the mechanics are still the same, it doesnt feel like a well translation to 3d. Also, is very easy to hit invisible walls and much more when you going backwards. There´s no clearly indication of the game limits. I prefer much more the normal game mode, because at least you dont have to move a character. Oh, and something i forget to said is that you cant change the crosshair sensibility, it would help A LOT. So.... yeah... Rez Infinite... not that great. It could be okay, but it ends being pretty bad. Even the graphics that are one of the highlight of the game werent that great either because the draw distance is very low and all of the objects are low poly basic forms that looks like if it was the first 3d game ever made. If i was reviewing this game for the PS2 or the Sega Dreamcast i could give it a 5/10. But Rez for the PS4 gets 4/10! Well, at least is better than Journey just because there´s actual gameplay.. Well-executed rail shooter. Should have had checkpoints before the bosses, it's not fun to play through whole areas all over again just because you didn't catch on to the boss's patterns immediately on your first try.. I wished i didnt have an idiot as a president, because this must be incredible in VR. Area X especially. Its gorgeous enough in the normal TV set, I can only imagine the wholesome experience with the VR goggles. But it was a pretty fun experience nonetheless.. Graphics and sound interaction are interesting and after a little bit I got into the game. However, area 5 of the normal game is poorly designed. There's an easy section that takes about 5 minutes and is interesting the first time you go through it and then a boss fight split into multiple stages. Unfortunately you have to waste your time going through the easy section again to get to the boss fight if you fail any of the 4+ stages of it, which made it feel like unnecessary grind. Area X is an enjoyable short additional piece to the game. Reasonably enjoyable, but no replay value from my personal point of view (although I appreciate lots of others would disagree).. Never forget, never forgive! #BoycottEnhance #BoycottTetris #FTetsuyaMizuguchi #FtheEpicGamesStore #FEpicGames #FUnrealEngine #Source2ForLife #FTencent. It just feels old and last-gen. Child Of Eden was better on PS3. Only recommended at a discount and worth checking out only if you're a video game enthusiast.. I've played Rez a couple times before without vr but it is definitely worth playing again in VR. Very cool.. Rez has been remade a few times now since debuting on the Sega Dreamcast/PS2. It's still an amazing shooter, and it's best played in VR -- also features a made-for-VR final level.. Rez Infinite seems grossly over-rated when compared to the awesome selection of PSVR games available now but I guess the reason for the high ratings was because it was one of the first VR experiences that showed the potential of the medium. It seems very archaic and too simple in its design, art style, and gameplay. The visuals weren't amazing compared to games like Thumper; they were just alright. The gameplay is very simple and pretty boring. Its more of a relaxing experience to have but I dont think it should receive a rave review at this time in the PSVR's cycle. There's other games that are a lot more immersive than this title. I was pretty disappointed with the game/experience even though I bought it for 50 percent off. It felt more like a very dated tech demo.. Rez: Infinite is a VR version of an old rhythm shooter. As far as adapting old games to this new medium Rez is a pretty good candidate. Seeing the levels in VR feels good and the one new level is the best part of the game.. Rez (Area x) is one of the most immersive vr experiences you will ever have. This is a must buy. Even if this is not your kind of game you would normally go for, try it, it's amazing.. This is a very good rhythm based shooter with incredible graphics and art design. The world feels amazing in VR and goes to show the power of the new technology.. What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said? While most people tend to focus on Area X as being the main draw, as someone who has loved REZ from the very first Dreamcast release (something I actually went to the trouble of importing in the states because the US version was a no-show) The title is the complete package in so many ways. Firstly, it's a much. Hire fidelity experience than the HD re-release that came out for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 a few years back, it supports PS4 Pro, it features unique vibrations support that amplifies the tactility of the musical side of things, and of course it is the most content complete and the most rewarding PlayStation VR experience out there. Some people balked at the 29.99 price point, but you would be doing yourself a disservice not to pick up this game. Rez Infinite is THE reason to own a PlayStation VR, and as it stands it is worth every penny.. I had to create account just to review this game. I bought Rez Infinite as it has got so many good reviews. How disappointed I was! Basically all you have to do is to lock the target and shoot. The game mechanics are straight from 80's C64-games. Avoid this piece of turd.. This game is pretty overrated in my view. Each of the five main levels is enjoyable and the music is good. I completed most of them first try though and there is little replay value. Area X was billed as giving the player complete freedom and a new experience everytime, when in fact its not. You can now navigate the character but its easy to find the walls of this world, in the end every playthrough is basically the same. The visuals and soundtrack are impressive and immersive, unfortunately the title is just too short and repetitive to make this game anything more than average.. I can not understand how someone would rate REZ with anything above a 3. The game is boring and all you do is lock on targets and let go of a button. Visually there is not much to like unless you enjoy wire-frame. This is one of the worst games for PSVR. Try the DEMO, see how bad it is, and ignore the bias reviews.. Upon finishing area 5 my entire body was trembling, shivers gliding up and down my spine, my hands sweaty from gripping the controller with all my strength, Rez changed me. What starts a simple beat grows into a beautiful orchestra of sound, with you as the conductor. It's a little expensive, but it’s worth it, I never had the chance to play Rez before, but it truly feels like this is the best way to experience what was already a memorable game.. Area X is marvelous. It is so sad that this game only contains only one new level exclusive for PSVR. Area 1-5 is good but not as good as Area X. I will only give a 6/10 or 7/10 for this old-school arcade game in 2016. I have also tried the game on TV mode and will guarantee you VR mode is a very different experience.. One of my favorite games of all time has come to PS4 with enhanced graphics, game modes, and even PSVR and PS4 Pro support! Un-Flippin' believable. Perfect 60fps goodness where both PS2 and Dreamcast versions fell flat, smoother and more vibrant textures where RezHD (Xbox360 Downloadable title) didn't go the extra mile. Doesn't look like it's aged much at all, maintains its full body and flavor like a fine wine. On top of it all, they are only charging $29.99 for it on the PS store. Get this. Now. Why are you still here?. Masterpiece game in its glorious edition. Must buy for every PS4 user. Unending replayability with great visuals on screen and with a Playstation VR set.. I played the original on ps2 and love this version. It's in HD and VR compatible. It's not just a port of an old game. The levels don't look the same to me at all. There's also an additional mode that's included here that uses the same play mechanics and manages to feel just new enough. The visuals are great. This game is great with or without VR. Along with Thumper, this is really the most fun I've had with the PS4 in a long time. These 2 titles beat out all the other launch titles by being proper full length games with engaging mechanics. The negative reviews seem written without playing the game.. The game is fun to play, but is too short for the price, in 5-6 hours you have it completed. Also it is a pity that you can't purchase in shops(only in their site, and for more money plus sending costs) the physical edition of the game. All the lights and sounds are beautiful, especially the X-Area. It has been my first game to buy for VR and I have enjoyed. I haven't played Rez before. I have played all game stand up and I didn't got sickness at all.. jogo é otimo , bela campanha , gráficos excelentes, ambientação extraordinária , multplayer primoroso, o melhor jogo da franquia. as avaliações ruins dos usuários abaixo é tudo dos sonystas chorões. game is actually really beautiful campaign, excellent graphics, extraordinary ambiance, exquisite multplayer, the best game of the franchise. the bad reviews of the users below is all the sonystas whiners.. If you've never played Rez before, where have you been, it was a brilliant dreamcast game. However, that was 16 years ago, and nothing seems to have really changed about this game since then to warrant it costing £25, i'm sure Rez HD on the xbox 360 was much cheaper than this. This is just a simple PS VR cash in, and not a very good one at that. Other than a lovely headache, there's not really anything you get out of playing this in VR that you just get playing in on a normal tv with the lights off and the volume up. If you've purchased PS VR you want experience thing you can't experience by other means. Rez Infinite, you totally can, and have been able to for 16 years. It was a good, if not slightly overated game back in the dreamcast era, but games are alot better now",creative state Rez Infinite's gameplay is at its core mainly an on-rails shooter . you start as a humanoid body flying in Matrix-like stages filled with conceptual enemies . each of the stages of Rez features a unique track by a different musician .
399.Fallout,"One of my all time favourites! The games has great storytelling, good leveling system, enjoyable combat and all in all amazing post-apocalyptic atmosphere. However the graphics didn't age well and you should avoid the censored version (1.2).. What a game, man. Before heading into, I knew it was classic and it has an odd time limit. After finishing the game, finding a water chip doesn’t bother me that much because 150 days is just enough for getting it, even if you’re playing the game so badly. Also, for once, you can supply your vault through water merchants in Hub and add 100 days more to countdown. Now I can say this wasn’t most impressive thing in the game. There is only 3 obligatory mission in the game. Overseer wants 3 thing, mainly. To reach the ending, really, just you need to go to Necropolis, Mariposa Military Base and the Cathedral, of course. This is amazing because most of the RPG games entails you, to do missions. To form the bond with story. I’m not saying it is a bad method, but why someone needs to drag me into some other things to reach the goal. If they were optional and I liked the world, I would do that anyway. This is the case for Fallout, definitely. There are 12 locations in the game and devs tried to connect everyplace through side quests. And results of some of those will have an affect on main quest arc. There is no level scaling in the game, also. Let’s say with some aid of Super Mutants, you can reach Military Base, and Lieutenant. To see, how hard the challenge will be. Yeah, in some point, I escaped the outside of Base, and hoped that Guard will miss. Of course, the game is chance based but I’m sure, you don’t want to get into a fight with nearly 0 chance of winning. And lastly, I love the evils in the game, both Lieutenant and Master. Especially when you heard the story of Master from Harold. I feel bad for him. You can terminate him with argument but it was pretty rough on him. That disclosure was painful to watch. So I’ve decided to activate the nuke in the Cathedral with Lieutenant’s Key after eliminating him. Damn. Sorry Master, once again.. Accidentally left a review while scrolling through the page! Metacritic doesn't allow you to delete your 'review. ('ve now just copy-pasted an average score.). Timeless classic. Isometric RPG that was basically essential to start the whole genre.. Unfortunately, it's a game that's too dated to be played anymore. It needs a remake or a remastered version.. Let us begin by saying that for me this is easily an 8.5, but alas I am incapable of giving such a marking, a shame that it will remain as an 8. As a seasoned player of RPG, especially CRPG, I must say that playing this feels a bit off. I am, clearly, aware of the age of the game and the limitations that the game had while it was being developed. Still, I found the game a bit lacking in the gameplay side, I know that there is a lot of depth with other types of combat but I played it as I play all the Fallouts: melee. The story was fine and it had a lot of twists that if you have the time and patience to play the game slowly across, for example, thirty hours, you would find a very detailed game with a multitude of options. I wish I could say more, but unluckily I rushed the end as it was dragging, I reiterate that if you take this game calmly, you will fall in love with it. Bed encounters: 0/10 Melee combat: 0/10 Fallout lore: 10/10. I bought both of Fallouts in the store as a collectors edition, and boy, that night got me hooked. And that was around when i was in high school. The best aspects for that time and now, is the dialogue, plus some moments that wasnt in the all time serious plus the satirical moments the game had. The main story is good/ok but the best part of it is you dwelve in to the lore and get to know about the alternate world we are set in. The voice acting is good, specially they used some actors that you will recognize, there are goofs and a lot of easter eggs. Plus using the vats to target each part even the Groin area the npc's have always a snarky comment, even its hilarious when you set the intelligence in to the lowest setting where the dialogues do drastically change. The mechanics are a mix bag depending on how the gameplay goes, and the turn based system is not perfect nor bad. Plus inventory management got also its own curse no matter who owns the franchise. As to the graphics, this is where the curse of the franchise begins... even it got great moments where you see the neat details in each game but you play it today, it doesnt age well. As to the sound, music slash ambient music, this game nails it, all games do. Each with their own creations it does have the vibe where you get to hear the creepy vibe of a post nuclear world. Really enjoyed my short time going through this one, kind of remarkable how much of the gameplay and atmosphere carried over to the later Bethesda entries. Yes, its hard to keep track of quests and tasks and the combat encounters vary from incredibly ez to literally impossible with no good middle ground. But the setting and characters are still fun enough that I enjoyed my time.. Not too much to say. It's hard to go form the more recent and accessible entries in the genre like Disco Elysium or Divinity Original Sin to this, but once you get the hang of it, it showcases some early strengths.. This has aged poorly in my view. Poor graphics aside due to the age, the story, dialog and role-play aspects are super-thin, and combat and exploration is cumbersome and boring. I only played until I reached the Hub, then I gave up. I didn't have a single memorable moment so far. The best aspect of the game is the atmospheric music, which must have been groundbreaking at the time. Apart from that, it lacks all the character and atmosphere of the later games. I didn't feel like I was in a post-apocalyptic dystopian world. More like the deserted landscape of the American West.. This is my childhood, remember how cool this game was to play, and the story.. Love it! The whole time I’m watching, I’m playing it out as one of the games in my head! They’ve done so much to incorporate as much of the world of Fallout into the show! From the music, to the excessive gore to the Mini Nuke for sale and on display in Ma June’s shop!. A classic game that's somewhat dated but essential for understanding its world. A must-play for fans of the genre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. if you want to play old school Fallout - play this one, Fallout 1, and if you liked it - play something like Fallout New Vegas after. skip Fallout 2 -for all ""bigger"" things none is better original, and most is simply worst. Fallout 2 vs Fallout 1 is like F3 vs FNV: - F1 and FNV are good rpgs, good stories and storytelling, while F2 and F3 - dorky downgrades of Post-apocalypses, with idiotic quests, stories and strained out-of-places attempts of humor.. The story is great, and the characters are amazing, same with the antagonist. I liked the time limit; it made the game challenging in a good way. Some of the mechanics did Feel a bit outdated, but I can not hold that towards it. It's a fun game, and I liked it.. Pure perfection. A very revolutionary game that pioneered a certain kind of design philosophy that other studios often attempt to replicate, which already speaks volumes about its quality. The focal point of the design is player agency and the game rarely forces you to take any specific approach to the challenges and dilemmas it puts forth. Another strong point is the immersive soundtrack, which contributes to the unique, depressing setting.. A must try game for anyone who hasn't played it. Turn-based combat with gruesome, brutal death animations. The gory, extreme gratuity of the violence was at odds with the happy-go-lucky retro-futuristic 1950s vibe of Vault-Tec's propaganda. Does a very good job of making you feel like you are always in danger. Bullets are scarce and expensive for a lot of the game, and you feel weak/insignificant for many levels. I don't note this as a bad thing, it just means once you break through into the hardest areas of the map you'll appreciate why trying to come here immediately was a fool's errand. Nothing in the game is specifically gated off, but trying to approach an end game location at low level is incredibly dangerous and combat is not an option to proceed. It's a fun, wacky, gruesome game. Funny and serious, gross and beautiful. All these years later it still retains so much of it's charm, it's so, so hard not to like.. First of all the game isnt for everyone, since its really old school, and some people who need hand-holding because they cant read or follow directions, or just explore the game world, this game isnt for you so just go away and go play your assasins creed or whatever, you mongoloids play, back to the game tho, its really good, it has a interesting game world, and good voice acting. its a turn based rpg so some people wont like it, but the game is great so atleast try it.. Grim but charming, an inventive and interesting world. Some of the best RPG elements ever.. Gameplay: UI is not very intuitive, but with some help from google you will be able to figure the controls out. Solution to the quests is sometimes pretty random. Be prepared to google step by step guides espesially in the end. The combat has some good parts but overall kinda meh. All weapons work exactly the same so there is no point playing anything else than burst assault rifle and plasma rifle. Be prepared to save before any encounter, sometimes a random enemy deals a critical hit for double your max hp. You can't do anything about it, just load your safe and beg for better rng. If you don't care about side quests / story / lore then this is not the game for you. 3 / 5 Visuals: Very outdated to a point where the low resolution is problematic to the actual gameplay. You can't see items on the ground unless you move cursor over them (and good luck cuz they are like 5 pixels wide). From artistic point it fits very well. 1.5 / 2.5 Story: Actually the strongest point of the game. Although this game has only one ending, the choices you make slightly shift it (so it's different shades of the same ending). 2.5 / 2.5. I was not expecting to like this game at all, even though the Fallout Universe is one of my favorites. The reason being that I generally don't like turn-based games, nor the isometric style. However, the original Fallout game is absolutely amazing. The tone of the story is a bit different than what I'm used to (Bethesda style), but still captures the essence of Fallout that I love. It's amazing to me how a game this old still holds up well in this modern age of gaming.. I'll start by saying the story and the world of Fallout 1 were incredibly captivating. It was really thought provoking, and it depicts a post nuclear world so authentic to the point it leaves uncomfortable feelings. Do you like games where you can immerse yourself in the story, and your decisions have an impact? Look no further. If you're interested in the Fallout Franchise this is the perfect place to start, if you have some tolerance for older games. [STORY]: As mentioned above, this game has one of the best stories I've experienced, you'll be finding yourself searching the wiki and diving deeper into the lore. Different playthroughs can differ from each other, whether you are skilled in Speech or have high Intelligence decides a lot this game. The storytelling is awesome as you start with one important main quest, and during the course of solving this problem, you get more and more information about a far greater threat. Almost every dialogue has a lot of options to choose from and makes it easy to really play your role, it just feels so alive even If this is such an old game. [GAMEPLAY]: Very simple, point and click to navigate everything, but it takes some time getting used to it. Combat is turn based, and half of the fights can be really tough, where you really have to stop and plan every Action Point you spend this round. It's tough because you are not stronger than another beings with comparable gear. Every fight can be really close until you get better gear. So in the early game it was really hard to survive, but once you acquire some of the best weapons you really begin dominating and this change is really rewarding and satisfying. Investing Skillpoints in: Lockpick, Repair, Science, Speech and Sneak has a great impact on your game and will change your solution to every quest. This feels so huge. Be really careful talking to NPC's because everything you say could change a lot in your playthrough. Have you threatened someone in the Hub's Downtown? You may need help from this person later on, and you may regret it. There are a lot of outcomes to every problem and situation and it's fascinating and entertaining to think about. There are some cons of course: - you have to save a lot, there are gamebreaking bugs and you're likely to encounter them. - you could play it without a guide, and it may be the most interesting riddle to solve ever, but I believe this will take too much time, I recommend a guide when stuck! - the story is so good and big, but the ending came kinda abruptly for me - it takes time to get into the groove of this game since inventory management, bartering and movement is bit outdated but when it clicks, it's quite good! TLDR; If you're a fan of cRPGs, this is for you. Fallout 1 has a captivating story and thought-provoking world-building. The gameplay is simple but challenging, and the choices you make have a real impact on the game world. It is a bit dated, and it is a bit of a slow burn, but it's worth sticking with. The story gets better and better as you play, If you can get past the graphics and the bugs, you'll find a rewarding experience.. One of the major cornerstones of all CRPGs, is great freedom of choice, and a great ending subverting your expectations(in a good way) You can finish the game never engaging in a fight just by sneaking around or talking your way out of trouble. Great game.. Even changing the role system from GURPS to their own at the last moment, the developers managed to make a great game, precessor of many.. 90's RPG to its finest. There are some weird things happening every now and then, like, some companion shooting you and Dogmeat to death, but either way it is a very compeling story with very intriguing setpieces.. Although this is a cult game and debuted over 20 years ago, I decided to check out this title quite late and I can only say one thing ... it was really worth it. The atmosphere is really very cool, as well as the presented world. A lot of decisions that actually affect the ending, although as you know, only some choices are canonical, but I still recommend it.. Still awesome .. That Fallout started everything. I really like the role-playing component and the story. How the world works, how lore writing. The game is very variable, extremely adult, companies is something (i really love them). You can even side with the enemy. Where else is it possible? The gameplay is a masterpiece. Truly my most favorite fallout.. My favorite game of all time. The role-playing part is AMAZING, the choices are so so numerous, exploration is very interesting, the game setting is perfect, and it is economical - it is not filled with any superfluous stuff.. Fallout's unrivaled commitment to giving freedom and consequences for every action makes it a transcendent roleplaying experience.. The best Post apocaliptic RPG of all time. Great full auto firing mechanics! Great ironic, sad, crazy story and encounters. Great characters. And War, war never changes.. The first time Fallout was 4, but when I played this one I had never seen its previous gameplay, this one has good graphics (I usually say that they are low because I am playing with PC gaming), and the turn-based RPG is fair, I'm just saying that Since the story is still progressing and I have no other opinion on the game, sorry, but it was a good idea to have played it.. I understand that when this game was released it must have been a watershed but I will do my analysis based on my experience in 2022 thinking about who like me wants to start in the saga. The graphics are an obstacle, because in addition to the character model being dated, the scenarios make it difficult to experience, because many things are hidden, not because they are a secret, but because the low quality prevents you from finding the item, characters, and objectives. Many times I looked on the internet where a character was, and in fact he was ""hidden"" on the inside of the wall that didn't show. The gameplay is interesting with an action point counter in battles and MANY different ways to assemble the character, avoiding the obvious melee and range, but being able to make stupid characters which completely changes the interactions. In addition, your choices directly interfere with almost everything in the game, from killing everything and everyone to not killing anyone. This freedom is very impressive. The backstory is interesting, but the protagonist's is very superficial. But the way it happens without directing it in an obvious way is pretty fun. I had a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing major. I recommend it for those who have an open mind for dated systems and old graphics, to be able to know the saga as a whole, even more so because it is possible to buy it almost for free. 55 out of 100. The first time I tried to play this game, I left it pretty quickly because it felt very archaic and outdated. A complicated control system, where you need to press ten keys in turn to perform one action. Inconvenient trading mode, where you need to manually calculate the amount, slows down the gameplay quite a lot. When I did try to go through it again, I did it in one breath. The incredible atmosphere of the post-apocalypse and the well-developed game world is entirely engrossing and gives an unforgettable experience. Unique customization of the protagonist's character allows you to play the game every time like the first time. Extraordinary sudden events always bring surprises and an element of unexpectedness. Although the graphics are in an old-school style, various unique animations have been etched in my memory for a long time. A fascinating and exciting story makes you think for a long time before making this or that choice. This is the rare case where the words and motivations of the final boss actually make sense and his position seems justified from another point of view. Definitely a legendary game and the best in the entire series.. The OG. A concise vision, executed to perfection. The '50s retro sci-fi, the story, the atmosphere. All packaged in what might be the quintessential cRPG.. This game is awesome, i can't decide where to start. Fallout is one of the few role playing games where your decisions actually matter. unlike fallout 4, where the story is set up and can only choose from 4 endings. this game combines all the core ingredients to combine the ultimate game. and it executes it damn well.. This game is a milestone in gaming history. It started a legendary series of role playing games. My score is 8 but if I could i would give 8.5 but it isn't worth of a full 9. This game aged and it had some problems. It isn't very easy sometimes to figure out the direction and some fights can be really tedious. This is a different way of making games. The setting was way darker than the recent ""Fallout 4"" even if all of the five main games are pretty dark and sometimes creepy.. This game doesn't need introductions. Ironically, back in a day, I almost finished it after Fallout 2. I was surprised the game was shorter, simpler. The limit of the Vault's survival was annoying. But I liked the endings (multiple decisions - storm, hack or convince). Back then I didn't care and tried to kill everything that moves or attacks me. Unfortunately, the game had a bug with the computer in the Mariposa base. So, I finished the game several times later. From the 1997-98 perspective, the game is just awesome and super interesting. It is simplified compared to Baldur's Gate but more convenient and flexible. The only problem was missing the shots (DND legacy). So, you really need to think about how to build a char. Pros.: - Awesome setting. - Variety of choices (even though, they are simple). - SPECIAL system. - Endings. Affect of your actions. - Weaponary. Always liked the animation of extermination. - A lot of popular culture references (X-Files, Doctor Who, etc., even reference to Richard 'Levelord' Gray). Cons.: - Missing shots while 95%. - The game is SUPER short. A lot of cut content. And you can feel it. - SEVERE underdevelopment of quests. Even with the Fix patch you still feel that something is missing. It's obvious a lot of content went to Fallout 2. Eh... Good old days.... Without a doubt the most unique game in the fallout series, the atmosphere and story is what really makes this game stand out. I have never played an RPG with such dreading feel to it, a lot thanks to the soundtrak which is amazing. Each town is full of life and interesting sidquests, and the game makes great use of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and skill system for a varied adventure. The only bad thing i can think of this game is that the main bad guys aren't really built up to, they sort of appear out of the blue... But besides that it's an amazing game through and through.. One of the best games to the series and an All-time Classic. A true Masterpiece ****!. the best and most immersive fallout game in the entire series. the soundtrack is amazing too. flame of the ancient world is the most immersive song for a level ever it makes the ending so much better. this game beats games that come out in 2021 for this series to this day. we are never gonna get a better fallout. maybe that's for the best. masterpieces cant be remade or remastered.. One of the best RPGs ever made. This game really ages well. I love the freedom of choices and its consequences.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best RPG ever. Must play. The atmosphere of the game is depressing but it fits perfectly in this world.. This is the best RPG ever. I played this in 2013 and my initial reaction was like "" what the hell is this game?"". That time I cared only about graphics. But after playing, this was my first RPG, I could never play a bland game like bethesda's fallout 4. Thanks for interplay. You changed my views on gaming. I will make a true fallout series one day, bethesda didnt do fallout any favour. If anything, it made it worse.. This is the first time I have played this game - Getting used to playing an older game like this was, difficult to say the least, trying to get the hang of what to do and when etc. That being said I understand how this game stands as high as it does. It truly is an enjoyable RPG with Hours of Playability, The graphics - it is what it is Story - was fantastic, great to follow along with As a first time player- please return back to this game once it settles in - it is worth a play. Fallout is one of my favorite video games ever made, it is also one of the most revolutionary PC games of the 90's. Its legacy is still relevant. The script is simply perfect; Fallout built upon Wasteland's RPG elements and delivered (in my opinion) the best RPG experience of the late 90's.. Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss and **** MISS! This game would be fun if my character wouldn't miss every single shot! It just makes every encounter very boring and of course enemies do critical SHOT wow! TRICK SHOT OOOOO! shots to me so just because of that I give this game 5/10. Bad game.. I am extremely new to rpgs as i usually only play roguelikes or other casual games . Only a few hours in i am more or less hooked from the atmospheric music to the rustic graphics this game is amazing from a sensual perspective . It does a great job of building a sense of apprehension in the player as the first few times i travelled out side of the vault and the surrounding cave i died . The dialogue is rich and you can spend a lot of time simply going through all the speech options , eager to find out more . It also does a great job of slowly drip-feeding you information about the outside world - filling you with a sense of intrigue . Another small feature i liked was the ask about function which i found to be very useful . Mu main gripe so far is the terribly clunky interface , however , considering how old this game is , I wouldn't consider it too much of a negative as I feel that other elements are far more important .. One of the RPGs of all time. Very good plot with an amazing post-apocalypse **** your choices matter. The fact that you can approach quests very differently makes the game very replayable. started after Fallout 4 for learning about lore, stayed for amazing unforgettable characters. Though learning gameplay takes time and it's not for everyone.. I first saw this game in WalMart. I thought it looked like trash and skipped it. Then word of mouth told me how great it is. Little did I know it would become a pillar for the way cRPGs would develop in the future. I can't stop playing it every few years for that reason. Best with the ""Fallout Fixt"" series of patches available from No Mutants Allowed / Vault-Tec Labs. Check them out!. Hello everyone, I am the Vault-dwelling Gordoth Enodious, a guy who likes clean water, and today I’m talking about the dangers of Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game (dubbed simply Fallout from this point on). Simple review details - metacritic does not like long reviews so check out my tumblr/patreon (gemsimov) for a complete review. Gameplay Fallout is a top down, isometric roleplaying game from a few years ago. It is played, almost entirely, through the use of the mouse, although there are some hotkeys that can be utilized for max efficiency… Even if efficiency is achieved by other means. The game makes use of chance as a defining factor for how situations are resolved, but that does not truly get in the way of enjoyment derived from it. In fact, although chance seemingly affects all interactions the player has with the world of Fallout, it is not so. Chance affects the outcomes of situations, but is not the end-all be-all of the solution. A situation that was going to go badly for the player has an incredibly small chance of going well for them, and the other variables are based on how badly the situation will go - it could be nasty, or it could be horrible. Chance in Fallout is an additive, rather than a multiplicative. Of course, some mechanics are affected by chance at a greater rate than others, but the fact of the matter is that chance does not appear to be as prevalent as one might think it were, initially. That makes the allocation of Skill Points and Stat Points actually mean something. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a roleplaying game has both Skill Points and Stat Points. One would have thought that these did not actually exist, for many a game claiming to be roleplaying games in current times are lacking some of these. At the start of the game the player has a number of points to allocate to their Stats, making their character unique, in the sense that these Stats are not going to be increased by more than 2, even if the player did everything in their power to do so. That means there is a very defining, important decision to be made, right at the start of the game, because these Stats define how easy it is for one’s character to do everything. The character will be better at doing some things than doing others. That makes the character appear somewhat grounded in reality. As in, ladies and gentlemen, the character might even have a flaw! Imagine that, a character who is not the most amazing thing to have ever existed! And having flaws makes characters interesting, even if they have no history of their own, for their failings become a juxtaposition for their successes, and the game becomes more entertaining. A game that is close to 25 years old, but has so much good in it that it still dwarfs the biggest games of modern gaming, is bound to be good, and to have something stellar to itself. Alas, its age is also prone to making it find itself stumbling through territories that were not nearly as well charted as they are now. More on tumblr/patreon 2/3 Presentation Fallout is a game about a world that is so vastly different from what humanity is used to that it is, essentially, a brand new world. How, then, does Fallout bring that world to life? Fallout, in all its glory, has voice acting for EVERY important character… And the voice acting is spectacular. The actors have all done an amazing job bringing these people to life, and even if some sound strange or uncanny, they still fit in this bizarre world that has come about after a nuclear apocalypse. But it is not only Talking Heads that look good. The world itself, having been granted a detailed and rich coat of muted colors, still retains an appearance that makes one think of how well crafted it is, even after all those years. The work put into the creation of the unique visuals, which fit so well with the setting, has, no doubt, been a great effort, and it shows. What, then, can one say about the SOUND of Fallout? Well, one only needs to listen to a single piece of the soundtrack, and they will find themselves IN this dying, almost wholly dead, world. The music by Mark Morgan is stupefying, and borders on genius in its quality. The sound effects are a little unbalanced in their fidelity, some are too loud, others are a bit quiet, some sound strange, others sound just right. More on tumblr/patreon 3/3 Story Best story in a post-apocalyptic game ever. More on tumblr/patreon 3/3 Legendary Point Yes, of course. More on tumblr/patreon Conclusion 9/10. Fallout is a game that should be played by every single person who plays video games, and is an experience that should be experienced by every single person that enjoys gaming. In fact, it is so great, I’d say it would not be bad at all to have it be experienced by all of humanity. Might make them reconsider their course of action. An exquisite piece of art, this is one of the best games out there. More on tumblr/patreon, 5k words bby mode lel. A decent RPG where you can indeed actually advance your character and choose one of many paths through the story.(no). I don't have much to say without ruining the awesome experience that you'll get if you decide to play this pice of art. Is not the best fallout game (that title goes to fallout 2), but is one of the best games I have ever played.. Was a long time Fallout fan before playing this initial game in the series and enjoyed the change in style. RPG elements were great, but the UI was confusing and hard to grasp. I am pretty sure I completed this game without getting the best from it but enjoyable none the less.. It's really good! It's about this bleak world that was destroyed by war you can make choices a thing that was forgotten in the modern fallout games the combat can feel sloppy but it's good and the humour is good too. This game started one of the most iconic game-franchises of all time but it doesn't mean it's perfect, in fact I think this game aged VERY poorly.. A masterclass in how developers should create an RPG. Large open areas, complete freedom to go where you want and the ability to create and develop your character any way you please. Lots of missions which can also differ depending on your skills and reflect nicely on how created your character. Lot's of interesting characters and locations, simple but engaging turn based combat, atmospheric soundtrack and plenty of wonderful artwork. It all makes for an oppressive and bleak adventure that will punish anyone that makes careless mistakes but rewards those that think things through. Easil","the graphics didn't age well and you should avoid the censored version (1.2) this is the case for Fallout, definitely . there are 12 locations in the game and devs tried to connect everyplace through side quests . there is no level scaling in the game, also ."
4.Super Mario Galaxy,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game on the Wii, everything is amazing, the story, the different levels, the planets and gravity interaction are all perfectly handled. The graphics shows what the Wii can do at its best. And the Music to top it up makes it a classic. Super Mario Galaxy gets 31 Wario Points from I, The Wario Enthusiast. This is not a Wario Worthy game. This game is awsome, i played it when i was just a little kid. (aka 5 years old). One of, if not the best game ever created. I am biased and grew up with it. I will admit it has some flaws but those flaws will not change my score.. Super Mario Galaxy is my favorite, if not in my top 3 favorite Mario Games. Everything about this game is so immersive and the Motion Controls feel so good in it and also the graphics, the story, and especially the soundtrack are all outstanding.. Perfection. Nothing more, nothing less. One of if not the best Wii games to ever be created and exist.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game and the best 3d Mario game to date. This game holds up the best out of all the older Mario games. With stunning worlds to explore and great in game mechanics what's not to love.. A fantastic game that ensures a compelling, cinematic, and jaw-dropping adventure throughout the entirety of its runtime. From the serene, atmospheric space junk galaxy, to the grand and picturesque melty molten galaxy, this game has some of the most breathtaking scenes in any video game. This is even more impressive considering it's a 2007 Wii game, they achieved such grand scenes despite the hardware limitations. Not only is this game's spectacle astounding, but so is its level design and mechanics. This game never stays on its ideas for too long, and you'll encounter new mechanics and wacky twists on previous mechanics in most missions. The craziness the game takes its ideas and levels is simply astonishing. You'll go from souring in the desert winds above deadly quicksand to escaping a giant boulder in sand-infested underground to climbing a huge tower with the wind, to running around a labyrinth on the side of the tower in just one level. I have not seen such dynamic levels in any other game, and this is what makes this game such a joy. The boss fights are amazing and fun, the music is beautiful and atmospheric, the game's progression feels satisfying, the enemies are wacky, the ending is cinematic and emotional, especially for a Mario game, and so much more. Despite all of the great things this game does, it has a few setbacks. The first galaxy has the player explore the starting planet, giving the player the expectation that they'll explore more in the game than what's done. You do explore further down the line, but there should have been a few more starting areas like Good Egg. However, I don't think this is a huge deal and the vast majority have not noticed or cared. The boo, spring, and flying powerups are slightly underutilized too, and could definitely have appeared in 1 or 2 more levels. Star bits tend to get redundant later in the game too after you have fed every hungry luma, people tend to have a few thousand leftover ones at the end. Coins are mostly useless. The speed run comets are no challenge because the timer is too generous often having a minute or two left at the end of the stage. The one-ups and extra-life mushrooms are also a bit too generously placed and half of them don't really feel like awards as you'll just find them right in the level's path half of the time. The reward for beating the game with Luigi is very underwhelming and they did a much better job with the reward in Mario Galaxy 2. A small number of its ideas are slightly underdeveloped (not by a huge margin though), like the spring vault, spinning metal screws, ice skating, platforming with tornadoes, floating with flowers, launching cannons, etc. Most of these ideas in general would just need one slightly more developed use somewhere to be perfect. Technically nothing is ever developed to its full maximum potential in any game, but it's important to know when to drop ideas before the game gets too repetitive and monotonous. I think this is what Super Mario Galaxy does right with most of its ideas, a good balance between novelty and development, while just a handful of them needed a tiny bit more. The swimming mechanics could be a little more polished and streamlined. Etc. People tend to complain about the game's linearity but that's not justified. Linear games exist. Open-ended games exit. They're two different types of games offering their own unique experiences and strengths, and not one is better than another. Claiming that a game is bad simply because it's linear is unfair and short-sighted because doing so completely overlooks what the game is supposed to be, and that linearity and open-endedness are two different but equally valid level design approaches. Linearity gives the developer more freedom to create controlled but more involved and interesting levels, while open-endedness sacrifices this for more player freedom. Again, two equally valid approaches offering distinct experiences and strengths. What's possible with a linear game is not possible with an open game and vice versa. Whenever someone criticizes linearity, they're just expressing a personal preference that is masked as ""objective"" because people usually cannot differentiate between subjectiveness and objectiveness. So, a game simply being linear is not a flaw, it's a feature. Going back to the game's actual flaws, despite them, the game is still overwhelmingly great. It's a slightly flawed masterpiece, like any other masterpiece, but oh man is it one of the best platforming experiences to this day.. Best game ever and heres : Movment 7/10 Simplecity 10/10 Music10/10 just sooooo perfect and vibrantStory 10/10 Man these fortnite kids will never know. I can't explain with common words this game. With his semplicity, Super Mario Galaxy is the best Super Mario videogame. The add of the lumas, the new mechanic of the spin and the wonderful soundtracks (combining new tracks made with classic instruments and new instruments with remix of the old tracks from old games) create the perfect symphony of perfection. This game will be forever in my heart. This game is peak gaming. Throughout the whole game it keeps you engaged and post game also gives you a lot. The music is the best thing to hit my ears. Goated game. Extremely good/10. My all-time favorite Mario games of all previous games in the past, including the games that were released before this game.. Very rarely do you find a game so fun, so perfectly weighted and so expertly crafted , but Super Mario Galaxy fits that bill perfectly and is a must play for serious gaming fans. It's not often you can experience such fulfilling and stress free gaming, but Super Mario Galaxy exists in its own world of gaming perfection. Perfect controls, fun enemies, brilliantly designed levels and some highly inventove design make this a game you'll enjoy visiting every few months just to play a few levels just for the hell of it. The only criticism is that the 100% completionists will be pulling their hair out with the huge difficulty of the '1 life' challenges, and that the game is slightly too long.. No matter what you think of this game, you have to try it at least once in your lifetime. It is a true masterpiece. The artstyle is great, the graphics are also great, the music is amazing, and there's just so much that this game has to offer. It is a must-play if you have a Wii or Wii U.. Perfection, the controls feel responsive, the game isn't too difficult or too easy leading for a well balanced game for both younger and older people alike. The art style is absolutely gorgeous. And i believe if you still have your wii somewhere in your closet you should try Super Mario Galaxy either for the first time or your 30th time.. In my opinion this is the ""worst"" 3D Mainline Mario game. It has a really fun and creativ level design, an awesome soundtrack and maybe the best finale in the 3D Mario series. Unfortunately the game is really linear (which makes especially this game worse then it should be) and doesn`t reach the highest highs in gameplay and gamedesing as the other games. It`s an extremely overrated game but still really nice to play. 8,35/10. For me, this continue to be the best Mario 3D Game after Super Mario 64. Incredible campaign and excellent gameplay.. Favorite game of all time just because of the overall vibe wich is incredible like you have the feeling that youre small around all of these planets and galaxies. And the levels are nearly perfect but the big point for me is the soundtrack : now this is perfection because you can take every single galaxy in the game and it will automaticaly have a godly soundtrack (space junk goat btw) and its for me the best soundtrack ever for a video game. In conclusion if you've never play this piece of art, get yourself a wii and have a good time. This is it. As someone who has been trying a lot of different types of gamesin the 3D era, this is it. This is the best game ever made. The best i ever played. It flirts with perfection. The music, the gameplay, the level design. Nintendo really did it, they created the best gamer. I remember playing the game when in came out in 2007, even as a kid, i was already this is the best game ever made. For the following years, whenever i played a game, this game was always in my mind. I had a similar relationshiop with God Of War 3, i always thought it ws the 2nd best game ever made. But after replaying it recently, i discovered a lot of it was nostalgia, i actually like some newer games more. So i thought maybe it was the same for Mario Galaxy but then i ran it on the Switch, now that i'm older, more experience, much more picky butit actually solidified my mind. That's the top 1. Still to this day, 17 years later, still hasn't play a game i deem better. I think why i enjoy this game so much is that it really captures my vision of what a videogame should be. No movie like story, no photorealistic graphics, no overdoing. This game is just pure fun and art. **** sikkim games **** tiranga games ****/ daman games https:/51games.site/ 51 games must try these games and get join bonus. This game is incredibly overrated. The controls are garbage, many levels are designed terribly, and the movement is very slow. I would rather play any other 3D Mario game.. A Game that is truly revolutionary and you can still play It after almost 20 years and still be interesting, truly remarcable. A classic icon to play on the Wii. Perfect for those who enjoy Mario games with good levels. The best platformer game ever made. For the time it was game changing, beacuse of all the depth put into this game and if you say any plaformer is better you are liying to yourself. My fav game of all time and also has the best soundtrack ever. It’s so goooood. Perfection: The Videogame. Just pure joy from start to finish, full of creative ideas, trutly the best game of all time. The OST is epic, the atmosphere for a mario game is yet to be toped to this day,even the motion controls are not bad at all. If I were toplay just game for the rest of my life would be this love letter **** for sure. 10/10 GOAT.. Everything I want to say has already been said about this game. It is the second best 3D Platformer to ever exist(Mario Galaxy 2 being the best). Music is absolutely perfect. Play the game.. Amazing platforming, beautiful graphics, incredible music. This game is true masterpiece and completely timeless. By far my favorite game everything from the ost the level design are great if your a fan of mario or 3d platformers in general this is a must play. The gravity mechanic makes it so that platforming is never boring and the power ups are actually treated as something important to the level. In other words, Mario Galaxy is PEAK!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is such a beautiful game! the audio and all of the mechanics and new powerups are so much fun to play!. Any gamer worth their salt understands the profound amount of ideas and individuality pressed into every enemy, boss fight, level, and galaxy in this game. I'll be telling my kids about some of these. The bumblebee, the boo, the ice, the shell race. All of these are just the powerups. Pair that with exciting level design that continues to test your understanding of these mechanics and you have a game that has to be played to be described.. This is such a take the security game bad bad crap garbage is Mario Galaxy I hate the final boss. Wii fan boys need to chill. Yes, Super Mario Galaxy is a beautiful work of game design that continues to push out idea after idea. But news flash so does every other Mario game that came before and after. I love galaxy, I enjoy the physics, bosses, environments and level design, and weirdly enough story. But is it the best Mario game ever created? In my oppinion no, I think it's been surpassed in many ways, and while as a game holds up well today, isn't all perfect. I played on the Wii with a Wii motion plus controller and still disliked the fact that motion controls are integral to this games core. Not only that, but if you're trying to play this game in 2024, you need to go on ebay and by a used copy of Super Mario 3D all stars and then be forced to play with either broken controller conrtols, or broken joycon controls. Now again this game is leagues ahead of what a AAA game even is today. But it's not the 10/10 best game of all time that many nostalgic Wii fans will tell you. Also arguably Mario Galaxy 2 is better. The music. The sounds. The atmosphere. The World-Design. The Gameplay. This is perfection.. This game is fun thay real did a good jibe on that game nice is one of my favorite. One of the best platformers of all time I have 100% this game twice one on wii one on switch it is a amazing game. By far, my favourite 3d platformer. Pretty much everything about this game is on point, and perfect. From story, to level design, to music, it's perfect. The only thing i can fault it on is controls, but it's a wii game, that's to be expected. Other than that though, one of my favourite games of all time, and the first game i ever bothered to 100%. It's just an OK game that when you introduce it to your parents, they get nausea. It's TOO overrated. I tried it, it was a bit fun, but it gave me nausea.. #How cant this game be so deep in the best game metacritic O_o I mean it's ok, but, nothing more,putting this before half life 1 ?. The game is so good that even the water levels are good. Play the game!!!!. Is this game a 10/10? Absolutely not. Is it still great? I thinks so. It absolutely has a bunch of 10/10 moments, which just makes me wish the whole game would be kept to that standard. Apart from the typically named flaws, namely the inconsistent camera controls, infuriating sound when low on life and overly linear levels, the biggest flaw was the lack of momentum. With the great movement and triple jump this is a big shame since I feel like you often don't get enough space to build up speed to utilize these great mechanics. Never doest this become more apparent than in the (fantastic) final level. This level really shows what this game could have been, amazing flow, barely any tiny round planets, and thrilling platforming. Everything combined, with a killer soundtrack and gorgeous visuals still made for a memorable and fun experience.. My third favorite Mario game after “64” & “3D World” Great fun and level design. Recommended.. This game is simply fantastic. Even though the gameplay, creative bosses and amazing level design are all perfect, it is the music that stands out as the best game soundtrack ever. It is game I want to play for the rest of my life. And it also contains on of the best final bosses ever.. This Game is an Absolute BANGER I played this back when it first came out, and the one word I would describe this game is WOW. The music is on point, the movement is on point, the level design is on point, etc. You will just be really engaged the whole time, and it is just Wow. If I had to give any criticisms, I would say that the game might be a little too complicated for non-gamers. I know when I first started gaming that I struggled with any game with physics, including the original Mario, so using the wii controller and nun chuck will be impossible for someone and I would not recommend this for them haha. But if you enjoy video games, you will love this one!. It's almost hard to believe how much time has passed since the game's initial release. Even to this day, it is the Mario game with the best presentation. While the controls may be a bit finicky, and a lot of the gimmicks fell flat, the game still provides some very engaging gameplay. There were definitely some portions of the game that were stinkers, but usually the levels don't drag on for too long. There was one level that soured my overall opinion of the game, which was Freezeflame Galaxy, which just had some of the slipperiest gimmicks ever. Every single act of that level had some amount of pain behind it. The Star titled ""Hot and Cold Collide"" (the third act of the level) was one that I remember feeling like it punished me for finding a way around its dumb mechanics by jumping in and out of the gate to the Fire Flower to light the torches in the Icy room, only to go back to the area to see what I missed, and it turning out to be absolutely nothing worth doing. Sure, it's my ""fault"" for finding a faster way around it, but the fact that there is nothing else of substance in the rest of the level just felt like such a let down. Did Nintendo somehow not know you can just jump over the gate rather than unlocking it? It's not JUST that level that bumped my score from a 10 to an 8, no that would be ridiculous! It's just that all of the annoyances I had with Freezeflame Galaxy are woven into so many more levels and challenges in this game. Any level involving water was also just the least fun thing ever because, despite Mario's honestly satisfying swimming mechanics, the controls make it a chore to be precise, which is what the game demands of you. Every level which involves a race is absolutely tedious as well, and the constant resetting after you've died makes me appreciate Super Mario Odyssey so much more. Despite my many gripes and frustrations, the level design keeps Mario moving, and the gravity mechanics are very smartly woven into the architecture of the game. The 3D planets make exploration and discovery fresh and keeps you on your toes. The fact that it still feels unique in the gaming landscape is a testament to its innovative power and clever design.. A great game I had my doubts but I booted up Mario 3d all stars I was shocked how well it controlled considering the wiis motion controls but it was intuitive and smooth overall one of the best games of all time I definitely recommend. This is seriously one of the best games. If you have a Wii, or switch, or ANYTHING that can run it, get this game. I cannot describe how good it is... just play it already!. Who wants to feel like they're exploring the mysterious ruins of Space? ...Play this experience. Who wants a structurally effective combo of great gameplay and storytelling? ...Play this experience. Who wants to feel like a kid again? ...Play this experience.. Super Mario Galaxy was an absolute delight to play through back when I was a kid and it remains as delightful as back then. Fun gameplay combined with what is potentially the best soundtrack in video game history makes for one of the best games of all time. It is absolutely the best Mario game ever made.. To be a candidate for the best Super Mario game of all time, you'd have to be a candidate for one of the best games of all time. Super Mario Galaxy is one of those games.. It is one of the best WII Games to ever come out the experience of it is insane. If you can put time into it it will be one of the best game experience you will ever have. I loved that game back then when I was a **** music is so relaxing, the levels are created so nicely,I love this game, whenever I hear music of this game, I just dream myself to sleep. I cant put into words what this game means to me, you can make games look like real life with these advanced graphics in the modern and future consols, but no game will ever touch this masterpiece, the greatest game of all time.. One of the best games know to man. Completely different than the past Mario games and good for all ages. Love it in every way.. GUYS IF YOU READ THE TITLE AS ONLY THE LETTERS WITH A STAR IT SPELLS OUT UR MR GAY HOWWW DID THEY KNOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!. I find this game super annoying that you have to do 3 times the same level and it feels the whole game is the same. Its well made for its time and revolutionary, which is hard to be with a IP like Mario, that has tried so many different things. Classic gaming to game.. by far the best super mario game ever made, i don't think nintendo is going to make something better than this absolute masterpiece.. There is something special with Super Mario Galaxy, like a bunch of interesting and unorthodox ideas encountered each other, to make this masterpiece. There is nothing quite like it in any other Mario game, or anything else I’ve ever seen. The gameplay, while not as enjoyable as the one from Super Mario Odyssey, is still really solid, even by today’s standards, the soundtrack is one of the best I’ve ever heard, and the atmosphere of the game is so unique, this game gives a completely different vision of what space could feel. Truly a masterpiece, and one of the best games of all times for me.. Super Mario Galaxy is the best 3D platformer ever made. Fluid movement and general gameplay, charming - if somewhat dated - visuals, fun bosses and fun, creative levels - all paired with one of the best soundtracks of ANY game. An absolute MUST play if you own a Wii.. One of the greatest games of all time from its compact butinteresting levels to the music to the story and the movement, this game is only topped by Odyssey for Mario games and only a few more games period Absolute Masterpiece. Literally my favourite game of all time. This has the best music I have ever heard, not to mention it's impressive display of atmosphere. All those whining about the controls really don't have a point, it works perfectly with the wii remote. Also, you got a Mario game, and you're complaining about it being to easy? Get Dark souls or something to shut your whiny mouths smh. Enjoyed the game quite a lot. The atmosphere is perfection, and there's a ton of creativity all around. My one gripe is with the controls. They significantly made the game less fun to play.. Super fun, it’s such a unique game with interesting and fun power ups, amazing level designs and fun bosses. my favorite game of all time. i freaking love this game to death. the levels, the characters, the design, the story, the controls... its all perfect. also, Rosalina is top waifu ;3. Super Mario Galaxy, it's practically a staple of the Nintendo Wii. While the system is home to several fantastic platformers. It's safe to say that Mario was the king of the third dimension during the early two thousands. Everyone was talking about this game and its beloved sequel. While I really enjoyed playing New Super Mario Brothers during my childhood, that enjoyment was mainly fueled by my first interactions with the Super Mario franchise. Super Mario Galaxy on the other hand, was thematically rich game in comparison. I adored the ""cinematic space exploration"" theme paired with all the levels. The designs of Bowser's galactic forces, the adorable alien races, the colorful design of each galaxy, it's a near masterpiece of game design. Now don't get me wrong, I really do enjoy this game. But much Donkey Kong Country Returns, I've never found myself dedicated to reaching one hundred percent completion. While I throughly enjoyed playing this game from start the finish, I was against the idea of unlocking everything this game had to offer after experiencing the annoying motion control stages. While they may be few and far between and they're not required to beat the main game, they are required for unlocking the secret final level. And the more I played them, the more I realized I was going to start hating this game if I spent too much time trying to complete the worst levels. With that being said, everything else is utterly remarkable. Freezing waterfalls as Ice Mario in order to perform a wall jump combo, switching between different types of gravity to reach hidden areas, launching out of spaceships like a rocket as they explode in the distance, its some of Nintendo's most inventive level design. The adrenaline you get from dashing from planet to planet will leave you with goosebumps. I'm also personally impressed with how the designers made each level feel so big. These may be semi-linear stages, but the way the camera is positioned makes me feel like a kid in a sports stadium. It really feels like I'm exploring a living, breathing world. It's not just another ""save the princess adventure"", like New Super Mario Brothers. It's also a ""save the universe adventure"". Every time I interact with the peaceful creatures from other galaxies, a part of me feels more determined to defeat Bowser. It's not just about saving old friends, their's an entire universe being threatened by Bowser's forces of darkness that needs defending. It helps him come across as a more threatening villain compared to the previous games. In fact, while I personally believe that Super Mario Odyssey is the superior game, it felt like there were more stakes involved in Super Mario Galaxy. Because Bowser wasn't just attempting to take over the world while kidnapping Peach, he was attempting everything in existence. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's packed with personality and platforming bliss. You're practically guaranteed to find something really enjoyable in this game. Seek it out, when you get the chance.. I can't form into words how outstanding this game is! The soundtrack, the ambience, the gameplay, just the overall atmosphere of this game is the best I've ever seen!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Unrivalled. Truly a creative masterpiece. Whoever had the idea to send Mario to space is a genius. No comments. Any game that introduces some of the best mechanics, visuals, music, and characters in the likes of the Lumas and Rosalina deserves a 10. Played it when it came out and loved it. Played it again recently still amazing.. SuperMario Galaxy will probably always be my fav. Mario game. I played it in my childhood a lot and Super Mario Galaxy 2 was the first game i ever pre ordered (and its just as good as the first one)!. I played this a year ago, and I did not regret it one bit. This game is one of the best to EVER exist from the Mario franchise, because the graphics are great, the controls are great, and the gameplay is great. I love everything about this game, no questions asked.. By far the best 3D Mario to this day. It followed up the worst mainline Mario ever (Super Mario Sunshine) with its best. Its gameplay is absolutely a marvel of game design with the way you navigate the planets.. this is such an amazing game, there are so many levels and they are just so good, and the finale is just a masterpiece, this is my favorite mario game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After playing it when I was 10 and playing it again when I turned 18, I realized it was a perfect game. Feeling nostalgic for the unique galaxies, the music always accompanying you, the unique controls it had, everything was perfect. My thinking about this game from when I was 10 to when I turned 18 didn't change at all, in fact it became even deeper. The fact that this game is so tremendous and you have hundreds of galaxies to explore makes you feel so small, but at the same time so big, which is a perfect combination of two opposite aspects. Plus, the story it has, and the themes it covers are simply amazing for a Mario game. For me, a game that will not only be in my memory, but in my heart and in my childhood.. This is my favorite game of all time. I will never be able to replace the 1st place by another game. Super Mario Galaxy made my childhood when I gained my first video game, Nintendo Wii. And it stills being the most beautiful and melancholic game I've ever played so far. I love Super Mario Galaxy.. Very good please try it i used to play it as kid super raccomanded!!!!!!!!!!. I have nothing but the utmost respect and appreciation for Mario Galaxy and the direction it chose to take Mario. The imaginative themes of every world set my expectations for what is possible in the deep, dark ocean we call space. The use of gravity in every level made for stages and experiences I don't think I'll ever forget. The score is one of my absolute favorite musical soundtracks. Period. Above all of that, however, the tone it holds and the story it chose to tell still amazes me all these years later. A Mario game holding this grand, cinematic energy nearly every way through, with a tale that touches on themes of loss, overcoming insurmountable odds, and finding your place taking care of people you never imagined you'd meet sounds so bizarre for a Mario game, a series known for happy, silly, and cartoony adventures, with plots that rarely step beyond just saving a princess. And yet, through all of that, Mario Galaxy makes it work with such beautiful execution and confidence that I still can't believe it is real. And yet, here it is. As one of the first games I ever played, Mario Galaxy holds a special place in my heart. It was the introduction to what would become one of my favorite pasttimes, whether I'd be playing games, watching other people play games, having discussions over this medium's history, and so on. It's a medium that has given me plenty of frustration, yes, but also given me so many happy memories and allowed me to connect with people, both gamers or otherwise. For all of that, I will always feel in debt to this medium, and the one that got my love for it started all those years ago. It's not perfect, but for me, it's the closest we've ever gotten.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best Super Mario game by far, aged gracefully even in 2024 and is a all around great experience.. i just signed in to say that this game is perfect, the soundtrack, the aesthetic, how the game is gorgeous and comfortable, imo best gamei have ever played. It is simply the most incredible game. As soon as you start in a lovely celebration you can feel the atmosphere and how just amazing and well put together everything truly is. Then one second later you realize this isn't just some ""your princess is in another castle"" kind of Mario game, but you are literally saving the entire galaxy. One of the highlights is the MUSIC. THE MUSIC IS PERFECT. From the opening level to the last. It contains feelings of relaxation, enjoyment to anger and distress. It truly ties the entire thing together. I won't get into the story because I think that is something that you yourself have to truly experience on your own but all I will say is that it is absolutely brilliant. One of the best games ever created and I 100% recommend picking it up.. The most nostalgic game I have ever played. This game is the reason why I’m a huge Mario fan today. It may not have the fancy movement of 64 and Sunshine, but the level design makes it to where you don’t need it thanks to its more linear design. Despite being linear, the game throws in ideas after ideas and it just helps make this game so much fun to play. The characters, the visuals, and especially the music just make this game so memorable. And it’s still a bla","the story, different levels, the planets and gravity interaction are all perfectly handled . i will admit it has some flaws but those flaws will not change my score . this is one of, if not the best game ever created ."
40.Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec,"Greatest Racing Game of all time. Vehicles, Tracks, Design, Ambience, a Refined piece. This is the quality over quantity that embeds the concept in your mind.. Indeed, one of Gran Turismo's best games, I enjoy the old graphics of racing, making it stand out from the rest. This was one of the childhood PS2 games that I played on my family's PS2. There are many different modes to choose from, along with all of the featured licensed cars from brands like Ford and Chevrolet. The racing experience is something unforgettable. I cannot compare it to previous GT titles, nor newer ones as this was the only one I played. It definitely deserves all the credit it has received.. I do really like this game and it is a ginormous upgrade over gt2 but its really nothing to throw a party about. its heavily overshadowed by gt4.. First GT and sim-cade that I ever played. While GT4 is a better game, this game has way better Aesthetics and some of the tracks do look better on this game. This game was my childhood and the first game I had for my PS2.. My favourite Gran Turismo game in the entire series. Aside from not having so many cars, tracks and content, the driving mechanics and soundtrack are superb. Even though I like Gran Turismo 4 a lot, I'd recommend this game over 4 to anyone!!! #GranTurismo3. This game was my childhood, it was the first racing game i played the game is awsome it has good graphics even for today it has great handeling it has an amaizing soundtrack and the best veriaty of events and cars.. The best GRAN TURISMO that ever existed. Everything else that follows was garbage.. Time to review one of my favourite games not nostalgically, but fairly. First off is the quicker details. The music is memorable in the menus, the licensed tracks are good regardless of regional soundtrack but the menu ones just offer that bit more. I think they suit the time period, the racing & while mostly Rock or DnB in the PAL soundtrack compared to the variety in later entries it does enough of the job. Remixed menu songs are present but they feel different enough and offer enough of a different sound/feel to them. The driving model is fun and easy to get used to. Not that realistic as GT4 or other racing games of the time. Each car does feel different though so you will need to get used to how each FF, FR, MR, RR or 4WD feels as well as traction on and off (like the license test demos). Auto/manual options are available. The menus are big & bold text, flashy banners, a mix of in-game cars/tracks & mixing colours. Some mistakes like Else 5 then 10 or the Grand Valley Endurance test. The lighting on track are interesting. You still have a mix of day and some set in the evening or night on a few tracks. Not dynamically though like Grid 2008/Test Drive Le Man. Evening like Grand Valley Reverse, Laguna Seca or Seattle Circuit. With Night SSR5/11 (new layout then GT1), or Wet SSR5. No cockpit. Others of the time like TOCA PS2, MotoGP or PC racers did. I can take or leave this. But 1 bumper, 1 chase cam. 5 opponents again. Others of the time had either 8 (whether kart racers/car racing) TOCA PS2/MotoGP with 22. TOCA PS1 games having around 15. I can take or leave this sometimes it's too crowded/the AI aren't good enough to justify more on the track even if impressive. The AI aren't the best in this game (until GT5 they did notice the player then their strict routes or slight nudges). They are either standard routes or challenging due to some pit routes, some cheating (cars in events or tuned) or crowding. Not really any nemesis, keep going or mix of the two like newer racing games or others of the time. The car list is very noticeably low though. Some makes have just 1 car, others 2, others around likely 15 (mostly Japanese makes) & needing to scroll to see them all. It has a mix of race, rally, hatch, sedan & more. You can store 200 cars in your garage but even with purchases/reward cars you aren't going to fill it up like GT2 if you were doing the one make events in that car & selling them after finishing the events to make space. One make events are now part of the main event lists not dealership like GT2/GT4/GT5P. So expect GT3 as more a GT1 or a next gen console 'some parts had to be quick & sacrificed' because they were considering yearly with GT 2000 but put more time in. You could easily think some parts are rushed due to the lacking cars, very few new tracks & many short variations not included either with some tracks like Autumn Ring missing but appearing in GT Concept 2001-2002. Fun besides limits. The track count is very much the major tracks (no short) & 3 new ones. Tokyo R246, Complex String (I wish it was more than a license test track) & Cote de Azur. All good in their own way (besides the 15 lap pro events), but Cote De Azur & Test Course appear very rarely in the career mode. Others renamed like Smokey Mountain South to Swiss Alps. Tahiti Circuit then Tahiti Dirt Route 3. The arcade mode like GT1 & 2 has a progression or time trial/free run. You have 3 difficulties & can do either on any available tracks unlocked. You start with 6, 6 each group. With A to F group & arcade mode ending movie. Forward & reverse layouts, wet SSR5, Test Track & more. Normal/Hard Group unlock cars in C to S class based on difficulty. As well as the 10 time trials giving a Pennzoil R34 Race Car as a reward. You have access to C to S (race cars), rally from the start & garage cars. 2 Player split screen on unlocked tracks. i-Link support (system link like PS1 or Xbox). Clearing status or importing garage. (In GT mode a car trading menu between memory cards). The career has a smaller GT1 like map. Tuning, Licenses (Rally but no IC), dealership, speed test, events, GT Auto & garage. 5 event tiers Begin, Amateur, Pro, Rally & Endurance (1-2hrs, 60-100 laps). 1-3 laps begin, 3-6 laps amateur, 10-15 laps pro, 1-3 laps rally. No 24hr. In Pro events 1 pit & predicting when they will is a tough. Amateur/Pro have at least 5-7-10 events & some cheat or some odd cars in events. Some 80s/one makes can have off car choices, or there are too highly tuned (Yaris/Vitz, Elise, TVR, Zonda, TT, etc.) cars in events. There is a 4:3/16:9 aspect ratio option, music on/off (each song or all), controls (if want to L1/R1 then the X and Square pressure sensitive buttons), I think stick support if prefer that control scheme. Among other settings. Not many but the basics. You can import your GT Concept 2001-2002 save to get credits, and the license tests all bron. One of my least fav gt games. Still is fun though. Didnt really have enough content. The Gran Turismo games revolutionised the whole racing game genre, ultimately for the worse in my opinion. It's technically amazing, the graphics superb and the attention to detail extremely impressive. It also has a painfully convoluted menu system with horrible accompanying faux coffee table jazz elevator music, tediously bullies you into completing a series of ""tests"" before it'll let you play YOUR OWN GAME, and is so joylessly obsessive about ""realism"" that it's very little fun to play. Give me Burnout 3 every day of the week.. Very fun game. I've been playing for a while and don't feel much burn out. Cool races, cars, and awesome graphics. it might take a little to get used to, but its a very fun game nonetheless.. Perfectly encapsulates the Gran Turismo experience. The only things wrong with this game is its smaller amount of content compared to other games in the series, and an unbalanced length for races in the professional league. Everything else is pure perfection and one of the best racing games of all time. Beautiful graphics and lighting effects for the time. Most intuitive physics in the series in my opinion (although not the most realistic by far). A great career mode and even a progression system in Arcade Mode. It's a must play for racing game fans or anyone looking to get into the genre.. HOW COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY BELOVED!? Even more than Gran Turismo 4, I adore this game - not because it's a better game, but because it was my first. I was so caught up in the #GT4SWEEP, that I forgot how criminally underrated this title was on this list. This game is pure, concentrated nostalgia directly injected into my veins. Little did 3 year-old me know it at the time, but this game would shape my taste in music, my love for cars (specifically, the Supra), and my appreciation for gorgeous skyboxes (Smokey Mountain GOATed). It may not be the most car-rich or the best balanced or the most technically impressive (even though it still holds up like a champ to this day), but god...DAMN does this game have class, character, charisma, and charm. This will always be my favorite. Not only deserving of a top spot in any racing game ranking, but any game ranking in general.. A phenomenal game for its time, even today it is fun to play it, however by treating the ovals as a content filler and the limited number of tracks and cars due to the PS2 release date does not deserve a 10. For me, A-spec is very close to perfection... well, except maybe Toyota Yaris.. Stellar game for a release title. Unbelievable. Childhood. Since had a lifetime interest in motoring.. Criminally underrated, at least it seems like that on this website. Truly a revolutionary game.. I'm not a fan of Gran Turismo but this game here is too good. I liked the gameplay and especially the dust particles that c managed to be more dense and time consuming than many rally games you find out there. For 2001 it managed to have a more realistic dust than Dirt 1/2/3 2007/2009/2011. A Gran Turismo 2 with better graphics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This game goes beyond being one of the greatest racing games ever made. I'd reckon it's one of the greatest games of all time. This game just feels right. The aesthetics, the gameplay, the controls, the great music and sound effects, and over all experience is best of its class. I have very, very fond memories of this game growing up. Little 4 year old me was blown away by this game and have been in love with it ever since. Even without my strong bias, it is worthy of praise. All you need to know is that Snoop Dogg made a song for this game. That's how good it is.. This was the first Playstation 2 game I ever had. I received it as a Christmas gift and play it still to this day in 2022. Gran Turismo 4 was objectively a better game due to the increased content and slightly better graphics, but this will forever be my favorite game of all time. I would give anything to be 11 years old again so I could recreate those same memories.. This game is amazing, that's it. It was released on 2001. That's 21 years ago. I played it when I was a kid, and I loved it. I am now 20 years old, and can't still understand how a game could look so good in 2001. On the original PS2 it's great, but when I tried it on emulator with some patches to see how it looks, I couldn't believe how good it looks, you can even think it's a last generation racing game with the visual upgrades. Also, the car selection is fantastic, it might not be as extended as the GT2 one, but it's still really good. And the tracks, all of them are memorable, and really satisfying to drive on them. At last, the career mode is really good too, you'll have lots of championships to race on, as well as a very challenging license tests mode. The best Gran Turismo on the franchise on my opinion.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 6 Total: 7.83. Gran Turismo 3 is a timeless masterpiece. First of all, the game doesn't care how you drive. If you're n the middle of a race and about to lose, you are able to use shortcuts and other techniques to best the AI players, and it is these oversights that make the racing more engaging than normal. Gran Turismo 3 also has the best simulation mode of the entire franchise, where all of the races have clearly identifiable names and pictures, and there is no overly complicated map to navigate. Some events even repeat difficulties, which makes it really easy to tell what kind of car you need to bring and which ones you'll be going up against. Finally, Gran Turismo 3 has the best arcade mode. Not only can you use the overpowered cars you own in simulation mode, but the game tracks which single-player races you win, and for every six tracks you beat, you earn six more. Getting every light on the bonus items screen to turn on is a true endurance test. Let's not forget that the menu and in-game interfaces are distinct and striking to the eye with its orange text, and the music arranged for this game is clear against the noises of the car engines. Gran Turismo 3 is feature-rich, it is engaging, it is a marvel of its era, it is timeless, it is my childhood and I am ashamed that barely anyone else got to experience this hidden gem of a racing game. It is a grand old time.. OVERALL - 95% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 10/10 Story - 5/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 4/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 10/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay Value - 7/10 I'm utterly useless as driving games, so when a game like this comes along and completely captivates me it must be incredible. Loved the variety and the soundtrack is one of the coolest until date. I still **** though.. When you play Gran Turismo 3, you start with humble beginnings and work your way up to better cars by winning races and completing time trials. This game's formula was immensely satisfying. The racetracks were diverse, and the music choices were phenomenal. In terms of graphics, it doesn't stand a chance to new racing games, but given the year it was released, it was darn impressive.. Graphics are beautiful until nowadays. Shocking thinking that we are talking about a game with almost one fifth of century. GT3 was an initial kick for realistic racing emulators. In its time almost nothing so close to reality were seen, for sure a game in front of its time. But which is good can get better. Unfortunately, with pasting time, without letting behind GT3's importance, better mechanicals and higher graphic power were appearing, obfuscating game's grandiosity and making it became dated and obsolete if comparing with another games in genre.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. A really fun game, with nice physics, cool music and amazing graphics, although with much less cars (150 approx.) than its predecessor (Gran Turismo 2; 600 cars approx.) since Polyphony had only a year to optimize the game (including all models and textures) for PlayStation 2. Fortunately, the game doesn't look as weird as Gran Turismo 2000 (a demo to show the power of PS2's hardware, which is basically a remastering of Gran Turismo 2 similar to Crash Bandicoot: N-sane Trilogy's), the number of tracks is pretty nice (19 normal + 17 reverse = 36 tracks) so you got a lot of kilometers of asphalt and dirt to race and hundreds of hours of racing to enjoy. Me, I have most Gran Turismo Mode races and the whole Arcade Mode completed!. One of the best looking PS2 games and almost on par with some low budget PS3 games. It is a challenge because the mindset when playing a racing video game is expecting it to react like an arcade racer and not a simulation racer but once you get used to it, it gets addicting because you can actually see and feel your skills get better the more you play the game. This game brought my passion for racing to life and the feeder music is just amazing. I got the disc and played non stop for like half a year and just couldn't get enough. The graphics are awesome, the car mechanics are insane that you might actually think you're driving at some point. Gran Tourismo 3 A-spec is the best and I mean the best racing simulator period.. A truly revolutionary racing game for its time, all other Gran Turismos that came after didnt do anyhting as close as to what GT3 did. If only one bad thing i can tell bout GT3 then its the bloody grind.. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec and NFS Underground are best Racing Games on PS2 . Gran Turismo 3 is one of the best game of 2001 in my opinion . Graphics in this game is very good for 2001 and Many Different real cars . Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec even better than Gran Turismo 4 . 8/10 .. A PS2 Classic and absolutely amazing! Sleek menu interfaces, challenging, and tons of cars! Hours and hours of replay value. Gran Turismo 3 It never gets old.. If you're looking for a realistic racing game, if you're looking for a graphically pleasing game, if you're looking for a game that let's you beef up your cars, then look no further, because Gran Tourismo 3 fits all of the above.. It's an OK racing game, i enjoyed Gran Turismo 2 and 4 much more than 3. What i like about this game are the graphics, and some new cars and courses that never was on Gran Turismo 2, and great licenses. The racing on this game was too repetive, for example on many tournaments you will find the same 20 lap-course, it gets boring to play the same course 20 laps again and again.... This is the best racing game i have ever played! featuring over 180 cars, with an incredible graphics (for a ps2 game). the physics is really great. this game is really the first GT game that change my life forever. ive even learned to drive from gt3. the best racing game that i have ever played (over 400 hours on it). I can't wrap my head around that this game has a 95 on Metacritic. Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec is just plain overrated. The visuals, car designs, and soundtrack are really good, but that's all. The controls are awkward and sluggish. When you move left (or right), you are locked in moving left until you move right. You try it for yourself and see how it is. But I must be seeing things because I think I'm the only one who's mentioned this. You might say that I need a better car (since I just started playing), but that right there is another problem. Any drivingracing game should never be that dependent on the car selection. That is a life lesson on racing games.. Ever since this game, every racing game has been compared to it. It's just the greatest racing game ever. So much has been rightfully said. If you have yet to play it, wtf. I remember this game well, it's still the best racing game that I've ever played. I've spent countless hours on this game for years. So many cars to buy, so many championships, I don't think I've ever got to complete it fully due to the difficulty to gain the 'S' license, but the game itself is so diverse. There's something for everyone. Highly enjoyable, beautiful songs, beautiful graphics for 2001.. A triumph.. This game sadly hasn't aged as well as i'd thought. It was a great game for 2001, but a purchase in 2012 is harder to recommend. The graphics are great for a PS2 game. The gameplay is somewhat good, but there isn't much strategy in races, and the difficulty tends to shift from extremely easy to very hard, The lack of damage that can be done to cars is absent, and when the mph meter says you are going about 70mph, it looks more like 40 mph. A passable game.. Even by the standards of the day, GT3 A-Spec has unbelievable graphics and unmatched driving physics. Framerate is smooth, there are a lot of cars to choose from, a full range of adjustable driving assists and some of the most realistic driving you will ever come across in a racing game. The licesnes are fun and gold medal is actually difficult unlike most modern games. There are a lot of cars that are hugely detailed (although admittedly some cars do look noticeably better than others) and controls are simple, responsive and make every corner satisfying. The choice of tracks is dissapointing but you still get some decent ones like Mazda Laguna Seca. The amount of content in this game, the replay value and addictiveness of trying to beat best times even on livesnses where you drive in a straight line and stop inside a box means that it's a game which can be enjoyed at any point, anytime. The attention to detail combined with its simplicity but hidden complexity in trying to get best times makes it both accessible, fun and hardcore. If they added more tracks this would be the ultimate simulator for its time. All it would be missing is interior view.. This was the only Gran Turismo I owned and I thought it was very good. The graphics at the time were phenomenal and the car selection was deep. I am not a fan of racing games as this was one of the only ones I've ever owned, but it was definitely a title worth having. The only downfall I think was that you had to do some pretty repetitive tasks to accumulate money. The big thing I wanted to see in this game though that wasn't present was damage on the cars, I've been told that this would cost the creators too much?. Amazing third part of the series. As usual, includes more cars, more tracks and more features than previous games. However, GT3 don't have anything new aside from the amazing graphics. They could have implemented some kind of damage system, more night tracks or some weather effects. Still, the best racing game in PS2.. now i wasnt into GT 1 or 2 very much but 3 just changed my whole view of this series . its a driving sim done to pretty much perfection . you get over 500 cars a ton of tracks the controls are fantastic steering wheel or controler i found worked great. the graphics in there day looked fantastic and the music was pretty good some nice tracks like the cult's she sells sanctaury and more. there are a ton of races in this game and to complete it will take you a long long time . i spent over 100 hours i9n this game and it stands to me the best racing game ever made .. One of the best racing games ever made for the Playstation 2. Killer soundtrack, great graphics, and fast cars make this game legendary for the racing genre.. Incredible game, amazing graphics for the time and pretty much the best driving simulator that had come out at the time. This game had insane hype and it's one of those rare cases where a game this hyped lives up to it and then some.. Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec is a nice racing simulator game. The games graphics showcase what the PlayStation 2 can do, from the design of the cars (which are identical to their real life counterparts) to the lovely track design. The racing is smooth and the cars handle great. You can also tune them up with turbo's, better suspension and tyres. There are a selection of events to try out in the Simulation (Career) mode like endurance races, Formula 1 races (Fictional Polyphony designed F1 racers)and Rally stages. Also there is an arcade mode to try out if you want to have some fun or play some multiplayer. There are a nice selection of courses ranging from real life to fictional circuits like Laguna Seca and Deep Forest Raceway. A couple of complains though drag this game down: The endurance events are an eyesore and boring (some endurance events have you racing for 2.5 hours), the Test Course is a boring race track to race around (basically its just a big Oval) and no skill needed to drive round it, there are 150 cars or so to buy (or win) and race, which is considerably lower than the previous installment's 600 cars (Gran Turismo 2) and because there is no damage in the game, you can pretty much smash into other racers or walls and survive. However Gran Turismo 3 is a great racing game and should appeal to fans of car simulator games.. I need to understand why there was so much hype for this **** did it get so high reviews?I've played it over and over,like I do all games before I review,and I took in account the year it came out,the innovations it had-everything.I have to tell you that this game does not deserve more than a straight up 8.That is the perfect score but everybody was so oooh and eeeh over this game.Same with the first one.Gran Turismo 2 is the best of the bunch,because it's game play was tight as can be with over 500 cars in 1999.also there was no competition against Gran turismo 3, at the time,at **** there would of just been 1 good driving game back in 2001 it would of been a whole different story.Then Sega Gt 2002 came out which had nothing on this game until PGR 2 came out in 2003 and that was finally a driving game that took the crown from Gran Turismo 3-in a heartbeat!I know games and I know that this game in an 8 and who ever is reading this,if your interested in getting a driving game,simulation or not,get any of the 3 forza games or the burnout games,whatever is to your ****'t get this unless you want to play a game for hours and hours and get no enjoyment from it.Like driving around the block for no reason,to go no where,get what I'm saying.","this is one of the childhood games that i played on my family's PS2 . the racing experience is something unforgettable . the music is memorable in the menus, the licensed tracks are good ."
400.Final Fantasy Chronicles,"Chrono Trigger and FFIV together is (was) an absolute must have when they released. The Chronicles opened them both up to a larger audience of newer RPG fans. They are both absolutely must plays. I played CT on the SNES so I knew going it what it was. I had not played FFIV until this, so I was happy I was finally able to. FFIV pulled no punches and casuals easily could get beat into submission. That said if you're an RPG veteran you will learn and adapt. Chrono Trigger is just a great, basic, nuts & bolts RPG. Everything is superb. While both of these are not at the top of my list anymore they were at the time and still demand the respect as what RPGs should be. Both are must plays.. i think this was the last final fantasy on the PS1 and if it is it is VERY perfect but it is overshadowed by other popular final fantasy games but it is still perfect..

401.Pizza Tower,"It's really hard to find a good platforming game while still keeping the charms of 90s. Pizza Tower literally nailed both of them: fun and engaging gameplay,with the graphic of 2000s potato PCs. The control is smoothly, the level designs are above genius, and the MUSIC, OH BOY DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC! DoI recommend it? Absolutely, this game is only $10. Do I recommend buying it just for the music alone? YOU MUST! Don't ask if Pizza Tower is worth your time, ask if you worth Pizza Tower's time instead.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Graphics: 10 Play control: 9.6 Game design: 9.3 Satisfaction: 10 Sound: 9.7 OVERALL RATING: 9.72. The best combination of Wario and sonic,Ilove the level design and think that this game has been in development for over 7 years,i love this game. I was constantly hearing about how this was one of the best platformers of the era and that I needed to play this game. I played this game and I can definitely conclude that this game was most definitely way overhyped, but that is not to say it is bad per se. It controls well, runs well, has a quirky but still appealing art style and humor to it, the music is good (especially the Pizza Time music) and most of the levels are perfectly serviceable with serviceable boss fights. However, if you want to get the most out of this game, this is a game that takes an extreme level of precision and dedication to get good at and to properly experience everything, which I honestly just wasn't feeling up to doing. This game was alright, but it wasn't quite good enough for me to start no-life'ing this game to get P Ranks in all the levels or get all the collectables. The best way I can describe this is that this game is a speedrunner's paradise. The speeds in which you often get to are incredibly fast, but that becomes part of this game's problem for the average player. You get so fast that it becomes unwieldly unless you've mastered this game and you'll be constantly crashing into walls and losing your speed all the time. You might be like ""well if going so fast is so bad, don't go so fast"". Well that wouldn't be a problem if the second half of every level didn't require you to make a mad dash for the exit where you're basically on a timer before Pizza Phanto comes to ruin your fun. While admittedly I rarely actually had to deal with the timer running out, forcing myself to constantly go Mach speeds and constantly running into walls all the time made it lose a bit of its fun factor for me. To be able to properly handle the insane speeds the game wants you to go for and to get everything, from what I can gather, requires basically dedicating your life to this game and learning how to speedrun it. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then don't expect to ever get used to the high speeds. Also another thing I don't quite like about this game is how it throws a million different gimmicks at you and hardly fleshes any of them out. I'm pretty sure every level has a different gimmick (I think there was an armor suit in a level in the first world they brought back in a level of the last world, but that is the only recurring gimmick I can think of). You hardly ever get to get good at any of these gimmicks and, by the time you might, the level's over. Most of the gimmicks did control fine at least, but there were a couple gimmicks that drove me up a wall with how annoying they were (I'm looking at you, golf level). While it was still somewhat enjoyable for a one time casual playthrough, unless you're a speedrunner who is willing to no-life this game, don't expect anything particularly amazing.. Review of Pizza TowerIf you’re looking for a game that combines nostalgia with fresh innovation, look no further than Pizza Tower. This indie platformer is a delightful homage to the classic 2D games of the late '90s and early 2000s while offering its unique charm, humor, and a barrage of frenetic **** its heart, Pizza Tower features a fast-paced, action-oriented gameplay loop that keeps you engaged from start to finish. You play as Peppino Spaghetti, a husky but surprisingly agile pizza chef on a mission to save his pizzeria from the clutches of a villainous tower.

The combination of visuals and sound creates an immersive atmosphere that keeps you coming back for **** for the controls, Pizza Tower nails it with intuitive mechanics that allow for fluid movement and precise jumps. Mastering the game's mechanics is a joy, especially with the plethora of power-ups and abilities that you unlock throughout. There’s a real sense of progression as you learn new moves and tricks, making it satisfying to revisit levels and improve your speed or **** of the fascinating aspects of Pizza Tower is its humor. The game is packed with clever references, puns, and absurd scenarios that keep the tone light-hearted and fun. Unlike some platformers that can take themselves too seriously, Pizza Tower embraces its silliness, making every encounter memorable.However, the game isn’t without its challenges. The difficulty can ramp up quickly, especially as you progress through the levels. For some players, this might be daunting, but it also adds to the rewarding nature of overcoming obstacles and mastering the game’s mechanics. There’s an enjoyable sense of mastery to be found in perfecting your run through each **** conclusion, Pizza Tower is a breath of fresh air in the indie gaming scene.

I REALLY ENJOY THE SUPER FAST PACED MOVEMENT AND THE LEVEL DESIGN AND THE MUSIC!!! ONY THING I WANTED FROM THIS GAME IS TO BE LONGER. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game currently ranks #1 in Top 150 highest rated Steam games of 2023 by game reviewers. I had to see what the fuss is all about, only to find out that this is nothing more than a generic 2D platformer. The pizzas with the red lips make annoying noises. The running animations are very cringeworthy. The pizza guy always makes incredibly cringeworthy faces. To make matter worse, there is a stupid TV on the right-top corner where the pizza guy makes even cringier faces. When you pass a level, there is music that is extremely cringeworthy. It is over-exaggerated and tries too hard to be upbeat in a pathetic attempt at making players excited when they win. It didn't make me excited in the slightest. All this cringe made me grab my monitor and slam it against the floor out of frustration. There is no multiplayer, but I didn't expect one at a cheap price. Did I say cheap? The greedy developers are charging $20 for a flash game. I immediately refunded this garbage after nearly 2 hours. I don't want to torture myself any further with this garbage. Besides, there are plenty of free flash games on the internet. I don't recommend this game at all, unless you like looking at cringeworthy faces literally every second. ● P.S. I originally wrote this review back in early 2023, so that's when it ranked #1 on Steam and I had to see what all the fuss is about. All the crazy things that happened to me this summer made me realize it's best for me to just quit gaming altogether. College Football 25 would've been my last review. I have 0 faith on these lazy and greedy devs, so that was the plan. But after the deletion of this review, I'll postphone my departure. I'm not letting you toy-collecting millennials get away with controlling the narrative, and I'll let these devs know why it's a mistake to listen to you. I'll make sure they develop a highly successful $70 game (regardless if I like it) that will trigger the nerds, before I quit gaming for good. Anyways, I slammed my monitor because of this game. So it deserved this score, Metacritic. Speaking of which, I need to pick up a new TV after destroying it. When I come back, I'll continue gaming.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Is it's great I enjoyed the game, the mechanics, The difficulty is balanced. One of the best indie games of the all times, the soundtrack, the smooth gameplay,the memorable levels,and the charism of the characters, absolutely a masterpiece of the plataforms. This is the greasiest, cheesiest, most deep dished game ever made! It’s the Wario version of Sonic Mania, delivering an appetizing collection of densely packed, faster paced level design complete with a killer, old-school PC game soundtrack.. This game is so good even after hours and hours of play time it's so fun! It's a very fast-paced game so you go speed.. i,v beating this game 2 times and i enjoyed it each time i'm about to do my 3ed best game of 2023. Easy ten out of ten. Amazing soundtrack. Very suited graphics. Amazing playstyle. And very fun to replay.. This game is absolutely amazing. Pizza tower has to be the most beautiful, most likeable game. It's emphasis on speed and 90s cartoon look makes it stand out. I'd say it's equivalent to the critical acclaim as cuphead or sonic mania. Only bad thing about this game is that it ends. Also the music, THE MUSIC Mr. Sauceman really went all out.. demonstrates perfection. every level is just perfect (not peppibot factory tho). i dont have much to say really other than ""its just perfect"" so i guess it really is a perfect game. Extremly good game only pepole that have an IQ under 2 Like only one here do Not Like this game. This game is so good. Perfectly animated, amazing style, good humor, and holy HELL if it isn't a good platformer. I love the focus on speed in this game, you feel like a train on the verge of a panic attack playing it. The music is so good, like thousand march or on the rocks. Also, the ending is the best ending to a videogame I've had the joy of playing blind. If you have pizza tower, go replay the ending sequence, if you don't have pizza tower, go buy pizza tower and play the entirety of the game to see the ending.. Pizza Tower manages to stand out from the pack in nearly every way. The 90s Cartoon Network artstyle gives it a distinct identity compared to recent hyperrealistic games, or lower resolution pixel art from many other indie titles. The standout, epic OST makes the game all the more exciting. Way of the Pig, Tropical Crust, and Extraterrestrial Wahwahs are highlights, and they're simply ordinary level themes! Pizza Tower is tightly designed, with little/no filler. Peppino's controls and movement are difficult to learn, but fun and versatile when you master them. Taunts doubling as a parry is quite a cool choice. All the levels are fun, with constant fast paced action, and fun, innovative gimmicks. There is lots of replayability too. Each level has 3 secrets with their own mini-challenge, as well as a treasure. Most of all, it's about getting the perfect rank. It's very fun, though sometimes frustrating (though it's always my own skill issue rather than the game being unfair). The 5 bosses are also a blast, especially for platformer standards. The Noise update provided a new, fun challenge that incentivized me to play the game all over again. Another great moveset, perhaps even more satisfying than Peppino's. There were plenty of hilarious surprises, and more great music.. Pizza Tower is extremely unique. It's got a distinct, hilarious art style that sets it apart from other platformers and great mechanics that almost make it feel like a more unique Sonic game. There isn't much more to ask for here: if you're down for hilarious and fast paced platformers, this is something you should definitely pick up.. Peppino spaghetti beats up a sentient **** I need to say more. this game is un ironically jood play it. now. This game was pretty fun and recommended to me by my best friend. I thought it was weird but then I played it and I really loved it. 93-95%. This is literally the greatest game to ever exist, if you love fast paced platforming, expressive animations, and a unique gameplay style, then Pizza Tower is for you. The minute I played this game for the first time, I was immediately hooked, and I basically had full control of all Peppino’s moves right from the start. Plus, the game is filled to the brim with replayability. Best game ever and easily the goat of indie platformers. 10/10. One of the best games I think I have ever played and my favorite. You can tell they put a lot of effort into it. The game was very fun to play when I first played it and is very fun to play now as well. I really like the way they handle difficulty. There's the usual; just go through the level, destroy John and escape by going back to the start in time, or you could try to get a P rank which can make a normally quite easy level into a very very hard one. To get a P rank, you not only have to find all the secrets, get the treasure, do another lap during the escape with the remaining time you have left, get enough points for an S rank (not too difficult if you attempt this. It sort of happens while you are playing and trying to maintain a P rank), and I think also get all the toppins, but you also have to do all this while not letting your combo run out by collecting points and defeating enemies, which is the main reason why this is such a hard rank to get. As for bosses, just don't take any damage and you'll get a P rank. What I'm saying is that this game is really good for beginners and people who are more experienced with the game. As for the graphics and art style, it resembles an old cartoon. It's very smooth and very good. When I first played it, I really noticed how smooth and good everything looked, and loved the amount of expressiveness in each character. I do now a bit as well, but I sort of started taking it for granted. In other words, the art style and quality is amazing. The music is also very good. Also a thing I really noticed when I started playing. It was also nominated for the steam awards for best music or something like that, so that should tell you something about it as well. Ah right, it's also inspired by Wario Land 4 I believe.. Pizza Tower is spectacular, a frenetic game full of personality, from the game's animations, its characters, the levels, the soundtrack and even the boss fights, everything feels unique and very fun.. My Favorite Pizza Toppings Pepperoni That Very Good Food To Be So Love About This.. This game is like Wario Land running at Sonic The Hedgehog speeds. Bring on this new wave of Wario Land Clones.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I've been waiting for a game that's similar in gameplay to the Warioland series since 2008 and Pizza Tower provided that while (in my opinion) surpassing the Warioland games it was based off at the same time. Although the movement takes a bit to get used to, I still think it's something most people can find enjoyment in even if they haven't played the games it was based off. This is the GOTY of 2023 for me.. Best 2D platformer I've ever played. Like Sonic if it was a good series and not hot garbage. I used to hate Italians until I played this game. Hope this helps. this is the best game because its mort the chicken 2 basically - mort the chicken superfan. So, i thought pizza tower is like a lame cooking game, but as one of my friends told me that it is not a lame cooking game i got interessed in this game and looked it up on youtube. I was very Impressed, so i buyd it and this is literly the best 20 Euro i ever spend. This game is just a masterpiece. But i am really scared of the comunity, they make mostly pretty weird stuff about it and i hope they wont destroy it.. Amazing indie platformer. Felt like playing a cartoon. Magnificent art and enjoying gameplay. Everyone must try it.. Infinitely replayable levels. A move set that seems clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be shooting through levels faster than a meteorite. The graphics were made in MS Paint and somehow I say that in the best way. This game made me a pizza. Great 2d game, great soundtrack, literally great at everything, but not perfect so it's not a 10. apparently my bf thinks this game is better than me so it must be really good. better than my bf. My brother playing pizza tower. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Masterpiece of all masterpiece. Best **** game I've ever played, and I'm a doge. The game is pretty good and fun! There sou much content Here and is pretty enjoyable in grafics and game play, give it a try it’s pretty good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The art style, reminiscent of Ren and Stimpy, is great. The controls, however, are very slippery, and the gameplay is mostly the same.. It is great to play this game, the gameplay is simple but used in many ways that make each level seem unique. The graphics are really charming with the 90s to 2000s cartoon style that looks like every frame came from some ren and stimpy type of cartoon. And i dont even need to talk about the soundtrack. Just play this game. Fresh air in this age gaming industry Music and art style overall experience is undescribable, unexpected, exciting and fresh. Pizza tower is my favorite game. EVER. why do I Give It A 9? well 2 reasons. 1 is more reasonable and 2 is more too my annoyance. 1. The Difficulty is CRAZY Trying too 101% percent The game is HARD but it makes the game fun in a weird ironic way. 2. THE AMMOUNT OF UNUSED ****. ok so not only are there like 4 SCRAPPED Playable Characters, Levels That Were just GUTTED. The Game Is About 45 Hours If You 101% Percent The Game (long) BUT THERE WOULD BE SO MUCH RE-PLAYABILITY WITH CHARACTERS LIKE ""The Noise"" AND THERE ARE LIKE 5 LEVELS THAT ARE COMPLETELY GONE. So Play The Game And Have Fun, Just Don't Look Too Deep Into It.. this game really helped me and that's why i love it. i used to think that no one would like my upcoming game Trick shot because of its loose pixel art style but this game showed that people can always love someones art style plus this game did sonic better than sonic. Pizza tower is a real masterpiece of a platforming game, when you first play this game it is a slow paced game before pizza time starts and you race to the finish, but by the time you are further in, you look back on that like it was awful and you can blitz through levels much more difficult, With amazing devs, a great community, and an all round amazing game, the only problem i had with this game is that there isnt enough! Every level and song in this game is crafted with love and passion, dont let the odd story and ms paint art style fool you, this game is an amazing experience that i beg everyone to try.. the game is amazing I have spent COUNTLESS hours playing this game from the levels to the bosses to the controls everything is next to perfect bravo mc pig bravo. you should buy and play pizza tower… NOW!! anyways this game is absolutely perfect, down to the minute details. HOCHI MAMA, this was amazing. I love this game it's so good! The visuals, The Music, The character designs, the Bosses, hell even the controls are so sweet! definitely recommend!. pizza tower is a masterclass in platforming design, the emphasis on speed keeps the gameplay in a smooth flow and even the bosses (Which most platformers drop the ball on) were some of the highlights of the game for me. there's lots to do in terms of content, with attempting p ranks, getting the different judgement scores and all the achievements in hopes of getting that coveted 101% score. it is a game i see really no major flaws in and with its tight controls, expressive animation and one of the best soundtracks of the year, anybody who loves games should 100% give this one a try.. interesting ,fun and simple, these are the words that can perfectly describe the game, it's fun , a bit hard for understanding at the start but you will get the hang of it. A very fun and wacky fast paced game. Its so energetic and crazy. The music is wonderful and all the characters and drawings are so interesting. The ost and artstyle are amazing. The controls and characters are somethin to get used to but if you know how this games works, then this game is a blast. pizza tower is the type of game you can probably play while half asleep and still have a great time. the ost is a **** JAM that you can listen to outside of the game and still know which level its for cus its that damn memorable. if you love warioland 4 and if you love highspeed platformers like sonic mania then youll love this game. my favorite part was getting the P ranks. the dopamine that hits you after you get it after like a 100 attempts either leaves you groaning like a ape or moaning. the bosses are phenomenal while yes may slow down the pace for me its god damn perfect. and is a nice lil break from the high speed **** i also heard that a dlc will be coming out and when it does holy **** am i playing that day 1. play this game. NOW!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pizza Tower: A cheesy platformer that delivers fast-paced action and deliciously addictive gameplay.. The animations are Steller charming the gameplay is satisfying i love it the music is awesome BUY IT IT""S 21 CAD$. Really good fast paced gameplay. Unfortunately, the game can go by very fast, but it has a lot of creativity put into it and makes the gameplay very enjoyable.. Way too difficult for me to handle. The concept is creative however, but this game is way too hard. 5/10. This game is a ten but has a massive flaw. THERE ISNT ENOUGH FEMALE CHARACTERS WE NEED MORE. I NEED MORE. PLEASE ADD A SUPER ATTRACTIVE PIZZA GIRL WHO MAKES THIS GAME EASIER ITS TOO HARD WE NEED AN EASY MODE CHARACTER WHO IS ALSO FEMALE. This game is so fun and charming! All the levels and bosses are great! The final boss is pretty epic too a great game to play whenever im feeling bored. - my little brother. Wow! Wow wow! This game is absolutely astonishing. My brothers was really into this game, and I decided to give it a shot, and holy crap, it was one of the most fun I’ve ever felt playing a platformer. With a solid 6 hours of gameplay in the main game, the art style is incredibly easy to fall in love with, and the speedy mechanics make it all the more fun. Peppino is so much fun to zip around with, with all of his wacky moves. It takes a bit to understand the moves, but on e you get ‘‘em down, well, not even Sonic could catch you at Mach 5. And then, when you beat the utterly spectacular final boss, you think it’s over right? WRONG! You can go through all of the levels again, to get the elusive P Ranks, which will take loads of trail and error, and a load more close calls. Overall, this is a must play game for me, who loves games where you just gotta go as fast as you can. You can get it on steam for $20, and I certainly reccomend it!. oh mama-mia! it-a would a-seem that another example of an-a indie stuuuuuuuuudio doing better than nintendo is a-here-a! I've a got-a the pizza and-a the pasta at-a the ready! A pizzatower is a game starring the italian chef/a-war a-vet-a peppino **** his a-quest-a to destroy-a the pizza tower and it's-a ruler, the pizza face-a! inspired by old 90s cartoons-a, this game is-a be-a-u-a-tiful! Mcpig venuto, visto and vinto! you-a must-a play-a!. I genuinely had no problems with pizza tower. It's a damn good game, the ost slaps, i love the artstyle the levels were fun to go through although i probably wont be going for p ranks i still find this game perfect. if you're looking for a past face 2d platformer which is just absolutely crazy get this game. Best 2d platformer since celeste. All in all a very fun and percise platformer that really wants YOU to master it. Doing all achievements is very hard but rewarding the combat is also pretty neat and if your P-rank is gone its YOUR fault! Do your best while playing it and have fun.. My god this game was absolutely amazing, the bosses were fun, the levels were amazing, the visuals were absolute eyecandy, and the music is just amazing. This game is perfect, just perfect, down to the last tiniest detail 10/10 for this awesome, stellar, golden throne ****. In my opinion, Pizza Tower is one of those games where you see it and say, is it a good game?, you try it and you say Oh **** it's a great game. The truth is that I had faith in the game and the final product is a masterpiece, this game is quite good, with good optimization and very polished controls, without a doubt a game with an interesting theme, in addition to its rank system, it is very addictive Well, one tries to surpass the rank that he obtained and that for me is good because it is like a way of caressing your ego. Honestly, it is a game that is worth playing and spending a few hours on.. I really do think that Pizza Tower is one of the best games out there. Out of all the games I have played in the recent years, I have seen very rare games that were worse than this. This game is a literal masterpiece, I love it so much. It is influenced by Wario Land 4, Sonic, and carries on its unique elements as well. This game is literal perfection and you really must play it.. I realy like the game for it's meccanics and music, the characters are awesome Whit realy enjoiable desings, i don't like the fact that the developers scrapped some good ideas, and how difficult It can be. One of the best games I've ever played! The music is absolutely amazing to boot!. I hated the game at first, but then I heard the funny Italian pizza man scream as he jumped out of boiling pizza sauce Super Mario 64-Style and now I love it. Then I met Lario and now this is on my list for my potential game of the year.. this game is pretty good and if you love momentum this is the game for you.. This game is absolutly amazing, fun to play and watch and the soundtrack is so damn good. really deserves 10/10.. Very good game, it has a very good music, and if there is nothing perfect, the gameplay is the closest to perfection, the levels are very well made, i enjoyed playing it, and the graphics and the arts are very good!. i have no life, just pizza tower. it had consumed me. i am no more. send help. One of the biggest surprises of the entire year so far, Pizza Tower is a magnificently frantic indie game that takes Wario Land 4's gameplay and runs at mach speed with it. The music is fantastic, the visuals definitely grow on you and the gameplay is some of the most thrilling that I have ever seen in a platformer.. No joke, this is my favorite game of all time. I absolutely love everything about this game, and you can just tell the developers put an incredible amount of effort and passion into every aspect.. Tour De Pizza dishes out one of the most brilliant and eccentric platformers of all time with Pizza Tower.. Pizza Tower is one of, if not THE best platformer I've ever played. This mix of Wario Land, Sonic, and Ren & Stimpy has made me succumb to it's charm after only 1 hour of gameplay, and now here I am with 25 hours in my belt. Pizza Tower is the most satisfying 2D platformer, it's dynamic, fun and rewarding once you get to P ranks. Go play it! It's only 20 dollars.. Genuinely one of the best games i have played in my life. The story is very minimal, but works incredibly well to not stop the gameplay in any way. it allows the freedom for Peppino to do anything he wants and have it fit in with the story. The animations are very smooth and the controls feel great. there is so much character in every move he does, from his skittish idle to his pure rage when attacking enemies. the soundtrack is one of the best i've heard in my life, from a game, movie, or a music artist. the high energy and rock tones really increase the intensity of the gameplay. There are so many different levels and the only real complaint i have are some of the gimmicks not being that fun to use, although many are. There is a boss in every world and they are great. They all feel fair to play against and you aren't punished for messing up once, as during them you can heal. Overall this is a 10/10 fast paced game that rewards exploration, has a great soundtrack, unforgettable gameplay, and generally was worth the 20$ i paid for it. The gameplay is so swift and smooth it pratically makes you want to get better scores and master the art. The story is simple, but works incredibly well with the tone of the game and the artstyle, wich is another thing to point out it's incredible! The characters are all very charismatic, especially the protagonist, wich they managed to make him unique and extremely relatable at the same time! And the OST **** SLAAAAAAAAAAAAPS!!! Just buy it, good game. :). This game is such a frenetic rush of dopamine, able to let you have fun replaying the same levels over and over again to get a score as high as possible! It takes the best from both the Wario Land and the Sonic series into a really amusing game, that can be truly understood only when playing it personally!. Pizza Tower is an amazing game. From the music, the level design, the boss battles, and the charming animation. Pizza Tower truly deserves nothing lower than a 10/10. This game was definitely ready to get funky.. holy **** **** buy this game, trust me, you will like it, just buy it on steam. creators if you are reading this please add dlcs after some time. i even put this on the game of the computer. i dont have to say anything. this is amazing and probably did a better job then the wario games themselfs. i know 20$ is expensive for a short game (not for me atleast) but i dont think it deserves to get a 9 for that, i recommend it if you like wario games. (also this game really makes me want to try out wario land 4).. Pizza Tower is a cheesy game with classic platformer gameplay reminiscent of Wario Land. You play as Peppino Spaghetti, a pizza chef on a mission to save his restaurant from being vaporized by scaling a tower filled with bizarre creatures. The 90s Nickelodeon-style graphics and wacky characters make for a visual treat. The soundtrack, featuring catchy tunes and silly sound effects, perfectly complements the game's absurd nature and will have you humming the Pizza Time theme song long after you've put down the controller.. This video game is very pizza enough to be the best pizza video games for computer to be the best pizza, because the characters are GOOD the Good.. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great animation, and great pizza too! This game has it all! I wish Italy was real though.. this game is insane and insanely good. Music, sound, mechanics, the ART, absolutely hilarious. sometimes the difficulty really spikes but aside from that, a total masterpiece. 10/10. This may be one of the best platformers I have ever played in a long time, Addictive gameplay and funny mechanics 10/10.

402.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"Another great game, excellent sequel to 2 that continued the story well. personally wasn’t super memorable for me but I enjoyed it. Brotherhood is an improvement to AC 2 but doesn't hit the highs like AC 2 did.. Brotherhood stands as one of the greatest entries in the Assassin’s Creed series and an undeniable masterpiece in the action-adventure genre. Launched in 2010, this game took everything the previous games built and elevated it with revolutionary features and a rich, immersive experience that captivated players worldwide.Narrative Depth and Character DevelopmentSet in the heart of Renaissance Rome, Brotherhood follows the iconic Ezio Auditore, who has become a seasoned Assassin. This time, he’s fighting not just for revenge but to establish a legacy and protect his city and Brotherhood. Ezio’s journey in Brotherhood is marked by growth and maturity, showing the evolution from a young, brash man to a responsible and charismatic leader. The storyline weaves historical events with fictional intrigue so seamlessly that it feels like a cinematic experience.Gameplay and InnovationBrotherhood introduced the concept of managing and recruiting assassins to build an entire Brotherhood, making players feel like they were truly part of an order. The blend of tactical management with core gameplay—stealth, parkour, and combat—adds a strategic layer that was groundbreaking at the time. The game’s dynamic combat mechanics, along with the chain-kill feature, made fighting fluid and thrilling, while the addition of gadgets like the crossbow gave players more creative approaches to missions.Rome as a Living WorldRome in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a vibrant, sprawling world that feels alive. With landmarks, bustling streets, and a vast open map, the game brought Renaissance Italy to life in a way that was rare in gaming. Players could roam from the rooftops to the iconic Colosseum, uncovering secrets, side missions, and historical monuments that gave a sense of authenticity and immersion.Multiplayer InnovationThe multiplayer mode was an unexpected gem, adding layers of tension and strategy that no other game had offered. With different classes, skills, and maps, it was a social experience that fostered a unique blend of skill and strategy, making players rethink their approach to stealth and combat in a competitive **** sum, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is a true gem, blending narrative, gameplay, and world-building into an unforgettable experience. It pushed the limits of what a historical action game could achieve, leaving a lasting impact on both the series and the industry as a whole.. this game has an incredible presentation and a great story and i dont know why but it really dropped the bar in the last act. It goes from 1 to 5x speed and the ending comes out of nowhere. Other than that i think even tho i liked rome a bit its not as interesting as the whole journey in the assassins creed 2. Just the sequel of the second one. It has all the good things and bad thing of it's predecessor. A worthy follow-up to the second game in the series. Ramps up the challenge and spectacle. Trims some excess from the previous game and fleshes out what worked well. The ongoing mechanic to rebuild and revitalize Rome is a nice touch.. No joke, this is the best game in the series to me. There was literally nothing i didn't enjoy about this game. Everything was perfect, down to a T. Back when this company knew what they were doing. Highly reccomend.. Story: 9 Gameplay: 8.5 Game Mechanics: 8 The game was great but lacked in the mechanics department. There is a difference between 2 and this.. I loved that this continued from were AC2 left off, but I've always been a fan of continuations so I might be bias. Something that hasn't changed, is my preference for the secondary gameplay. I just enjoy the story of what's happening with Desmond and Lucy vs of what's happening in the animus; however I did enjoy both. I'm happy they kept the element of building/repairing a city to earn a passive income. I don't know if I was just doing a lot of side objectives, but this felt noticeably long, which isn't a bad thing. However I found myself not enjoying this as much as I hoped too. I easily disliked my experience playing this far more then the first two games combined. There were so many missions I didn't enjoy doing, countless times where the parkour locking worked against me along with having to fight against forced camera angels when I needed my focus elsewhere, and too many time that combat controls didn't respond correctly. I did however find the ending to be very interesting and enjoyable to play, but I'm starting to wonder if it's due to the Sci-Fi tone of it. I almost want this to be the last one I play, but the ending alone might be enough to make me play the next game.. I bought a game with multiplayer. A few years later I couldn't play multiplayer anymore. The developper did a great job. The multiplayer mode was so original and fun! The producer, no. I'll never buy a ubisoft game in my life.. Hands down one the best Assassins Creed behind AC2. The sights of Rome are some of the most unique and stunning ones in the series with missions like climbing up the famous Roman Colosseum, flying through the skies with Leonardo Da Vinci's inventions, and much more.. 8/10 at release but 7/10 for 2024 gameplay, the outdated nature shows with the lack of hand-to-hand combat versatility. the brotherhood system is the most notable improvement over AC1 and AC2. the game has some cheesy dialogue and plot progression but does a good job of selling Ezio himself. The missions are mostly fun but also many noticable annoying missions too. Anything related to Desmond is an annoying parkour puzzle, it overstays its welcome.. Almost perfect but the pacing can be a bit slow and some parts of the map feel empty and dull. Besides these minor details the game isincredibile.. assassin creed brotherhood is a masterpiece, this game was great in every way, especially the story. Great game, great story, overshadowed however by the horrible ending of the last game which pushes this game's plot.. This really is Assassin's Creed 3 in all but name. It adds to the store of AC2 and develops game mechanics that will be staples in future AC titles.. Another sprawling adventure through the bustling streets of a historic city, this time set in Renaissance Italy. Once again, the graphics are marvellous, the movement fluid and it has a really nice sense of period. Thankfully the cut scenes are scaled back somewhat so you actually feel like you're playing the game rather than watching it this time, although I did sometimes feel bogged down with the endless side missions which spoils the narrative momentum somewhat. But it's still a strong arcade adventure with acres of ground to cover and places to explore.. This game is a modern classic. Of all AC games that I've played, this one was the funniest- Overall rating: 9.1.. A really good sequel for 2 with some great new ideas. It's really similar though, and the story doesn't hit as hard, seeing as it's just the middle chapter in Ezio's story.. Assassins Creed Assassins Creed Assassins Creed Assassins Creed Assassins Creed. This game is very based im not gonna lie to you my friend very based game indeed. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 10 Music: 10 Story: 10 Total: 9.83. Part 2 of the Ezio trilogy and it was well done with some new features and the Brotherhood missions.. This was a great continuation of AC II that was even better in some aspects, especially adding a team of assassins that you can use and upgrade. This really brought more fun into the game. The only thing that drove me mad was Leonardo’s flying missions. I nearly broke my keyboard trying to complete them, so I wouldn’t recommend taking these missions for the sake of your mental health. Other than that, the game is great.. This masterpiece of Ubisoft brings us the continuation of Ezio's story and adds a lot of options that really increases the game and your plot. The characters seems very coherents and the game found his place in the sun providing you to manage your own guild of assassins during the gameplay. The system of parkour it's the best of the entire collection 7gen's AC and the game, differently of the AC and ACII has nothing boring at all.. Such a disappointment after AC2. An unpolished step-down. Pros: * The opening sequence is well-designed and directed. And a cool trip back to Monteriggioni. * The first Vatican mission is beautiful too. * Daylight in Rome looks amazing. All the colors are bright like on old Italian landscape paintings. Sightseeing Rome with this light is mesmerising. * You can ride a horse in the city (though you will almost never use this feature). * The assassination at the orgy is great. * Eltsin and Putin are featured in 16's puzzles. * The climbing-based Romulus lairs are great. (Others not so much). * You can finally collect all the flags w/o hating the game! Cons: * In 4K the game looks ugly (I played the game on Xbox Series X as a part of Ezio collection). The draw distance is awful. People look like you're playing GTA3 and the textures get more detailed when it's too close and too late. The stupid behavior of NPCs doesn't help (like women drop their umbrellas in a distance just because they couldn't load correctly). Feels like Cyberpunk 2077 on PS4. * Also, music is huge step down. It's either a direct copy from AC2 or annoying new chorals. * The story is much worse than in AC2. And also it gets lost in endless side-missions. Also, the missions are not coherent. They all are generic. Some are buggy. Some are fine. None are great. If I need to play one more 'follow' mission I will kill myself. * Cesare looks like an anime character. * The achievements are not fair again. Replaying the missions again and again to get 100%? Nooooooooo. * Desmond climbing levels feel like a cheap version of Uncharted. * Even 16's puzzles got worse :( * Both the last memory segment and the ending are meh.. Assassin´s Creed: Brotherhood follows in its predecessors footsteps. And that´s just fine! The story is super interesting and Desmond has a much bigger role in this part. Graphics and sound are high class as usual and one of the biggest changes is the terrific multiplayer. If you like the AC games, especially the ones with Ezio Auditore, you will enjoy this fan service!. With all its ups and downs the assassin's creed series is a must-play. All games are enjoyable even though generic some times. A great inspiration for a history lover.. The story evolves from the first game but the gameplay not so much, its a little bit below the predecessor but its one of the best AC ever made. The second best AC game. Compelling narrative and Ezio continues to be a strong character. Ends with a killer cliffhanger.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. The best Assassin's Creed game out of the ones I have played (II, III, Brotherhood, Unity, Black Flag), the story is interesting, the voice acting is solid, the gameplay is incredibly fun with a world that is both immersive and memorable and its just a fantastic game overall that I couldn't put down.. To this day, still easily one of my favourite games of all time. The music, the open world, the characters, gameplay, story, EVERYTHING. Absolutely legendary. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. More of the same. It's Assasin's Creed 2 recycled. Same graphics, mechanics, playabiliy. Its highest point was incrediblely continuing the amazing Ezio's story. Although being a extension of AC II, keeps funny and explorative as his predecessor. Good game, essential for knowing game's story, even innovating anything.. Assassin Creed Brotherhood continúa de la segunda parte al poco instante donde termina. Es más una expansión y la pelea es con Cesar Borgia aunque vemos a su hermana primero. Se observa el reclutamiento de nuevos miembros para la hermandad, las misiones secundarias no son mucha cosa, pero te dan más cosas por hacer. Se termina con un acto del protagonista Desmond Miles que impresiona y desagrada al mismo tiempo. In English Assassin Creed Brotherhood continues from the second part to the little instant where it ends. It is more an expansion and the fight is with Cesar Borgia although we see his sister first. The recruitment of new members for the brotherhood is observed, the secondary missions are not much, but they give you more things to do. It ends with an act by the protagonist Desmond Miles that impresses and displeases at the same time.. My personal 3rd favourite game of all time and second favourite game from the assassins creed series, it's time to review Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood: Pros: -Great story, good continuation of what AC 2 started with an amazing set of characters including: Ezio Auditore da Firenze -Big improvements in gameplay over AC2 with Borgia towers to liberate, horseback riding in cities, an awesome recruitment system with your assassin's, more weapons, more kills, improved (but a bit easier) combat system and parkour improvements. -LOADS to do. Synchronisation points, Borgia towers, war machine missions, Templar agent missions, Tombs, Lots of shops to renovate, landmarks to buy and more. - Modern day with Desmond miles expanded -Optional objectives added -The ability to replay missions - Awesome twist ending - Loads of collectibles for the ones looking for stuff to find. -Outstsnding soundtrack and good graphics Cons: -You assassin recruits are a bit over powered with the arrow storm (an ability which kills all guards on the screen) -Your horse can only gallop in certain missions: SLOWEST HORSE EVER - Optional objectives can be a pain to complete sometimes In the end: Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics/Sound design: 9/10 Overall: 9/10. I recently finished AC: Brotherhood and I thought it is a very good game. AC: Brotherhood had a long and immersive story with an awesome ending boss battle. I found the ability to recruit and training your own personal Assassin's was a cool new feature and they have helped me get out of a jam more then once. I also like the new armor and weapons, especially the crossbow. That weapon really helped me out with stealth missions. I also liked how everything you do was all in one city, Rome, instead having to travel to multiple cities. The down sides of the game for me were the sometimes ridiculous full synchronization challenges and some of the missions. Otherwise I give a 8.5 for AC: Brotherhood. Assassin's Creed II remains my favorite in the series but Brotherhood is my now second favorite. I recommend this game for fans of the Assassin's Creed series.. this is how you make a series of games. Mind you this should've been the last of the Ezio games. They took what made AC2 a great game and improved it, this game is amazing. tons of secrets and items to found, great side quests, great storyline and great characters. Just an amazing and fun game.. Tied with AC2 for best AC game. Rome was very well designed and fun to rome around in ;). Also the addition of the brotherhood and being able to call in assassins mid combat was a really good addition.. Launched myself off the Coliseum and missed the the hay. Remember the scene in Groundhog Day when Bill Murray's character experiments with suicide? Been there, done that. Correction: Ezio has been there, done that, while possessed by me. I have a real love/hate relationship with this game. It's like playing an 18-hole golf on the most epic course in the world, and getting rained on at hole 15, unable to finish the game. I so wanted to quit from about the halfway point onward but had committed too many hours into it and wanted to see it to the end. The controls are erratic and extremely frustrating, when Ezio just WILL. NOT. FREAKING. GO. WHERE. YOU. WANT. I had to be very, very patient in order to not rip the disc out and frisbie it across the room and then take a mallet and break it into a million little pieces and then melt them down in the fire, after the umpteenth time Ezio jumped into the middle **** of guards instead of up to the next ledge as I'd wanted him to. I controlled my frustration, became Zen with the game, recruited my brotherhood, and went on a killing spree throughout Rome. The endgame is extremely rewarding, but it was a parting gift at best after all the violent arguments we'd had. But, it was best that we separate then and there.. Neither as good as ACII, nor as ""bad"" as ACIII. The story is necessary for understanding the saga but it feels a bit unnecessary. The best part is that they maintained the glyphs.. Another excellent story in the life of Ezio, who is just as loveable as he was before. Brotherhood also adds a never before seen multiplayer mode to the Assassin's Creed franchise, that is surprisingly addictive.. i consider the best game of saga, that was overcome by the black flag what was launched 3 years after. The gameplay is perfect, the game has hours and hours of gameplay, all is beautiful and person was getting better, at its best, Ezio is the most beloved saga.. The story wasn't as strong in AC Brotherhood, but it further expanded on it's gameplay elements with tons of new content. The location being set in Rome felt just as fresh as it did in AC2.. Don't get me wrong or think i'm a hater/troll. I love the AC games and their unique story in fact this game will deliver you some story that'll help you understand the 3rd one more. Its just that this game is basically an overpriced DLC for AC2. It played exactly the same way except this time Ezio can be a big whig Assassin CEO that makes all of his grunt workers do everything being killed in the process while he ponders where he'll take his next vacation and decide if he wants the prime rib or lobster..... HELL GET BOTH!!! I love ubisoft and they are one of the good guys in developers who listen to their community but I think this time they were needing some money at the end of the year to fund new games so they released this knowing that people like myself would buy it. The only thing this game gets a 10 at is multiplayer. If you're sick of playing shooters and want something more innovative in a MP then you should give this one a try and just wiki the story to save ya some time. I did in fact really enjoy this game but again it was a little too easy and a lot of the time just felt like I was playing a massive expansion of assassin's creed 2 rather than a new title.. Brotherhood is a nice continuation of the storyline established in AC2. Ezio is older, has more responsibilities and the new brotherhood task management is a nice addition. A real shame that BH simply rehashes everything else and does little to expand on the previous games. It was nice to see the Desmond sections getting more attention and now actually feel like a part of the game. Desmond and friends actually feel important this time round. Also Desmond steps up and becomes a rather important character to the series (before I just saw him as a plot device.) The story is still riveting, leading you deeper and deeper into the complex tale and I can not fault the writing at all. Characters are the same, just older, as they were in the last game. If anything, my only real gripe with this game is that it doesn't really take as much of a leap in innovation like AC2 did from AC1. That aside, it's still allot of fun. Overall: More of the same, but that isn't a bad thing, just a shame as they could have done more with it.. in terms of story this game don't surpass the assassin's creed 2,but in terms of open world,graphics and secondary missions the brothehood takes the best.. It's superb. This should be a game to play and rate for 2010. This game came up with better storyline, graphics, gameplay, game mechanics and many more. I have enjoyed it. This game's superior **** worth every penny.. Well implemented characterization, decent voice acting and some pretty nice gameplay additions, Brotherhood did just enough to come out of the shadow of Assassin's Creed II. Ezio is a likeable character and the Brotherhood adds a nice new depth to the storyline. While the training could be somewhat ****, it's not too laborious to put you off. An enjoyable experience from start to finish.. This is my favorite Assassin's Creed game to date. Brotherhood takes everything that made the first two Assassin's Creed great and refines them to a point of perfection. The city of Rome is large and is full of secrets and side missions. The story is, in my opinion, the last good story in the Assassin's Creed games (Revelations and 3 were disappointing). Your new abilities are awesome, such as running an Assassin Brotherhood and being able to use crossbows. It's just a very well done, well polished game.. A new entry providing little innovation from it's predecessor that could also be considered as a standalone expansion rather than a new game. It suffers from a small environment only giving players the chance to explore one city rather than several different ones. On the bright side it is the first game that allows the player to start they're own assassins guild. 7 out of 10. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the best Assassin's Creed game that I have played (granted that I have only played this and the first game). The combination of multi-player and single-player is great. The campaign was a little confusing for me due to the fact that I didn't play Assassin's Creed 2, but once i got the general gist if what was happening I enjoyed it even more. While the campaign is great, I didn't really care for most of the side missions. The combat, while it is good, isn't all that different and doesn't change itself throughout the game as it should. The multi-player is awesome and absurdly unique. You are hunting down and assassin while other assassins are hunting you down. With progression in levels, you unlock more abilities and makes the re-play value very high. Assasssin's Creed: Brotherhood is much better than the first Assassin's Creed game. I can't compare it to the rest of the series since I haven't played them, but they all seem the same.. I scored this game a 9 out of 10. This is because while it is more of an ""expandalone"" game it takes what AC2 did and improves on it in nearly every area. The UI is vastly improved, the combat engine is not anywhere near as frustrating to play with, movement and the other gameplay elements are now fun to actually do instead of just irritating. I easily had the most fun playing this game of all the AC games. Sadly, while Ezio remains as engaging and interesting a character, this game is neither as funny as AC2 nor is it as engaging in terms of the storyline. Which is why it doesn't get the 10 out of 10 score. The universe remains interesting and deep however. Best AC game period. Go buy it now.. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood took everything that made Assassin's Creed 2 great and amplified it several times over. Brotherhood is probably the best of the entire series (not my favorite, but it is the best) and added several things in the game play. Being in charge **** of Assassins and being able to use them in combat was a plus. Being able to innovate the entire city of Rome instead of just a small villa is also another thing I liked and there are so many side quests that it adds hours of fun to the game and I highly recommend it. My problem with it is how combat driven it is. There are stealth missions in the game, but the focal point is primarily on the combat rather than stealth. The reason I bought Assassin's Creed. Other than that, it's an awesome game and worth playing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood"" is a sequel to ""Assassin's Creed 2"" and continues the story of Ezio. Game takes place mainly in Rome, that has much to discover and explore. There is not much of new comparing to the second game, but yet the game improves combat gameplay. Some fighting scenes were difficult, for some reason scene in Coliseum doesn't leave my mind. The game had much new stuff for multiplayer gamers. If you are not into online gaming, still you'll have much to do in singleplayer campaign. Story is not a strong side of ""Assassin's Creed"" (I'm not saying anything about AC III, it was terrific) and here I felt it again, boredom after first half of the game. After playing through ""Brotherhood"" you'll have a feeling, that it is just an addition to the game, too big for DLC, but not a standalone game. Yet, worth its money.. (Out of 10) Game play: 95 Dialog: 96 Campaign: 98 Pacing: 95 Graphics: 95 Free roam: 99 Multi player: 89 Replay rate: 100 Overall: 94 Assassins creed brotherhood is an impressive installment to the AC franchise. A very solid game.. perfect graphics 10 perfect game play 10 great story 9.5 great soundtracks 9.5 ------ EPIC ------ what we could ask more from this game to get back in history walking on the streets of old Italy with the awesome Ezio. Really enjoyed the single player and the multiplayer had great ideas but the servers took longer than a black person walkin on the road they never go by the rules. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a fantastic sequel to AC2. But know it as that: a sequel, and be careful about expecting tons more over what you've found in the first two iterations of this game series. Brotherhood refines the series more than redefining it. The assassin's guild is a cool addition and Ubisoft did find a compelling way to continue the storyline. But beware, as the closing acts of this game become a little harder to follow. The story jumping comes off as more disconnected than a cool storytelling element. All things considered, you'll enjoy the entire package, now with multiplayer mode, and get over any shortcomings you feel the game may have.. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an unmitigated triumph, taking the superlative groundwork laid by its forebear and building upon it. That you're confined to Rome is never an issue, as it's a vast and seamlessly sprawling, cohesive environment. Rebuilding the city and driving out the Borgia is about as compulsive as gaming gets and chances are, you'll sit glued to the game throughout and feverishly complete every Subject 16 puzzle, collect every item and refurbish every shop, aqueduct, faction building and underground tunnel you come across. Achingly beautiful to behold and incredible to play, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood will be the best Roman holiday you'll ever have.. I confess, I wasn't a fan of the previous AC titles. In fact, I hated number one and played two for an hour or so. It amazes me that I'm enjoying AC Brotherhood and if it wasn't for the wife wanting the tv on, I'd be playing right now! Graphically it's top drawer, sound is deep and menacing, story (which I'm not familiar with) is interesting, controls (my biggest bug bear from AC1) are much improved (combat still confuses at times) and the setting of Rome is brimming with atmosphere. I exchanged Need For Speed Hot Pursuit for AC3 (NFSHP is one of the biggest disappointments of the year) and I'm so glad I did. I highly recommend this game.. On a replay, I love this game. It was always good, but it's unspeakably better since experiencing Revelations and coming back to it. The comparison between the two made ALL the difference. The story is good and works as a solid extension on the second game, though the excuse for making Ezio earn weapons and armour from the beginning feels a bit forced and cheap. The integration of familiar characters is spectacular and had me emotionally engaged throughout both in Ezio's AND Desmond's stories. The big drawbacks for me are the cut and paste, but less successful, equivalents of assassin's tombs (they're fine, but less exciting and make less sense the second time around), and the way in which you're rushed through the end section of the game. Glyph puzzles are present, and though the intros from Subject 16 are sorely missed, they're still as creepy, cryptic and strangely informative as ever. While it doesn't match up to the quality of Assassin's Creed 2 in my mind, it's still a game more than worth buying.. This game was great, I enjoyed playing through the new addition to the Assassin's Creed world, however I didn't feel like it improved much upon Assassin's Creed II, nevertheless, I would still recommend it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brotherhood continues the story of Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, and also Dezmond. If you have not played any of the others then you would not understand the story of this game to well. The game play is about the same as the second one. You can loot people, shoot guards with your hidden gun, hire mercenaries, and many other similar features. The story mode is not near as long as the Assassin's Creed II . I would say it is about half as long. So if you are someone that's looking for a long single player game, look elsewhere. The graphics in this game are great. I believe that this game has the best water graphics. When you look at the water it looks real. The multiplayer increased this games replay value. Running around with your friends and killing people is great. The best mode by far is Manhunt. In manhunt four players try to hunt another four players that are hiding. The hiding team gets points by hiding and stunning the hunters; the hunting team gets point by killing the other team. Their are different abilities that affect your player. Several abilities are the hidden gun, smoke bomb, charge, changing NPC's to look like what you are, and many others. Wanted is another popular game mode for online play. This is where players face off each other and everyone has a specific target to kill. It changes overtime and so you will always have someone hunting you while you are trying to hunt down someone else yourself. While you are playing the game you level up and gain new abilities, new characters to play as, different colors, and more game modes. The only thing I did not like about the multiplayer is that you can only rank up to level fifty. Once you get to the max level that's it. You will soon stop playing the multiplayer because their is no sense of accomplishment. (They should have included some sort of prestige system like in the recent Call of Duty games). The main component that makes this game great is the multiplayer. The story is good too, but you must play the previous ones before.. I'm a huge fan of the AC series though I was concerned about this game. I must say this game doesn't disappoint. It takes everything AC 2 did well and improves on them. The combat is better, the movement is better, and while I don't think the story is better than AC 2, it does set up AC 3 because of all the Desmond stuff and the Ezio stuff is still fun to do. I really liked all the meta game stuff that they added in AC 2 and brotherhood does that stuff but just does it better. The multiplayer is actually pretty fun as well. This is a must own for any AC fan but players new to AC will probably be lost story wise, so they will need to play the first 2 AC games to understand what's going on. AC; Brotherhood get a 9 from me.. This game is fully dependent on what type of gamer you are: multiplayer or campaign, graphics or gameplay. This game was mildly appealing for the first month i owned it, then i traded it in. I focus on multiplayer and graphics for these games and shooters. This game has sub-par graphics, fine multiplayer, and fine gameplay and campaign. Buy with caution.... At first I had my doubts with this game because I was thinking that this going to be a cheap spin-off , but when I played I realized that is good as Assassin's Creed 2. Also, it features multiplayer games wich have some really good free DLC. A must if you liked the previous one!. I thought it was th","Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an improvement to AC 2 but doesn't hit the highs like AC 2 did . the game's multiplayer mode was an unexpected gem, adding layers of tension and strategy that no other game had offered . the storyline weaves historical events with fictional intrigue so seamlessly that it feels like a cinematic experience ."
403.Left 4 Dead 2,"One of the most innovative zombie shooters out there. Still fresh 10 years later. Valve created a masterpiece with this one. Very high replayability. Left 4 Dead 2 is an undeniably Fun game and continues to be a gold standard many zombie run and guns are compared to now. Even ignoring Good old nostalgia, as a game alone the mechanics are simple and easy to understand, as well with the simple story that the games lays out, perfect for a game of this distinction. The only Knocks I can give to this is game is that The campaign is a bit unclear about where you’re supposed to be going at times and that from a campaign experience is quite short. All in all a 4/5 for story and a 5/5 for gameplay, Definitely recommend!. Coach is the goat.coach is the goat.coach is the goat.coach is the goat.coach is the goat.coach is the goat.coach is the goat. Best multiplayer game of all time with so many fun options that just expand from the original. Fantastic zombie action game one of my favorite that always refreshes itself with reply of every campaign the only thing i don't like is Rochelle and the difficulty spikes in difficulty while i like a challenging game it becomes no longer fun. LEFT hand. Used to be 4 fingers. It's DEAD. There's 2 fingers remaining. Left 4 Dead 2.. The game that never gets old. It is a gem for a bunch of friends to play at their spare time.. This game will always remain a classic cooperative zombie shooter to look up to.. Left 4 Dead 2 left like the first ""small game"" to have a huge impact. While not quite Halo or COD this was another must own game for middle school in the late 2000s. Adding in the original Left 4 Dead maps was a great idea and the game still gets the update or two every once in a while. Despite it no longer being available on the Xbox Marketplace, it is definitely worth it if you get your hands on a physical copy. 'nuff said, it's a great game. Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna be busy being a one-man cheeseburger apocalypse. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gunplay is amazing, is great with friends and its ok-ish in singleplayer. Singleplayer is really great for new players to gain experience! Plus its dirt cheap.. the best zombie shooting game. So good enough. Classic 2010s valve magic. Expansive co-op zombie shooter that is good in it's base form, and gets much better thanks to the mods you can install, which can make your regular run much more fun and hilarious.. i really enjoyed this game, detailed character, fun with friends, gamemodes and with a workshop?! this game is really fun.. They need to remaster these games for the new generation of consoles or make a thrid third installment. Fans like myself have been waiting years to hear something about Left 4 dead 3. Have so much love for this game it’s truly something incredible. It’s a timeless classic, even 15 years past release date you can easily find multiple multi player games for each campaign. The versus mode has sadly become full of try hard **** over the past few years, newer players would never be able to experience a game of versus without getting kicked for falling 0.2 seconds behind the team or missing an instant kill spot. The current players on versus mode leave no room for new players or less experienced players to experience such an amazing unique and fun game mode. The character are more rounded than the L4D1 survivors. The voice lines are fun and there’s so many secret dialogue hanging around the game just waiting to be discovered by picking up different weapons or just interacting with your teammates. I don’t think I will ever become tired of this game, simply incredible and is still up to todays standard despite its age.. this one is better then the first one great game and valve did left 4 dead 2 great good maps and zombie types overall just a great one. Matthew Alexander ""Matt"" Sinegar [SIN-NA-GAR] (An EXTREMELY Mature & EXTREMELY Heterosexual (Straight) African-American/Black Man): Left 4 Dead 2 Is LITERALLY Still One Of My All-Time Favorite Horror Games.. Left 4 Dead 2 is a more complete game than its predecessor. While the gameplay remains the same, it features more of everything. You get more weapons, zombies and multiplayer modes. The campaign is longer too. If you love gory zombie-themed shooters, you'll love this. It's a great mix of cooperative and competitive matches. A true Valve classic. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. Violence isn’t the answer. It’s the question. And the answer is YES.. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be gray Put your picture on my wall It reminds me, that it's not so bad It's not so bad My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be gray Put your picture on my wall It reminds me, that it's not so bad It's not so bad Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin' I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin' Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em But anyways, **** it, what's been up?

I thought Left 4 Dead 2 would become a failure after Valve stated after the original game dropped they would put out lot of DLC packs for L4D. When I heard that L4D2 was announced less than a year after L4D, I thought it would be a horrible game but nope. The game is great with hilarious characters, cool environments, and LOTS OF ZOMBIES!!!! All the guns are fun to use & all the types of special zombies make this co-op game great. Thanks to the modding community, we can create completely quirky & incredible maps for all types of players.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Amazing Story.......................Good Score.....................Great. Best Game Ever!!! Tons of replay ability and still has a ton of dedicated players.. L4D2 is a one of a kind game, because of the vs & I hope that they remastered it or make L4D3 & it's the best online 360 game todate. Although it's basically the same as its predecessor, it delivers the same amount of zombie-killing fun!. Left 4 Dead 2 is basically the original game but improved in every single way.. Well, the final Left 4 Dead game before Turtle Rock left Valve in 2011 to pursue new projects. L4D2 is, first and foremost, and blast to play. The gunplay is great, the HUD design is solid, and the art style really fits in the atmosphere of these games. The many zombie variants is cool, and the new weapons thrown in the mix are fun to use too. This game is a blast to play cooperatively, and solo too. However, the story isn't all that interesting or well told, and the gameplay, while being very good, isn't quite rock solid enough for the game to fall back on. Aside from that, L4D2 is a very fun game, but I'd say you should get it for a max of 15$.. Hours and hours of fun. This game features a variety of gamemodes and is very easy to get into, especially with friends. Versus mode is extremely fun and is surprising competitive. However, beginners should beware of online play (versus mode specifically) until they get better at the game. Sometimes people take the game really seriously and will vote to kick those who are not as skilled. Besides this, there still are a lot of people who will work with beginners and help each other survive. I strongly suggest you purchase the DLCs as well if you buy Left 4 Dead 2.. Left for dead is a really fun coop survival zombie game. The gameplay feels a little bit like doom, but its still pretty soild. The single player mode is the best part, especially if you play with a friend. The multiplayer is decent, but still isn't as good as the single player.. An amazing hack-n-slash game that truly defines it's genre. However, only 10 hours in I couldn't help but to find myself skipping missions and eventually skipped to the last.. AH ZAWMBEE GAJME!!!11! Nah for real this time! Left 4 Dead 2 is a very improved version of the previous installment: well, Left 4 Dead! With a couple of things like more melee weapons, improved graphics, etc. Let's see what this gem has for us shall we? First off: The storyline, it's not super special but it gets things done by following a new group of survivors that consists of: Good guy Nick, Bumpah'-carz-Ellis, Worst-kind-of-lawyer-Rochelle, and that one coach dude from punch-out. As i said, it's not fantastic and you'll have to use your imagination if you want to make this the remarkable masterpiece you want it to be. The graphics are still the classic, **** if you are playing on a computer that can't render the graphics that are compareable with xbox 360 titles (i am referring to the Steam version of the game) Soundtrack is fitting, it plays suspense tunes when you're in, let's say ""a pickle"" and plays like buttah' The weapons are relatively balanced with the exeption of shotguns that are just way too slow when surrounded by a horde of lunatics. Left 4 Dead 2 also has a really realistic physics engine.... yeah, Source... kind of. It varies in physics between Valve games apparently. Ok, i don't have much more important to say so here's a summary: Pros: 1) Plays smoothly, the AI is well programmed and the special infected are hella' precise. 2) Soundtrack is immersive and fitting. 3) Storyline is kind of interesting, especially if you have read the L4D Sacrifice comic. 4) Easter eggs and achievements are both very fun to accomplish and find Cons: 1) Glitches and bugs can ruin your experience 2) Online play **** *ss 3) The new gamemodes are complete ****, they are hard,confusing, and don't add as much to the average experience In short, this is a very interesting game, i've always seen zombies as an interesting subject and this game gets it right in getting me immersed in the **** that's upon you, and three other **** or either overpowered AI's. In other words, this game gets the score: ""I can dig it"". Great game if ONLY PLAYED ONLINE. I say that because when you play offline there is not that much to do and you would feel alone, but if played online it is this very fun and addictive game. The story was really bad but the zombies and the great atmosphere was amazing to play with friends or other zombie slayers.. Woah. This game is fun, addictive and you can play in multiplayer. Perfect for messing around and having a laugh if you enjoy blasting zombies' heads off! (Let's be honest know, who doesn't?) Though not as good as DOOM, the fps genre still rocks here, and I will always consider this game one of the best.. A fun co-op first-person shooter from Valve. It is very team focused and is rather uninteresting if played alone. A worthwhile experience for those who enjoy co-op games.. The new Left 4 Dead instalment adds little to its predecessor but still bring the joy and addictiveness found within the previous game. slightly updated graphics, new maps, players, weapons and enemies will continue to have you on the edge of your seat. You will have a joy playing with your friends and this is still where the game is at its strongest. One of the best zombie games to date.. Agh where do I start. Okay before you read this I love the original Left 4 Dead zombies, forced to use team work to kick undead ass, and play as a zombie to kick living ass sign me up."" Okay *sigh* Left 4 Dead 2 is a huge disappointment for me. First it's like the original with a fresh new coat of paint. Next is that it didn't do anything different, it did add umm let me see FOUR or FIVE new guns(I'll talk about melee weapons later) I mean for real and all they are is a upgraded version that felt like the original weapons just with a different name and shape. As for the special thing in the game is the melee weapons one thing, if you implanted them in this why diD'T THEY ADD IT IN THE ORIGINAL. I'm not kidding they felt like something missing in the original, also the DLC that included the original survivors made this more true. Also the versus is down right broken, survivors damage you quickly, and playing as the survivors it's frustrating cause your team get destroyed easy, and the new infected are just plain boring with the exception of the Jocky. However there is some redeeming factors, one I liked one new game type called Realism. It's really creative to think of it, in this mode there is no glow around items and teammates so if they get incapacitated you really wouldn't know where they are, also the zombies can not killed instantly with a body shot with a strong weapon like the sniper rifle instead you do more damage if you shot them in the head,*classic* because of the new mode it improved the score a bit. From a company like VAVLE I thought I would be more impressed but this is just wow just wow.. This is probably the finest co-op game out there. The gameplay is perfectly balanced to the difficulty you choose, punishing you if you mess up, tweaking the difficulty depending on your performance; the AI director is great for the pacing. The vs mode is the surprise winner. The strategy needed to defeat the other team is incredibly rewarding, pulling off a perfect infected attack injects adrenaline straight to your joy department. The only problem is playing without allies, but that shouldn't be popular for such a popular game.. Such a dissappointment. First, the good stuff. The melee weapons are really cool, and I liked using the machete, axe and guitars the most. It's fun online and has a lot of extra modes. Now with what I don't like. The sniper is poorly balenced and acts like an accurate shotgun. The story is almost none existant and the game is very boring if playing alone. But the fun when playing with friends makes it an 8/10. It's Left 4 Dead again, but with new guns, melee weapons, more hilarious characters, better maps and just more fun in general. If you like Left 4 Dead, you're going to absolutely love this game.. Don't like it, just zombie hordes, boring... I played split screen with my friend, so the game play was more fun. still, can't never played it by myself alone, too boring..... I love this game. The difficulty of this game doesn't belong in the AI of the zombies but yourself and teammates. You could play on easy and get demolished if you're just fooling around. The very few weapons that was added isn't much and enough to complain about that there aren't enough weapons for the zombie shooter. The new infected feel generic but easily liked because they pulled them off. Melee weapons added are very very awesome, it upgraded the game twice. though it is fun, I don't think it will get any better than a 7 for me.. This game is alright. Nothing special. Personally i LOVE Zombies! But this game was kind of disappointing, it is fun to play at times but i found myself feeling like i had to work my way through levels to survive and it wasn't as fun as i thought. Plus the first person view is WAY too close you can barely see what is happening around you. Overall this game isn't terrible but in my opinion it's only worth a rent.. As with the original Left 4 Dead 2 sees players take on the role of one of four survivors just after the outbreak that turned most of the population into either zombies or even more powerful mutants. The game leads these Survivors through the south-eastern region of the US bringing the level of dramatic co-op players have come to expect. The game has been criticised in some quarters for being released within a year of the original but it certainly refines the formula enough to justify its existence. For starters there is a greater number of versus modes and the timed survival mode, that only came as a download in the first game, is now available right off the bat. With the introduction of new enemy types teamwork is also more vital than ever before. Wandering of alone is usually a pretty sure way to get yourself killed. Fortunately new weapons are also available including melee weapons. These weapons range from the weak crowbar to swords that can decapitate three or four zombies at once and really bring an extra dimension to the gameplay. Furthermore the main campaign is also better realised with some excellent set pieces. This all contributes to another fantastic multiplayer experience from Valve.. I love story about zombie and left 4 dead 2 is really impressive game .This game got best coop ever.I play this game 2 years and still not boring me!!. I never found Valve's ""Left 4 Dead"" to be a great game. Entertaining? Yes. Challenging? Yes. Innovative? To a certain point. But the overall product still lacked a certain panache. It was too limited and too restrictive as if the makers didn't have the time or money to deliver a full product. But just one year later, Valve released this sequel which didn't suffer from the same limitations. By making a few minor adjustments and adding some much needed content, the company had created one of the great XBOX Live experiences. ""Left 4 Dead 2"" may be just a team-based arcade-like shooter, but it is a great one. In fact, it may be the best zombie game I've ever played. The brilliantly conceived cooperative and competitive modes are both fast-paced and intense and require strong team efforts to win. Versus is the best mode, in which two teams of four (survivors vs. zombies) are pitted against each other within a campaign chapter. L4D 2 also features Realism mode which amps up the campaign's difficulty, a horde mode (Survival) and Scavenger, a take on Capture the Flag. ""Left 4 Dead 2"" is a great tactical game with fun characters, plenty of gore and a nice variety of weapons. It's one of 2009's best games. 9.5 out of 10. Left 4 Dead 2 is pretty much the same as the first one, except for the better wepons and graphics. But other than that its the same. No suspene, no other survivors, and no cutscenes.. i love this game hope the 3rd left 4 dead in work but love zombies killing but what wrong with game australia ban this game censored it!!! but i got uncut version i love this one more gore more action. censored version got less gore not good action. but how ever uncut more gore festive. I thought that this game was really amazing. The fact that the game is fast paced makes it even better. Roaming through the towns, cities, streets, buildings, roads, highways, and even forests facing zombies and ""special"" undead. You can find guns and melee weapons in all of the levels. I gave this game a 10 because it deserved it for the graphics, gameplay, plot, easy controls, and challenging but really fun levels.. This game needs some work. When i say work i mean WORK!!!!!!! I kinda like it. But it needs work on graphics. If you like zombies, then you might want this game it is ok for its price. But the first one ****!!!!!!. As a player i don't feel im abandoned by the developers in: the multiplayer experience for example, there are a lot of people playing it, I dont feel the developers created this videogame to only profit, always updating, there is a visual and history essence un compared to all other ""last humans on earth"".. A very good game and again another master piece . New characters which was nice. New zombies was very cool and much more guns and melee weapons which was a very nice touch to it. Many game modes are back and a few new ones as well. Campaigns 9/10 The old modes 8/10 The new modes 8/10 Left 4 Dead 2 8.7/10. The people on the PC version are cooperative and helpful. Don't bother with the console version; the other people ruin what is an amazing game with lack of teamwork.. Really fun and awesome reply value. Story lacking, not enough dialogue, but really fun multiplayer, dynamic levels with differing items, special infected, and common hoardes.. This game was AWESOME !! but to bad i traded my left 4 dead 2 for prototype and pkm pearl. This game is one of the best i highly recommend it. Disappointed to say the least. I've loved Valve right up to this point with Left 4 Dead. L4D was good, but nothing special to me, and then this mod came out and I lost all hope in Valve ever really redeeming themselves in the next 5 years.... Okay, this is a Modern Review of this game. Since there has been many DLC's to change gameplay. I will like all my other reviews, put in three categories about the gameplay, multiplayer, and campaign. Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is fantastic. It's very well done compared to the original Left 4 Dead 2. The graphics are touched nicely but it has some slight bugs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Multiplayer: The multiplayer has 7 different modes with the returning Versus, Survival and Campaign. Left 4 Dead 2 has also added other game modes such as Scavenge, Realism, Mutation (DLC) Versus Realism (DLC) This game was meant for more then one player, which it obviously shows in the gameplay. Overall, the Multiplayer faction of this game is near perfect, with some lag issues from its dedicated servers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Campaign: Okay, lets all admit, this game as a very feeble storyline. The story is, four survivors (Ellis, Nick, Coach, and Rochelle) are abandoned at a rescue center in the middle of the apocolypse. This causes them to fight through the 6 campaigns (1 is a DLC, there are also two other campaigns which come from a DLC with the original Left 4 Dead.) against thousands (Literally) of infected, with 7 types of Special infected. These special infected have various abilities. The 7 infected are: Smoker, Hunter, Witch, Boomer, Tank, Jockey, Spitter and Charger. All 7 have various abilities customed to fit their own roles. ----------------------------------------------------------------- I rate this game a 9. The gameplay is very good and playing versus is increadibly fun. Unfortunely the community killed this game. Most of the players don't know what word ''teamwork'' means at all, making playing this game increadibly annoying to play. If you can run this game fine on computer, buy this game to it. Avoid Xbox 360 port at all cost.. Awesome environments, characters, weapons and some of the most addictive gameplay I've ever come across. The graphics aren't the best around even when it came out and the frame rate dips so it isn't perfect but in my opinion it's the best zombie game around.. Probably one of the more addicting games out there, it's hard not to love Left 4 Dead 2. Most people think it's a rushed sequel to a great game and that it fails in comparison to the original, but in almost every category Left 4 Dead 2 is better. The only think that Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't measure up to Left 4 Dead in is characters. In L4D, we had memorable characters who had real life to them but in this game, they seem almost as dead as the zombies. Other than that, L4D2 shines above L4D. More maps at launch, tougher difficulties, more game modes, new infected, weekly updates, you can't go wrong.. A very fun and addicting game with better weapons and more pickups then the first. Multiplayer is very fun and balanced although it can get laggy at times. Overall one of the best zombie games out there.. First off, I love this game, and everything about it, the art style, the voices, the characters and the maps, all great. In this installment all of the campaigns link up, and make sense (if you play them in the correct order that is) which is a vast improvement from the previous title. The addition of the new infect characters really add a different swing into your play, as you now have to take into account the spitter, which can deal great deals of damage to stationary players and the charger, which can and will boul through your team and split you up as you try to navigate your way to the safe room. The best thing about this game is the competitive edge that the Versus mode gives you, and the ability to play as the infected is a great experience.. While multiplayer has seen quite a bit of updating, Pretty much everything is the same. Short campaign with no replay value, The exact same gameplay with no difference what so ever, Decent graphics that are poorly designed. Left 4 Dead 2 doesnt impress as much as the first game does.. I do not see how this game deserves a 8.9 in user scores. This game is a average FPS with unlimited ammo and weak zombies. Single player is boring and graphics are disappointing and repeating. Multiplayer is better if you play it with friends, but same goes with any other multiplayer. I did not like this game, even though I am fan of Half Life and Resident Evil series.. Awesome Zombie killing game like the first one it was alot of fun. L4D2 has new zombies that catch you by suprise and can make you jump, like when you hear a tank coming it still makes your heart raise, gore was awesome, head shots were satisfying. Maps were great. Still wish they had more female charaters :l sure did miss the old charatersas well. But all in all a great game. this is my all time favorite game, great weapons, great grahpics and a lot of fun to play with freinds or online. Im happy to say i loved this game i bought this game with high hopes of a fun zombie shooter and i was granted that with this just amazingly fun game. Ok to start off the best part of this game is the co op ive never had more fun in co op ever. Next the characters are such a great batch of zombie killers. next the guns, they were fun to use and great to shoot. and finally the many different chapters and maps make the game a reallf fun time and a great chance you will want to play again.. This game is a tiny bit better than the first, an achievement only met by few games. The campaigns are old-school, and the characters and weapons are much better than the first collection. Valve has a tradition of putting developer commentary on their games, and I played thru the campaign with the dev commentary, as I always do. It enhanced my experience, and I suggest this game to anyone.. For a long while, Team Fortress 2 was my favourite Live game, with it's varied character classes and Pixar-esque graphical style. The along came Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 offers TF2 style variety, and then some. Taking the class-based formulae and filling it with BRAAAAAAAAIIIIIINNNNNSSSS, L4D2 is a near-perfect multiplayer game, that any self respecting game should play. It's a really solid shooter, firstly, as playing as the survivors is just as fun as being the zombies, thanks to fun weapons and grenades. And then I move on to the zombies themselves, who play the more tactical game. Survivors cling together to survive, while the zombies get to choose crafty spawn points to suit their classes particular skills. The Boomer, a puking, fat zombie that can cause a huge hoard of common infected to attack the survivors, either by puking on them or exploded on them. There's also the Spitter, who throws a great big acid patch onto the floor, damaging the survivors and, if your particularly crafty, netting you a few Achievements. There's also the Smoker and Hunter, the former dragging survivors to there death with his huge tongue, while the latter climbs onto rooftops before leaping onto survivors and ripping them to pieces. The Charger and the Tank are sort of similar, as the Charger is a hulking brute who grabs survivors and pummels them, while the Tank just generally throws rocks and smacks survivors into oblivion. The last playable Infected is the Jockey, who jumps onto survivors and drives them into the zombies, causing said survivor to become a mound of flesh and blood. The single player campaign is also enjoyable enough, but it's far superior in co-op, with all it's zombie shooting, grenade throwing, with stalking shenanigans. Ah yes, the Witch. The Witch is a fast, powerful Infected who if you startle will kill you or knock you down, and then you will have to rely on your fellow survivors to help you. With is the point of the game really-teamwork. It forces you to work with your friends for a truly great survival-based multiplayer game, whilst being both addictive and satisfying.. This is my favorite **** newer special infected are so much harder to fight that it just makes me want to play the game more so i can challennge myself. This game is great for multiplyier and a blast to play onine!. Takes L4D1 and makes it so much better. The graphics are improved dramatically and so is the gameplay experience. The scenarios are much more intense - such as a flaming apartment building (or is it a hotel?). The new special infected add a sense of more caution, or if you're good enough, at the very least, a sense of more excitement. Just about everything in this game is better than the first - even the music is better. The multiplayer and online experiences are much funner and are more of a challenge. This Left 4 Dead is worth buying way more than the first one, and this is one of Valve's greatest gaming achievements. Not only as a game, but as an experience - this one can literally change substantially each time you play, while the first one only has subtle changes that don't directly affect gameplay greatly. This is one of my favorite zombie games ever made, if not my favorite.. Multiplayer! cooperative or competitive! Teamwork actually means something here. You can do more than just shoot guns. Controlling special abilitied Zombies is a unique experience. To call this a first person shooter almost seems like an insult because it has more different qualities than nearly all other hogwash coming down the pipe. Not incredibly different from L4D1, but a few new special infected and melee weapons and **** worth it. Lots of polish, lots of fun...online scavenge mode rocks! You not only feel like a member of your team, you need to be and they need to be yours or your brains will get eaten. Bottom line...possibly the best teamwork oriented game ever, certainly the best with a still thriving community.. This is one of the best game ever. Plenty of fun with friends and a very enjoyable versus mode. The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I've seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely a masterpiece!. This was a GREAT game has everything you could want guns, funny characters, and ZOMBIES just go out and buy it and you wont regret it. Graphics are great the sounds and music make it a scary and enjoyable experience. I would recommended this to anyone who is looking for a zombie game with a good campain, good humor and just a good time.. 9/10 = Amazing = Addictive and very well designed shooter. Some of the best Co-op and versus action you can possibly find on console.. 6 Word Review from Familiar Fan: Has replay value with laughable flaws. IF you're a fan familiar with the Left 4 Dead series, it's almost like playing Left 4 Dead again, but there are differences in Left 4 Dead 2. One big difference is that you shove is limited down from the last game. After a certain number of shoves, you can't shove anymore. If you desir","left 4 dead 2 is an undeniably Fun game and continues to be a gold standard many zombie run and guns are compared to now . as a game alone the mechanics are simple and easy to understand, as well with the simple story that the games lays out, perfect for a game of this distinction . despite not being available on the Xbox Marketplace, it is definitely worth it if you get your hands on a physical copy ."
405.Left 4 Dead,"It was my first game on the Xbox 360 it was the first game I played it brings back memories but I'm getting an Xbox 360 for my nephew I hope he's enjoyed it. The cast of characters in this game are better then L4D2 but at the same time there isn't as much to do outside the campaign like L4D2 which is the opposite. So many great nights playing couch co-op, drinking and laughing - great stress release after a long day at work.. A terrific zombie shooter with a great mix of co-op and competitive modes. The graphics are a bit crude, but the fast-paced action is intense and challenging. Playing the story either solo or in split-screen is fine. However, the game fires on all cylinders with its online multiplayer. Plowing through the campaign with three other players is good fun. And competitive modes are every bit as good as they are in ""Gears of War"" or ""Call of Duty"". Overall, I would rate this with an 8.5 out of 10.. Simply a very good zombie fps shooter along with its sequel. If only we’d get a re release of these games….. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Phenomenal zombie game !!! Wish there was a thrid installment. This and the 2 game are a must have. I'm a bit nostalgic for this game. In 2008 when it was released I got really sick and this game kept me entertained for weeks while I recovered. Is it a perfect shooter? No, there is no such thing. I've heard some want to compare it to COD just because it's a FPS. This is not COD. It's funny how tunnel visioned people become, wanting every game to be like their favorite game. It is it's own thing. That would be like comparing **** to mangos: both are fruits but completely different. There's also complaints about lack of story. Seriously? It's not that kind of game either. The whole point of left 4 dead is that each campaign is its own episode, like a movie. I found it unique and wanted to replay it to get a different experience. Someone complained about zombie AI. Exactly what is it you want? This is a zombie shooter. This game gives you variety unlike other zombie games. Sure you play the same levels, but the hordes will come from different areas, and special infected are well circulated throughout the levels. You never know what's around corner. This is a fun game, not a deep game. It's not supposed to have dozens of cut scenes, super deep characters, tons of dialogue. It's pure action fun. I enjoy its simplicity. Yes, the loading screens are long. I don't mind because it gives me time to cool my heels, get up and grab a soda or something. There's witty banter between your team during the campaign. I do think it might've been cool to have included in game the character backgrounds, where they came from and how they found each other. The game just doesn't call for it, though. The only frustrating element I found was the NPCs if you play solo. Don't get me wrong, I did not have online access when I first got this so I played it solo and still loved it. But sometimes your NPCs are useless when you are incapacitated or they fall off a building and die. I have a soft spot for older games. It was all about simple fun, not trying to make every game into an epic RPG-like experience which in my opinion slows and stunts the fun **** like this. If Left 4 Dead tried this I think it would be a different game, people would've compared it to Resident Evil or something and would've gotten lost in the shuffle. Instead, it stands out.. left 4 dead is one of my fav zombie games ever made its fun and good but not as good as left 4 dead 2 but still love this one. This zombie-themed shooter is a great action-survival game. While it lacks the content of part 2, Left 4 Dead is still great fun. Yes, the graphics are a bit crude and the gameplay is simple, but the experience is intense. Whether you're playing the campaign or competitive modes, the game is filled with fast-paced thrills. The key to success is to play like a team with your fellow zombie slayers. While the single player mode includes capable friendly bots, it feels like a practice session. The real fun is when you go online with a real group of players. So if you're a fan of the genre, then you should try this one out. I would rate it with an 8.5 out of 10.. A cult classic for zombie games. The maps/missions are very fun, the zombies can easily overwhelm. The best zombie for me is the witch as the first time it started crying I foolishly started going to it and it got me off guard. Can get quite repetitive and not being able to aim down site is quite annoying. Just a good, basic zombie game.. Played with my 2 other best friends. Always had one cpu playing which made it hilarious. I always said this was my favorite game all time. The random generated levels made it so fun to keep playing.. An amazing game sadly this is the worst way to play it, it's still left 4 dead it's still amazing you're going to get many hours out of it fun but Xbox 360 version doesn't have all the DLC for free like the PC so it does feel like the worst version but it is interesting to play just to see how the frame where tries to cope with all the zombies it is fun And it's always fun to play co-op with your friends. I would recommend it just to see how it run on the 360.

Great fun.. A very fun game with well-defined characters, great visual storytelling, many game modes, and non-repetitive game-play.. Left 4 Dead is one of the best games to play co-op on the couch with a friend.. Left 4 Dead is an online focused first person shooter in which a group of up to four players take on the role of survivors in a zombie apocalypse and have to work together to make it to safety. Each level is broken into five chapters, the first four require the players to make it to a safe house before a final “survival” chapter in which waves of enemies will hit as you try to hold out long enough for rescue to arrive (the final “every man for himself” dash never fails to entertain!). To this day Left 4 Dead, and its sequel, remain amongst the best online experiences in gaming and the real key to the games success is that working together is not optional. Wandering off alone will almost always lead to certain death from one of the many enemy types out to kill you and the game perfectly balances the need to keep yourself alive whilst also looking out for your friends. With enemies appearing in different locations on each play-through there is also plenty of replayablity. If only Valve would make another one…. Left 4 Dead is a decent enough game. The gun-play is competent, the graphics are solid, and the game is very fun to play. The problem here is the severe lack of content. But the game is still a blast to play with friends. L4D2 is much better though, and I would definitely recommend that over this. If you still want to get this for whatever reason, I think max price would be 12$. I know that sounds like I despise the game, but the content you are getting here is sorely lacking, and 12$ is a fair price for a game with amazing core mechanics, but lacking in meaty play value.. Like always I'm reviewing the game for people that are asking themselves if it's worth a buy NOW, and therefore take into account that there's almost nobody left online and for Left 4 Dead it's obviously impacting the final mark. So technically the game is beautiful for its time, with very nice light effects that increase the creepy atmosphere, nice sound design for the enemies, no framerate issue even when there's tons of zombies on the screen, Valve did, like always, a very professional job. Concerning the gameplay that's what has been the most ""damaged"" by time as like I said you won't find a lot of people online and this game is thought to be play in groups of 4 to have the most fun, the IA for the allies is not bad at all if you play in solo but there the game is a rather simple FPS with similar situations again and again, everything works fine but there's no variety. And it's not the nonexistent story that will appeal to solo players, every mission has the same one and it only takes one word, ESCAPE. It will take approximately 6 hours to do every mission and once again, if you play alone there's 0 incentive to do them again, so it's very short. In conclusion Left 4 Dead is a very fun game to play with friends thanks to a simple but good gameplay, but the lack of story, the repetitive level design and its short length makes it forgettable for solo player. I would advise it if you know for sure that you have at least one friend willing to play it with you, if not there are better FPS out there for you.. The game is really fun, I was kind of skeptical before I bought it but when I played it I think it is a little bit better than Left 4 Dead 2 because it isn't as buggy as L4D2, Yes it a few bugs but I don't really care. The online play is incredible, I could care less for single player but in many ways this is a Masterpiece and I say its a must buy if you have an Xbox.. This game is boring at first, but then awesome. Pros -Nice graphics -scary -interesting story Cons -Horrible controls This game is worth checking out.. This game isn't awful, but it is beyond overrated. I have an understanding that the fans of the franchise are very fond of Valve, because of men like Gaben Newell, but this game whether or not you play it on console or PC really isn't really all that impressive. All the guns are practically the same, the gameplay is beyond repetitive (shoot painfully dull uninteresting zombies/special infected), the ai are only very good when they want to be, and it gets quite boring very quickly. Don't get me wrong, I had plenty of fun playing this game with friends, as the multiplayer is blast, but I'd honestly rather play CoD online, and yes I said that. The Left 4 Dead vs mode online multiplayer is what saved this game for me. That is all.. Left 4 Dead is still one of the best multiplayer videogames of all time. The gameplay is a ton of fun for friends, and is a must own for Xbox 360 owners.. The original Left 4 Dead is a fast pace cooperative game. Why play in co-op, because the game has some infected(special zombies each containing there very own abilities) that requires a teammates help to get off of you, so it's better to have some friends cover your back then going in like John Rambo because that could cost you your life and you're team would start to break apart. Why not play the campaign by yourself, because it's starts to lose some of its charm and beings to become boring also it's A.I isn't the most impressive to protect you. If your not interested in that then the multiplayer could interest you because it's fun and you get to play as the special infected against the survivors being controlled by other players to see who can get the farthest in a campaign before your team gets wiped out and who ever has the most points at the end of the game wins. If you want to survive waves of zombies with 3 friends then you could always play survival. It's still not perfect but it's not bad of getting a copy, 7/10. I really love playing this game! The campaign is great for it keeps me compelled to play by myself or with friends. The online feature is great for it can get boring playing by yourself and the ai can be too dumb to save you or to be helpful. Survival is a great feature in which you just have to survive long enough.. This game really has nothing to offer someone who thinks zombies are boring and the idea has been milked so much in modern pop culture you can see the cows ribs. Half-Life 2 did not gain so many fans for it's shooting mechanics but it's depth and world creation, Left4Dead is just the source shooting engine and zombies that present no challenge, that's it. It looks bad, plays bad and even the co-op is left for dead by Halo and Rainbow 6. I finished the first level then switched the game off unimpressed and totally void of any immersion. Overall the most boring ugly game I've played and not the standards I expect from a full release from Valve.. When first playing Left 4 Dead I was alone and playing by myself, it took my 30mins just to walk 30 meters. I was petrified. Left 4 Dead was purposely made to be played on multiplayer and this is where the game shins. Valve has successfully made an action packed *fast paced* zombie game, which will leave you on the edge of your sit the entire ride. Do not expect to play an emotion story driven game as this is nothing but.. This is one of a dwindling number of couch co-op titles that gives you solid multiplayer functionality on one screen. It's a great game to play with friends, the co-op feels like a full feature, rather than something added on later (which many two player games falter at). The controls are fairly intuitive, and actually implement a few features I wish more first-person games would offer.. a really boring and repetitive game this game simply takes 10 minutes then it is the same even in any level you play in the co op was good but still gets boring after a while. It's simplicity may leave the player feeling bare at times, but ""Left 4 Dead"" is nevertheless an overwhelmingly entertaining zombie shooter with some brilliant co-op gameplay possibilities.. Valve is now my favorite game company, all thanks to this game! I've never played an actual ""good"" zombie game, aside from RE, and 'Left 4 Dead' is just what I needed! 4 player co-op has never been so fun!. A Valve FPS with zombies. This is a wonderful game that I enjoyed very much, but to get the full experience for this game, you need to have 3 other people, but when you do get 3 other friends, it makes for one helluva good time. And, because you need other people to enjoy it so much, that's why I also have to criticize for. That and its somewhat short gameplay time. It's nice to see games encourage you to play with people, but I shouldn't have to be hindered from enjoying the full game experience because I don't have friends who wanna play this game with me, but that's a minor point. Overall, Valve a lovely FPS with zombies.. I really enjoyed this game, despite the linear paths and lack of weapon variety. For what it is, an episodic zombie shooter, it does it well. Given, there's not much of a plot, it's a simple escape scenario. But for a zombie apocalypse shooter, I'm not sure how much of a plot people expect. Gave it a seven because it does get a bit boring for long stretches, but in short sittings when you just want to blow away crap for 30-40 minutes, it's a lot of fun.. Tell me again, what survival horror fan doesn't like blasting a few hundred zombies in the head every now and again? With Left 4 Dead, you'll get to kill zombies. Morbidly obese zombies that vomit on you and attract the main horde, skittish zombies that attack you when you startle them, zombies with a cat-like prowess who try to hunt you down. It's fun, it's simple. It's what we want in a zombie game.. This was the game that got me into gaming as a hobby. My friend raved about this game for the longest time and so finally I went out and bought a crappy Xbox 360 Arcade just so that I could play this game. It was the best thing I have ever bought in my life. The intense gameplay that kept me and my friends coming back, the endlessly replayable levels, and the charming characters made me a L4D fan. I have spent hours and hours and hours of my life killing zombies with a friend on the couch next to me. I am a huge Resident Evil fan but this is without a doubt my favorite zombie game. Even though it has no real story this game holds up extremely well. Enjoy!. Zombie games are well, out there. they could be awesome and they could be boring. THis is one of the better zombie games out there. It's fun and at the time, was pretty scary.. I'm usually not into zombie games but this is a truely fun zombie killing experience. It has lots of content and the AI director changes how each level plays making it a game which always offers new challenges. Single player is solid but this was a game meant to be played with friends. The game emphasizes teamwork, lone wolves don't last long. Pick this game up if you and your online posse are looking for a new challenge or even just a change of pace from COD or other traditional shooters.. One of the best FPS games of all time. The characters are entertaining, the level design is great too. The games only flaw is the variety of weapons, of which there is around 5. The game has superb multilayer and really encourages teamwork. If you like FPS games, zombies and playing with friends, check this game out!. This game is extremely not as good as the second one witch i gave a 6 to. It basically needs work on everything. I needs to drop in price 10.00 to even make the price good.. If this game had a way to punish players that **** out and rage quit I'd have to give it a 10/10, The environment and atmosphere gives pure adrenaline, game play is engrossing and winning a match feels extremely rewarding.. This is one of those games that you can pop in and play with a friend for maybe like an hour or two and then you'll probably want to quit and play something else. The game has almost no storyline and becomes repetitive just hours after playing it. The content is weak and the game lacks depth. I'm a huge zombie fan and I love co-op games but I found Left 4 Dead hard to enjoy. I would only recommend this game if you have a friend to play with. It's a good time waster if you need to burn an hour or two with a friend.. It was worth waiting a few years to get this in the bargain bin... Left 4 Dead (outdated to it's sequel which came out the following year), is a definate not buy if your looking to get it (by the time your reading this it'll be sometime after 2011, so don't get this). A decent game, just incomplete.. This game is so much fun when you play it with a friend. I think if you play it alone it is boring so I recommend only playing this with friends. This doesnt have any replay value though. Its better just to rent or something and then give it back.. Original concept and dynamic gameplay. But the actual controls and shooting mechanics are clearly suited for PC. This is a poor port for 360 because it just feels like Counter-Strike with zombies. If you can see through the un-immersive controls, the gameplay can bea blast- especially if played with the right people. However, the campaigns are a lot shorter than the ones for L4D2, and there's only 4 (excluding map pack). It's worth playing but it's something that becomes boring and old VERY quickly.. Left 4 Dead is a blast to play, it can easily consume hundreds of hours of your life, it has tons of awesome multiplayer modes, awesome co-op, and Zombies! this game is a pure adrenaline rush, at times hundreds of Zombies will swarm you at once, and it's awesome! while the game is built for co-op play, it's still fun to play by yourself, although you'll have the most fun with four friends and difficulty on expert and watching the craziness unfold, all the game modes rely on teamwork, and there's one gameplay mode where you can play as either the Zombies or the survivors and have to effectively communicate in order too win, and it has extremely high replay value, this game comes so close to getting a 10, but it does have some flaws, there are long load times, there are only four short campaigns with five levels a piece, and if you don't have multiplayer, it wont last you forever, but this is still a fantastic game online or off, and is just shy of perfection, a must own.. Before Left 4 Dead's release, I had always wanted an intense shooter that pits you against a city full of flesh hungry zombies. So needless to say when I heard about Left 4 Dead, I was all over it, and I'm happy to say that Valve did not disappoint. This game is pretty much the game I had been wishing for since I first saw Dawn of the Dead (2004). Left 4 Dead is an intense, pulse pounding first person shooter that has been brilliantly created with an A.I. director that constantly changes the item locations and enemy spawn locations, making each time you play a campaign different than the last time you played it. This game strongly relies on its multiplayer, which is no less than spectacular. Playing with three other ""survivors"" in a zombie apocalypse is something that even today still hasn't gotten old. The versus mode is another great multiplayer mode that allows you to play as the survivors, then the infected or vise-versa in a four on four match. Another thing that makes versus so good is the fact that its completely balanced. The graphics are a bit old, but within respected tolerances. The voice acting is great and the dialogue actually made me laugh out loud in a few times. The only reason this game doesn't achieve perfection is because of lack of content, but the only reason this is a complaint is because the game is so much fun, that I just keep wanting more and more. This game delivered exactly what any zombie media fan could want and is easily one of the funnest games I've ever played.. It's pretty straight forward and easy at first glance, and if you're good at first person shooters you should have no problem. The game isn't really scary at all and there isn't much of an apocalyptic atmosphere. It feels more like a shoot em up action game, but that is indeed the point. As a first-person shooter, it can be really fun, however once you've beaten each map a few times there isn't much more to do with this game. The second one is much better and much more worth purchasing (not to mention it came out about a mere year after this one). If you force yourself to think about what you do and take the game more slowly and sneakily on a harder mode (like Expert) and turn off the cheesy loud over the top music, this game can be pretty intense and realistically frightening (depending on what kind of setting your put yourself in). The best aspect of the game is probably Versus Mode, because playing as the mutant-like 'special infected' is quite entertaining. I realize I seem pretty down about this game, and this is only because I've had it for years now, but when I first got it, I thought it was one of the greatest games ever made. However, now I see that in comparison to the sequel, this isn't so impressive. Plus the Steam PC version is at least 10x better, especially since you can download modded maps such as a few Silent Hill maps and many more.. Anything that Valve's touch becomes platinum, Left 4 Dead has a lot of similarities with Counter Strike in every aspect. Non stop action,over the top violence will be found in here, laugh out loud coop , and nice campaign. Tho, this is not a game for everyone,as i said this campaign is hell of a fun experience but is very short, and especially for offline users, they will not get more content on it. Also L4D lacks in weapons, there's not many variety. Those minor flaws doesn't deteriorate the excitement , and you can get good use for it. So pick it , ( get L4D2 it has more stuff ) but, get in mind that less dont get everything right , even if it has zombies.. 9/10 = Amazing = One of the best online Co-op/ Versus games to date. Extremely well designed and very fun overall.. It doesn't have a great story, but a least it has one. That's better than some other zombie games. It does get somewhat repetitive, but it's still fun. Multiplayer is pretty over rated though. The controls are pretty good but not the best. Gameplay is good. I'd give the campaign an 8 and multiplayer a 6.. At the time of posting, 26897 zombies had been harmed playing of this game by yours truly. Now assume I kill an average of four hundred or so each time I play a level. Do the math. I've played Left 4 Dead that many times. And I will continue to do so, it's that much fun. I don't think I can give any better praise than that... Want to read the full review? Go to ****!. Left 4 Dead has everything i want in a survival game exciting and realistic i rate this game top marks and will recommend it to anyone who is in to survival games.. I hardly ever re-sale my X360 games but after a couple of weeks I immediately brought it back. It's interesting how valve tried to make a game that's made to be repeated but it doesn't work like that. The campaigns last around an hour each at most, versus is dull, and although the ""Director"" changes zombie and horde spawns, it doesn't do much else. Not so impressive when it's put like that, is it? Gunplay is pretty bad, just hip-firing forever. Characters have some charm, but Francis? No. Hate him. This game isn't worth your time. Poor gameplay. Poor plot. Poor graphics. Get out while you still can.. Just about anything wrong with this game on the 360 is corrected in the PC version (and improved upon in the sequel). It has to do with Microsoft, I'm almost sure. There aren't any custom maps, or free additional content or regular updates on the 360 version, however, there are on the PC. That's pretty much the only reason I'm giving this game a nine. -- I bought it after hearing a few of my friends talk about it, and that's one of the most amazing things about the Left 4 Dead games, I think. The levels themselves stay the same, but the experience is different every time. As someone from Valve said, it promotes ""organic storytelling."" This happens over and over, for the same game. There are only several types of enemies, and yet every time you play, the experience is different. A look into the developer's comments (included with the Game of the Year version, at least) gave me a good idea of just how much thought was put into every aspect of this game. -- The graphics aren't breath-taking and miraculous, but the techniques put into the development of the graphics certainly are. Music and sound effects are used as audio cues to alert players to where enemies may be hiding. I mentioned in another review, actually, that it is these things that will be remembered several years from now, rather than a game having 'the best' graphics, or 'the best' shallow trait. -- I bought Left 4 Dead over a year ago, and have played it regularly since then. It never lost any of its fun value over that time.. I don't think Valve can make a bad game...cause this surely isn't one. Everything about this game is fun, especially the different types of special infected. This is a great game to play multiplayer on xbox live with and not ever really get bored of this game, as long as you long killing very fast undead.. If it wasn't for this game and Left 4 Dead 2, i won't have even bought an xbox, honestly. This game is just amazing, though it is pretty much that same 7 scenes you're playing over and over, the randomness setting of a.i.'s and such make it like a brand new match every time. Versus, Campaign, and other modes other than Single Player are a great way to keep my attention to the game getting to play with other. The game is just amazing, i play it like everyday and i can't imagine not playing this gem.. Online co-op gaming at its best. It's not a 'normal' game with its four levels that, on easy or normal, can be finished inside 40 minutes per level. Stick it on extreme and it's a different story, though. We're talking hours of pain per level... ouch.. im suprised a company like valve a company who made games like half life 1 and 2 and Portal come out with such a half assed game , this is such a bare bones game basically there meeting musta went some thing like this ""i got a idea lets make a game with zombies and make it 4 player co-op"" any thing els ""no thats it dont need bosses or a story , well make it beatable in alittle over 3 hours and just toss in a few guns and call it a day."" this game should have been released as a budget game for like $20 . cause thats about what it looks and plays like . this game the way it is probubly woulda been great 6 years ago on the originla xbox i mean the graphics already look like the belong there. its just way to short i mean to beat a game in 3 hours just shouldnt be . even on the hardest diffuculty me and my friends had this done in 4.5 hours . after i beat it on both normal and the hardest diffuculty which was 2 days i had no desire to want to play it again . its like ok why would i want to its the same thing through all 4 lvls run to a vehicle kill the same zombies over and over with a grand total of 5 higher type zombies like the tank and witch which arnt difuctlt to put down. this just feels so rushed and just slapped together. this game is at best a rental and thats if you REALY REALY REALY like killing zombies . this game was a waste of $60 and valve should be ashamed for charging that much for this half assed game.","left 4 dead is a terrific zombie shooter with a great mix of co-op and competitive modes . the graphics are a bit crude, but the fast-paced action is intense and challenging . the game fires on all cylinders with its online multiplayer ."
406.Slay the Spire,"very interesting game. I got hooked right away and right now with 114 hours I still havent beaten it. It just shows how much work they put into the game.. This is one of the all-time greatest games for me. Absolutely fun and highly re-playable at your own pace. Simple graphics, but they do the job. The characters are varied, I only wish there was more. At least there's mods, though.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It just set the standard of the genre, that no one else can still reach. All 3 (later 4) heroes are unique, and all of them have many good combinations which makes every run feel unique. Only thing it could be improved on is maybe the diversity of enemies, but I cannot give Slay the Spire less than perfect 10.. Very fun to hop on and do cool builds. The deck building is fun and very simple to learn. The games only real issue is that it is repetitive and kind of easy for a roguelike. Although if you like deckbuilders, I would give it a try.. do some research before you postyourreview please. This game is the predecessor of rogue likeDeck-builder. It is possible to win every run if you're skilled enough statistically.. I love this game. It's one of the best roguelike deckbuilding games ever made, in terms of gameplay and mechanics. BUT The art and visual style are such a turn-off. Some people might say it's ""unique"" or it's the ""style"" of it, but it's just plain bad. I know that sometimes indie developers can't afford high-end production levels, but Slay the Spire is a very successful game and could update its art a bit. I bet it would only generate more interest in the game. Although superficial, the visuals play a crucial role in selling all other aspects of your game.. It’s a solid game and fun to play, but in my opinion there’s too much RNG involved. I watched tier lists and speedruns just to confirm this: some cards are completely worthless, and no matter what deck you have, you would never use them. Sometimes you have to abandon runs because you only get bad cards. In my opinion, the game only works if you can consciously exploit it and build an overpowered deck. The gap between a bad deck and a good one is just too big. That said, it’s still quite satisfying when you manage to complete a run, even with an average deck.. It's a game I've spent a lot of hours on, simply because every run you do is unique with a vast variety of cards, potions, artifacts, and encounters, all with a fluid and fun gameplay. I'd personally recommend the mod Downfall, since it adds a lot of good quality content.. This is the best value you will ever get on a video game, when you consider dollars spent, vs hours enjoyed. Best card game I've ever played, every run is different, unique and offers its own challenges, all four of the characters play different and have their own special movesets, and when you get good enough at the game, you unlock ascension mode which allows you to replay it again with harder and harder modifiers.. A very addictive game that will keep you busy for hours. Yep, it's hard and the RNG is not on your side, as is the case with most roguelikes.. It is a very simplistic game, however incredibly addictive. It has this feeling of a card board game but with a very nice interface. Short games, with a very good reply value. I can't find any bad point in this game . limited cards but better than 10k+cards YUGIO . well designed tactics and various play style . victory feels so good . perfect !. It's perfect. Just the best roguelike you can play. If you are into deckbuilding then it's a musthave.. A bastion of the rogue-like genre that looks boring but sure as hell isn't. Unique, addictive gameplay that is easy to pick up but is still complex enough to warrant multiple replays.. This game is really good and introduced me to deck-building games in general. Being a big fan of Roguelite games, this game is really good. There is a nice charm in the aesthetic of the game and the weight of your choices being able to affect if you are about to get totally **** in the next encounter is something that I enjoy. Something else the game accomplishes well is the ability to use normal game methods without the use of mods to slowly build yourself into a monster that can destroy any enemy. Overall really good game design and the implementation of mods is always a plus.. Roguelikes are, in some ways, comparable to shuffling a deck of cards: all the parts are there, they just need to be rearranged to make a random order. You would think, in this way, that a roguelite with the central gimmick of a deck of cards used for almost every action would be a match made in heaven, but Slay The Spire needed only one swing at it to prove to me that the idea should have stayed nought more than a concept for all of time. It's problem is, simply put, that it isn't an enjoyable system, and adding the two ideas together only makes for double the number of ways that you can be unfairly executed. Along with this, I just personally don't like the sense of ""you will eventually just have to take damage"", because it feels like if I get damaged or not is entirely out of control. Commit to dealing damage, or allow me to influence it directly. To sit in the middle just feels like poor design, and forcing that to then rely on RNG? That just makes no sense to me.. This game really is the real deal. An incredibly addicting delight **** that will have you draining hours and hours of your day trying to beat. The creative mechanics, the charming art style, and the easy to understand but hard to master gameplay all combine to make a game that keeps you coming back for more. If you love card battlers, this is the best of the genre. I have 270+ hrs played on Steam and I don't regret a single one of them. Definitely a game that is worth the time (and frustration).. amazing game which created a new genre of roguelike card games and be the best.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Basically THE deckbuilding roguelike, complete with overpowered decks and plenty of rng to screw up your run.. Pros.: - Cool mechanics of this rogue-like. Normally, I do not like them. - Nice variety of characters and tactics. - Artifacts, potions, etc. Things stack. - Aesthetics. Loved it more than Darkest Dungeon. Cons.: - No story. At. All.... This game is very fun but can feel unfair at points a lot of the negative reviews say that the RNG makes the game unfair, but you usually want to go with the flow when picking cards, rather than just hope for a specific build and get disappointed when you don't get it. The game is ok, but as someone else put it: ""the rogue-like elements destroy the deck building elements"". A masterpiece. Perfectly executed in all aspects. The music. The interface. The graphics. The gameplay. The story. It has hundreds of hours of replayability. Each time you play you learn new things. There are no in-game lootboxes or macroscamsactions. You pay once and have hundreds of hours of fun. The people downvoting are either bombing it, are complaining about luck because they don't understand maths/statistics, or just aren't very good at the game. If you don't like card games, you might not like it. But Slay The Spire executes perfectly at what it's trying to do. Even after hundreds of hours of playtime, I've still not scratched the surface of the depth the game has to offer and I feel that I can still get a lot better at the game.. A nice little deck building rogue-like with enough card variety that each play-through can feel completely different and another good example that you don't need AAA graphics but just incredible gameplay. Randomly getting the right combination of cards for brutal combos is very satisfying. I feel like the hero characters need a little work as 2 classes are almost too easy where the other characters are too hard. The Ironclad: with his heal after every match and more powerful defensive and strength cards make progress to The Spire possibly on nearly every playthrough. The Silent: The poison cards with the amount of free attack cards make Slaying the Spire just as easy at the Ironclad. The Watcher: Fun switching between stances but the biggest problem is that there aren't enough cards to help you switch and exit stances. So if you don't get them in any drops you are stuck with a character that is good at defending and it makes matches very long and tedious. The Defect: A really fun idea of a robot/construct with orb slots that can give you free damage or defense each turn. However, like the Watcher, if you don't get enough of those orb filling cards then you are stuck with a rather useless character with weak strikes and defends. Focus or Targeting cards really boost this character but there are only three cards with those abilities so good luck getting one. In short, a playthrough with Ironclad and Silent will have you feeling like a God, whereas with the other 2 games are heavily reliant on RNG and even what seems like a successful game can suddenly end with some bad card draws or enemies that start their first 2 turns with 30+ damage.. I had fun, good game for some time when you are watching series on the other screen.. this is the best digital card game that you can play, and one of the best roguelikes as well. Pretty addictive. It is effective when you want to get yourself distracted.. This is like Yugioh + Pokemon as a Rogue Like game. Great idea and execution and not as unfair as some people are claiming if you have decent deck building skills and know how to time and execute your plays. There are only four base decks but each of them has multiple playstyles to mix and match. Together with potions and items to collect this becomes a VERY deep game that requires a whole lot of understanding in how to build and play your deck to win. Not every run is equally hard but every run is doable because you have so many options. My only complaint is that the graphics and animations are terrible. You could literally photoshop screenshots of Fromsoftware enemies with animations from Pokemon Emerald into this game and it would look 500% better. 8/10. Slay the Spire is a great **** a point. The problem is that the endgame -- once you have cleared the base quest with all three characters -- is preposterously difficult, even for a Roguelike. In a genre classic such as Hades, the player is rewarded for experimenting with different builds based on drops. In StS, if you don't luck out and get the exact right combination of cards, at exactly the right point in the game, you're totally effed. Enemies are idiotically overpowered, and minor mistakes can be catastrophic. This turns what was an absolutely thrilling and addictive experience into a lame, frustrating grind. Why bother to keep playing if it all comes down to dumb luck? An enormous disappointment. UPDATE: Dropped the score from a 6 to a 4 due to the absurd end-game difficulty. Your capacity to slay the heart has virtually nothing to do with skill, and is entirely based on luck. It is *possible*, but will require you to get every requisite card, in a particular order, while landing only on enemies that it is possible to defeat. The developers ruined an otherwise excellent deck-building experience with ridiculously imbalanced difficulty. A challenge is welcome, but rolling the dice -- which is all that the latter stages of Slay is -- gets very boring very fast.. 99% luck based and ofc if you complain about that dumbazses will tell you some streamer can get 10 win in a row blah blah blah even if you can consistently win the game with 1% skill, its still not fun - repetitive gameplay. Do the same thing over and over again until you die and repeat - If you somehow lucky and win the reward is the **** same, you gain some xp which in turn give you some useless stuff nobody cares about once you level up - there no deck building here because there's nothing to even build when cards are given to you at complete random. You cant choose to limit the random pool. It randoms from all the cards you've unlocked overall its much better game than Monster train but its still pretty garbage. A deep game consisting of a deck based on different characters you choose with different abilities. When I say deck I mean you actually build the deck as you continue the game. You start with some basic stuff and you can go from there. Sometimes you get such a fun broken combo that it is straight-up euphoria. There are some really cool enemies challenging in different ways that make you really think and build your deck accordingly the next time you go through with that character. The amount of content is pretty endless as iv never had the same run ever. The amount of time I have put into this game is a great deal and its such a great time I have this on multiple consoles and the PC. I love the character art, the music, and just everything the game has to offer. Now one big thing I am going to talk about that a lot of people don't seem to mention is the PC version on steam has a whole workshop. The workshop allows you to download anything that people have created for the game. You can play as bosses like the Slime boss, you can play even as crazy things as Goku / Sailormoon / Yugioh or you can just change out the music, the art, the speed, the story, the items, and the cards. It's endless and the workshop adds so much to the game that I can't even go into detail with 5000 word limit here. Just check it out yourself as it's all free on steam. Another big thing I need to mention is the fact the game runs flawlessly on the steam deck which is my main game on the steam deck. It runs via the touchscreen, the sticks or the haptic pad. All feeling awesome. I really do not have anything negative to say about this game as its just a joy to play. -V. Pure deckbuilding roguelike experience. A reference point for any other games to be released in this genre. Gameplay > everything else, which makes total sense for a truly indie game.. Literally can't play games I enjoy because someone is playing this piece of trash. Do not buy this game. Save yourself from this pain.. i liked the game at first. but to much random and the further you get the more bullcrap enemies get. like, no matter what you do sometimes you just can't win. you put in all this effort just for it to not matter.. The game is fun at first, but the randomness of what cards and other items you get makes it impossible to build a decent build, but the enemy power levels and attack patterns are more geared towards a game where you have absolute control over cards and items. This leads to dying many times where it feels you had no chance. The game is so random that I have once sacrificed two block cards (optimizing fast powerful damage) just be rewards with two cards that boosted block effects! Thanks RNG-esus! And what makes everything worse is the fact that you can build a decently powered deck just to be faced against enemies that play perfectly against your specific deck. Totally deleted this game after a few days. Avoid!. I play this game on a secret account so my friends don't know, but I love it. Very addictive. I've probably played 200+ hours in this game. I hope none of my friends find this review, as I've been telling them that I've never played this game.. Slay the Spire's combination of deckbuilding and roguelike mechanics gives you the freedom to create your own builds and playstyle, while still making the progression of every run smooth.. Best turn based tactical card game I've ever played. Very addictive. I like the variations in the characters. Each one plays very differently.. I have a few hundred hours in this game. The unique, rich style is excellent. The creators did an excellent job of creating an immersive world with its own feel. The gameplay is simple, but works. The graphical style is wonderful. The ascension mode provides almost limitless difficulty allowing for high replay value. I love the RNG, but I hate the RNG - it makes each game different. I think I spent $19 on this game and I have almost a thousand hours played. That speaks volumes. There's no season pass, no DLC, no microtransactions, no annoyingly gated progression system. Your one single payment buys a full, complete game with superb replayability. This game is a true gem. I only hope they create a sequel.. This game is well built. - If I die I don't feel like I lost. it can occur because of attrition rather than lack of skill which is rare in gaming. - Progression is slow but it is still attainable. - There are interesting things in this game to keep you coming back and the runs or acts aren't so long you don't want to play. - You don't have to play every class some are more enjoyable than others.. Im a big board game person, but I dont typically like deck builders. This video game is better than most of the deck building board game counterparts. Once I beat it after about 45 hours, I lost the desire to keep playing unlike most people. Perhaps I need to go dive deeper into this one.. I was instantly hooked on this game when I first started playing it. I'm a bit of boardgame geek, so I played the og, physical deckbuilders like Dominion before they were cool, so this hit a sweet spot for me. I don't play this much anymore, but I got a solid 60 or 70 hours of bigly enjoyment out of it.. This card-based roguelike dungeon crawler keeps calling me back for more, because no matter how many times you play and no matter how many times you win, there are still harder challenges, new rewards, and fierce battles ahead. Play as one of four fighters against a collection of unique and... otherworldly... foes as you battle your way through the Spire as you try to figure out what's controlling the world you find yourself in. Everything you need to survive, attacks, power-ups, and defenses, are contained in a deck of cards and a set of potions you collect and add to as the game progresses. While each fighter has his or her own unique deck of cards, thus creating a style of gameplay unique to that particular fighter, you'll soon find out that everything in this game is connected to everything else. You can, if you're lucky (or unlucky) start playing other fighters' cards, or you can sacrifice a reward from the past for a new one in the future, and all the while you're wandering deeper and deeper into the Spire facing foes with their own unique abilities to slay you before you slay them. To say this game is hours of addictive gameplay you just can't put down is an understatement. It's days, weeks, even longer, and I can't even guess how much time and how much raw grit and skill it would take to fully conquer this game. And yet that task doesn't seem as daunting because of how addictive this game is. Whether as a brief time killer or as part of a dedicated gaming session, Slay the Spire is truly among the best of the best of its genre.. One of the most engaging turn-based games I’ve played in a long time. It really masters the balance between overall progression and minute-by-minute fun. It’s been a staple in my gaming diet for over a year.. Slay the Spire is a rouge-like deck-builder in which the player must use cards to defeat a series of monsters, death sends you back to the start to try again from scratch. At the start of each run players will start with a set of basic cards that allow for attack and defence. Defeating monsters and finding treasures allows players to choose extra cards to their decks, with stronger ‘elite’ enemies rewarding ‘relics’ which give permanent bonuses. I’ve played and enjoyed a lot of rouge-likes of late, and Slay the Spire is without doubt one of the most addictive. Trying to piece together that perfect deck full of cards that compliment each other kept me coming back for well over 50 hours, and with four characters available to use (each with their own unique cards and relics to unlock) no two runs will ever quite be the same. Anyone with even the slightest interest in rouge-likes and/or deck-builders should certainly check this out.. WOW!! Near-infinite replayability. Short play time. Perfect learning curve. Secrets. Crazy card interactions. This was the game I didn't know I wanted to play. After putting maybe 30-40 hours in, I almost stopped. I thought I had seen it all now that I had ""unlocked"" the game. Little did I know, that I knew almost nothing. The incredibly satisfying combos you find. The strategy vs tactics tension. Short term vs long term. The fact that almost all cards are good in certain scenarios. Every question seemingly can be answered by ""well... it depends"", makes this so good. No 2 runs are the same. Even though you can eventually steamroll the basic difficulty of the game if you play enough, the higher difficulties always make you re-assess the value of cards. What used to be a terrible card in a previous run can be a run-saver in another. Much recommended!. This game is a must play, especially in 2021/2022 where the price is too good for what you're getting. I hate card games & turn based games, so when I say this game is incredible I mean it. Get it.. I believe this was my introduction to the roguelike genre. Both fun and frustrating, but in proper doses. For the price you get 4 characters, and a good helping of replay value. Each character can be played a different way almost every time. Lot's of cards and lot's of options.. Very fun game. Each run you have a lot of option and even after hundreds of hours I'm still hooked!. Slay the spire was a game I only got because I am a very big fan of rouge likes. But I never thought a card game rouge like would have pulled me in this deep. Story: This game does have some story in it, but its not really told through out the game, I am many hours into it yet and all I know is that you have to slay the spire. Yet this lack of story is fine because people are not coming to this game for a story Gameplay: At first glance all the mechanics of this game might seem over whelming, with all the numbers, relics, and effects. But just after your first run through of the game and just experimenting, you already got a pretty good handle on how the game works. The only thing I wish I knew starting this game is to just experiment with different cards, not only is it the best way to get accustomed to every build, but its also very fun to try out new things and they end up working out. How it works: You get 4 characters, each with their own unquie cards, relics, and health. There are three floors to beat, a boss at the end of every floor. You are given a map with every floor you enter, allowing you to choose a path you want to take to get to the boss. All the paths are randomized every run. Exploring the floors you can either run into enemies (beating the enemies can grant you a new card, gold, and sometimes a potion), a mini boss (same thing, but will always give you a relic), and a question mark (These areas are a random special kind of event, sort of like a advanage/disadvatange, and some of them can be mini games. One example being an event where you can sacrifice a certain amount of health for a powerful card, my favorite though is the event where you can bet on two dudes jousting, the dude with a lower chance of winning has a higher gold reward, making it a risk and reward kind of thing.) Cards and relics: The biggest part of slay the spire is the cards and relics. At the start of every enemy/boss encounter, the game starts and you are given your starting hand. Some cards are attack cards, and others are more skill based like defense. As the run progresses so does your deck. At the start you will have basic attack and defend cards, and at the end, you will have a fully fleshed out build. Relics are passive effects that give you certain effects, (Ex. Royal pillow allows more health restoration when resting). Another great part of the game is synergies, some cards can mix great with other cards, and some might mix well with some relics, its really up to you on how you want to approach a situation,because there are just so many options. Art style: Art style is very nice to look at with, every card and monster designs are unique. I understand that this game may not be for everyone and the description I gave of the gameplay may have been a bit jarring, but just give the game a try. If you dont like it after one or two run throughs,just drop it, its only like 20$ ( I could be wrong on the pricing but it was cheap). It is very easy to pick up and play, it can be complicated if you want it to be. Slay the Spire is a great rouge like because of how fun it is to master, one of the more unique rouge likes out there.. I dropped at least 200 hours into this, to level 20 all the characters. The challenge factor is super high and all the mix-and-match options with the cards and relics make each run unique. Plus, the community around it (Jorbs etc.) is super rich. This is the closest I've felt to the feel of Magic the Gathering in a single-player game.. Best game 2019, this kept me hooked since the first time I played it. must stop playing this to play other games but can't.. I didn’t expect to like this game since it’s a roguelike and a deck-builder, seemed these two don’t fit together but I was completely wrong. This game is fantastic, it’s challenging and addictive. It’s the kind of game that makes you want to keep playing even when you die and lose everything.. Slay the Spire is a turn-based strategy game that is very satisfying thanks to the gradual improvements made to the player's deck in each attempt. The developers have done a great job of balancing all aspects of the game mechanics. I think the difficulty level is perfect. It's challenging, but it's also very reasonable and accessible to new players.. Genre defining, a perfect game. I have happily poured hundreds of hours into this. Worth playing just to ask ""Do I care about roguelikes/deckbuilders?"". Nice game. Nice combination of roguelike and card game. Never played something similar. Its fun as hell. It took me like 90h to slay the spire so... Just 8 out of 10. Best game ever created. Playing all time in my life. Must buy. Dont read this, go do it. Bit slow and repetitive, too much of RNG and not enough diversity of runs. My first two runs took 3 and 4 hours each, which is tooo long.. This genre of game (that this specific game pretty much invented and spearheaded into popularity) is not everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly is mine. After almost 400 hours sunk into the game (100% on 2 saves) since the alpha, I can confidently say this is one of my favorite games of all time. It's a strategy game that inspires creativity. Also, it's still better than all of it's clones. I've tried so many and some of them were cool but none could top this classic. Also I beat ascension 20 heart with shivs before the accuracy buff. Yes that's a fat flex.. Very fun roguelike deckbuilder. Perfect game to start up and when you got nothing else to do and wanna burn some time or just wanna play something laid back for a while. Almost all my friends that has this game has 100+ hours.. I want give this game a 7 but the mod community through the steam workshop gives it that one extra rating. The game is highly addictive early on, but for me once it gets stale (18 hours playtime) I found it hard to commit to another run with the same bosses and relics to embark on a quest to find the same cards from that characters type. I game just needs a bit more content maybe a few new characters for example. The level design is a big positive for me, I love choosing what I do next and it feels like my choices are strategy based rather then pointless choice that will not matter long term. This game does leave a lot down to luck though and that might be a turn off for some. For me the graphics are disappointing and in some cases look lazy due to the same dull backgrounds during fights. It is a very well made and addictive deck builder with with a few imperfections, but it is a worthy buy for any deck building game fan.. Great roguelike, offers a lot of interesting builds and its fun to make ""broken"" decks. Main problem is endgame. Once you learn the ins and outs of each class, end game becomes very boring and pointless.. This roguelite deckbuilding game is so addictive it should be banned! I absolutely loved everything about this game: from its awesome handdrawn art to its dopamine ""just-one-more-turn"" infested gameplay. It also has an insane replay value!. It's very very addictive game. But when you beat the game with every character it gets a bit repetitive and pointless. Ascension isn't enough. It lacks endgame and a bit more content.. When i first heard ""rogue like"" and ""cards"", i was like: whaaaat...? But then, when i played it i foud out it is a really cool combination and it's so funny to play it. The only problem i have with this game, it's that i'm just unable to get further the third level. But i guess that's just because i'm so bad at cards xD.. Currently my most played game on Steam. Highly addictive and very challenging, I recommend this game to anyone that is looking to enjoy this game casually. But this game is easy to get into but don't expect to be a pro. I accomplished a lot in this game and still lose ALOT. Overall consensus this game Is Amazing.. The best rogue-like card game that i have ever played. Awesome design and card balance.. Easily one of the greatest games to have come out in the last decade. The deepest game I have ever played in terms of mechanics for a card rogue-lite. Period. Such an amazing game and one that really has defined the genre, a genre that by the way has not produced a game as good as this yet. Monster Train is close but still can't touch Slay the Spire. I have over 600 hours into this game and I'm still learning something new every day. I can't say that about any other game I've ever played in my life. If you are a fan of card games at all you are doing yourself a huge disservice by not playing this one. Sure you'll be frustrated at times, but you'll come crawling back and you'll be rewarded for it. This game does not hold your hand, it is reminiscent of you know, actual games instead of this streamlined bullcrap that passes of as ""games"" these days (in reality they are just interactive movies).. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. one of my favorite card games in recent memory, and super well integrated with rogue-like gameplay. insane amount of replay value, and even though luck is obviously a factor, it really does feel like skill is way more important in this game.. This game is really enjoyable. If you love rogue-like, the chance are you'll love this game.. Fun, challenging, and rather addictive. Someone rushing through the game can have just as much fun as the person treating it like chess, taking a few solid minutes before every move. Knowing the mechanics makes the game easier, but is by no means a cheat code to winning. Luck is most certainly a rather necessary aspect to this game, but it's very unlikely that you'll keep losing because of it. Risk is rewarded just as much as being cautious is. Balanced gameplay, decent sound design, and one of the only card-based strategy games that I've actually enjoyed playing. Plus, you can buy this game on the Switch or an iOS device if you wish to play it on the go. This is definitely a game that can be enjoyed whether on or off a PC. Modding support also livens this game up plenty, but I've had my fair share of fun without modding the game whatsoever; so, to make it clear, modding is not necessary to enjoy the game, just another way of doing so. Worth a play for those who enjoy rogue-likes, card-based strategy games, or both. Hell, maybe even neither!. I don't think their is a more perfect game just by looking at it's ide",i got hooked right away and right now with 114 hours I still havent beaten it . it's one of the all-time greatest games for me . but the art and visual style are such a turn-off .
407.Titanfall 2,"Bloody hell, what a good game this was. The graphics aren't even that bad now (Though they aren't good either), but the story, man the story... While the story is linear, I don't exactly see how it could be otherwise, and in either case, I think it's pretty good. And the gameplay itself is amazing, with the wall running, and your relationship with BT... I could not recommend it enough.. This is my definitive first-person shooter. The story is unbelievable. The time travel mission is my favorite mission in any video game to date. The movement is so fluid. The multiplayer is the most perfect thing i have ever played. This game. This is something that is quite hard to forget. I'll just say it, the story was way too short. That's it. That is the only complaint I have. The only thing making this a 9/10. The story was amazing, it was very fluid, the design was beautiful and the ending was what made people hate Apex Legends preventing Titan Fall 3 from coming out. Not much more the say. Just play it. 9/10.. Titanfall 2 boasts one of the best campaigns ever created for a first-person shooter of the past decade. Dynamic and vibrant, its only (and biggest) flaw is being too short.. Rarely does a game come along that seamlessly blends a compelling narrative, fluid movement mechanics, and innovative gameplay, but Titanfall 2 delivers on all fronts and then some. From the very first mission, the story captivates you with its emotional depth, engaging characters, and unexpected twists. It's not just a game; it's a journey that stays with you long after the credits **** player movement is simply unmatched—fast, responsive, and exhilarating. Wall-running, double-jumping, and sliding across beautifully designed levels feels natural and empowering, making every encounter feel dynamic and rewarding. Pair that with the expertly crafted game mechanics, and you have a gameplay experience that is as intuitive as it is **** relationship between the player and their Titan, BT-7274, is the heart of the story. It’s rare to see such a strong bond between a human and a machine in a game, and Titanfall 2 executes it flawlessly. The missions are diverse, with each one introducing fresh ideas and mechanics, ensuring the game never feels repetitive.Whether you're a fan of high-octane multiplayer action or a gripping single-player campaign, Titanfall 2 has something for everyone. It's a gem in the FPS genre and deserves all the praise it gets. A must-play for any gamer.. Great campaign, movement gunplay and story. It deserves more love to be honest. Titanfall 2 is a true masterpiece Titanfall 2 is a unique blend of gameplay, design and emotion. Roll-ups, double jumps, Titan control and a variety of abilities make every battle tactical and exciting. You're constantly thinking about how to best utilize the abilities of the hero and his mechanical partner. The gameplay design and locations are simply amazing. Some moments, like the house building station, where everything flips upside down and you run on the walls, stay in your memory forever. But the most rewarding part is the story of strong friendships. In a short 5-10 hours you get so attached to your Titan that parting with him causes real emotions. Titanfall 2 is an example for modern shooters, how to make games with soul. It's not just a game, it's a benchmark.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is absolutely incredible! The campaign is great, the gunplay is fluent and smooth, and the mechanics are excellent. Being a Titan is so cool! As for the multiplayer, it's fantastic as well. The executions, especially the Titan executions, are absolutely amazing. 10/10 would recommend!. A good campaign but overrated. Too short and a cookie cutter plot does not make a masterpiece.. Why did EA kill this series? This game is perfect! It has fast paced and satisfying gameplay, not to mention the story is great!. Awesome shooter. Nice story. Everythingjust great. Wasn't **** for some time cause everythingwas borin, but this game has saved me. Nice gameplay with descent story, enjoyed the mecha mode. I have missed fps games.. stroy is not the best plot, but one of the best story telling I have ever experienced. if you watched the movie ""Atlas"" ,this game is the origin of that movie and with a much better narrative.. It’s a fantastic movement shooter with a fairly simple plot. A lot of cool gameplay mechanics get introduced to keep the game fun.. This is one of my favorite shooters, fun mp, great campaign even though it’s short. Jack cooper and bt 7274 are the best characters in the game, titans did indeed fall. Now where is titanfall 3 respawn:)). Titanfall 2 is a fast-paced action first-person shooter that is set in a fictional universe in which the fantasy of mechs engaging in hand-to-hand combat while the pilots are soaring through the skies comes to life. Titanfall 2 comprises an action-packed campaign that clocks in at about 6 hours. Titanfall features an extensive suite of online multiplayer modes ranging from the classics like Capture the Flag and Amped Hardpoint to unique takes crafted by respawn, such as the Colosseum, which is a 1v1 with a random loadout of weapons on each turn, and the Titan Brawl, which features 5v5 action amongst the various titans. Titanfall also features a PVE experience known as Frontier Defense, in which the player teams up with other pilots to defend the zone against five waves of enemies ranging from cloak drones to nuke titans. The gameplay of Titanfall 2 can be described as a mix of fast-action gunplay intertwined with smooth, fluid platforming. The incredible level design portrayed by Respawn Entertainment allows the freedom of traversing the map in whichever way the player feels, and additions like grappling hooks, stims, and phase shifts differentiate and add a bit of characterization to the movement of each pilot. The gunplay of Titanfall is polished and filled with an immense suite of weapons, comprising of basics such as pistols, SMGs, and assault rifles, as well as special, unique weapons like the SMR and my personal favorite, the EPG, which blasts emp blast, eliminating the other pilots in one shot. The Titans in the game operate as they did in the previous title. However, the gameplay loop of wrecking other titans and watching a brutal execution after performing a melee attack while the other titan is on their last leg never gets old. There is an odd satisfaction in the titan-to-titan gameplay as the feel of each titan is unique, which leads to a unique playstyle for each titan, leaving the player to decide which kind of titan suits them the most. Titans like Northstar scope out enemies from far away, whereas Ronin has to get up close to inflict damage. This diversification of the abilities of each titan gives the player freedom as to which titan suits their **** campaign of titanfall 2 is one of the best fps campaigns that i’ve experienced quite a long time. The plot revolves around rifleman Jack Cooper, who is under the wing of Captain Lastimosa. Cooper is forced to step up and take the reigns of a pilot, and he has to embark on a journey to fulfill the final mission of Captain Lastimosa. During this trip, BT-7274 (the titan of Captain Lastimosa) becomes our companion for this journey. This is a tried-and-tested formula that has worked incredibly well in The Last of Us (2013) and even in the recent God of War reboot in 2018. The spin that Respawn takes on this approach is that after a point, titans form a symbiotic bond in the later half of the game. This enhances the impact of the climax and forms a connection with the player as **** most memorable part of the campaign has to be the chapter titled ‘Effect and Cause', as it showcases some of the beautifully crafted visuals and intricate level design. The platforming, enemy interactions, and pacing of the level are balanced masterfully and showcase the talent of the developers at Respawn. Shifting towards the multiplayer section, most of the original maps are retained from the original game, and a few new ones have been added to the rotation. The customization of each weapon, titan, pilot, and ability has been cranked up to eleven. The skins can be unlocked via challenges, advocate gifts (in-game currency), or just progressing through and leveling up. The level design of these maps is largely open-ended, as it leaves it up to the skill of the player to take advantage of the movement mechanics. The performance of the game on console is incredibly stable; barely the game dips below the targeted 60 fps on console. However, during titan brawls, drops in frame rate can occur. Even increasing the field of view will impact the overall performance. The gripe that I do have is that across all platforms, the multiplayer servers of the game have been DDOS’d. This led to consistent crashes, glitches, and basically an unplayable state of the game for a significant portion of time from mid-2021 until 2023, and ddos still occur. It's significantly better than before, as the game is playable as of now. However, these kinds of exploits ruin the goodwill that took years to build. Titanfall 2 is an incredibly well-paced action first-person shooter that is definitely worthy of your time and attention, as it showcases some of the best work from Respawn Entertainment. Whether it be the highly engaging campaign thrill ride or the explosive chaos of the online multiplayer, Barring the network issues and ddos attacks, Titanfall is one of those games that deserves to be in the library of every player who likes first-person shooters.. It had neat mechanics, but I didn't enjoy the single player game. It was too on rails. (Now go here, now get this thing, now go there.) I didn't feel like I had any choice in anything. One of those games that feels more like you're clicking through a movie than a game, if you know what I mean.. Masterpiece, one of the greatest shooters. Full of action and emotion, the gameplay is fluid. Graphics are so good, i enjoyed this game so far.. One of the best fps made... no doubt.... TF1 multiplayer is better though...minus the smart gun.. ""Titanfall 2 features a compelling campaign mode with a unique story and impressive animation. The multiplayer mode, which I played the most, offers a high degree of freedom without being overly difficult. Players can switch between being a pilot and a Titan, and earn points by eliminating NPCs."". The Greatest FPS game ever made. It’s criminal they haven’t made a Titanfall3 with today’s technology.Respawn get it made. But this time don’t release it between battlefield and call of duty!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I bought this game on a whim after hearing people talk about great **** it was. I found they were right & titanfall 2 became one of my fastest 100% on my PS4. This game really did have it all, a great story and amazing multiplayer. Titanfall 2 is the king of movement shooters.. An absolutely brilliant game. Yes, the story is predictable, but I'd rather have a poor story told well than a good story told poorly. The movement is supreme, the gunplay is satisfying and the game runs very well. I can't believe EA abandoned this franchise........ Best game ever, definitely deserves a sequel thank you EA for ruining another franchise you really are one of the game studios of all time.. It’s a banger. The campaign is great, bit short for my liking but it’s still a great experience. The movement is fluid and satisfying to play with, gunplay is awesome and titan fighting is also great! With the price it is at now, it’s a must buy.. This game is so underrated!! Unlike other fps games like CoD or Battlefield, Titanfall 2 has an amazing campaign!! The story is a very basic blockbuster action movie story but the level design is just astounding! Everything is so well thought! You discover elements of gameplay very gradually and the game just gets better and better. The levels are designed to make you think about all the possibilities the different elements of gameplay can offer. I was mind-blown. I wanted to finish the campaign before starting to play online. I finished the campaign in a few **** multiplayer is very very nice too. Even if you're a beginner you will enjoy it as teams are composed of real players and bots. So, even if you're not very good in the beginning you will be able to contribute by killing bots. The gameplay cycle is just so well balanced. I enjoy the quick and very dynamic movement of the pilot and then when you have scored a bit you can summon your titan and enjoy a heavier gameplay with all the artillery your titan has to offer. Jumping on enemies titan to steal batteries is also a lot of fun! It is so underrated, I am really amazed. The developers did such an amazing job on this game. Thank you so much!. Everything about this game is amazing. Only change I would make is that you could skip the cutscenes in the campaign. They get annoying after you’ve completed the campaign 20 times. The best game. Nothing is better. This is everything a multiplayer game should have regarding leveling, movement, and gunplay. The single-player is also amazing. It **** they focus on Apex.. fantastic story although quite old game play remains gorgeous wow, mechanic fantastic,the only thing they could put more titan. A godly game, I currently have over 100 hours of gameplay and am still playing, the story is 10 out of 10 and the gameplay is 10 out of 10.. Such a great **** story is 10/10. The gameplay is so fluid and rich. I have played this game online for so many hours and keep replaying the story. Hope we get a 3rd game.. Awesome game, i really liked it. Good story, and beautiful gameplay, awesome.. Since my knowledge of and experience with multiplayer FPS titles is limited, my review is for the campaign of Titanfall 2, which is truly phenomenal and remains the gold standard for concise single-player components of multiplayer titles. Respawn delivers a cinematic experience full of incredibly varied gameplay encounters and rich mechanics, drawing from and expanding on strong aspects of highly influential FPS titles that came before such as Half-Life and Halo. The visuals remain impressive, the gameplay is addictive and fun, and each additional mechanic from the time-travel to the general mech combat is revolutionary and fully polished. If only it all lasted a bit longer.. Titanfall 2’s campaign is the best FPS campain I have ever played. The voice acting, the story, the weapons, the mechanics- it’s all fantastic. The only flaw the campaign has is it is too short. But Titanfall 2 is a straight-to-the-point game with everything Call of Duty wishes it could be. It would be a crime to not develop a third game.. One of, if not THE most fun FPS game I've ever played. I've played a lot of Apex, so this gameplay wasn't really new to me. But to have a good story, bosses, extra mechanics, good characters, and really cool environments, this game was great. I had a blast playing this. I started it on the hardest difficulty and it was a great challenge. They were generous with the checkpoints and I respect that. The game wasn't AS hard as I thought it would be tho, but like I said, I respect that. The platinum was fun to get. Respawn knows how to make great gameplay. Ubisoft, learn something from them. Far Cry is still trash.. One of the best FPS's I've ever played.. greatest shooter of all time.. soooooo over the top. best movement OAT. played.. Just get your time thru this beautiful campaign and enjoy the fast paced movement of the multiplayer along with friends, this game may be quite old but it's experience isn't.. The best single player shooter campaign out there full stop. Still holds up in 2023. gunplay and level design simply unmatched to this day.. Best FPS game ever, being futuristic Call of Duty done right with Mechas, High Speed Movement, just a blast to improve youre skills in. The campaign is my favorite movie, there are infinite possibilities and fun to be had in the multiplayer, and PvE is just brilliant.. Great. Nice job Ivctuigc4601idbsbiwidhxhh2883brbchbsiidbhh37w99dhxhhe9229hd. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Finished this game in 2023. What can I say - it's a masterpiece. Definitely need to try. Inside a mech is another experience! Fights are so dynamic, combining mech and person, lots of weapon. Very hope to see Titanfall 3 !!!. I'm very bad at this and it's still easily one of my favorite games (also has my favorite voice actor). This is a diamond in the rough tho, which is entirely unfair to those that made the game. What does that mean? It means it released in a very crowded time where so many games were competing each others' release window that this game didn't get the popularity it deserves. Years and years later, it's still a great popular game. Online is fast paced and crazy Campaign is funny, witty, and makes you care about a titan, more than just it's metal frame that's protecting you. (updated 2023 review) It's not playable for me. Matchmaking is upwards of 5 minutes, multiplayer disconnects from the server and you really can't do anything of substance. Campaign was okay... I suppose. Clearly their cash cow is Apex.. I only played the campaign and my score is a 7. It last about 7 hours or so. I enjoyed the first half of the game and some parts of the ending. It's a shooter with some easy puzzles. Decent voices in Spanish.. More than what you expect from an FPS campaing for sure, the story and the bond between the main actors are very well presented. On the other hand, the gameplay mechanics are way ahead of its time.. Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!. I think I have never played a smoother FPS game before 'Titan Two'. The art style is awesome, the story quite right and the gameplay outstanding amazing. I fell in love with the gunplay and the whole mechanics of the game and I really can recommend this titel to you, even in 2023 it is a great title that should be tried.. Titanfall 2 is the most videogame videogames have ever videogamed. There are many reason it flopped, but none are the games fault: a release date between established titans in the videogame industrie, hackers with skill issues being angry for no reason, and neglect from the higher-ups. But nevertheles, if you can, play it. Hell **** EA and Respawn if they let the franchise die. this is not fortnite >:( + titanfall 2 more like titanfall poo lmaooooooooo. Best movement game. Fun to replay the story when you completed it‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎. Titanfall 2 does everything an FPS game need perfectly, the story is one of the best in the FPS genre and the game play allows for fun, fast paced game with a lot of speed run potential and the multiplayer is one of the best of it's time, unfortunately EA left TItanfall 2 for dead due to the fact they released it in between Call of duty Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, and the multiplayer has been overrun by hackers. FPS meets mech game with a dash of Prince Of Persia style acrobatics in this beautiful looking military adventure. The platforming element means that you can approach combat with speed and aggression rather than the usual creeping around. Not quite the measure of the Halo games, but it retains their spirit much better than Bungie's own Destiny series does.. This is a very creative and enjoyable First Person Shooter, the titan fights are the highlight of the game, and the platforming is great. The story however, is very short and takes a while to pick up, as for the characters, they're okay, I actually didn't really like Cooper as a protagonist, the dialogue options are completely unnecessary and just cringe. There are some difficulty spikes but overall the game is balanced, the boss fights are a little bit underwhelming and very repetitive. Lastly there's a multiplayer mode for those who want to keep playing, and it's a nice addition. That being said, Titanfall 2 is just... nothing extraordinary in my opinion, it's a solid experience, a fun videogame, but it doesn't do anything different. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. Titanfall 2 is REALLY a worthy second game by Respawn complete with one of the most intriguing storylines for any FPS since Modern Warfare 2. Thanks for EA that it was their LAST great game before Battlefront 2 came a year later until the Dead Space remake in January.. Great campaign, excellent and fresh level design, a few quite simple puzzles and a lot of fast paced, fluid action. My only criticism is it was quite short, I finished it in 2-3 days, not sure how many hrs.. BUT: Some of the level design and overall art direction is some of the best I’ve seen, definitely on par with Dishonored 2’s Clockwork Mansion which is a marvel of level design. So, this makes up for the short campaign. I’m not usually into FPS’s as it can get repetitive quickly, but the fluidity of the gameplay along with the level design made it interesting and rewarding. If your into sci fi you should definitely try it out. Haven’t touched the multiplayer yet, don’t know if I will.. The campaign is so awesome boss fights, combats so good! multiplayer was awesome aswell this game is 10/10 totally would recommend!!. This game is so good every player should play it because campaign:10/10 multiplayer:9/10 boss fight:10/10 best game ever I played in my life. While the campaign itself may be very good, filled with creative scenarios, and great gameplay to accompany it, the story just isn't what people make it out to be, it reminds me very much of an average sci-fi movie, with lackluster characters (except for the one that everyone, including me loves), and a very make-it-as-you-go plot. However, for me, the multiplayer is where this game really shines, with one of the exhilarating multiplayer modes I've played, with great weapon variety and maps, and the fantastic change of pace that is the titan gameplay. Endlessly enjoyable. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done! P.S. it works great. Great game the story was epic I recommend it truly amazing game 100% go play it.. one of the best mp games of all time. on top of that the single players was also great. please make titanfall 3! apex doesn't hit the same way, we need titans!!. An amazing funny, fast and so well done multiplayer game that will give you hours of enjoyment.. This game is pretty cool - me Good with friends and family haha - also me GGss. Awesome campaign and great multiplayer, definitely deserved more attention when it came out.. Amazing singleplayer and multiplayer modes, only thing thats keeping it from a 10 is the fact that it doesnt get updated and that there is no crossplay. Fun shooter alien action, seriously hindered by nearly impossible platforming and no hints on what to do when you get stuck failing the same thing 40 times. Typical ea crap fest. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Preety good campaign, gameplay is fluid and enjoyable, one of the best FPS campaigns out there. Titanfall 2 is better than the original in every way imaginable. Not only does it actually have a story, the story is fantastic.. A great game with much attention to detail and heart and soul put into it. Titanfall 2's campaign is a wonderful experience with funny jokes, a interesting plot line that keeps you on your toes and a ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING movement system. My only problem is with the console servers, Due to a bad release timeframe and marketing. This game didn't get enough of a fandom and love from gamers around the world for the devs to make back to back updates, Pretty much. TLDR: Great game but needs some work on console multiplayer servers and need more attention to the console version of the game.. Excellent game. It's unfortunate that I wasn't able to play any of the multiplayer but that's okay because Its single player campaign is every bit as good as the hype suggests. It is very creative and at times, surprisingly poignant. It also fully showcases this game's fun gameplay. There are two reasons why this game is so fun: A) It absolutely nails movement and traversal in a way that no other FPS game can ever dream of, and B) Every gun feels so good to fire. All fluid. All responsive. The human enemy AI is kinda dumb and often slow to react but that's no problem on Hard difficulty (the perfect difficulty) because the game overwhelms you with sheer weight of numbers and enemy damage output. It forces you to keep moving, maintain a fast pace and to use every weapon and tool you have. I can not begin to describe how much fun this game is on Hard. I did like the Titan gameplay with it being a little slower and more tactical but not nearly as much as when i was playing as a Pilot on foot. One of the best FPS games ever made.. the Campaign is basically painted by Numbers for the Most part but I think it's really cool you get to play a Recruit named Jack Cooper also you its cool you get in that perspective also you get attached to Monarch Titan BT he is a cool character in his own right 8/10. Played this game after Apex Legends and was pleasantly surprised. Excellent story and graphics, familiar and more complex gameplay. What is happening in multiplayer is beyond words, cool mechanics that were cut in Apex. The pros of this game can do such amazing things that my jaw dropped.. Online is fun but sometimes has trolls. I love the story and how they expanded on the world from just being a online game, guns are ok but character sometimes gets stuck when trying to jump over A.I, definently play again but not as often.. Very enjoyable single game campaign. Incredible multiplayer. The game ideas is top notch. I want TF3.. I only got around to playing this game this year, 2022. Boy, did i miss out on one of the best first person single player campaigns ever. So good. The story is decent but the guns, mechs, wall jumping ability and time travel segments were just fantastic. It's sad that we may never see a Titanfall 3.. Great campaign, albeit short. Fun weapons and load-outs. Dialogue is casual and funny. Story is ok.. The most fun gameplay I've ever seen. Level designs are flawless. Communication with IT is very friendly. Greetings from BT.. Far too little attention is paid to this game. Titanfall 2 is a very good first person shooter. i really recommend Titanfall 2.. Titanfall 2 was a great multiplayer game but the single player is still worth the mony. It's weird to think, even more so by playing and finishing it, that this brilliant shooter came out half a decade ago. What made it different probably also helps make it look still new. Titanfall 2's plot, to be honest, may not have anything special. But it's the rhythm, execution and the always-on-track good writing that makes it interesting and easy to follow and enjoy. The BT-Jack Cooper duo is enough to hold up the plot perfectly; the cast of ""villains"" works. The writing could have been better, such as clearly explaining how the Fold Weapon works. Also, the ""Effect and Cause"" level suggests that time travel plays a central role in the plot, but this is not the case; this could have been made clearer. Apparently Titanfall 2 wouldn't be much very different from its contemporaries: it's a modern FPS with aim down sight, regenerative HPs and it's pretty linear... but the point being that among them, it stands out. It's not Doom (2016) and yet Titanfall 2, at least partially, follows its philosophy: it can be frenetic, fast, ""the pilot"" (if the player knows how to move) is furious, like sliding while killing enemies which is pretty fun. Verticality is good and double jump is essential in this sense as much as wall-running: a philosophy which reminds ""push forward combat"", in fact. It is true that not all levels are suitable for this approach, and some require a slower slant. The level design, however, is great and really impressive at times such as the smoothness and seamless time shifting in ""Effect and Cause"" emblematic level, both combat and platforming, which is really a peak for the genre, an incredible technical and design achievement. Shooting feedback also works pretty well. Piloting the Titan, the ""walking tank"", the other side of gameplay, is a nice thing. It might look less hectic and more boring but it's what varies the gameplay and makes it more interesting. Titan combat requires a good perception of space and good timing using offensive means to outperform enemy Titans; the spirit of the ""fight among titans"" is there and radio communications with enemies contribute to a good visual/audio atmosphere. There are several sets of Titan equipment: each different weapon also has a time-based recharging ability or gadget which can be used altogether for advantage and a powerful final attack that recharges when hits are scored. The Titan has no regenerative HPs and needs batteries to recover them, of which there is rarely a shortage. Enemy Titan boss battles happen and are all in all appreciable but one. And this brings me to some major flaws. First of all, there is a huge baffling leap from penultimate to last skill level: it really seems like skipping 2 skill levels, not just one. Like that, it's probably one of the FPSs in which the player dies quicker among those I played and I played many of them. As such, that little bit of ""push forward combat"" that distinguished Titanfall 2 is nullified as it becomes a generic move-and-cover Call of Duty-like video game out of necessity. The higher skill level highlights flaws that are already there, even if less perceived otherwise as one soon realises, among other things, that the cloak ability offers no tactical advantage to the point it's useless, as it either lasts too short or recharges too slowly or both. Not to mention the infamous Viper boss fight: skill levels aside, why is the boss battle level so tight (basically a corridor) yet bumpy at the sides that it slows down the already clumsy Titan when manoeuvring? Why are there no effective shelters? Why is Viper simply so advantaged besides being a flying enemy which makes it challenging opponent in the first place? It's a whole game design mess, really, which makes a huge contrast to awesome stuff like ""Effect and Cause"". And finally, the game is short; too short and should have lasted at least half as long more for an acceptable longevity. Titanfall 2 is a good-looking video game. I am pleased to see that Valve's Source game engine still looks this good with the necessary updates, although it has been said the engine has been modified to the point it can be considered something in its own right. It's nothing revolutionary (while Source was in 2004) but some scenarios in particular show a high tier quality. Graphics quality doesn't negatively impact game's performance, which maintains a solid frame rate. Titanfall 2 is great game and one of the best FPSs ever made although it is far from perfect. I don't think it's the evolution of the genre but it is certainly a successful design exercise that left its mark. Highly recommended for people wanting to play something different among modern FPSs.. It's a good campaign with lots of variety, but the story really misses the mark for me as hard as it tries. If an FPS campaign is what you're looking for give it a go, but don't set expectations too high.. such an underrated game its better than call of duty in so many ways and superior gameplay and gunplay compared to stupid cod franchise. Fun and fast pace story mode. I completed it by 3-4 hours. It runs smooth in my old ps4 console. It is weird that the subtitle and the voice must be in the same language and can only be set in the console system setting.. So this is the game that was gonna revolutionize first person shooters? I don't know if that part of the community is so used to eating crap fo","titanfall 2 boasts one of the best campaigns ever created for a first-person shooter of the past decade . from the very first mission, the story captivates you with its emotional depth, engaging characters, and unexpected twists . from the very first mission, the story captivates you with its emotional depth, engaging characters ."
408.Dark Souls III,"This game is not even a open-world game, but it gave me the vibe like it's almost a sandbox. Not like the other games almost welcoming and guiding the player to explore and move on, the world in Dark Soul III just quietly and ruthlessly awaits the player to try again and again until you finally discover the truth of this dying world.. Took all the strong points of DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne and mixed it all into one game with top notch graphics. Clearly a classic.. A masterpiece full of incredible atmosphere, challange and satisfying gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Masterpiece!This game makes you feel like the whole world is set against you. Every enemy, every battle is a test of your will. But after defeating the next boss, you feel a wave of euphoria and calmness. You realize that the main thing is to move on. And even if there will be mistakes, falls and new attempts ahead, you realize that becoming a Lord is possible.This game is a reflection of life. It gives you hope and reminds you: “The unburned are always looking for embers”. If you haven't given up yet, victory is definitely ahead.10/10. A true masterpiece for those who are not afraid of challenges.. The difficulty of the game is what makes its so good and it teaches the player to adapt a learn, there is of course some parts of the game that is a little annoying like the swamp. Dark Souls 3 is the final piece of the Dark Souls trilogy, and I can confidently say it is the best of its kind. This is also my favorite Out of the 3 games, and the DLCs themselves are 10/10 as well. This game has the best bosses, soundtrack, and graphics out of the trilogy and concludes the story nicely.. Just a masterpiece in combat and atmosphere ! If you enjoyed Elden Ring consider this its little brother who manages to do a few things even better!. The best part of the series, charming landscapes and the same incredible lore of souls. The end of a series. I can say it's a very fitting end to one of the most memorable series in gaming. It puts things confidently into rest with both its DLC's and tying everything back to the other 2 games. Although it's a bit more linear than the other 2, it helps balance out the difficulty of its areas and also its bosses. This leads to some of the best boss fights in the series by far. I have to say that it's also the most beginner friendly with fast and responsive combat and clear and concise menus. Praise the Sun!!. i prefer the other dark souls than the 3 sequel, for any reason, but its aweasome game. FROM's best game. It's better than Elden Ring, better than Bloodborne. Absolutely fantastic experience I love it!. This game feels more like a missed opportunity than a cohesive experience. While its core gameplay revolves around defeating enemies, there’s little to no narrative to provide context or purpose. The lack of a compelling story leaves the experience feeling hollow, as if the sole objective is to overcome increasingly difficult challenges without any meaningful **** difficulty itself is more frustrating than rewarding, often relying on cheap mechanics rather than skill-based progression. Coupled with uninspired level design and repetitive encounters, it fails to capture the player’s interest or offer a memorable **** the end, this title struggles to find an identity, leaving it as a forgettable entry in its genre. It’s hard to recommend to anyone seeking depth or style in their gaming experience.. Weakest soulsborne game. It's the dodge-roll simulator boss rush personified. Dark Souls 3 lacks atmosphere, innovation, immersive level design, cohesiveness and is too fan-servicey. A lot of areas are reused assets from Bloodborne and some of the bosses are straight up bad. This game gets a good rep for its bosses but in truth there's 2 bad bosses for every good one. You can tell Miyazaki was forced to make this game due to the backlash of DS2 but he flopped pretty hard on this one.. Fromsoftware comeback after not so great Ds2 and nailed it ,i don't any game has better lineup of boss lategame when it starts from Dragon armour to Twin princes into Souls of cinder then probably best duo boss in FS game demon prince ,friede ,midir and Gael probably my favourite with Margit and Maliketh from ER. I was expecting more **** with a good review. The graphics and the physics are disappointing for a 2016 game. Worse than that, in spite of weak graphics, it is not optimized! As I compare this game to a similar game like Prince of Persia 2008, the combat is so simpler. It should have been more exciting. I give one score just because of the good environment. I also mostly see people play this game because it is hard but I would rather call this game a no-difficulty-option game instead of a hard game! There could be plenty more games that you can simply set its difficulty to the hardest and might become harder than this game.. One of the greatest games ever made. A genuinely masterpiece. I do not need to say anything else.. previous to elden ring this was by far my favorite souls game. Really fun varied areas, great bosses, phenomenal music, the best dark souls game in the series by far.. Amazing everything it is ridiculous that anyone gave this game less than a 90%. I have played a LOT of games but this is by far the Greatest Of All Time, it really did change my life. Thank you Miyazaki my goat. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PROS.: This game is amazing, I can't stop playing until the end. CONS: I didn't enjoy all the possible finals. Hope something more interesting for a hard game to beat.. The best souls game and my personal favorite in the entire genre. Wished it got a remake or something cuz the only thing I feel like its lacking is its controls, it feels a bit clunky and old bz its an old game.. The only type of game genre created by miyazaki that can make your body,hand,feet felt cold,hot,fast breathing,pounding heart,chills,relieve(especially when landing the final blow)after beating the bosses(10-30 tries),many developer tries to copy the gameplay(not just the difficulties but checkpoint system,limited healing,etc)but the one created by miyazaki(fromsoftware developer)always have the most of that moment. Great conclusion for the Dark Souls franchise! Amazing bosses, Areas, and Music.. An amazing game with hard but satisfying combat and great bosses. Would 100% recommend. It's also one of the easiest Soulsborne games, though, so if you've never played one (or if you have) pick up this game and you'll have a good time. And get either the Fire Fades edition or the season pass, because the DLC like Ringed City is so great. DS3 is a must play.. Pretty good, 8/10 because of bad UI design decisions and technical issues (a lot of pop in textures):kick should be custom bindable and input buffering shouldn’t exist, camera should not be this bad in a game from 2016, the boss should not ever leave the screen, lock on system should be omni directional with further range and should work regardless of line of sight, also there should be an option to disable the R3 to center camera, nameless king and king of the storm should be 2 separate boss encounters and aggro range for mobs should be smaller. After two playthroughs the cracks start to show and the general clunkiness starts to get annoying. Why am i constantly getting knocked down by normal enemies? Why am i constantly getting interrupted when attacking? I swear in my 70h of playing my attacks got interrupted at least 10 thousand times. It really starts to just feel bad to play. Also non-boss enemy design is too fast with too many combos that do too much damage. You can easily get completely stun locked to death by just two-three enemies. Cant heal, cant move, cant attack… its happened like 20 times. It doesnt make the game harder, just tedious and annoying. There aren't any words worthy of singing the praises of this game. Must play.. camera bit stinky in some boss fights however flawless game other tha nthat. This game fixes so many of the problems with ds3 making it look like what could of been while taking a more linear approach. i played this game, but I didn't like it, there are a lot of weapons, you can do builds, I didn't like the bosses, except for a few, the game looks good, but somehow after bloodborn, when I played it, it didn't attract me like the world of bloodborn ... everything all in all, the game is okay, it's a bit overrated. If we compare it with other souls games, ""DARK SOULS 3"" is definitely the best souls game ever. The game has smoother gameplay and character control than all other Souls games. You can jump as soon as you drink estus, and after taking damage, you can roll to wherever you want in a very short second. I'm not even talking about their music. The music of this game is definitely at an award-winning level. In addition, the fact that it is a sad work increases its level of memorability even more. I can say that it is the only Souls game that fromsoftware has made with care. Level designs and boss designs are already at a level that we can call art. Play this game, make others play it.. Dark Souls III is a masterpiece. Thank you miyazaki for this amazing game.. Great game. I just finished going through the add-ons and it was a great experience. Sorry, but Elden ring is not even a match for classic souls in terms of passion for the process.. Dark Souls III exemplifies perfection in action RPGs with its intricate world design, challenging yet fair combat, and hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. From its deep lore to the meticulously crafted environments, every detail immerses you in a rich, interconnected world. Combat is a ballet of precision and strategy, rewarding patience and skill. The sense of accomplishment from overcoming its formidable bosses is unparalleled. With stunning visuals and a haunting soundtrack, Dark Souls III is a masterpiece that sets the standard for the genre, delivering an unforgettable gaming experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pros - crisp combat that feels fair - the best boss design in Dark Souls - the Ringed City DLC only serves to elevate the game - massive amounts of build variety // Cons - way less interconnected map design - the only good thing about Ashes of Ariandel is the final boss fight // Being the third game, following what many people consider a disappointing entry and ending the Dark Souls series, DSIII had to stick the landing. We are all lucky it didn't just stick it. DSIII landed on its feet and decided to do cartwheels. Best boss design among the three entries. Massive weapon, armor and ring variety that allows for an unimaginable amount of builds. Combat that doesn't feel like two trucks trying to flip each other over. It does everything right. As to the previously mentioned boss design, it is goated. Nameless King and the Slave Knight are my two favorite fights amongst everything Fromsoft has ever released. Dancer, Pontiff, Abyss Watchers are iconic. The only bosses I would label as bad are Aldritch, Wolnir and Scat Tree. DSIII also does something that is not just rare for a Fromsoft game, it is very rare in media in general. It provided one of the most cinematic and mechanically engaging fights as the very final thing you engage in. And where Gale runs, Nameless walks. Both of them are so mechanically perfect, that dying to them truly feels like a mistake on my part instead of a wrong hitbox. Ingenious. Dark Souls III is the rare media conclusion, where everybody left satisfied at the end. If you have doubts about jumping in, just take the leap and experience one of the best products, from one of gaming's biggest darlings.. This game was far better than an 89! C’mon now!! This game was easily the best game of 2016 and would give it 2016 Game of the Year while Uncharted 4 was my runner up. Overall score 10/10. Awesome game one of the best I'd say! I love it so much! I think they peaked here to be honest!. Controls **** cause not-responsive, story almost nonexistent, and generally speaking - nothing interesting to do here instead of trying to kill these annoying dogs. Mechanics are really obsolete. Although graphics and music are nice, but i cannot recommend this game to anyone. Simply overhyped.. You want a game where you explore a dark fantasy world while also getting your ass kicked and kicking ass while being a knight, wizard, and whatever else you want to be? Here ya go. it's just so peak. everything is just so good, great level design, thrilling combat, and best bosses in the series. the graphics also held up pretty well.. Dark Souls 3 it is masterpiece no one a doubt it, soundtrack,gameplay, bosses. Great game! I love it! Best Fromgame but Elden Ring is a little better, I say get BOTH.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is one of the best game i've ever played . Pure masterpiece , always keeps you entertainted , always has something new to explore. Variety of weapons ,equipment and armors to pick from . The best bosses in the franchise yet . Also definitely focus on the lore as well as it has a lot to offer!. The linear progression makes exploration less exciting but they doubled down on the boss fights and atmosphere of Dark Souls. It might not be as legendary as Dark Souls 1 but it still has the most poetic and sad ending to any souls game.. While Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 and 2 laid the groundwork, it was really Dark Souls 3 that defined the Souls genre and deserves the respect for doing so. Best game ever the bosses are simply outstanding the only problem is the existence of Farron keep. This game is the pinnacle of soulslike games and should be played by anyone who also enjoys soulslike games.. This game is so overrated and it **** **** Old ass mechanics and boring start to finish … just some nerds overrating a shiit game. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. I hated it how slow DS1 was, DS3 fixes these issues, but still it's not as good as BB or Sekiro. At least I like the linear approach, in direct comparison to ER. Nonetheless 7/10 so I recommend everyone to play it.. Great game! Even though it lacks the amazing level design of DS1 or the atmosphere of Bloodborne it feels like the perfect linear formula for a From software game. The bosses are all great even though some are on the easy side. The lore is as deep as ever, the levels are really fun and polished, and the combat feels great with a lot of weapons in the mix to try.. Dark Souls showed to be the greatest challenge for the franchise, and giving the fans an unforgettable experience. The game is not merely a challenging action RPG, but rather a captivating culmination of the series' expertly crafted formula. The combat itself is exquisite, a deliberate dance of precise strikes and strategic evasions that is truly unparalleled. Achieving mastery over it is an accomplishment in its own right, as is simply surviving in this eerily beautiful world. Every placement of enemies and every hidden corner feels meticulously designed to provide a constant sense of excitement. Dark Souls III is a triumph, a game that will leave a lasting impression long after the final credits have rolled.. One of the best or even the best souls game, great bosses, osts, areas and weapons. The dlcs for this one are superb and are a must play.. Great Game. Many games use numerous cut scenes to convey the story and atmosphere of solving the game, and the problem is that it is easy to get bored. This game delivers very smartly without relying on cut scenes. If you don't do it well, you've brilliantly overcome what can seem very cheap. In fact, regardless of this part, the action alone is already a masterpiece.. the music and themes of this game are totally epic and sets a very intentional gloomy mood in all the right ways. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dark Souls III is one of the rare games that feels like a constant icy shower on first playthrough with moments of constriction and discomfort, that erupt in joy and relief and a pride of success that I perceive as unparalleled in my long history of playing video games.I do not know how it feels if this is your first kind of game that is as uncompromising and unyielding as the Souls games than Dark Souls. It was my third after playing half through Bloodborne and being completely absorbed by Dark Souls I. If you found any joy in its gameplay style, in its gatekeeping and abstract story telling, in its shady and dubious worldbuilding, you will find in Dark Souls III a piece of art that is at the peak of presentation of atmosphere, boss fights, story-depth and the tragic twisted philosophical themes that stuck with me ever since. Read no further, start it and let it tumble over you - The only things keeping it from being a 10/10 is the occasional involuntarily over-powering on subsequent playthroughs, the equipment load juggling I simply do not like as an skilling moderator in the Souls games and the swamp level at Farron Keep that I perceive as bloated and redundant in its size.. Dark Souls 3, the final installment in the legendary series by FromSoftware, stands tall as a majestic and unforgettable swan song. With its refined gameplay mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and hauntingly atmospheric world, Dark Souls 3 delivers an experience that both honors its predecessors and carves its own **** of the standout features of Dark Souls 3 is its impeccable combat system. Building upon the foundation of the series, it introduces fluid and responsive gameplay that rewards skillful timing and strategic decision-making. Each encounter is a thrilling dance of life and death, demanding both patience and quick thinking. From tense sword fights to intense spellcasting, the combat is a true masterpiece that keeps players engaged and on the edge of their **** world design in Dark Souls 3 is an absolute marvel. Lordran and Drangleic may have been awe-inspiring, but Lothric surpasses them both. Every area is meticulously crafted, showcasing a breathtaking blend of gothic architecture, ruined castles, and eerie landscapes. The interconnectedness of the world delights players, offering shortcuts and hidden paths that make exploration a true joy. Unraveling the secrets hidden within Lothric is an adventure in itself, providing a sense of discovery and wonder.Graphically, Dark Souls 3 sets a new standard for the series. From grandiose vistas to the tiniest details, the game showcases stunning visual fidelity. The lighting effects, intricate textures, and attention to detail all contribute to an immersive and atmospheric experience. Dark Souls 3's gloomy yet beautiful art direction flawlessly captures a sense of impending doom and the decaying grandeur of the **** storytelling in Dark Souls 3 delivers a poignant tale that ties together the loose threads from its predecessors. The intricate lore is interwoven into the world, leaving breadcrumbs for players to discover and interpret. From enigmatic NPCs to cryptic item descriptions, the narrative unfolds gradually, offering moments of revelation and emotional weight. The somber yet captivating storytelling enriches the experience, leaving a lasting impression on the player.Multiplayer functionality in Dark Souls 3 continues to be a highlight. The seamless integration of cooperative play adds an element of shared triumph and camaraderie, while the unpredictable invasions keep players on their toes. Whether earnestly assisting others or engaging in intense PvP battles, the multiplayer component adds depth, replayability, and a sense of community to the game.While Dark Souls 3 excels on almost every front, a few minor blemishes prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Occasional technical issues and minor balancing inconsistencies detract slightly from the overall experience. However, these do not significantly impact the game's brilliance and are negligible in the face of its many achievements.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Another army rolling ankle biting simulation of castles, churches, swamps and sewers. Another case of controller wrecking frustration as inputs seem to be optional. Did you press strike once, or twice, did I roll left or right? Neither is apparently the answer to both as you have a halberd forcibly inserted inside your throat. Don't worry though, you won't **** see any of this as the camera decided to lock onto the **** ground or the roof during this whole ordeal. Maybe next time I'll lock onto the enemy instead of spinning either 90 or 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Great to know I'll be wasting time running back here, likely clipping of a small rock, that I've never noticed before, that will prevent me from collecting my souls. Otherwise great games, just **** annoying to play.. Worst of the 3 but that's not saying much its still amazing. Loses a lot of the Dark souls charm and feels smashed together with Bloodborne. PvP is still okay but it not on Dark Souls 2s level. The desync and hitboxes are unbearable and the ganking is even more pathetic than DS1. However the world is beautiful and the map is designed well. This game also has some of the most fun bosses in the series. Some of the funniest interactions ive had in Dark souls have been in this game. Definitely the best Co-op Dark souls.. Dark Souls 3 and Souls-series are definitely not for everyone, but true fans will enjoy it!. Bad game, even worser than Dark Souls 1, but actually it's good and fun so A-. dark soul was expectation got taht member dis hmm little easy enemy crazy boss fun had though multiplayer bussin. By far the best Souls game out there. Everyone has their own opinion, but Dark Souls 3 really is the best. Great combat, great bosses, great level design and fantastic aesthetics.. Dark Souls 3, rather than serving as a triumphant finale to the beloved series, falls into the trap of formulaic repetition. Its lack of innovation, frustrating difficulty, convoluted narrative, uninspired level design, and unbalanced multiplayer aspects collectively make it a tedious and underwhelming addition to the Souls franchise. For a series that once set the standard for challenging and innovative gameplay, Dark Souls 3 feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a fitting and memorable conclusion.. My favorite Souls game. Nearly every boss and area is memorable and addicting (especially the DLCs), with music that elevates these encounters to new heights. There is a ton of build variety available, and I’m especially partial to the unique boss weapons. I've done several playthroughs with different builds and have had a blast each time. The PVP is generally fun and active too. Whether you're a Souls veteran or newcomer, I can't recommend this game enough.. this is a nine for me but i have to add the extra point because my bf will break up with me if i don't (please send help). Dark Souls at it's best!. Easily one of my favorites video games of all time, and my favorite soulsborne game. Incredibly deep Lore, fantastic bosses, wonderful musics, it's hard to find a negative point.. An absolute masterpiece and a must play.. Pretty good game. Areas and overall atmosphere are a bit lacking compared to games like ds1 or bloodborne, but the bosses are absolutely fantastic and some of the greatest in video game history.. never understood why souls like games are considered hard? it's a grind game) it's just that if you don't know exactly how to kill an enemy, it seems difficult, in fact, players get a big rush of dopamine when they manage to kill the boss after a bunch of attempts) that's the whole secret). It's dark souls, so you know it's good, but how does it compare to it's predecessors? The gameplay is smooth and fast paced, with a lot more weapon variety. The bosses are varied and extremely aggressive, which makes defeating them that much more satisfying. The base game has very little wrong with it, but the dlc features some abysmally bad endgame areas, and while the DLC bosses are incredible, they are also some of the hardest bosses in video game history, and will require significant time commitment to overcome.. The game are so long and there and the swords have a great skills great bosses great ost I like this game the graphics are nice long game and I like the system of the rings the worth the price. Even though dark souls and demon souls were the original, this was the game that really put soulslikes on the map in my opinion. If you want to dip your toes into the genre. Here is a great place to start. you can't miss this game. Bestgameofthe series. My favorite game among all. Yes not for everyone, you've to enjoy challenging game and have the mental to get beaten up harder than ever but the feels man. If u can make it through this game will change you and the way you aproach games. Aside from the gameplay, hopefully this game will speek as deeply to your soul as it did to me. If you're into dark universe and poetic grim, enigmatic and gore stuff as I am, this masterpeace is made for you. I connect with the art of this game on a unique level. Level design is crazy, cinematics are over the roof, story well .. what u figure of the story is deep af. Cameras are not perfect, controls may feel a bit rough at the begining. But hey you were here for the challenge in the first place ? (the two dlcs are even better, like beyond words, play it). Still to date my favorite entry in the souls series, and one of my all time favorite games. it depends on if you count the dlcs or not i think no dlc it is an 8 whit dlc it is a 9 or 10 and has the best bosses in all of souls. A dark and brooding experience that feels like plunging into some black abyss of twisted mysteries that you’ll never understand, but that impact you deeply nonetheless. It’s a game better felt than understood, which work almost always in its favour.. It's aight. A little too much same regions as the past games tho.. the G.O.A.T. it's fun. very good so good bosses fun fun fun gooooood. A little too linear, with some boring levels and an okay story. Great boss fights and gameplay loop overall, very replayable and a worthy ending for the Dark Souls trilogy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Must play. Just buy it. First ""souls"" game. Thank you dark souls ;). I will start with the positives. Overall all the bosses look cool. The combat is very similar to Elden Ring, so therefore great. And some of the bosses are just great, I mean the last bosses of both the base game and the DLC’s are exceptional. Also the story is quite interesting, but I can’t say I understood it from just the game. I had to watch a YouTube video to understand it. And you can’t forget some of the tracks in the soundtrack. They’re amazing. Now for the negatives. It’s just too tough in certain areas. I had to get lots of help in the form of online co-op just to get past some of the bosses, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the ones I got help for. Luckily I beat the final bosses for the base game and both the DLC’s because they’re the best in the game, however I got help for around half of the rest of the bosses. However I think you should enjoy it if you feel ready to master the game mechanics, or atleast get to grips with them. And don’t feel bad if you need to get help from online co-op, this game is hard, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. There are people that will say your trash at games if you got help, and that you ruined the whole game. Don’t listen to them.. Came a little too far away from its roots for my liking into more of an ARPG than a Soulsborne game, but fantastic nonetheless.. This video game is the perfect culmination of this great saga. Every aspect of the ""Souls formula"" is taken to exceptionally high levels of quality; it's the definitive Dark Souls. The way it tells the story, its atmosphere, soundtrack, and above all, level design, are truly marvelous. Each boss has personality and a method of defeating them that, when discovered, fills you with satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. I want to emphasize the brilliance of the final boss, which brought a tear or two to my eyes. In summary, it's an outstanding video game that brilliantly concludes this saga.. A souls classic. mechanics, fights, designs, in short, everything is beautiful. If you like a dark universe, from software offers it.. The best Game Fromsotware very thanks Hidetaka Miyazaki Thanks Fromsotware. A great game but way too linear, you must go in one direction and thats it, for the entire game. I love DS2 better since it has more bioms, more enemy types and more content overall. My first dark souls game and I fell in love with dark souls games ever since. This Game is just Amazing Almost every Boss has a Godlike Ost and then there are Boss fights like Nameless King, Midir, Soul of Cinder and Gael which are all S Tier Bosses.. In many ways the true sequel to the first Dark Souls. Follows up on a lot of those concepts and mechanics and improves many of them. This has the best boss fights in the series in my opinion. Amazing music, amazing map designs, great build variety, engaging lore and exciting combat. Challenging, but fair.. this game close up the dark souls series one of the best game series ever made neatly, the boss fight take all the good points of dark souls 1 plus bloodborne and ignore dark souls 2 to create unique fights that will change your perspectives about gaming in general.. One of my favorites games ever, I really like play these kind of games. 10/10. The world desing is beautiful, the grafics are fantastic and the wepon arts god I love it, but is not for begginers, the game punish you hardly for explore the cenarios and isn't the best souls to start to know souls like game. When I played this game a had the sensation to play a game made only for fans and not for everone who want to hard game. I fell no diference betwen the introduction and the rest of the gameplay in terms of difcult. I love this game, but I don't recomend fot people who want to know an learn about the souls franchise, for begginers I recomend the first, the seccond, bloodborn or elden ring.. The game is amazing. There is nothing as satisfying as finally beating a boss after struggling on it for a while. The only issue is that it can be hard to know where to go and what to do to progress.. Maybe because this is my first souls game so im holding on to it but man is this an amazing game.. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 8/10; Gameplay: 10/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: 10/10. Pros - The Bossfights are Cinematic, Fast-Paced and well designed. - The level design is the best of any souls game - The graphics are fantastic, have held up for 6 years, and will for much longer - The combat is responsive - The enemies are diverse, and suit their respective environments Cons - It ended - There are perhaps 1 or 2 too many gimmick bosses.. Dark Souls 3 is a great game, hosting incredible lore and some of the best and most memorable boss fights ever. Even with these highs, the lows are too low for me to put it above an 8. These lows include the easy combat and frustrating early game.. I always found fromsoftware games overrated in terms like narration and writing, but despite that, dark souls 3 grabbed me by the balls and","the world in Dark Soul III just quietly and ruthlessly awaits the player to try again and again . it's a masterpiece full of incredible atmosphere, challange and satisfying gameplay . the difficulty of the game is what makes its so good and reminds you ""the unburned are always looking for embers"""
409.Gunstar Heroes,"Gunstar heroes is one of the best games for the Genesis/Mega Drive, cool graphics, music and also uses 3D, just make sure you don’t break your controller when fighting Gunstar Green. Another perfect conversion of a legendary game. Treasure was one of the stars of the Genesis/Megadrive, with classic games like Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy and..... believe it or not..... McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure. Yes, that's right. They took a fast food pimping clown and made an amazing hidden gen platformer. That takes some skill and vision. Gunstar Heroes is an exhilarating run-n-gun explosionfest with customizable weapons. And explosions. Lots and lots of explosions. Did I mention the explosions? Because you're gonna see a lot of 'em. It's a shame this series ended after the second installment, with Gunstar Super Heroes for the GBA. But the good news as that it has a place in the M2 converted SEGA 3D Classics lineup. This is a seminal game, it's a blast to play, and all the tricks Treasure used to simulate 3D on the Genesis makes this version absolutely pop. Unless you hate retro games or SEGA in general, you'll have a blast playing this. Cannot recommend enough.. For me, this game gets a way higher rating than the regular Virtual Console version, simply because it makes it easier by giving you an ""almost god"" mode. It also has an extremely easy ""temp save"" feature, so you don't have to play the stages over and over because they're too hard. And it's got really good 3D in it.. It's Gunstar Heroes, emulated and enhanced by M2, and in 3D. It's as good as that game's going to get, hand cramps on the 3DS aside! The sound is great (and there are the two different sound versions to choose from!), the quirky artwork and bosses are still there, and I think it still holds up well today. It's not a 2015 ""10,"" but it's certainly a seminal retro game.","gunstar heroes is an exhilarating run-n-gun explosionfest with customizable weapons . it's a seminal game, it's a blast to play, and all the tricks Treasure used to simulate 3D on the Genesis makes it absolutely pop . unless you hate retro games or SEGA in general, you'll have a blast playing this version ."
41.Halo 2,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is just as good as Halo CE. It fixes some issues like multiplayer, story, and levels but it also made other things worse. I personally think it looks worse, the Flood are more annoying for some reason, and I hate the new health system. I also don't care for story and always skip cutscenes.. I remember my bro coming home with a crystal Xbox and a copy of this, what a game!. Halo 2 is a great game that makes it easier to see its campaign in a more favorable light with time. One of the best multiplayer experiences at the time, and in general.. It's a great game. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of action, its mechanics are very good, the story line is very solid and of course the master chief is great.. This game is my 7th best game ever made. It might be seen as rushed and taped together to some people which it is. But it still out does the original by a large margin. 10/10. Simply a masterpiece. This game was the start of Xbox live and truly took Halo 1 and dialed it up.. When I played the original halo I thought it was awesome but this is art everything an fps sequel needs the story is really good so far I’m half way in halo 3. So happy this game got the remaster it deserved btw it was absolutely goated. After having played the original Xbox version of Halo 2 online with the Xbox Live substitute Insignia, there are much better competitive multiplayer games that exist even on this console. It's certainly great, but it's easily overhyped. Lots of the features Halo 2 was praised for upon release already existed prior in other games. Culminating all of them together certainly makes it special, but the actual gameplay experience leaves much to be desired. Lackluster weapon balance, and gamemodes that easily wear themselves out make it hard to keep playing if you've already been in the space for some time, which wasn't expected in 2004, but still likely. Regardless, the multiplayer is held together by an objectively revolutionary custom games system that holds it together even in modern light and paved the way for the future of casual online gaming as we know it. Becoming the proving ground of thousands of homemade gamemodes, dozens of modes that would become series staples, and a few that would transcend the series and become genre staples, such as the legendary Infection gamemode. Regardless, Halo 2's praise can likely be attributed to the ease of gameplay and large scale online connectivity. It is arguably one of the easiest FPS games to pick up and play in the entire genre, hosting a casually competitive to incredibly competitive range of gameplay and gamemodes. And with the rise of high-speed internet access across the world, hundreds of thousands of homes would join the fun in Xbox Live and experience online multiplayer for the first time in a format that heavily facilitates community and communication. Outside of the multiplayer, however, the campaign is probably my least favorite of the Bungie releases. Yet again suffering from similar issues with balance and a seriously lacking runtime, only about 9 hours during a time where 12-14 hours wasn't just the average, but was expected from your money. But, you can't mention Halo 2's campaign without the infamous legendary mode, which has Master Chief in a supposedly upgraded set of armour, that can handle less bullets than Rookie can in Halo 3:ODST. The same ones you can slaughter in droves as Master Chief without really thinking too much about it. Who's the real spartan here? At the end of the day, without the nuance of nostalgia, Halo 2 falls below my expectations of a 2000's multiplayer-focused shooter, but makes itself easily approachable for those who are new to the space, making it a unique case where you can easily hop in and play without much knowledge of video games at all. But regardless, lacks the mechanical skill-ceiling or gameplay variety of the sort of game I would be looking for now, or even in 2004. -steeliest. Outstanding sequel to the legendary halos series with amazing maps continued story. The idea that there are two protagonist is a good edition to the the game and beside being the Masterchef story, but also speaks of the uprising and fall of the covernent which Bungie, fitted perfectly into the timeline. The first few levels are a stunning set of amazing combat ready environment to play through with the Masterchef with the addition of duel weilding. This was also the first game to boast the brutes which is a great challenge for players to tackle. The arbiter was an iconic character in the series while also being a way to chop and change from the Masterchef. His different abilitys allows you to go invisible at will and fight with covernent troops instead of agents. After the the first game this was a true stuner and great continuations of the series and bring Masterchef to the next chapter of his fight.. Its not a perfect game and yes the flood do make the game worse. I can't give this game a 8.5 so its a 9. its my favorite game of all time but its not a 10. I have played 10/10 games. Took the original's story and universe and turned it up to 11. Expands on everything, has a fantastic story, fantastic multiplayer, insane lore, amazing soundtrack... Perfection.. Masterpiece, much better than the first one in my opinion .. If the final act wasn’t cut, this would be my favourite game of all time. The campaign is still a masterpiece, if not a flawed one. Halo 2 features one of the best stories ever written for a game, and multiplayer so revolutionary it changed online gaming forever. Any modern multiplayer experience, particularly for console, in some way owes itself to this. In what? 9 months? Bungie changed the status quo, again.. Halo 2 is a massive improvement on the solid foundation that Halo Combat Evolved started. A much more engrossing story, improved game-play and a working online multiplayer made Halo 2 one of the most important games I had growing up and playing with my cousins during Christmas. The only ""complaint"" I can bring against Halo 2 is on how barren the multiplayer was in terms of what was available, it was an early Xbox Live game so while there wasn't anything to unlock or grind for it did exactly what it needed to do at the time.. This is ok at best. It added a lot of cool features like duel wielding, a usable energy sword and being able to play as the covenant. But much like every mainline halo it gets worse halfway through where its just nothing but the flood. Dual wielding is incredible. The story is incredible. This is one of the best halo games ever created. The aniversary edition is very nice and well done. Anniversary cutscenes are some of the best cutescenes ever. They are better than most modern AAA cutscenes. Incredible, Incredible, Incredible, Incredible.. Simply a masterpiece. One of my favorite Halo games. It's challenging and at some times feals cheap, but it has such good gameplay and level design that trumps all those minor issues. Master chief is the goat.. Following the ways of old halo 2 shows how classic gameplay can still be fun even over 16 years later halo 2 and it's story show a way of how it was made while not making full sense the game and it's multiplayer is the 2nd best in my opinion with reach being in first. Halo 2 was once a game you could spent literally hundreds of hours into online multiplayer, and now because its no longer online, must rely on its mediocre single player campaign. While Halo 2 was a great multiplayer for its time, the single player campaign suffers greatly from a lot of dark empty repetitive levels with terrible syncing music. Although Halo 2 has a more interesting story line with viewpoints from the Arbiter and Master Chef, ultimately it fails as a single player experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best Halo campaigns, it still holds up very well today and I've been playing it back and forth throughout the years, the gameplay is engaging enough to keep you on your toes especially if you play Heroic difficulty which is what I recommend to play early on and if you want a real challenge the legendary difficulty will be your best bet, regarded as one of the hardest campaign in any Halo game for me this title is easily one of the best of the series. Nowadays on MCC and the additional modifiers that alter the gameplay experience and difficulty (in both agonizing and bizarre ways) add a relative amount of replayability to the game.. My favorite halo game of all time played it for years. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Imagine making one of the best FPS campaigns ever and then doing it again. Despite some difficulty issues on Legendary, the campaign is a worthy successor to CE. Furthermore, it revolutionised online multiplayer as we know it, and set up the behemoth that would be 360 era Xbox Live. Of course, this game feels more responsive than CE while also carving out is own, more competitive identity as it is known for today, with additions like the battle rifle and the mistake that was button combos, carving out it's eventual legacy.. this game is good but not as good as the first or third ones. that beind said it is definitely better than forespoken. This is the pinnacle of Halo. Amazing campaign, multiplayer, and took Halo to even further heights.. HALO 2 was about as good as Halo CE... nothing much to hate about it. currently playing Halo 3. The game that launched online console shooters nearly two decades ago still holds up today. Not only does it have the amazing multiplayer that popularized Xbox Live, but it delivers one of the greatest stories in gaming.. The greatest Multiplayer game of all time, 1 and 2 are simultaneous and for me almost a singular experience. Loved this game, everything has already been said, but it is for sure in my top five games of all time.. Halo 2 was a perfect successor for the overwhelming Combat Evolved. From campaign to multiplayer (local and online), everything is very polished. Not as groundbreaking as the first part, but still one of the best Xbox shooters. Overall rating: 9.4.. Playing Halo Infinite and how horrible it has gotten made me respect the OGs.. probably one of the best games I've ever played everything about this game is literally perfect.. Halo returns in this bigger, bolder adventure set during the Covenant invasion of Earth, More weapons including a new dual wield system, more vehicles, spectacular set pieces and an enhanced multiplayer makes for the best game on the Xbox, bar none.. What is there to say? One of the best singleplayer and multiplayer FPS games ever. Took everything great about 1 and improved it. Too many memorable campaign moments to count. Cliffhanger ending is a bummer but the rest of the game is so good it doesn't matter. Iconic for so many reasons.. I don’t have many memories from this game. But i remember when I was addicted to play it with my siblings. Kinda miss them. The game that made Xbox Live into what it is today with the online. A worthy sequel to an amazing game with a better story, GREAT multiplayer as online multiplayer had just started two years ago at the time, and overall, an even better sequel to an amazing game.. Brilliant. The first level is one of the best set pieces i've played in all games. Great game to play with a friend.. This game has amazing story, amazing combat and great level design. Very smart giving us two perspectives of the Masterchief and the Arbiter. The multiplayer was also amazing for its time as well. The only flaw I see with this game is the fact the legendary mode is a bit broken as the enemies have way too much health and can one hit you- Second weakest entity in the game.. The most overrated game of all time. This game does nothing new to add to what the first game apart from the Arbiter who was a fun character to play as. Apart from that The game is very boring and the physics are horrible I found myself falling of the map a lot more than I normally do. The music is the exact same as in Halo CE and becomes extremely repetitive.. Halo 2 is a really great sequel. Halo: Combat Evolved set a high bar when it released in 2001, 3 years later it exceeded the bar. A lot of positive changed were made in Halo 2: Shields recharge quicker, enemies (at least on normal difficulty) are easier and more fairer to fight, especially the flood. Lot of new fun weapons such as the Covenant Carbine or the Brute Shot. Speaking of Brutes, as tough as the flood were in the previous game, the brutes take the cake in this game but they're nowhere near as bad and annoying as the flood were in Combat Evolved. Mission design and the story blows Combat Evolved out of the water. Halo 2 allows the player to play from the perspective of Master Chief, a spartan, and now as The Arbiter, part of the Covenant. This feature alone is what makes Halo 2 one of my favourite games in the franchise, I loved playing as The Arbiter and following the story of the elites. Overall, the single-player experience was really really good and I recommend playing this game if you have played Combat Evolved. Halo 2 also introduced the first matchmaking online servers through Xbox Live, something Combat Evolved didn't implement in time. Co-op split-screen is still available and it's a nice feature being able to choose between playing as a Spartan or an Elite in multiplayer. Unfortunately, Xbox Live servers were shut down by the time I got around to playing this game :(. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. Another awesome title I had this day one and I liked it halo is a great franchise dispite all the bad negativity with the franchise through it all there still rumbling in 2023. How can a disgraceful game be a masterpiece by a company with almost no gaming experience. The answer to Halo 2 is let's get into the review. Actually there are no incredible things to say, there is a game that came out as a result of fixing everything that was bad in the previous game. What was this bad thing? reasons ? Mechanics, section designs and repetitive gameplay. First of all, let's start with the mechanics and gameplay. The game is still limited to using a maximum of two weapons, and this is the basis of the game, especially the company prefers this design, but this time, too many weapons have been added to the game and they are all different and effective. This is where the section designs come into play. Unlike the previous game, we see a large and detailed map, not a closed box anymore. This map affects the gameplay incredibly with different sections and detailed designs until the end of the game. The weapons and vehicles you use are in harmony with the section designs, and everything in the game including the music. Unlike the previous game, Halo 2 is really a competitor to the FPS games we call masterpieces. Undreal gold, Quake 2, even almost half life 2 game is not as good as Half life 2 in certain aspects. Actually, what I want to talk about is not important. there is one more issue Multiplayer.O Since yun did everything very well, it is very effective in Multiplayer gameplay, even at a level that can continue to be played even for many years. Unreal tournament 2004 looks like a great competitor. As for the result, we have a game that can be one of the best games ever, if a little more effort is made. As for the grade 94/100. even tho I like the first halo more but this game is nothing short then a masterpiece great campaign and even greater multiplayer. A good game that was obviously rushed and put out before it was ready, this is evident by how unbalanced the combat is with enemies, the abrupt ending, and shorter cut up levels compared to Halo: CE. That being said it has great music, amazing characters, good story, and solid level design. My only other gripe with this game is the weapons don't feel as hefty when you shoot them like Halo: CE and they got rid of the assault rifle, but dual wielding is nice, overall felt it was a step down from Halo: CE.. Halo two is maybe the best FPS of all time. It is a masterpiece without rival. The story is amazing especially with the Arbiter. The gameplay flawless. The world and worldbuilding/lore is expansive and engulfing. The religious commentary on blind faith is striking. The multiplayer endlessly addictive and so fun with friends. This is the Empire Strikes Back of FPS games.. This game was a wild rild so many funny xd lol moment's but also so many badass moments and the graphics on the remaster are mega drippy and the gameplay is halo the energy sword is so fun. I kinda like this game. This game, like the original, is responsible for shaping most of my childhood. This game iterates on the Halo formula to create a truly special experiences entirely distinct from the first, introduction of elements like the brutes, the arbiter and dual-wielding became fan favorite inclusions for many games to come. A worthy successor the original that in some way surpassed it, but viewing the Bungie trilogy as a package, this is the game that hammered home the point that Halo was here to stay.. Halo 2 - in my opinion turned out to be very similar. Well, that is the problem of the first part. But, it seems that the Bunges did not find the path that they need in Halo 2. Not to say that it’s completely **** Exactly what is the same. Even when playing as the Arbiter. 5 out of 10.. Story was great. I loved how they gave us more info on the the Covenant and how I got to play as the Arbiter. The level design was good. With snow areas, grassy areas, and levels that are on space ships, there is a great variety.. Played it with the MCC. Took everything Halo 1 did and put it to the next level. Aged well, is still fun. Play this with your best friends. The remastered is astonishing. Cool fun.. I have tried to love this game over the years so much. Throughout the past 10 years I have probably played through the whole series about 5 times and Halo 2 has always stood out to me as the weakest (other than 5). First of all the guns do not feel powerful at all and it doesn't have the same feeling heavy hitters as the first game like the godly pistol and shotgun. Furthermore, the level design just isn't for me there are so many long corridors just full of enemies that will completely shred you if you don't play perfectly on heroic of legendary not to mention the jackal snipers. The landscapes are just so much more boring with no open levels that allow you to explore like in Combat Evolved or Halo 3 which severely hurt its enjoyment. Most of the game is you just standing in grey corridors as you shred through super aggressive flood that two shot you in endless waves. There is only one redeeming quality and that is the brilliant story which is probably one of my favourite in the series, seeing the war from the Covenants perspective was very exciting and seeing how there culture thrives on lies and the reasons for their actions completely changed the world of Halo and gave us brilliant World Building. In conclusion this is definitely just one that isn't for me because everyone else seems to like it, but I just do not understand why.. Halo 2 is the perfect sequel to Halo Combat Evolved, nearly every aspect of the game has been improved, easily the best shooter of 2004.. Amazing campaign. Arbiter is the best character in the series. This was so ahead of its time in 2004. My favorite in the Halo series especially multiplayer. Dual needlers dominated! Still play this with the nephew on The Master Chief Collection.. Greatest Shooter ever made. I wont waste my time saying much else. Except that I have to for the word count.. A master-class in multiplayer game design that puts all modern Halo games to shame. Featuring the best dual wielding weapons in any video game, ever. Combat feels fun, rewarding and balanced. With a killer soundtrack. Easily one of the best shooters in history.. This is my favourite game of all time :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))). Halo 2 took Halo to another level and introduced what online multiplayer was capable of. Halo 2 was revolutionary and to give it anything less than a 10 would be uncivilized!. Halo 2 is a great advance on Combat Evolved, it expands the universe of the saga with new species, enemies and allies, it introduces the story of the Inquisitor very well and has much more lore than its predecessor. Sadly the ending feels incomplete and it's just making way for an even bigger story in Halo 3.. The absolutely best halo game hands down. I love the parallel story line and the music should be illegal it’s so good. This is how you tell a story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Arguably the best Halo in my opinion. It offers a lot of fun. It has an insane multiplayer depth and still holds up to this day. Halo 2 is a fantastic sequel that takes everything from CE that worked and improves on it and then adds so much more. Gunplay is a lot smoother and still feels great today. Vehicles feel much better to handle AI across the board have been improved and the soundtrack is just iconic. Visually the game looks a lot better like its really impressive for a OG Xbox game to look like this and the anniversary graphics also look a lo better then its CE counterpart. Along with all these improvements to the core gameplay and presentation the story has been made so much grander in scale with the audience getting to see how the covenant operate and really humanize the enemy a bit. Being able to play as the covenant was also a genius move. Considering that the actual development for the finale version of Halo 2 was about 10 months the fact that this game is as good as it is and for its time has such a grand story to it is really impressive. But considering that development time it would explain why at times the game can be a little glitchy at times. Its almost never anything game breaking and again given that time to make the game the fact the game runs so well is astonishing. If I had to find complaints for the game it would be that the inclusion of boss battles were very underwhelming and unnecessary because there just not really fun to play. Flood levels are still the weakest levels granted their still not nearly as bad as the Library in Halo 1. And the difficulty is a lot more unfair in this game and if you've ever played the legendary you know what I'm talking about as Halo 2 has one of the most difficult legendary modes in the entire series. Honestly that's probably the biggest thing for me keeping it from a 10 for me if these issue had time to of been addressed then maybe although the ending is notorious for being a big cliff hanger although that's not as big a deal now seeing as you can readily play Halo 3 today. One last note the multi[layer is also still a ton of fun today to play. Overall the game is amazing and its defiantly one of my favorite games of all time and I look forward to playing through it again and again with people I know to make them experience it to.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best chief in all halo games. My favorite Halo game of all time, the gameplay still feels very good and the story is incredible. Oh and also the soundtrack rocks.. Halo CE was awesome and It set the settings for halo 2 to make its way to another level , halo 2 was more about story telling! it has the best story in halo franchise and will forever be in my mind as one of the greatest FPS games of all time.. This game is part if my childhood and everybody who has an xbox should play it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After Halo CE set the foundation of the Halo franchise, Halo 2 comfortably and solidly managed to expand and improve the series with its second attempt. Halo 2's more earth focused missions and twists around its plot make this game one of the best in the series. An amazing title that managed to improve in almost every category its predecessor and redefine the fps genre on its own.. Halo is quite simply the closest thing we have ever experienced to a living, breathing alternate universe.. Nonsense story, weakest of the mainline Halo games. Multiplayer isn't my bag so can't comment on that. The best halo for me. Great story,levels,weapon,and cortana. I'm was sad when i watched a story in halo 5, and i hope 434 will change it to better side in halo infinite. 10/10 halo 2. The best Halo in the series. Amazing for it’s time, and still worth playing. 2004 was peak of fps.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This review is tailored to people who are thinking about playing Halo 2 for the first time and as such will be subjected to today's standards. Halo 2 is for many the defacto Halo experience and I would have to agree. All the complaints I seemed to have with Halo: CE have been fixed in its sequel, which is even more surprising when you take into consideration that Bungie had to crunch a lot to get the game done in time. Everyone knows the massive failure that was Halo 2's E3 demo, yet they prevailed. The combat stays intact, giving the player more weapons and the ability to dual handle guns, that while niche, contributes a lot to the power fantasy that Halo 2 desperately needs. The graphics, by today's standards, aren't the best, but there is a notable improvement from its prequel, undoubtedly pushing the hardware of the OG Xbox. The art style is still a classic and it feels distinct to Halo. The soundtrack is very well executed and there are some pieces that I'll never forget. The same can be said for the narrative. Halo 2 makes up in spades for the lack of narrative in Halo: CE. The story has various twists and from the moment the first cutscene starts, I was immediately hooked and taken aback because I wasn't expecting such a major shift in the way the game told its story. The game, in my eyes, delivered the best campaign out of every single entry in the franchise, that to this day, is still undefeated. Were it not for its controversial ending, the story would have been perfect. The mission design is a step up from Halo: CE (since you don't traverse around the same looking rooms for a whole level, now), however there are some sections that ask you to defend a single part of the map for a set amount of time, that sometimes drag longer than you'd like them to. To this day there are some glitches associated with multiplayer, that for some offered a new layer of skill gap, while to others, made the online experience less entertaining. To me, they aren't very important. Overall, Halo 2 is, without a doubt, the essence of what Halo is. In my eyes, it was the best one out of the original trilogy, which is funny, since it definitely was the worst one for Bungie, the developers, due to massive amounts of setbacks they faced.. my favourite halo, really good gameplay and campaign is the definition of perfection! made my childhood :). Halo 2 struggles to recapture what made its predecessor great in terms of level and weapon design, but advances the Halo universe in creative and fun ways narratively.. dear humanity ,we regret being alien **** we regret comin to earth, and we most definitely regret the corpse just blew our raggedy ass feet. I absolutely love Halo 2! Took everything from the first game and made it better. This is done by expanding multiplayer and making it feel faster, run smoother. Must own if you have an Xbox, be silly not to. Yeah, what can I say? I wasn't a huge fan of Halo: CE and this is pretty much more of the same, but improved in some ways (not as many endless gray hallways). I played the whole campaign in couch co-op with a friend, just like with the first Halo and we groaned our way through it again. The story was incoherent and boring, unfortunately I think I just don't have any interest in the Halo universe. Even more unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of the gameplay, which doesn't leave much for me with this game besides the amazing CGI and music.. We are witnessing a revolution in storytelling and gameplay. The game is very epic and exciting and you will definitely be immersed in the game world. This is by far one of my favorite games of all time and learning how the production of this game went I'm surprised that this held up with the introduction of dual-wielding and mounted guns as well as introducing so many new weapons and vehicles this game was put on the map with making over $125 million in 24 hours of launch and so much talk about it on the news i was so hyped. The only reason it is not a 10 is because on higher difficulties the game feels very unfair. Very hard to pass certain sections without cheesing it out. Great story, great gameplay and IMO the best soundtrack in the series, even Halo 3's. Multiplayer was the best when it released and on the MCC is still great and the reason to purchase it.. There is one small feature that was added to Halo 2 that was awesome and that was, for the first time you could have duel weapons.. I tried finding the page for Halo 2 anniversary edition on the Xbox One, but couldn't find it. Therefore i'm posting my review here. After years of resisting the urge to buy a Xbox to play games like Fable, Halo and others i finally caved, and bought a Xbox Series S. Great console. And naturally i got a gamepass to play games, including Halo Master Chief Collection. Unfortunately the experience has been quite disappointing. Halo: Combat Evolved was alright, though it feels dated by now. Sadly Halo 2 is faaaar worse off. This game **** **** now. The story is a collection of horde mode stand off's. I've been shooting up hordes of enemies with less than stellar gameplay until some door opens, with little context as to what i'm supposed to do. Master Chief lands on a Halo ring, and boom! Another horde mode stand-off! What happened with this game in comparison to Combat Evolved? The levels in Halo 2 feel lazy. I tried to persuade myself in playing it longer, but i was getting so frustrated with these lazy moments where you are just waiting for a door to open, the world's longest tunnel with barely anything in it, and messy gameplay. I remember playing this game in 2007 at a friends house, and i was obsessed with it. So taking that memory in consideration, i think the game has aged too much and many games since then have improved beyond Halo 2 in 2004. Unfortunately that's no excuse in an anniversary edition, I give it a 4/10. I hate it.. Some of the best storytelling and world building the series has offered. I will say that the level design is my least favorite in the trilogy for feeling more linear. Such an amazing game.. A fantastic sequel that improved many things from the first game. It's not my favorite Halo game, but it's up there and still very fun to play to this day.. While Halo 2 did improve some of the stuff from Combat Evolved and avoided the same gameplay mistakes like unbalanced weapons or repetitive level design; Halo 2 has its own kind of flaws. The multiplayer shines the most, it's slick, fun and various. The maps are memorable and so fun to play, the gameplay is a lot more balanced than the first game. Gameplay modes are great too and my favorite one is Zombies. Halo 2 had a somewhat disjointed campaign that felt rushed in every scene and moment but it did the job really well, but for me Halo 2's single greatest aspect is its fantastic multiplayer.. Halo 2 was a thrill ride from start to finish. I couldn't stop playing this thing. I was hooked so to the plot that i couldn't stop playing; it was like a thrilling novel told with vivid colors, beautiful scenery and fluid gameplay. Now halo 2's story is not perfect but how bungie handles different characters and plot lines is so fascinating. In 11 hours",this is my 7th best game ever made. it's the start of Xbox live and truly took Halo 1 and dialed it up . the actual gameplay experience leaves much to be desired . lackluster weapon balance and gamemodes that easily wear themselves out make it hard to keep playing .
411.Tekken 2,"Great game such an improvement to theist tekken I love the amount unlockable characters. Felt this one really kicked off the franchise in my opinion. Tekken 2 is a fighting game, the second entry in the Tekken series. It was originally released for arcades in 1995, and ported to the PlayStation a year later.. Most underrated Tekken game with Easy to learn hard to master gameplay this game is a banger. Sequel to what was at the time easily the best fighting game around, and it surpassed it in every department. The number of fighters seems like slim pickings and the graphics are rather blocky by today's standards, but the Tekken games are unbeatable in the fighting stakes on the PS1.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not Exellent on game play but for the time are king of fighting. Tekken 2, while better than the original, isn’t nearly as good as Tekken 3 was, but this game still deserves credit.. It's astonishing that this game is 25 years old. Having played the first game before that, I can easily say that Tekken 2 improves on everything that made the first game great. The game's fighting system is very complex and enjoyable and the story/arcade mode isn't as difficult to finish as it was in the first game. It also provides you with many new features, such as the Time Attack mode and Survival mode, which gives the player more challenge other than the main arcade mode. The soundtrack is fantastic, while new themes for the characters and the stage design and graphics, while dated today, look fantastic at the time. Tekken 2 is great fighting game for its time and it still holds up pretty well after all these years.. OVERALL - 84% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 9/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 10/10 A great building ground for the games to come.. Nice tekken game with lots of characters, i remember the third one was better. OGRE 4 THE WIN.. Game: Tekken 2 Genre: Fighting Developer: Namco Publisher: Namco System: Playstation (PS1) Year of Release: 1996 Length of Playthrough: 4 Hours Total Score: 84/100 Value Score: 8.4/10 • Story: 7/10 • Characters: 9/10 • GamePlay: 8/10 • Graphics: 7/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 8/10 • Length: 8/10 • Replay Value: 9/10 • Player Value: 9/10 Pros +25 Playable characters +Endings for Characters +Survival Mode, Time Mode and Team Battle Modes Cons -Gameplay can be tedious even at the easiest of settings -A lot of clone characters and reskins. Fun Tekken game from the early days. I remember playing this on a PSX with friends back in the day and loving it. The game had your standard fare of modes a fighting game should have, along with the combat engine that is fun to learn and create your own custom combos with. Overall Tekken 2 is a fun experience with more characters than to original, and is a great place to get your feet wet with fighting games.. One of the greatest fighting game sequels in video game history. It surpasses the original and would continue to evolve into a fantastic series. I love this game. The graphics back in 1996 looked slightly better than the original but 20 years on they obviously look awful. The music is good but I like the console port music from the 1st Tekken much more. The arcade version music is way better than the home port. The sound effects for punches, kicks, throws, damage and death cries sound so badass. The gameplay had a MASSIVE overhaul and brought in new fighting mechanics to keep the game more interesting. The sub-bosses from the original return and are improved in every area in terms of depth, style and moveset. It brought us many new fighters to the series: Jun Kazama, Bruce Irvin, Lei Wulong, Alex/Roger, Angel/Devil, Baek Doo San and Jack 2. The new mechanics were -command list -10 hit combos for every fighter -hidden throws and throw chain combos for many fighters - reversals and throw reversals - back throws - unblockable attacks and dash/ hidden special attacks -sidestep for Kazuya and Heihachi Of course the various modes that would become the staple of the series and the fighting game genre such as Time Attack Mode, Survival Mode, Team Battle Mode and Practice Mode. The only flaw with the game is the stiff controls and the stupid space-jump mechanic from Virtua Fighter. Thank God they fixed this in Tekken 3. Overall i give this game a 9 out of 10. A must buy for fighting game fans.. A Huge step up over the original game but still not quite as good as the third game in the series. Still a solid game and well worth a look in for anyone that has an original Playstation.. Tekken 2 is the second installment in the Tekken fighting game series, developed and published by Namco. + Excellent 3D Fighting Game + Good Characters Designs + Ending Cutcenes. Tekken 2 is amazing ps1 game, it was released in 1996 along with crash badicoot 1 and blood omen legacy of kain. if you are a tekken fan, get tekken 2, it's good.. One of the best Tekken classic in the history,fun arcade mode,very easy characters to control and master,great **** no Tekken 3 not even close but the reason why i gave it a 9 cause its the first Tekken game i played and the reason why im a fan of the franchise,probably you won't find any fighting game better than Tekken,its definately the king of fighting games and had stay that way for a really really long time,although soul calibur and dead or alive might have come close.A very great game,simple but fun to play,its a must to your collection plus Jun Kazama is my favourite,shes brutal!!. Anybody who is a fan of fighting games needs to pick this up. This is one of the best Tekken games and really should not be overlooked for 3D fighting games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tekken 2 isn't perfect, although it sure comes close. As it stands, it's one of the best fighters available for the PlayStation. If you like fighting games at all, you will love Tekken 2. The graphics and fluent character movement will amaze. Tekken 2 is a good game and a improvement to tekken 1. It had great characters, great graphic and the gameplay was also very good. Of course now its outdated but back then it was a good fighting game.. This game is amazing for it's time, even though some of the music is rehashed it's so good that i don't care. The fighting is so complex, but not impossible to learn (i played it the first time as a five year old). A lot happended since the first one, a lot of new modes like team play, survival, time attack and practice with combolists. Many new characters and character endings, updated and new fighting mechanics like the counter system (though only Jun has this feature).. It's not a game you'd want to be playing now there's superior versions in the form of Tekken 5 (gameplay and graphics) and Tekken Tag 2 (which is coming out very soon and featuring tons of old characters) but Tekken 2 manages to remain a fun fighting game with the great stories, the colourful stages, the incredibly catchy music and the overall feel of it. It's definitely not perfect (when you press a button expect to wait a second before your character actually responds and the AI ranges from too easy to impossible) but it's the best in the series and worth playing for sure.","Tekken 2 is a fighting game, the second entry in the tekken series . it was originally released for arcades in 1995, and ported to the PlayStation a year later .

412.Phantasy Star Online,"Phantasy Star Online for the Dreamcast is a great game with stunning visuals, great gameplay and inmersive story. The customisation of the characters is also very good. Great way to show what online gaming was to the world.. One of the best RPGs and what makes it even better is the cooperative experience either locally or online. This game is a milestone in gaming history as it's the first legitimate online game for consoles. There are still private servers hosted today so it can still be played online. This game is an absolute classic in every way, it's one of the best RPGs of it's time, one of the best online games of it's time, graphics are great and there's a ton of gameplay! It never gets old! A++. One of the best combat games and one of the best Dreamcast games. This game has great gameplay and great combat mechanics. Great music, great graphics, what more could you ask for?. The dreamcast in collaboration with this game were so far ahead of their times it's incredible to think just how iconic **** this game really is. First online console and such a huge diverse MMO this was. They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Absolute classic.. This game is truly mind blowing. I mean this game came out in 2001, graphics are good, first online console MMO, story amazing, atmosphere. I remember playing with my friend it was an adventure. It's repayable. The only bad thing is probably its sound quality. Maybe thats just for me.. This game is incredible. I remember when I first booted it up on my Dreamcast, with my special all-new broadband adapter, and then getting onto the server. I was amazed by it all. Incredible graphics, sound gameplay, and holy crap, the weapons were so cool!",the game is a milestone in gaming history as it's the first legitimate online game for consoles . there are still private servers hosted today so it can still be played online . it's one of the best combat games and one of the best dreamcast games .
414.Jade Empire,"It's a game for the time was released, are very rich in items and build stats and skill very cool to explore and difficult very suitable for any players. Jade Empire offers a compelling narrative and a richly crafted world that stands the test of time. Though its gameplay mechanics may feel slightly aged, the immersive experience and cultural depth more than compensate, making it a worthwhile journey.. It just doesnt work. The plot is absurd and boring, the combat gets annoying very soon, there is no freedom at all.... This game is peak Bioware! One of the best RPGs ever made and much better than any overrated game that Bethesda makes.. I love that this game allows me to live out the fantasy of terribly embarrassing a colonizing musketeer.. This game still holds up even today. This was back when Bioware was one of the best videogame developers. I still have a hard time finding many companies as good as Bioware when they were in their prime. The story is amazing, the soundtrack is well done, and the world is one I always go back to even 16 years later. One of Bioware's best and one of the best rpgs ever made. I highly recommend Jade Empire.. THE BEST GAME EVER! I love it! The story is fascinating, the graphics are awesome for the time, you have to think well your responses before chosing them because they will affect one way or another, you must play it, NOW. Jade Empire is an inventive and immersive masterpiece. It isn't perfect but it is a truly unique RPG and probably the most underrated Bioware game. The story is deep and complex, with great characters and twists that are both shocking and thought provoking. The combat is fast paced while still offering variety and strategy. It really is a shame that it never got a sequel because its biggest weaknesses seem to be technical ones. It is good in almost every area and it is my favorite game for the Xbox console. It stands as one of the best western RPGs and is a great example of how to make an RPG that breaks convention. The gameplay in Jade Empire is still unlike any other RPG. Rather than simply learning new spells your character learns new magical martial arts styles and each style has a combination of abilities. This ties perfectly into the story because you usually need to meet and train with new people to learn new fighting styles. Some of the styles can only be gained if you have a certain moral alignment and so you can't earn ever style in one play through. I found this process far more rewarding and interesting than the level up systems of most other RPGs. It would have been nice to have more techniques for each style but there are over 20 styles to learn so there is no shortage of cool abilities. Outside of combat the gameplay is a little bit restrictive, it would have been nice to be able to interact more with the environment but that's a problem with nearly all RPGs from that time period. Where the game shines the most is the dialog choices and character interactions. These choices are both complex and rewarding. What you choose to say matters and the results range from hilarity to tragedy. There were so many great scenes that I was constantly excited to see what new character encounters would result in. Romances are an option and this game has some of the most interesting ones I have ever seen in a game. Your choices don't just impact how they respond to you, your conversations can even change the way your companions view the world. The story is one of the best of its time. Your moral choices matter. While you are fighting against villainous people, their motivations are complex and so are yours. You ultimately decide by each decision what type of person you are going to be and that leads to many different changes in the story. There are three endings that are all dramatically different. You can do things that are even more horrible and villainous than the people you are fighting against. I played through Jade Empire at least 5 times and each play through was different, and each one was satisfying in a different way. Probably my biggest complaint with the game is that the world is too small and restrictive. While most areas look great a lot of them are limited to pathways or confined spaces. You also don't have the opportunity to go back to some areas so that makes the world feel small by the end. While I thought location were all interesting I did find it disappointing not having more to explore. What is there is good but compared to a lot of other RPGs the game world felt quite small. The visuals design mostly very good. The environments thoughtfully crafted and they offer a great blend between recognizable Chinese designs and more fantasy based ideas. Monster designs are also creative and cool looking. Some scenes were truly breathtaking and the lighting was good for its time. Some areas looked a bit bland and the character models are fairly average when compared to games of that time. Animations are a bit stiff looking. It's a good looking game but not not quite as good looking as something like FFX which came out years earlier and definitely not on the level of Ninja Gaiden which came out the year before. Sound design is excellent. The voice acting is almost all great and there is a ton of dialog in the game. Even by modern standards it holds up pretty well. The sound effects are also quite good with each fighting style having unique sounds. The music is good and fit well with each area. The only weakness I would say is that there aren't a lot of songs that stand out as iconic. In terms of length and the amount of content, I felt that the game could have been longer. The main story took me a little more than 30 hours without rushing. That isn't bad but for an RPG that is below average. On the plus side though there is almost no padding, everything feels necessary and I never found myself bored with level grinding. There are also many decisions that can change the way the story unfolds and that gives the game a lot of replay value. Its a pretty good length for a focused action RPG but a fair bit shorter than a game like Dragon Age. Overall I think this is one of the best games of its time. I give Jade Empire 89% Gameplay - 8 Story - 10 World - 8 Uniqueness/Ideas - 10 Visuals - 8 Sound - 9 Length - 8 Immersion - 9 X-Factor - 9. Without this game there would be no Dragon Age and no Mass Effect, even though it was in the shadow of Kotor, it truly stands out and sets the formula for the rest of Bioware's games in stone. It's a dang good formula as well, when it comes to story-heavy Rpgs, Bioware was and is king. The game has aged quite well after ten years, and is certainly still an enjoyable experience in 2015.. Gameplay: The gameplay for this game is just a third person action game with a decent amount of variation overall. I liked how whoever you choose to accompany you also works well with the type of gameplay choices you are interested in. There are a butt load of different monsters to fight and you have to work in simple. but fun tactics to dispurse them. Story: This game has the second best story of any game I've ever played. Everything was original, inspiring from great works of Kurosawa and even traditional Asian lore. I don't want to ruin anything, but you basically have to find your master and figure out why everything is going on in this world. You will go to heaven and hell to find this out and with a crew that is amazing. Characters: The voice acting in this game is unparalleled to any other game. I don't just mean how everything comes across, I mean how well the dialog sounds and the choices you have to choose from sound. I've played games where you have a choice between good, kinda middle/bad and bad for your choice of things to say, this game isn't that. You invest in who you spend your time with and build a relationship with a lot. Side quests/length/extra: There are plenty of side quests and they aren't like GTA side quests either. Every single one is entirely different and original, and one even includes a cameo role from John Cleese which is hilarious and delightful. This game took me 40 hours to complete when i was like 11, but only took about 15 when I revisited it last year. Alas, 15 hours doesn't sound long for a game like this but the replayability of getting to know separate characters or being evil instead of good is just fine with me. Also, there are certain scenes that are just so amazingly awesome I'd watch them a hundred times. Music: Best music of any game ever. Other than journey, anything from naughty dog, deus ex:human revolution and a few other games, this is the best soundtrack I've heard by far. I honestly listen to some of the tracks occasionally for fun! If I had to rate it 9/10 because the length isn't that long and the gameplay isn't that impressive, but this game still holds up almost ten years later and that's definitely something to say!. One of the greatest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I can practically find no flaws with this title, as there are very few, if any. The combat is deep but easy to pick up, the graphics are gorgeous for it's time, the controls are incredibly fluid, the music is phenomenally beautiful, and the characters and plot are extremely well-written, making for an unforgettable experience that's very easy to become fully immersed in. I would recommend this to practically anyone, as there is almost nothing wrong with it. This is the quintessential Bioware title for me. Play it if you haven't already.. I loaded this into the XBOX expecting absolutely nothing from it but, after 30 minutes I was hooked, I've played many gems (SoA, FF4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, Chrono Trigger, Tales of Symphonia etc. to put it in perspective) but this is so far the most AMAZING. This severely underrated RPG (yeah, I said underrated) has many quests that will give you satisfaction or make you feel dirty. When it's lighthearted it's lighthearted, but when you go dark the game one ups you. The story is simple yet powerful, you chose the next adventure based on your desicions, the game play is also pretty basic but entertaining and the re-playability for this RPG is superb (played again after I just beat it). This one is a heavyweight.. A spiritual follow up to the acclaimed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Bioware have yet again created an epic RPG in their own unique style. Without the Star Wars name to fall back on the developers have taken the best elements from their Xbox classic and built upon them to produce a title that, in gameplay terms at least, is arguably even better. Following an option to take on one of six characters the player is thrown into the world of Jade Empire. Unlike The Old Republic Titles the game this time around is a true action RPG. An excellent control system helps make these battles enjoyable and players are gradually introduced to new elements eventually revealing a deep set of options. Combat includes hand-to-hand fighting as well as the use of weapons and magic and combining them based on the type of enemy you are facing is the key to success. This time around Bioware have built their mythology from scratch and the Asian kingdom in which the game takes place is steeped in a history waiting to be discovered by the player with a storyline that, while not perfect, is certainly interesting enough. As the player advances new characters with their own back-stories will join your party. Only one can be taken into battle alongside you but each brings their own strengths and weaknesses adding further depth to proceedings. Despite the immense customisation options the game does its best to remain accessible by removing tedious item and stat management. When enough experience is gained the player has the simple choice of upgrading their body, mind or spirit. Levelling up obviously helps during combat but interestingly also provide extra options during conversations. The good/evil system associated with Bioware RPGs is also implemented differently with players instead aligning themselves with different philosophical beliefs. The Path of the Closed Fist dictates that only the strong will survive while The Path of the Open Palm teaches that helping others will eventually lead to rewards. This new two sided morality scale avoids the usual good vs. evil method allowing players to play the game by their own belief. For anyone that is a fan of Bioware's work, that includes the three Mass Effect titles, Jade Empire is a must buy RPG that offers well in excess of twenty hours of fantastic gaming.. A beautiful game with endless detail and style, a great story and great visuals. Best Xbox game ever even though it's almost ten years old as I write this review.. Just how could anyone not love this inspired and beautiful masterpiece? It's story and the dialogues are well written (like KOTOR) but its game play is much more free and, thus, thrilling. The on rails shooter part is a nice treat for fans of the genre but they can be skipped in case you are not. Overall a great game.. one of the most underrated games ever. a brilliant story with tons of different choices, fantastic graphics for its time, hard hitting gameplay, tons of different styles, upgrades and ways to fight, great characters, hours of gameplay, and a new and original different world. jade empire is a very unappreciated game and more people should play it.. I laugh at those who rate this game with a 10. Do not get me wrong, Jade Empire is a good game, but that is all it will ever be. 'good' not great, wonderful, amazing. just 'good'. Lack of any real story or character depth has lead to the low rating of '4'.. I enjoyed this game a lot. I found the story to be engrossing, and the depth to the lore design and graphics were fantastic. The story tends to be linear, but it's such a fun ride I really didn't care by the end. There were also some wonderfully unexpected twists to the story, and by the end of the game I was on the edge of my seat to see how it was going to end.. This game is FANTASTIC!!! one of the best games I've ever played, this had fantastic graphics for the time, and the sound is still top notch, the story is fantastic and you really think before making a decision because your choices alter the world around you, and the side quests are AMAZING!!! they are all unique and are just so much fun to play through, and it has some cool things to find out like new fighting techniques, but keep in mind while playing this is really easy (think Fable II & III easy) so you may want to crank up the difficulty, out of all the Bioware RPGs I've played this is so far there best, a must own and it truly earns a perfect 10.. Amazing story. A fantastic trip from beginning to end. The brilliant dialogue and talented voice-acting make for an unforgettable role-playing experience. Even the real-time combat style and the diversity of character abilities are a lot of fun (the kinds of things that often tend to be weaknesses in RPG's). With Jade Empire, Bioware struck gold.","the story is deep and complex, with great characters and twists that are both shocking and thought provoking . the combat is fast paced while still offering variety and strategy . the game is good in almost every area and it stands as one of the best western RPGs ."
415.Xenoblade Chronicles 3,"If you are a fan of the Xenoblade series, you will probably like this one the most. It has everything a Xenoblade fan could ask for; a consistent good story, interesting characters with good development probably the best villain the series has ever seen (N), a phenomenal fighting system which is even fun after 100+ hours and of course the fantastic Xenoblade worldbuilding.. I dunno what to say so imma just say that everything in the game is atleast amazing. Music espeacially is 11/10. As someone not particularly accustomed to JRPGs, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* was an unexpectedly engaging experience. I’ve always hated the typical “your turn, then my turn” mechanics found in many JRPGs, but *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* managed to surprise me in ways I didn’t expect. Oh, and in case it’s not obvious, this was my first encounter with the *Xenoblade* **** you’re wondering whether you need to play the previous games to understand this one, the answer is a resounding no. The most captivating part of the game for me was, without a doubt, the story. Sure, I know it can feel unnecessarily dragged out at times, to the point of disrupting the narrative flow, but the overall world and the tale it told kept me hooked and actively engaged **** gameplay revolves around a real-time combat system where positioning party members and setting up the most logical skill compositions is key. As someone who hadn’t played previous *Xenoblade* games, I found this system incredibly fun—at least for the first 40 **** game consists of seven chapters, and I completed the first four on standard difficulty. However, I started growing tired of the combat system and worried that the lengthy battles might pull me away from the story. So, I reluctantly switched to easy mode—a decision that turned out to be the best one I made. This game is massive, detailed, and seemingly endless. Just when you think it’s about to wrap up, it throws another 10 hours in your **** for the graphics, they’re muddy even by the standards of the time it was released. However, I must emphasize an important point here: while the graphics are subpar, the art design is among the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. The developers have crafted a breathtakingly illustrated universe that captures the journey of six friends traversing an endless world. I lost count of how many times I used the screenshot button on my Nintendo Switch—a button I previously thought I’d never use.This game is a testament to how art direction can surpass graphical fidelity and how a strong story can make up for rough edges in gameplay. That said, I must mention that the gameplay starts to feel repetitive after Chapter 4. While the story becomes incredibly deep at this point, the layered complexity in gameplay seen in the first three chapters doesn’t carry forward as much.Despite these flaws, I’m incredibly happy to have stepped into the *Xenoblade* universe. I now understand why this game is so beloved. Its art design, unique combat system, narrative depth, and the way it keeps itself fresh with various mechanics make it a true classic. This game will undoubtedly stand out among my Switch reviews as a title JRPG fans will adore.I’ll end my review with this:“Hear that, Noah? Lanz wants something a bit meatier!”. best rpg on the switch together with persona 5. voice acting is great, graphics are great, battle system is great fun. great end game content.. One of the best games i've ever played! Amazing story and character design.. Blurry scenery, messy combat, and a boring story. I've played the entire series, but I have no plans to purchase it in the future. thanks!. The grand finale of one of my favorite JRPG trilogies. If I'm being honest, I was slightly worried going into this game, however, I quickly managed to fall in love with it and I enjoyed every second. First things first, this game has the best gameplay in the series, by far. I absolutely adore the classes and the heroes, every character can be whatever the player wants them to be, so many things to experiment with, and the customization options are more than enough. What surprised me the most is the side content, it's just so damn good, especially compared to the previous games, the world is full of content, I genuinely couldn't stop exploring. Also, the hero quests are amazing, I managed to do all of them, and I unlocked all the classes in the game, and I still wanted more. As for the story, personally I really liked it, it's such a beautiful story, and pretty dark too, it has so many depressing moments and some of the highest highs in the series, and I even loved the characters, they're all so well written and interesting, easily the best part of the game in my opinion. The only issue I have with the story is the pacing, which isn't bad, it's mostly consistent, but after the first chapter, it gets slightly repetitive with the colonies and the flame clocks, and it takes a while for it to get better. I think it's pretty obvious to say that the soundtrack is stellar too, some songs actually made me tear up. Unfortunately though, the world design disappointed me a little bit, most areas look similar to each other, and I personally found the absence of the titans to be underwhelming, like yeah sure there are definitely some gorgeous areas to visit, but they are very few. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 isn't only the conclusion of a saga, but an exceptional videogame that can stand on its own, it's the ultimate Xenoblade experience, and my favorite game of the trilogy. Final Rating: ""Excellent"" ~ 9.5/10.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of my favourite games of all time. The soundtrack is incredible, and it looks about as good as physically possible for a switch game. The story (while the weakest in the series IMO) still managed to keep me hooked. I loved every main party member and felt that they had good chemistry with each other. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an amazing endpoint for an incredible series.. Finally, I played Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the culmination of the trilogy. Not gonna lie, I got into this game with low expectations because I wasn't a big fan of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and fortunately, I actually came out of this one feeling impressed; in fact, it might be my favorite Xenoblade Chronicles game yet. First of all, I'm surprised by how emotional and beautiful the story is and how interesting its themes were. It's not perfect though, the pacing is a bit slow at times, but the overall story is really good. The characters on the other hand, are my favorite in the entire series and probably my favorite part of the game. The gameplay is the best in the series by far, it removes all the tedious elements the previous game had, it has QoL improvements like much faster pace, 6 active party members, deeper customization, better revive and chain attack system, adds the class and the interlink systems, references both previous games in its own ways, and it even adds new minor elements as well. The exploration and the side-content is the best in the series by far as well, better quest design, better maps and navigation system, better NPCs, it's all just better. Also, the art style is beautiful even if the graphics quality and the performance aren't the best. Now, even though both the music and the world setting are amazing, they're slightly less memorable than in the previous games in my opinion, but only slightly. Pros: + Great story + Lovable and engaging characters + Very enjoyable gameplay + Many noticeable improvements and tweaks + Gorgeous art and world + Awesome soundtrack Cons: - Minor pacing issues Narrative: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Content: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Music: 9/10 Art Style: 8/10 Final Rating: 9.5/10 - Outstanding - Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes all the good parts of the previous games, improves upon them and addresses literally every flaw and gripe I had with its predecessor. It's arguably the best Xenoblade Chronicles game ever and it's definitely one of the best JRPGs in the past... 2 decades. Do I recommend it?: Must-play for fans of the series and JRPG fans in general.. Solid 9 for the gameplay and combat, 6 or below for the rest of the game. The main problem with the game, and most Xenoblade Chronicles games is that the story starts awfully slow and it's by far the most boring story from all the other XC games that I have played. I tried to play it about 5 times and evey time I would stop playing because the story was so bland and I did not feel at all for most of the characters. By the end of the game I started caring more about some of the caracters that were boring at first and the characters that seemed interesting had a very boring and stupid ending imo. What makes it even worse is the main villains of the story, they are so bland and uninteresting that I had more fun killing random monsters on the map. The personality of most of the characters seems to be based on someone close to them dieing and that's their whole personality. ""Someone one I cared about died and now I feel sorrow"". When I started playing XC3 i had just finished XC2 and that game was a rollercoaster from start to finish. What saves the game is the combat. The gem system is plain stupid. There are thousands of materialsthat you find everywhere and that are needed to craft stuff but there is no way to tell where to get them from. By the end og the game I had some gems at level 8 or above and some at level 2 because I crafted them with nopon coins, not because the materials dropped. It should have had some way of tracking where to find different materials. I wasted over a million coins at the fabricators and farming different bosses around the maps and the materials still did not drop. Where you do get materials to craft the gems is farming various bosses after you finished the game which is lame imo. Yous should not have to wait for 100+ hours to be able to fully enjoy the game. Future redeemed had indeed redeemed this game. Fun story from the first few minutes, fun characters that you feel for right from the start and makes me want to help them on their journey. They managed to create a fun combat system that does not get boring but the rest of the game seems to me not up to par with the rest of the games in the series. The ending did not make any sense at all to me. If you really want to make excuses for a mediocre story you can, but if you look at it for what it is, you will see that this is not even close to the rest of the stories in the series and the ending is disappointing, to say the least.. Completion Time: 110hr+. Story: This game tells the story of the Digital Life faction uploading information and being trapped in an infinite loop within the system. System: The game revolves around the four core attributes, and the battle system has been changed again. In the previous game, you drew cards until your fingers hurt; in this one, you train professions until your liver hurts. The Monolith system would really suit an MMORPG.. Such a good way to make the licence come back after the dumpster fire that was XC2. Beautiful music and world. Story was interesting too! It felt like a movie most of the time when we're on the cut scenes though.. This game was an incredible experience with the story and all the characters. Definitely my favorite of the trilogy(not including X I did not play that). I just loved , from beginning to end , great story and characters , Tho I have to say that after reaching the city you have to push through 3/4h of somewhat boring gameplay but man it picks up so well after that, I personally loved the ending and the final cutscene was gorgeous. This game might just be the best game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I still haven't played the first two, which I want to eventually play, as well. I still found it to be so beautiful and fun. Non-stop fun in fact and I never felt like the quests got repetitive. All the quests felt so unique and personal to the environment and characters you were helping in the quests. Buy it now!. An essential experience for fans of JRPGs and, basically, anyone with a heart.. It's the worst game from the series imo. I didn't particularly like the story, as it was inconsistent and not that interesting. The first game is still my favorite.. It is a masterpiece. I don’t know if it is the case with every JRPG, but for me it was an eye opening experience. Like it is an anime, but a game! The characters are so well done that you keep remembering them even long after the end. And the story… Other aspects are also made to perfection to some insane level. Battle system might look dull, but wait, here goes one mechanic and another and another till the very end! The world itself also feels alive and interesting to explore. The only bad thing that I could mention is the wrong platform, like the game of this scale should be on much more moverfull systems to unleash its full potential. And the economic system is broken, but I have not used it so let it be.. XC3 is my first experience into the Xenoblades franchise. Currently, I am only 10 hours into play and cannot praise this game enough. Its complexity gives the game a mature feeling with plenty and learn and do, while the beautiful, open world exploration blends wonderfully with the quality soundtrack music. Some have mentioned the music was too loud to hear the voices, but I have yet to adjust any of the sound parameters. Already, I am interested in buying the Expansion Pass! XC3 is one of the best games on my Switch Lite.. Bland and unengaging story, every single fight takes way longer than it should. I found nothing enjoyable about this game.. XC3 is quite possibly the best game of all time. It was perfect all around the board. The cutscenes made you feel the same emotion the characters were feeling in game, the characters were all dynamic and had incredible backstory’s, and development that really allow you to understand each character on a higher level. adding to the perfect blend of emotion character development is the visuals, breathtaking graphics also help you really feel what’s going on in the game. The graphics also help enhance the amazing and expansive world that monolithsoft has created, filled to the brim with cool areas to discover, and if your a veteran, areas from the previous games as well. Even just looking across the land from a high peak will put you in awe of the beautiful world. The combat is also amazing, with complex systems and mechanics that allow you to have your own style of combat, and hit clips on all the enemies. The boss fights are amazing, which most bosses having a backstory just as good as the protagonists, it allows for truly amazing fights. The gameplay in XC3 is also amazing, it is easily picked up by anyone and allows for an experience that anyone can enjoy. Xenoblade chronicles as a series has one of the best story’s any game has to offer, and XC3 completely wraps up the story from the other games, alongside having a mind blowing story of its own. Overall the story is flawless, and will leave anyone in awe after completion of the game. Should you finish the game, which would take a long time due to the sheer amount of content (40-60 hours of main story and plenty of side content to keep you busy as well), you can purchase a DLC that does nothing but improve upon what is in the base game. And the cherry on top is the amazing soundtrack paired with the game, the music fits perfectly with all the environments that it’s played it. All the music in the overworld perfectly pairs with your surroundings, and the other music does the exact same. Overall a flawless game, and would 10/10 recommend.. I just bought this today. Wow this game doesn't require any mind to play. It's so boring. I just wasted my money on this. I am pissed.. Easily my favorite game of all time. Extremely good story and character writing that had me absolutely enthralled at the emotional climax of the story. Paired amazing gameplay and world design that almost never disappointed. There was one small pacing problem near the end where it turns into a scavenger hunt across the world and the entire sequence is superfluous, but that's only 1 hour compared many tens hours of the game being a riveting experience. With plenty of side quests and content spread throughout the world there is easily several hundred hours worth of content to enjoy. I highly recommend giving the game a try.. The best ending of the saga that we dreamed of. I really love the series, but this part gave me a best memories.. Xenoblade 3 has alot more I was looking for from the series and is an great addition to the JRPG roster. I feel it has great world design again though mixing worlds of 1 and 2 makes it the least interesting ironically monolith is still masters at world but its not totally a new world. To me this has the best cast easily not just the great main 6 party but this game goes above and beyond in side quests/ characters in totally voiced world build amazing quests (orange class quests) that elevate RPG content in a way others should learn from. Mio is legitimately amazing. So many good characters. The game has a mostly great story throughout and and great amount of worldbuilding with the quest, colonies, map, and war. It hooks me from the start. On the mixed side i felt the battle system was a bit much, alot of mechanics and a good mix, yet 6 characters ends up being alot. its hard to tell your player impact, with enemies ending up being underwhelming. ESPECIALLY the VILLIANS WHY they are just not interesting besides N and M. issues with combat like The AI of allies, mmo style, so many mechanics like fusion, with less indications of aoes/ changing battle to enemy more setup less execution than 2 or even 1 those bother me. While classes are fun you use them for a bit and clearly find someway better than others and earning them is weird. Problem being WOW your always over leveled in general in normal while engaging with content like the game wants you to! and once you get ashera/ signifier combat for late game becomes: break to launch press chain attack: do optimal chain: win. the enemies do nothing and bosses can be unmemorable. Finally i felt up to chapter 5 it was amazing but lost moment after that twist to the end especially ch 7 which forces you down Noah's quest... Its still an great game that i recommend but some aspects have soured on me Overtime. 8.5 - 9 /10 game real good despite my gripes. In comparison to Xenoblade 1 and 2, this game is overrated and average! The story was so boring, I fell asleep many times. The final boss takes extremely long time (it does not matter the level) for absolutely no reason and the fight is maybe the most boring fight I ever had! I had high hopes for this game and it let me down. Thankfully, it's DLC ""Future Redeemed"" is much more enjoyable!. ""Trilogies all have one thing in common. That beimg the third one mostly being the worst part"". This is almost an unofficial mantra that has been rooted into our brain. However it was no other game than Xenoblade Chronicles 3 that broke this formular for me. Never in my life did i went in into a game with so high expectations and getting those topped every single time. This game even midway throughout was great already but after the mid part it became not only my favorite game but my favorite media. The story might be not the most creative but when the execution of the story trope is so grand i don't care. You feel for the characters, their connections and why they are the way they are. They aren't jist the stereotypical anime characters, they are just like you and me: Normal human beings. The gameplay uses the best of both XC 1 and 2 and is not only a great easter egg once you get behind it but also way more flexible than the previous one (except XCX). But both stillfeel imferior to the music. Oh godDAAAAAMN goes the music hard. Yasunori Mitsuda puts once again all his heart and soul into the soundtrack. Heck he created the flutes used in game by himself and used the leitmotivs for several soundtracks. On top some bangers from the previous games get remixed and reused when fittimg for the situation. But it still blends with the score of XC3 so that the call back are subtle and not in your nose. I could gush about that game. No other game made me sob so hard as this one does. The only negative i could give are 1 or 2 side characters being annoying or ome part of the story being a bit more shorter during the 2nd last chapter but at that poimt who cares. If you never played XC1 or 2 you'll get an amazing game filled with awesome characters as you join their journey. When you've played XC1 and 2 bevore you'll get a magnefied 10 out of 10 prime example for fanservice done right. A reward for you following Monolith on their journey throughout their releases (except XCX) and a testament of their passion. You propably noticed that i am very passionate about thos game but i can guarantee you: The creators adore this game more than the fans ever could. A game much more a conclusion like this doesn't just come out. Especially not nowadays, in an age of corporate torment where quantity over quality is the goal. This is a love letter to both the fans and their games where you'll see how much this game is overloaded with care and passion. And i'll never forgive TGOTY for giving best score to Scandinaviaboo- The Game instead of this one.. It has an amazing world, an amazing story, amazing characters, amazing gameplay... Genuinely what more could you ask for from a game like this?. This game is hot garbage. The voice is trrrible. The story is terrible. The characters are terrible. The final boss is one of the worst boss fights in video game history. This game is hot garbage, and I hope the developers learn from their mistakes in the next game. If you like this game, frankly, you have no taste in videogames, and you should play some better games.. Okay. This game a 10 for me because of one simple reason. I wasn't an RPG guy until I saw this game in the game awards, and really wanted to try it out. Now here I am with over 300 hours into the game without a single regret. I have now purchased every single installment in the series and am still currently playing through them. This game's story is incredible, and I absolutely love the character cast. They're so loveable. This is a must play RPG on Switch, and I will be playing this again sometime. This game opened my eyes to a genre I had always neglected, and now I will confidently call myself a RPG guy, and it's thanks to this game.. My favorite Xenoblade Chronicles game. Really entertaining story. Plot points raised here were at a new series heights. Game asked some very interesting questions that left you to ponder them post playing. I really enjoyed the group of playable characters and the characters we meet along the way. And of course how this ties into the general universe... Chef's kiss. Story wise I truly think they nailed it, especially after playing the DLC epilogue. In terms of gameplay it self, I was very impressed. With the new system fighting big monsters is always fun, and you can take on levels you should not be able to, as long as you properly min max your characters and make the right choices at the combo burst. A real treat for number nerds. Overall top stuff. I would not be surprised if this is the last entry in the series, but I am excited to see the next JRPG from this studio.. Plus: quality of life options, characters, battle Minus: good story but not good like in Xeno 2, less location diversity. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 brings a beautiful JRPG experience like none other before seen in the series, even though it has its flaws like any other game. However, its qualities more than make up for them, showcasing an exceptional entry that captivates players with its unique charm and depth.. One word: Soul.. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is amazing! Technically it’s a marvel, and gameplay wise it’s as fun and addictive as ever! I played it all the way through! And I’m this day and age that’s rare for me personally. The reason I say it’s a tech marvel is because it does what systems that boast of more power can’t even think to do. 7 characters during it out at the same time in real time on an open world that has next to no loading times when out there! MonolithSoft knows what they are doing and they are doing it very well! So many heroe characters that can accompany the normal characters not to mention the generous helping of side quests and DLC that come with the game. It’s just so much but they put it together well enough that you are so satisfied. Of course they have to leave you wanting more and they definitely do! The other game that’s attached to it where you play a whole other party at a different time in Aionois’s time is probably even better than the original game in some ways. I’ll have to do a whole other review for that one though. The gameplay and story are woven so very carefully and intricately you wont have lack of either. How this game didn’t get GOTY is beyond me and proves that the Game Awards are either very racist or very biased. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gets a 10/10 a must have for your collection of fun games/RPG’s. Packed with content! My personal game of that year. This is what I call Nintendo’s best! You can only get it there! Happy gaming and peace everyone.. This game takes you with him in his long and emotionnal story. I think I will have to play it again to fully grasp everything this game is trying to tell me. Best game I have played in a very long time.. Wow, undoubtably one of the best JRPG experiences on any platform to date. Between the epic story, the massive enthralling world, and the engaging battle mechanics this game get everything just right. Although very long winded it still very much respects your time and gifts you with an excellent narrative and ending for sticking around. This is a 10/10 game hands down, don’t miss out on this experience.. This might be the most fantastic all-around Xenoblade game I’ve experienced so far. Combat system, characterization of the main cast, music, story progression, all of which are great. The game also has one of the most memorable endings I’ve ever seen in JRPGs.. My curiosity beats my hesitation to try out this game and ""WALLA!"" turns out XC3 is pretty good. I've said on my XC2 review that I won't try XC3 due to several issues that I had with XC2 that I believe might carry over to XC3. Turns out, XC3 improve in every aspect which makes me enjoy my time with it. I've finished the game after 120+ hours. Planned to complete it but I'll save it for later. Things that I like about XC3: - The navigation system still not that great but the world structure is less confusing which make traversing the world a lot easier than XC2. - The Quest design is getting better, although I have to say when you reach CH6 onward, the Quest design is back to how it was in XC2 (Too many subs) - The gameplay mechanic is solid, not like XC2 which pretty confusing and overwhelming with its Blade mechanic. In XC3, it's being changed to classes which pretty awesome and fun IMO. And you can change characters in the middle of battle, finally. - The graphics is better than XC2. Kind of confused with lot of review that complaining about the graphics of XC3 like what do you expect? The fact that this big game is running on switch and has better graphics than XC2 is already an impressive feat. - Story is better as well IMO. In XC2 I tend to get lost while following the story but the way XC3 deliver its story is just better. I'm able to understand the plot and what's going on between each colony. - Characters is debatable but I love XC3 Characters more than XC2. I can relate more to XC3 characters than XC2. Things that I think XC2 still superior than XC3 are: 1. Music = Well, it's all about preferences but XC2 is just way more exciting and alive. XC3 is also good which fits the theme about life and death but XC2 makes you feel kind of badass. 2. World = Of course, it's all about the theme as XC3 about war where XC2 not, so the XC2 world is way more vibrant, colorful which makes it look pretty than XC3. But, again the graphics still better on XC3. As JRPG Fan, XC3 completely nailed it. I dislike XC2 but I'm loving this one even thou I can't say that this is the best JRPG I've played but I'm enjoying every single hour that I've spent on this game. Good Job Monolith!. +Characters don't feel one-dimensional and there's lots of focus on the group and their personal struggles, wich is something that the previous games also had but not to the same extend and I'm glad to see more of it here. +Combat is advanced and complex and gives you seemingly infinite options to set-up your party. It's fun but din't go in this game thinking it's a full on action-JRPG cuz it's not. It's more of a tactical/strategy JRPG except it's not turned based. +Music is peak as usual. +The areas look dope and are fun to explore, tho don't go in this game thinking it's an open-world game like BOTW, cuz it's simply not that and not trying to be that. +The graphics are better than ever. Great artstyle with great graphics (For the Switch, at least) -The areas are very large (especially in the later chapters) but unlike in Xenoblade X, there's no sprint button wich this game could use for sure. -When you're fighting in a small area with lots of enemies at once the game becomes hard to follow visually. Now yes, there is an indicator showing your position relative to the enemy you're targeting but it's still a mess sometimes. I feel like they should give us the option to disable damage and healing numbers since, when you think about it, you don't really need them. Sure it's good to compare the damage output of your party members n' stuff but you can already see all the stats in the character menu so just give us the option to turn of all these damage/healing numbers so that my screen doesn't look so bloated in crowded fights. -The dialoge isn't bad but sometimes it feels like the characters point out pretty obvious things. Mainly early game. -This is not the dev's fault but sometimes I had frame rate drops in ceetain areas. This is just a Switch issue, not a Xenoblade issue.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story in this game is amazing, one of the best that I've recently experienced. The characters and overall storytelling is very memorable, touching and thought-provoking. And my score is very uplifted by this aspect. Because to be honest after 30h or so... I was completely bored with always the same combat and exploration loop. At first it was brilliant and everything was fresh for me but after half of the game it become a real struggle to keep on going. But fortunately when I switched difficulty lvl to easy battles were lot faster and I really recommend easy from the start if you don't want to waste a lot of hours looking on the same combat system over and over again. I've tried previous xenoblade games but they never really convinced me to give them a chance for more then couple more hours. But this game is really special. I really think that everyone should give it a try even if you are not into j-rpg - like me - I'm sure you'll still have a lot of fun!. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an excellent JRPG that is sure to please fans of the genre and newcomers alike. The game has an epic story, a beautiful world, engaging combat, and plenty of content to keep players engaged. If you are looking for a new JRPG to play, then Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a great choice.. I've been playing video games since the days of Final Fantasy 1, and I've seen a lot of them come and go. But Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of the best I've ever played. The story is gripping, the characters are memorable, and the world is absolutely stunning. I could spend hours just exploring the different areas and taking in the sights.. This is an JRPG masterpiece tha","""Xenoblade Chronicles 3"" has everything a Xenoblade fan could ask for . gameplay revolves around a real-time combat system where positioning party members is key . the game is massive, detailed, and seemingly endless ."
416.F-Zero GX,"Skill issue? Before I talk about F-Zero, I need to talk about Dark Souls. Yep, it's one of THOSE reviews. Dark Souls is a notoriously challenging game that I put off for years because of its perceived difficulty. But of course, when I did finally get around to it a couple years ago, Dark Souls blew me away. It turned out nothing was ever insurmountable: with enough willpower, persistence and a little creativity, I was able to overcome every challenge. Despite or maybe even because of the difficulty, Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all time. F-Zero GX is not the Dark Souls of racing games. It has nowhere near the amount of flexibility that Dark Souls has, and it demands even more of the player: if you want to beat this game, be prepared to memorize each track and practice, practice, practice. Sure, trial and error can blossom into amazing satisfaction if you're willing to put in the work. If you enjoy especially challenging games with a high skill floor, F-Zero GX may be the game for you. But such a high level of commitment is not everyone's cup of tea. Even if you play a lot of racing games and you think your skill in the genre is above average, you're probably going to feel humbled, frustrated and baffled as to how this game is even humanly possible. While Dark Souls always gave you options if you felt stuck, in F-Zero, your only solution is to get good. To its credit, F-Zero GX is a very polished game that avoids the typical BS associated with artificial difficulty. Make no mistake, this game is extremely tough, but it's fair. When you fail (and you will fail a lot) you have only yourself to blame. So don't get me wrong, F-Zero GX is a well-crafted game, but it is extremely niche. And while its high price these days is no fault of its own, it certainly makes it harder to recommend. If you have the patience and confidence to develop a high amount of skill, you may end up regarding F-Zero GX as one of the greatest racing games of all time. If not, don't let anyone judge you for writing this one off.. Playtime: 1 hour. I personally found the SNES and GBA F-Zero games quite nice for what they were. I really wanted to see how they would translate to a full-blown 3D makeover, but I was left disappointed. As a whole, it feels less forgiving, if not tedious in the grand prix mode, especially when you bounce off the walls for the 12th time. I decided to try the other game modes. Time trial was... well, it was a time trial mode in its most basic form. So then I went to the story mode. ""I'll have some guidance, a sense of progression"" I thought. Nope, it's just ""collect this amount of orbs in this amount of time"". And you're given very little time, mind you. Unfortunately, this game just doesn't feel good. It feels a lot like something you'd play on an arcade machine, not on a home console.. Still one of the funnest racing games to play. The speed is exciting, the controls are precise, the characters are fun. Story is kind of cringe, but some find it charming. Too bad modern Nintendo won't make a sequel to this game, this game will remain a classic.. My favorite racing game of all time, and I only started it a few months ago. F-Zero GX improves upon it’s predecessor with great visual detail and widescreen, the abiltiy to create custom vehicles, a story mode, and more. The game has a great soundtrack, going for a futuristic and sometimes metal feel, compored to it’s predecessor’s metal-like soundtrack. F-Zero GX is as fast and challenging as it is rewarding, being based purely on skill and quick reflexes whether you’re playing alone or with others. This truly is the Dark Souls of racing games.. Best racing game ever that will probably never be beaten, especially in this day and age, and since Nintendo is probably the worst company in the world, multiply it by 200x. Legitimately great game. The best in the series, and probably one of the best racing games ever. It is really hard and tough to master, but once you do, it is incredibly satisfying and fun. Levels are unique and detailed, races are fun and fast. The story is fun, however it is sometimes heavily unfair. Overall, a nearly ideal racing game. 9/10.. A perfect racing game and everything the genre should be. I’m not a racing fan but adore F-Zero and the sheer speed and exhilaration it delivers.. This game's life seems to fade quickly when there are other racing games on-hand to play with more realism. Advancing in every aspect of the game becomes old quickly when you have to pay for it. The customization, ability to play your saved vehicles at an arcade and the potential to play at tournaments sponsored by Nintendo is alluring. You must love the F-Zero franchise or racing to finish this game.. F-Zero GX is probably the greatest racing game to have ever been released, and it is surprising that Nintendo haven't made a new 3D graphic styled F-Zero game since. While tough at times, F-Zero's learning curve is very rewarding if you can master it, and the sense of speed and spectacle of the races are very exhilarating. The soundtrack? Among the best in any Nintendo game. The ability to make a custom racing vehicle is also a great feature that many racing games do, but I feel GX has perfected. While the cinematics in story mode are a bit dated, they have a ton of charm for early 3D animation. This game is a must buy for racing fans.. I am a huge fan of F-Zero and F-Zero X. Back when I tried to play this game 20 years ago, I couldn't get into it because it didn't feel right. 20 years later, its the same sentiment. I know Sega had their hand in the development of the game, but I believe their influence is what really derailed much of the experience. The music in F-Zero and F-Zero X was iconic, the tracks all felt very different and interesting, almost to the point where you wished that there was more lore to them. F-Zero GX just feels awkward in the presentation compared to the foundation set by the predecessors. Because of the influence of the Sega style presentation, it has the generic racing music from that era and really uninteresting backgrounds (although the graphics are excellent). The addition of content such as the characters having voiceovers, bonus videos, and more personal is awesome, but it feels very much out of place compared to what the franchise already had established. Its just awkward and goofy, and feels like its pulled straight **** Dreamcast racing game. The game just doesn't feel consistent with the series. The gameplay is pretty good. Truthfully, I like the gameplay of F-Zero X a bit more. The cars in this game feel way too loose and slide around too much, and the bouncing off of the walls feels more goofy and out of place than ever before. Despite that, I do like how all of the vehicles truly feel unique, its definitely worth trying all of them at least a few times as they provide a huge variety in how they perform. The ability to make your own custom machines is also fantastic, not only does it add a really cool level of customization, it adds a surprisingly deep level of customization of performance. The levels are also really challenging, I appreciate the difficulty of this game, because you can feel the gradual improvement of your ability with each additional attempt. And if you really commit yourself to memorizing courses, you can spend hours trying to improve your scores and times. I also thought the addition of the story mode was cool, although one of the least memorable modes of the game. This game did a lot to build on the formula that was established by the previous F-Zero games, while stripping it of the personality and presentation that made the other games great. Unfortunately the stripping of the personality really makes it feel way too much like a solid but generic racer of the era. There is a lot of fun to be had with this game, but it didn't pull me in nearly as much as the other two games. I feel like the game added the foundation for necessary steps for the franchise, but unfortunately 20 years later, this is just where they left off. One step forward, one step backward, but good enough.. There is a reason this title has been rebooted, there is so much competition in the racing scene, especially with Mario Kart. It is not terrible, just very dated.. It’s F-Zero so that means it’s peak fiction. It has goated gameplay, a wild story mode a lot of drivers to choose from, fun maps, good music, and a lot to do and unlock.. Insanely hard game for masochists. Brutality in video game form. The Dark Souls of racing titles.. F-Zero GX holds up as one of the best Nintendo racing games to this date, there's a lot of good content hidden in this relatively unknown game. Everything about the controls just feels right, controlling your vehicle is great when you know what you're doing. Unfortunately there is a learning curve to the game (I had played 100 hours before even attempting the Master difficulty), and this sort of racing game doesn't work well in multiplayer. The gameplay is extremely addicting, learning the layout of each track to know how to keep your speed above 1200km/h at every second of the race, and the AI is a lot less predictable than in the previous F-Zero titles, making for more unique and overall enjoyable races. The AI racers also prove to be very tough on Expert difficulty, and Master requires almost perfect knowledge of the track to win, making 500 points on a Grand Prix so much more satisfying than any Mario Kart game can achieve. I LOVE almost every aspect of this game, but one of it's most obvious flaws is the balancing between vehicles... the Body, Boost and Grip stats are downright lies on a few of the machines, and those with high max speed (e.g. the Fat Shark, which has excellent speed AND acceleration) tend to do much better than others. I haven't even attempted a Master Grand Prix with the Silver Rat... This game has it's flaws, but it's very enjoyable if you commit to it. I would talk about the Story Mode and custom machines, but this review is already long enough. In short, good game.. great sense of speed!…….......................................................... haven't played many racing games, mostly just mario kart and other f-zero games. But of them, this is the best. Best graphics, great high speed racing, friggin COMBAT mid race, machine customization, plenty of different vehicles to pick from, an awesome story mode which is... overly hard but still pog, a multiplayer mode which... could be better but still fun. I've spent hours playing the racing modes on this and I rarely beat them but when I do I feel great. Every race is incredibly fun. It is a damn shame this was the last 3d game.. Incredible visuals for its time, a massive amount of variety for its stages, smooth slick controls at ridiculous speeds, and a ridiculous amount of variety in characters. There is no doubt that every person that has a need for speed in racing games should at least play this game once in their life. This is debatably one of the greatest racing games possibly ever made and definitely the greatest racing game Nintendo has ever published and I don't believe they'll ever be able to beat.. getting very hard on story missions might be one the hardest ""real epic gamer"" challenges out there. The thrill of the speed and precision required gets you pumped everytime.. This game is a great reminder of how epic Sega was as a third party developer in the early 2000s and a reminder of their HUGE impact in generation 6. The game looks amazing and has great controls! I've played it briefly and it was a great experience. The game is hard following F-Zero X in perfect fashion. A must have for any F-Zero or Nintendo fan. If you're a fan of futuristic racers and don't have this then it's time to pick this up and realize that this franchise was king in that space. Also a must have for any Sega collector. Perfect example of their brilliance in generation 6.. This game set a bar for all futuristic and arcade racing games as a whole so high that it would likely not be reached for a very long time. This game is a timeless masterpiece that would never get old. This game is the reason why there hasn't been another F-Zero game in more than 15 years. What makes it so amazing? - One of the best title screens ever - Fantastic menu design - Every single music track in the soundtrack is incredible and puts all techno music - Great track design - Interesting and well-designed characters and machines - Magnificent levels - Great graphics quality, game looks great even today - Rock-solid 60FPS - Tons of unlockables - Original machine creation and customization - No load screens whatsoever, in a Mini DVD game - Endless replayability - 4 player 60FPS multiplayer - The difficulty (challenge, rather, the game is fair) would turn a gamer into a GAMER - Look, I won't be able to explain how good the gameplay is without hitting the character limit - Okay I will, the game redefines going fast in a racing game, has polished controls, many strategies, doesn't have those crap soap physics (because you'd expect them to improve the handling of the machines as well in the 26th century), encourages risking it all, you get boost power!!, it's FUN - Even the cutscenes have been intentionally done like a 2000s wrestling show with over the top reactions and silly dialogue, because if they were all super serious they would never be able to achieve the desired quality. The way they are in the game makes them really stand out from the other FMVs in games and makes them fantastic. Also the characters are all ripped which is cool In short, the game is great in literally every aspect. It also has the best version of Rainbow Road (that was sadly renamed to Phantom Road). And if you still aren't convinced, the game runs on a Super Monkey Ball engine. Also, there exists a list of F-Zero AX arcade machines locations, google it, it's one of the best arcade games of all time and the Deluxe cabinet looks absolutely insane in real life.. My personal rating for ""F-Zero GX"" (GC): 9,5/10 - Masterpiece Gameplay: 10 Video: 8 Audio: 8 Scope: 10 Balance: 9,5 Story: -. The best racing game. The best racing game. The best racing game. The best racing game.. A perfect racing game. It's quite hard at times, but it's good to be challanged sometimes. It's crazy arcade high speed meets F1 and MotoGP precision. Every wreck, loss or failure can be pinpointed down to the exact turn, pass or jump. This game is about speed and precision. The practice mode and time trials do not exist for boredom. They are there to hone skills and acclimation to each vehicle. Proper racing with ridiculous tracks. No great automobile racer has won by whimsical skills and feeling a vehicle. They helped but they still studied courses and tunes to eek a second or so here and there. That's the beauty of this game. That and its supreme controls. You never have to guess what button does what or when to use it. This series needs a revival because every other competitor needs weapons and floaty physics to come near the speed and challenge this game has. Probably new hires for track design as well.. Wow, this is hard, but the challenge is awesome! Maybe too awesome... Yeah, it can be too difficult at times.. Don't even bother reading the negative reviews for this game. Basically every single review amounts to: ""I **** at this game therefore it's bad 1 out of 10"". This game is hard, but plenty of us non-scrubs can beat this game or at least come close. If you **** then that's your problem not the game's, git gud. Now on to the actual review. This game is almost perfect. The music is great, the controls are great, the sense of speed is great, and the game is challenging without being unfair. GX is everything I've ever wanted in an F-Zero game and I don't think it'll ever be topped (If Nintendo ever even makes another one..). This game should be like a 9.7, but the scrubs have dragged the overall rating down. If you don't **** at racing games then try this. If not then don't bother we don't need any more little babies crying about the difficulty and dragging the user score down ok?. This extremely fast-paced game was a lot of fun with a variety of vehicles to pick from with varying stats, a selection of stages to race in, and the fact that you can kill other players just adds a bit of a darker twist into the game. My main problem with this game, oh god, the difficulty. similar to Wipeout XL (or Wipeout 2096), it's one of those games where you die... alot. especially the story mode, which is pretty forgettable.. Incredibly challenging but a lot of fun. Soundtrack is epic and style of game play is rare to see in the racing genre. Another brilliant game in the GameCube era that needs a sequel.. Still the most exhilarating racing game ever, in my opinion, even in 2017. Only Burnout 2 comes close. I've just gone back to playing it on the Dolphin emulator and the graphics still look great (I've upped the resolution to 1080p though). The main Grand Prix mode is awesome and not too hard, but the story mode quickly becomes next to impossible! It's still worth 10/10 though because there's so much content on offer here. I wish a modern version of this absolute classic could be made for the Switch/Wii U. It has to be said, the courses are the real star!. The eyes of most players here are blurred by nostalgia, for many it seems, childhood nostalgia, while I skipped this generation (during my early 20s) and returned to this game later in life (having experienced 3 or 4 generations of gaming before the Gamecube even appeared). The parts of this game where there is a track that doesn't launch you into oblivion are great; superb high-speed racing. However, for many of the later tracks in the game then it is a matter of the game being so fast that you simply do not have time to avoid or see the ramps that launch you to an instant death. The only way to confront this unfair challenge is to play the challenges (or most annoyingly the whole cup) over and over again until you randomly succeed. This is not fun and massive design flaw. In many ways this makes the game impossible to complete without putting in a disproportionate amount of time (and anger) compared to the fun. I'd love a new F-zero game, but without this fundamental flaw. A game that is neigh-on impossible to complete, not due to size, but due to bad design = low score, simple as that.. F-zero GX is the best out of the series cause of it's great gameplay and great courses. This game should be more loved than the N64 version. This game is one of the best racers ever.. This is one of the best racing games on GC . In My Top 10 Best Racing Games on GC included . F Zero Series compare with Wipeout Series . F Zero Series is racing on spaceship as in Wipeout, but I more like Wipeout than F Zero and F Zero more children than Wipeout . F Zero quite fit Racing Game .. This game was clunky, people have nostalgia goggles on, the ones before it were better, honestly. The same nerds that hate on modern Nintendo games with challenge, praise this for far less.. F-Zero GX is the greatest racing of 6th generation! This game cooler that NFS Underground 2, Burnout 3 - Takedown and Wipeout series. We can boost to 2000 mph and this is the hardest racing game of all time.. Let's just lay out why I think this game deserves 10/10: Graphics: For it's time, a locked 480p60 with great character models stuffed onto a 1.5GB disc was and still is a phenomenal achievement. Gameplay: F-Zero GX excels in Gameplay. Smooth 60FPS in both singleplayer and multiplayer with 30 racers on screen, steep difficulty curve that is incredibly rewarding and the feeling that you want to keep coming back makes me come to the conclusion the gameplay deserves 10/10. Controls: The game controls great. Very responsive, controls are natural once you get used to them and they complement the GameCube controller Music: Music is one of GX's strongest areas. With it's unlock-able and default music it fits the courses very well. Courses: Speaking of courses, they're great too. It must've taken forever to design these because of how intricate yet in a way simple they are. Definite 10/10 for courses. Overall: You can't go wrong with this if you like racing games at all. The definitive futuristic racer.. F-Zero GX is easily one of the best racing games ever made, if not THE best racing game. Everything about this game is so highly polished that it's almost impossible not to have fun with it. The visuals are some of the best on the GameCube if not the best on it; the game looks better than a lot of Wii titles and even looks better than some of the very early titles on the PS3 and Xbox 360. The details on the machines give an incredibly realistic look to them and the CG cutscenes in the story mode look stunning for the GameCube. The tracks themselves are beautiful to look at, especially Fire Field & Aeropolis. Speaking of tracks, F-Zero GX's tracks are beautifully designed. All of them are extremely fun and a challenge to race on. The music is also very good, however it isn't as great as F-Zero X's. That doesn't mean that it has no good songs, because it does (Lightning, Aeropolis, Fire Field and almost all of the Pilot Themes). F-Zero GX is notorious for being ridiculously difficult, and it certainly is difficult. The Master difficulty in the Grand Prix is extremely challenging and getting 1st place in all the tracks is a daunting task (Phantom Road i'm looking at you). And of course, there is the Story mode. The Story gets hard in Easy mode in Chapter 6 and the game is near impossible in Very Hard in chapter 1 (yeah.....). However, the difficulty is there to challenge the player into sharpening and perfecting their skills and once you beat the Story Mode and unlock the hidden racers, you feel accomplished. F-Zero GX is an underrated masterpiece and is one the best titles Nintendo has ever published/made. While i still prefer F-Zero X just a slight edge, F-Zero GX is a title that should not be overlooked by racing fans. You want the craziest, hardest and one of the most beautiful racing games ever made, F-Zero GX is the one you are looking for.. The parts of this game I was able to play were pretty. Sadly it was much too difficult for my abilities, and I didn't manage to get far enough into the game to have a good impression of it. Unless you're really good at racing games, F-Zero GX is going to be more frustrating than fun.. This is pretty much Nintendo's finest hour on the GameCube. None of that sluggish gimmicks found in Mario Kart Double Dash can be found here. This game is fast and challenging, presenting a deep gameplay that might take a while to master, but it's completely responsive. At the time it came out there was so much stuff right with this like online leaderboard, amazing graphics and arcade counterpart AX connection compatible. This is truly a grand title and it's a shame Nintendo now focus more on crap like Wii Sports than teaming up with Sega again and making a worthy successor to this.. one of the best racing games ever invented. The soundtrack is remarkable especially how it seems to flow so well with the tracks themselves, it gives a truly dynamic experience throughout the whole game creating the general feeling of a virtual futuristic rollercoaster. The gameplay itself is addicting. In a nutshell you race one lap without boost and than after the 2nd lap you can start kicking it in high gear and I mean HIGH GEAR! This game is SO freaking fast. I spent hours on this game and it never got boring.. My favourite racer of all time. Improves on F-Zero X due to it's massively improved visuals and more single-player game modes. Plenty of tracks, racers and great music as ever and the speed you feel is insane, it's really in a class of it's own. The sometimes impossible difficulty level (even on easy this thing was REALLY hard) holds it back from absolute masterpiece-dom however. I really hope they make one of these for the Wii-U, it would blow my mind.. Best racing game ever, story is INSANELY hard, so don't do that. Just play some grand prix's, get some money, buy some characters, attempt to do the emerald cup, and have fun!. Graphics: 8.0 Sound: 7.0 Gameplay: 7.0 Fun/Story: 7.5 A good racing game, with smooth 60fps but the visuals of some tracks didn´t convinced me. Sound isn´t good too, gameplay is difficult, ... Sometimes i played it, but never liked it very much. Perhaps the reason ir more about the style and type of racing game (i prefer simulators).. An incredibly fast paced futuristic racing game, an amazing (electronic/rock) soundtrack, a HUGE character roster, ability to customize and create your own vehicle, very original race tracks with loopings and gravity defying mechanics, an ending movie with each and every one of the characters you finish Grand Prix with and a challenge mode which is incredibly hard and truly challenges you to come back for more... Depending on your love for fast paced racing games this will be the game for you. It has a very arcade-y like feel to it, but this benefits the game even more, you just keep coming back to the game, learning how to maneuver every racetrack they throw at you, definitely worth your time as a race fan. One of the best the Gamecube has to offer!. There was a point in my life where I thought Need for Speed was fast. Then I played F-Zero GX. This right here is how you make a good racing game. Crazy speed, insane techno music, awesome graphics, and ridiculous track designs all help to make this game what it is. And you know what? This game is HARD AS HELL. If you are able to beat the story mode, you deserve a plaque or something. In my humblest of opinions, this is the best racing game to date. I just hope they make a new one some day. This franchise better not die.. Probably one of the best racers I have ever played. Those that are panning the game for its style or difficulty are being silly and vacuous trolls (like Gamerfolife or KarlN). This game is very fast as it runs at a constant 60 fps. The tracks flow really well with constant speed and look really nice (plus they're functional). The graphics are great because they are very detailed, with some good animation cut scenes in the story mode. There are many unlockables and modes such as being able to customize your machine, to pilot profiles, to watching replays. The Grand Prix offers five cups with their varied track designs and plenty of replay value, coupled with interviewing the pilots afterwards. Story Mode is more like a Missions Mode with a plot behind it; it is very difficult, but totally worth beating. The game offers 41 pilots with their own machines, all unique from one another and making for a great character list. The music is pulse-pounding and very catchy to hear. My only complaints with F-Zero GX is that it is quite difficult, especially in the Story Mode where the AI cheats in some chapters (its still beatable, though), and that some of the voice acting and lip-syncing was a little off at times. Otherwise, it is a complete game with few flaws and I enjoyed every minute of it.. *9.8* Ocean of depth and entertainment.. Every failure creates a drive to win that builds to obsessive levels. An F-Zero update's arrival to the e-sports scene would cause a gaming revolution.. Will I ever beat this game? Ever? That's what makes F-Zero so great. When you die, and I mean WHEN, it makes you go ""Let's try again, I'll do it this time!"", but of course you die again. And again. And again. **** Here's what you'll get out of this game: Gameplay so hard it puts Battletoads to shame, magnificent visuals, a kickass soundtrack, and the chance to play as the spawn of Chuck Norris himself, Captain Falcon. If you only enjoy a game when you're constantly winning, you'll never enjoy this game because you will DIE, with nobody to blame but yourself and your need for speed. That's it, though. The gameplay works so well that you can't fault anyone but yourself. This game has no luck involved. It's just you racing 29 other contestants in a brutal death match of who can be faster.. This is the last hardcore nintendo game, and boy is it a good one. This game oozes style, with uniquely-constructed settings and memorable courses, not to mention the blazing soundtrack keeping pace with the speed. It is a VERY hard game, but it keeps frustration to a minimum.. F-Zero has a cool graphical style and a megaton of collectibles to unlock. However, these assets ultimately wilt when faced with ball-breaking difficulty and over-sensitive, twitchy controls. I loved the SNES and N64 F-Zero games. They were fantastic! This one is probably best avoided unless you're either hardcore into the franchise or a sado-masochist.. F-Zero GX is the current latest F-Zero game released on home-console, and it'll be almost ten years since its release. If you play the game today, it'll feel like it's been released yesterday. This game definitely got ahead of its time with it's catchy soundtrack and high-quality graphics. What's great: Gameplay elements, awesome graphics, amazing soundtrack, entertaining cut scenes, and it's story mode. What's not so great: The difficulty of completing the game, but F-Zero is more than just a test of skill... Would I recommend this game to a friend? ""YES!"" as the Falcon would say.. A must have racing game on the Gamecube. It plays quite fast and is comparable to Wipeout and Extreme G on N64. The controls aren't as critical as Wipeout and it might be a bit on the flaky side. Multiple modes, customization, and wacky characters make this FUN. Its sort of arcade style. The graphics and music, supplied by Sega developers, give it charm. Once you beat it there is some replay value but not as much as I hoped; its a bit too hard in the challenge modes. A great game that is not as good as Wip3out, but much more fun than other games out there.. Hi, my reviews work on a 3 way system, i rate graphics, audio/sound, gameplay. then i have an overall rank for each game i review Graphics: F zero GX is a beautiful game. i have seen few games that look better on the GameCube. very colorful, abstract, and detailed (9/10) Audio/Sound: The soundtrack in F zero is great, and fitting to the fast paced action that f Zero has to offer. None of the sound effects get annoying and the voice acting is slightly above standard. (7.5/10) Gameplay: The racing in this game is Very awesome, the multiplayer is as tasty as pie but the story mode is one of the hardest i have ever seen. Even though i enjoy a challenge, F Zero is overkill on the difficulty perspective. in all this game runs amazingly with VERY challenging gameplay. (8/10) Overall: the game runs, looks and sounds great with few problems, the difficulty may add or subtract some of the replay value. however F zero is an awesome game and should be on everyone's GameCube collection. F-Zero GX scores an 8/10. One of my favorite games, and easily the best racing game i have ever played, the game offers many characters and their vehicles which you can unlock... and a lot of race tracks (that you can also unlock). It could also well be one of the hardest games i have ever played, the story made really made me angry, but i still kept playing it until i finally unlocked all the courses, (still need to unlock the characters, but probably not going to cause of how hard the story mode is)... Games has overall fast paced gameplay, the most fitting and amazing soundtrack ever put into a game, and excellent vehicle customization... why would anyone give this game anything lower than a 10???. Wipeout? forget about that **** This game right here is perfection when it comes to futuristic racing. Fast paced, superb controls, great tracks, awesome music, really great graphics, solid framerate and hard as **** difficulty just make the deal better. One of the best games that the Cube has to offer.. What was mean","despite or maybe even because of the difficulty, Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all time . if you enjoy especially challenging games with a high level of commitment, F-Zero GX may be the game for you . make no mistake, this game is extremely tough, but it's fair ."
417.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury,"If you don't have this combo, GET ON YOUR SWITCH RIGHT NOW. Mario 3D World is already a great game with an amazing soundtrack and fun gameplay, but when you add in a completely original take on the Mario games (Bowser's Fury) to go with it, you get one of the greatest games on the switch.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 3D World - 8/10 - Pretty fun game, depth perception is wonky at times but this game is pretty fun, especially on co-op. Bowser's Fury - 9/10 - Really fun game, altough waiting for Bowser to wake up so you can break the blocks is kinda annoying. The map is pretty fun to traverse through and the Cat Shines, even though they had pretty much the same objective on every island, were very fun to collect.. Memorable nostalgic and fun the multiplayer is the highlight for me if your not throwing your friends into the abyss your not playing it right. This game had so much potential but the camera control was bad enough and it felt like a 3d 2d mario game. 3D World is fun for co-op, specially to play with someone isn't into gaming but played Mario as a child. But as a stand alone game I was really bored by it, I felt I was playing an improved 3D land wich was amazing for it's time. So that game would be around a 6-6,5/10. In the other hand Bowser's Fury is just amazing. It's really hard for me to play again after a few months after I beat it, and one of them was this one. I wanted the world/the game it's self to be bigger, maybe mixing up with those 3D levels in 3D world, have a larger story like Odyssey, I don't know it felt like it is an amazing Mario game but it could be so much more.. Cooperative mode is superfun! Great game to play alone, and even better to play with company!. Good addition to the current content (even short). However, for me, this is only a nice experience to revisit the title. For those who did not have the opportunity to play it on Wii U, for sure worth the value to enjoy it on Switch.. my cat was brutally murdered by cat mario, however the game is good and I didn't really like my cat in the first place.. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury may have seemed like an unexpected game to come onto the Switch, but it actually works really well. The new controls and movement system makes the game feel a lot smoother and gets rid of that slow feel in the original game. A problem I have with this game though, is that I would have liked some more levels. The game is more or less the same as the Wii U's one, apart from the movement, slighty updated graphics and of course Bowser's Fury. Now, Bowser's Fury is almost perfect. Almost. They portray Bowser like a super angry, badass villain and I love that! But his son on the other hand... Bowser Jr. can be helpful, however most times he's not. He gets in the way when you're running around, and when I need him, he's off painting a wall. I had to put help from him on zero, otherwise I would have raged. Overall Super Mario 3D World + Bowsers Fury is a great game. You should definitely give it a play. 8/10. What a fun game, full of great levels. Especially enjoyable with the Multiplayer elements (Now online too), but even on your own you will struggle to find a game quite like it. And Bowser's Fury, although a tad short, was a great and fun game.. This game fixes every issue with the original. Additionally now that the Wii-U era is over, this game has begun to get some love. The game isn't as ground breaking as Galaxy or Odyssey, but it makes up for it by being incredibly fun. Nintendo's level design is at one of it's peaks here. Additonally this comes with a completely new 3 hour experience. Bowsers Fury is a glimpse behind the scenes of the future of 3D Mario games. It accomplishes more in 3 hours than some games do in 100.. This was actually the first game I downloaded to my Switch and it was great! I still play it unlike some gamesI have. Oh, and did I mention about how many bug fixes there are?!. Super Mario 3D World was already a very nice game with the simple mechanics and fun worlds but that is only added to by Bowser's Fury and the combination is truly one of the best Mario experiences.. Other than me raging so frickin hard on w4's boss it is a pretty good game (me raging is the reason my username is ****). The Multiplayer experience is the best out of any video game I've ever played, the level design goes well with the characters and power ups, all the hidden secrets are fun and the aesthetic of both games it's really vibrant and appealing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is an absolute delight for both newcomers and returning fans. The game blends classic platforming with fun level design, making it an essential addition to the Mario Mainline series. The controls are smooth and responsive, simple enough for people of any age group to get used to the controls with ease. Completing the game 100% is immensely satisfying, offering a variety of unlockables and challenges. Bowser's Fury adds a unique twist, presenting an open-world adventure that’s a thrilling departure from the traditional formula. This version is a significant step up from the Wii U original, with improved graphics, faster gameplay, and new content that enhances replayability. Overall, it's a joyous, well-crafted experience that showcases the best of Mario.. this game is not stuck on the WII U:) and this is fun its hard in a good way. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game, while often looked down upon as a game that failed to be a ""3D Mario,"" to me, combines everything good about Mario into a game I consider my favorite 3D Mario Game. Actually, scratch that. This might be my favorite Mario experience PERIOD. Every level of Super Mario 3D World is so meticulously designed, and I absolutely love the way it incorporates elements from the 2D games and the 3D games. The new power-ups are so fun to use and the collectibles are well-placed. While accessible, the game also provides some extremely fun challenging levels. Champion's Road, while a struggle, was one of the most exhilarating obstacles in about any Mario game. Not to mention, this game was meant to be played with multiple people, which makes it a perfect fit for the collaborative nature of the Nintendo Switch. What truly elevates this particular version's experience is the Bowser's Fury mode, which gives us a world reminiscent of Super Mario Sunshine. The game mode takes on a more Odyssey-adjacent feel while also periodically spawning in the most fun iteration of a Bowser boss fight in Mario history. In addition to that, having Bowser Junior as a companion is a welcome addition that gives his character to stand out a lot. The fact that Super Mario 3D world can be experienced with multiple people makes the game so much more fun for it as well, in my opinion. It makes it really easy to pick up and play in a way that the other 3D Mario games never really were to me. Honestly, the co-op actually ELEVATES this game for me, which is usually not the case, even for the 2D Mario titles. Given the third dimension to wiggle around in, it creates a slightly more manageable feeling of chaos that I really like about it.. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is a great platform game to play with friends, alone the game sounds too difficult and a few times boring for a Mario game. The level design, sound design and character characteristics are awesome, Platform games is a masterpiece of Nintendo and this game has almost all the points of a perfect platform game. Super Mario 3D World has awesome level designs, enemies and boss fights, how the game works or its story is a little hard to learn in the beginning because you play with a panoramic camera and sometimes you can easily miss some jumps. About Bousers Fury, the game is also awesome, awesome map design and level design, the only part that can be boring sometimes are some enemies in the map with the way they interact with what you are doing and the boss fights against Bowser. The last point about the game it's the powers, you can easily beat the game with the cat power, and its too OP, at least for me. But I highly recommend, awesome game.. Super Disappointed, I Bought The Game In Anticipation For Some Action Then I Reread The Title And Realized There Was Only One R. I think the game would benefit from having more levels with a moveable camera and getting rid of the time clock, or at the very least making that an option. It has all the aspects of a 2d Mario game that I don’t like, and doesn’t scratch the itch of a 3d Mario game because it doesn’t encourage any kind of exploration.. The 3D levels can sometimes make judging jumps a little tricky (resulting in a few frustrating deaths), but Super Mario 3D World features an excellent variety of levels, enemies and power-ups which add up to make another top-notch Nintendo platformer. The addition of Bowser’s Fury also helps add a good few more hours to the games runtime, even if the constant appearance of Bowser gets a bit dull by the end.. Not all is bad.3D World is similar to 3D Land but I prefer more of a Super Mario 64 style.. Mario 3D World isn’t a game that invokes much feeling or magic. I don’t understand why this game even exists. Mario 3D Land was a game created to pad out the 3DS library, so a sequel to that handheld game is illogical. Level design is really boring, given that the game doesn’t have many gimmicks to play around with. Thus leaving levels feeling like they weren’t made to take advantage of anything, but rather making them feel like they were cobbled together in a level editor last minute. The only levels I enjoyed from this game were some of the post game levels, but in my opinion they aren’t enough to carry the game. Now of course the controls are excellent, the visuals are beautiful, and the soundtrack is up to snuff with the other Mario games. But those things are meant to be icing on the cake, not the main supplement. Oh yeah, there’s also the “Bowser’s Fury” game mode which honestly feels incredibly lazy and shoehorned. It’s only there to justify the $60 price tag, but overall 3D World being the exact same price as Mario Odyssey feels absolutely cursed.. Its nice this game comes with 3D World, as Bowser's Fury's short campaign really did nothing for me. Its very ""Mario Maker"". Which I get that is an odd thing to say, since I like Mario Maker a lot, but I guess what I mean is that it seem fan made. None of the areas are all that interesting and are not cohesive at all, just thrown in a single map at random. Then you have to deal with one of the worse parts of the game, Bowser. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have this big **** just spawn and shoot **** at you while you tried to platform is an ****, its just not fun. Most of the time its more of an annoyance, where you just have to say, ""Ok, fun, I guess I'll stand in this hole until he goes away"", just wasting your time.. Amazing game. I never played wii version, so this was a new experience for me. It's my first game in Switch, and I have completed it because yo never get bored. Amazing.. This game brings all of good Mario Platformers... Just incredible and the real challenge is behind the last level. The best coop multiplayer in Mario Games, really love the couch coop. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While I like 2D mario games at times, I am not a huge fan. This game is mostly a 2D Mario game, disguised as a 3D game. However, the 3D game is minimal and the player mostly completes linear 2Dish levels. The levels themselves are pretty good and I enjoyed my playthrough. I suspect that I would enjoy this game (like Mario Wonder) more in Multiplayer than Singleplayer. For both these games I tend to feel like they are a 6, rather than a 7 for single-player, but the multiplayer raises them to a 7-8.. It's another Mario game. Boring, repetetive and horribly annoying. Ideas in this game are as bad as in every mario game. After ending of story and some 100% course I can't understand why Nintendo mario games are that expensive where there is many of copy and paste and recycled stuff.. SM3DW is overrated, you get to the desert world and there are no desert levels! Same with all the other worlds, it's very very cheap. Bowser's Fury on the other hand starts out feeling like one of the best Mario games of all time, and then becomes abrasive as hell towards the end. Not worth a buy.. Great game with great level design. Mario is so responsive and the cat power-up is amazing. Not a big fan of Bowser's Fury, but it's a great bonus for this remake.. It was really awesome game i have played ever. It was also my first modern mario game i played if we don't count old marios, super mario 1,2,3. sometimes i could not check the clock for learning that how long did i play. I stuck in that fkkk game. NOTE: EVERYBODY HAS TO PLAY THİS PERFECT GAME!!! section design is PERFECTT. I LOVE THIS GAME. Such an awful Port!. This is the same game as Mario 3d World for Wii U but with garbage controls and an overpriced DLC that doesn't add much of anything. Besides,the base game is $20 more than the original version on Wii U.. Thank god bowsers fury did not reflect the future of this series. 3D World was amazing Bowsers fury was awful. This game is amazing. It has a linear development and it encourages you to go the completionist way (which I don't normally do). I would vote with 10 but for me, Bowser's Fury is not as perfect as Super Mario 3D World.. This is an amazing package for 60 dollars, I would of paid 60 dollars for each game separately, but they decided to bundle them together for a great price. Mario 3d world is amazing, an amazing single and multiplayer game, yeah it might be a 9 year old game, but they it is still worth it. Bowsers fury is the game people wanted 3d world to be in 2013, it is an amazing open world game and is worth the 60 dollars BY ITS SELF! The music is amazing!!! 10/10. To get two perfect games for the price of one. What a steal. Bowsers fury shows the potetntial for future 3d mario titles. and not ever level in 3d world is perfect but their are so many perfect levels.. This collection is the definition of a perfect collection. Not only do you have a perfect 3D Mario game ported from the Wii U and enhanced to make it even better but you also have a brand new game with it and Bowser's Fury on it's own is an 8/10 game. This collection is a must buy and this is how you do a Wii U port not something super lazy and crappy like New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, etc. Bowsers Fury 9/10 perfect experience maby a little short but 3D World wans't anything to write home about.. Bowser’s fury is such a wonderful game. I hope it would be expanded into a full size title.. I think that this game isn't the peak of 3D platforming, but it's not the worst thing ever. I think ""Worst game ever! I don't understand you all saying this game is super easy, except for the last level. Luckilly, there is Bowser's Fury, but it is still not enough to compense for f****** SM3DW. A pure scam!"" and ""Locked 30fps in handheld mode in a MARIO GAME. This runs like absolute **** it's almost unplayable without having the switch docked, at least in bowsers fury. Not worth $60 in any way shape or form."" are a bit harsh.. I was super excited to see 3D World come to the switch when this came out, but for this review I'm mainly focusing on Bowser's Fury. While this game was certainly fun and was an interesting take on 3D Mario, I didn't think it was fantastic. It had it's good moments, but I wasn't loving the fury mechanic too much. Still worth playing though, and having 3D World to play with it makes this game a must have on the Switch.. While 3D World is still just as fantastic since its release in 2013, Bowser’s Fury on the other hand, is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and BRILLIANT to play! An incredible (predictable) story, the open world that was taken from Odyssey, Fury Bowser being a GOD and that is something I wanted Nintendo to do outside of Smash, INCREDIBLE graphics, and overall, 3D World + Fury is a brilliant Switch port that you should DEFINITELY play!. An Excellent game with an excellent additional side story, my only gripe with it is how painful it is to fully 100% the main game. An amazing port from wii u to switch. So many new additions and changes and it makes this game that much more fun.. I loved Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, and this enhanced port improves on it quite a bit. Gameplay is faster, tighter, and more crisp - the increased speed of the action alone makes the game so much better. Throw in the surprisingly great (but short) Bowser's Fury, and you have a can't miss package. A must-play for every Nintendo Switch owner.. In contrast to New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, this game is a perfect example on how to port a old game to newer hardware. The gameplay of 3D World is much faster now and the movement feels more fluent than on the Wii U. The leveldesign sadly follows the formula of 3D Land which makes the levels play like 2D, which makes it hard to stick out. Bowsers Fury is a great addition. It definitely fits the 3D World vibe, while still being unique in its own way. We never had a open world 3D Mario before and this side mode builds up hype for the next big Mario game. 3D Land is a fallen off game. It is ok. I could not really see that I got too much out of it bored when you're sitting on the bus. It is very enjoyable. But bowser's Fury was so good that I had to put it to my TV so I could enjoyed it. All. It's goodness and it also because playing it on the switch filled wrong when it looks so good. It has just the right amount for this kind of experience and it is very fun level design and looking for alle the sun kitt I had a smile on my face all the way through and the story is fun. so play 3D world on the bus and bowser's Fury on the TV. 3D world was a very fun experience which was fun in co-op to play with mates, while the world themes are basic, each level tries to keep the formula new and fresh which have lead to very memorable ideas. Nothing ground breaking but still enjoyable. Bowsers Fury was not what I was expecting, the fusion between Odyssey and World was entertaining to play, while fighting bowser was fun after a while it became irritating to need to stop what your doing to avoid him.. This game works, it is a remake of the game on the Wii U and it works for the switch. This game shows the chaos the first game showed. Also 4 players, there is multiple secrets for you to find ""green stars, and stamps"". Yes play this game.. This is an absolute gem **** that you MUST play. Everything about Super Mario 3D world is amazing, from its cast of iconic characters, to its charming and exciting worlds and levels and its brilliant soundtrack. By far one of my favourite Mario games out there.. Possibly my favorite Mario game yet. I loved the cleverness of the levels and the enemy characters that looked like toys. Made me fall in love with Mario all over again.. Mario 3D World = 8 Bowser Fury = 10 Overall a great game for Mario Fan but all I want is more of Mario Odyssey which Bowser Fury manage to give that kind of freedom and fun of the Odyssey. At first, I kind of confused because many people said that 3D World is better than Odyssey which is why that argument kind of intrigue me to purchase 3D World + Bowser Fury. Turns out, I don't like it that much because we're just playing a linear level and more focused on the platforming. It's not bad, but I just prefer the exploration and freedom in Odyssey more than a linear and more focused level of 3D world. At the end of it, I start to understand why some people said Odyssey weird and prefer 3D World, because 3D World stick to the traditional Mario while Odyssey kind of an open world version of it. On the other hand, Bowser Fury is great. It's like a combination of 3D world + Odyssey. Yes, the level is more linear and focused on platforming like 3D World but the free roam exploration is completely a nice touch for that. Although, Bowser Fury is relatively easy than 3D world and Odyssey. Well, just buy this game if you love Mario in general but if your first Mario game is Odyssey. I don't think you'll love this game. Give me Odyssey 2.. 3D Mario gameplay in crisp HD with great visuals and controls is great, but Bowser's Fury is the real treat in this package. Some of Nintendo's best music and platforming sequences with the unique execution of Bowser's effect on the world is a breath of fresh air for the plumber in red.. When this game came out on Wii U i didn't like how the gameplay looked so i didn't play it. Now that I had the oportunity to play it on the Swithc, i actually enjoyed it. It was really fun and very polish in almost every aspect. But, to be honest I prefer the ""sandbox"" style of Mario games like in Mario 64 or even more the Galaxy style where in the same world/galaxy you could have a lot more exploration, so for me 3D World is not at the same level as those games.. Seriously world class game design. Very impressive. + A great soundtrack too. Excellent game for couch co-op, and love the design of each level. It's definitely a throwback to 3D Mario games like Super Mario 64 and Sunshine. Definitely a staple if you're looking for a multiplayer game to play.. Both games are together about 15 hours playtime, if you collect most of the stars/suns. Super Mario 3D World You can play different characters. The upgrade helps you through the levels and sometimes they are even necessary to find all the stars. The 3D feeling isn't that good. The viewing angles just doesn't feel good and after jumping you don't land where you would expect. That's a bit annoying. After defeating Bowser, there are even more levels for the late game. But these are pretty hard, be prepared! A great addition is Bowser's Fury. In this fully 3D World you navigate Mario and helping Bowser Junior to make Bowser normal again. The map has really good vibes like in Super Mario Sunshine. The difficulty is easy to medium, so perfect for a nice break. You can 'store' the different upgrades like the fireball, boomerang etc. and activate or even change between them whenever you want.. Mario 3D World is the perfection of what Mario 3D Land started. It is one of the best - personally I would say the best Mario-game of all time. The short well designed levels always invite you to play. Bowsers Fury is also a good addition to this game and makes the short adventure a little longer. I can really recommend this game.. The best 3D platforming experience I have experienced. The level design approach beats out that of the traditional collectathon games, and the addition of Bowser's Fury adds a bit of the traditional star-collecting formula to this already great game. The green stars are fun to collect, and the fact they are required to an extent makes them worthwhile to grab. The unique character traits make which one you choose more important, though the speed increase makes Toad nearly unplayable.. The easiest and most streamlined Mario World i played, but the minimalism gives it a charm others dont have, wasnt particularly blown away by any stages though.. I really like the 3d version the bowser's furry too but the map is pretty small and you got to fight bowser like every 10 minutes and itt's annoying. A fresh take on an old formula. The worlds are amazing and this is so much fun with friends. Sometimes the perspective is a little frustrating though. This game is just pure fun! It definitely has great replay value and is fun to play alone or with others.. The weakest entry in the 3D Mario Series... First off, I prefer the sandbox 3D Mario games so this probably wasn't made for me. This game packs a ton of content but I feel like the formula of just reaching the end and grabbing a few stars along the way lacks depth. There's is a great variety of gameplay though, which helps its cause. I really hate the fixed camera, which removes a lot of the control I've had in other 3D Mario games. Things can feel inexact with the camera being so far away from the characters, a lot of time at a slanted angle. When you get to the secret worlds at the end, the camera gets almost unbearable. Multiplayer is a great time and the fuxed camera works well for it. The Bowser's Fury add on is fantastic. I wish the whole game was that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I mean, what is there to say, It's the same masterpiece as the original, but with an extra game mode that is also a masterpiece. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay and level design is great and f0r once in a Mario game, the music is actual memorable.. this game is a masterpeice and i often come back to this game the most out of all mario games. One of the better games on Switch. It is fun and can be enjoyed by all ages. Highly recommend.. Super Mario 3d world have good content on wii u , but on switch still have an upgrade , the addition of Bowser Fury is wonderful, good graphics nice pos game, nice difficult for a Mario Game, but not that good on multiplayer mode.. It's a solid game, but nothing more. It doesn't go above and beyond the way other Super Mario games have. It's good for a single playthrough, but not much to come back for. Bower's Fury is a nice addition, but not enough to push my score above 7.. This is the greatest port on the switch by FAR. Making the characters faster and adding a couple QOL changes was nice, and adding online was huge, but Bowser's Fury is just AMAZING. A big ""open world"" with a bunch of mini objectives and Bowser attacking every once and a while is super fun, and really could be its own side game. This game improved on the original super well, and Bowser's fury just puts it over the top. A must play for any switch owner, especially with friends. Bowser's Fury is a fantastic addition to this game. The open-world style of play is fun to experience as Mario for sure. The whole Bowser goes ballistic thing gets old after a while, though. 3D world is probably more of an acquired taste. I found myself bored with how easy things were very quickly. When games like Mario galaxy and odyssey exist, I have a hard time understanding why 3D world is worth playing. Nonetheless, worth a try. Just not a must-have.. Mario 3D World + Bowser Fury is a remaster that we didn’t necessarily need. On the other hand, the 2013 game still works as well with an adjusted fluidity. As for Bowser Fury, it is a kind of first step to a completely open Mario. If Mario Odyssey would have been like that, I would have put 20/20 direct lol. But, this port is certainly not necessary is always welcome on switch.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. wonderful game, sometimes hard enough to make me take a break but overall worth the money. This is purely a rating for Bowsers fury, I love 3d world to death. Bowsers fury is sandbox, but has a weird day- night cycle that I’ll admit, makes the game feel robotic. Everything being cats can also have that effect on you. I like the connected world though, and a sandbox Mario is always welcome. I feel like this was more “testing ground” than an actual game, but I still liked it and it was fun.. Funny enough I actually liked bowsers fury more than the base game. I think it’s a really good 3D Mario game with an amazingly fun open world expansion. I’m fact is probably give bowsers fury a 10 on its own. I think the base game has problems such as it’s locked camera, inconsistent design and style, and a few strange design choices. It lacks the story of Odyssey or Galaxy as well. It’s fun, and is easily the most fun co-op Mario experience you can have especially with four friends. I totally recommend picking this one up!. an incredible and amazing gameplay with so many good moves. i love it so much. Honestly, this is one of my favorite Mario games of all time. You got the timer, flagpole level design of a 2d Mario with the collectibles, movement, and exploration of 3d Mario. The multiplayer is enormously fun, and the game is filled to the brim with surprising and delightful ideas. It looks and sounds gorgeous as ever, and if you are craving a challenge by the end, buddy, try to beat Champion's Road. That **** is hard. Bowser's Fury was equally stuffed with wonderful surprises that I hope we get to see expanded even more in the future.. Two nice games in one package. First Super Mario 3D World which is reminiscent of the classic NES Mario games, a thing I like. Another plus is its variety of different level builds. Unfortunately suffers of controls a little imprecise, something unusual for a Mario game. 2D as 3D, 3D World is in between those two, even if it contains 3D in its name. Then Bowser's Fury where we find the usual controls of a 3D Mario. Great cinema this shorter game, with its beautiful graphics, epic music and some of its platforming demanding some skill. This package is surely a welcomed addition to my Switch collection, even if I still prefer Odyssey.. This was my first time playing Super Mario 3D World and it's an addictive platformer, so addictive that I started maxing it out. However, it was possible for me to reach the last level, but in the end I couldn't max it out. Nonetheless, great game with fun mechanics. It's challenging, but comfy and visually appealing. On the other hand I got Bowser's Fury, which exceed my expectations, it was something I would love for Nintendo to use as a stepping stone for creating the next thing in the franchise. It was nearly perfect, I loved looking for things and collecting it all (I played it near the release date, so right now I can't recall the name of the things there were to collect). Map was diverse and quite big for such a thing (not a full game). Gameplay was smooth and the usage of Bowser Junior was nice as well.. A very rare 10/10 but this game absolutely deserves it. I 100%ed the WiiU version back in 2015, but I chose to revisit this because my wife wanted a multiplayer game to play. The game is just as terrific as I remember, and the addition of Bowser's Fury is a nice extra treat. At its core, this is a 2D Mario platformer elongated and translated into the 3D space. It's got crazy power ups, tons of secrets, bonus worlds, fun as hell music, creativity dripping from every orifice (that's a horrible mental image why did I say that), really memorable levels, throwbacks to older Mario ****'s really all here. ...that being said Champion's Road is still a pain in my ass, lol. Super Mario 3D World is very enjoyable, I had a lot of fun playing through this game. Levels are really fun to run and jump around in and look awesome, most of them contain new elements and enemies the previous levels don't have, keeping things going and interesting. Collectibles are not hard to find and collect and are fun to search for. It's a shame that after beating the 8th world, the extra levels following up are pretty much nothing. They are only about the difficulty that quickly rises from that point onward. 9/10 Bowser's fury is a very fun game for Nintendo Switch newcomers and it contains two things at once: level structured islands and open world exploration. Once you finish a level (an island), new cat shines become available on it. Bowser's constant attacks are cool, BUT... the console itself has problems with running the game on 60 FPS. His fury blast makes the game run on like 30 FPS. It features lots of adorable kittens and good old friend Plessie and 100 cat shines to collect. The ending for 100% completion is very disappointing, though. 8/10 My verdict: a great experience, that everyone with a Nintendo Switch must play. Contains two great games with a lot going on. Bowser's Fury requires a lot of fixing.. A great value package. Your getting a glimpse into the future of Mario games. As well as, 2013's Super Mario 3D World included. A must buy for Nintendo Switch owners.. Great game! I didn't play ",3D world is a great game with an amazing soundtrack and fun gameplay . but when you add in a completely original take on the Mario games (Bowser's Fury) you get one of the greatest games on the switch .
418.Dark Souls,"One of the best games of all time hands down. I love how it lets you explore and find your way with very little hand holding. Go find your way and get killed in the process while learning the game.. Does anyone know how to wear a hippo? No, didn't think so. If you can't play this game you can't wear hippos and I love this game. (Help, I'm stuck under a hippo). one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life, the map is perfect, the **** of gwynevere PERFECT. disgustingly overrated. the movement is clunky, the bosses are bad, the second half of the game (and some part of the first half) is bad, build variety is limited, weapons and spells are unbalanced.. I think that no matter how soulslike it is with new innovative mechanics or interesting stories, none of them will be the same as the experience of Dark Souls I, it is a wonderful experience in every detail and if you love souls you will know that no matter how archaic it is, it is one of the best games in the genre.. One of the most important videogames in history that marked a change in the creativity of developers and in the approach of consumers, inventing a new genre that combines the complexity of hardcore RPGs with the intuitive dynamic mechanics of third-person action. The experience is set in a high-fantasy open map with large interconnected areas that transform the game map into a real dungeon, always difficult but always readable.. Played this and the dlc and boy oh boy!! The world design was top notch, with amazing soundtrack, amazing boss fights and all. This game performed beyond great for its time especially in terms of gameplay and combat perspective. Overall score a 10/10 and definitely in my top 5 of all time.. This is one of my favorite games of all time. It is just an absolute classic. The gameplay is punishing but fair, but I admit it took some getting used to. But if you can get used to the gameplay you are in for a treat. A beautiful world, amazing bosses, a super cool atmosphere and just an overall fantastic experience. The game has a reputation of being very hard. I don't think this is strictly merited. Yes the game is challenging, enemies and bosses do a lot of damage and are sometimes hard to read. But you as the player also do a lot of damage, and the challenge then becomes more about being careful and chosing a moment to strike. Another thing that makes the game hard are the cryptic, complicated systems with which you for example kindle bonfires and upgrade your weapons. Due to the games' complicated nature, I urge you not to hesitate to look things up online if you are struggling. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great world design, whimsical atmosphere, amazing boss fights and a story of thousand pages all in this quiet game that has made the biggest noise. The design of this game is nothing short of phenomenal.. This game is so overrated and it **** **** Old ass mechanics and boring start to finish … just some nerds overrating a shiit game. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. Few words define this work of art, but I just didn't give 10 due to the huge drop in FPS in some parts, but the levle design, boss fight's, etc. are sensational.. the game is a technological marvel for its time. if you were to judge it by that standard, its a 10/10. modern gameplay-wise it still holds up extremely well. My only real complaint is some large boss run-back times combined with gimmicky bosses that kill you in 1-2 shots. when the boss feels fair or you're able to do more attempts without 5 minutes running each time, it is usually very satisfying flow of gaming, otherwise it feels like a major reset simulator. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Anor londo, shall I say more? Okay fine, I guess the tutorial is pretty neat.. Good game overall with good story and gameplay mechanics and a lot different weapons and builds, summon mechanic allows for easier game especially with very difficult bosses like O&S, every boss is difficult on own,not every has it in their move set but in their areas.. Good game, but I died to the final boss one time and forgot to save, then it sent me to Dark Souls 3. My favourite game ever. Perfectly challenging and captivating, especially if you're happy to delve into best builds. The game doesn't offer help on this front, which is where the online community shines. Online play is fantastic.. One of my all time favorite games, I loved mostly every second I played. A lot of my deaths I say were my fault, there were a few times I died and was like 'how was I supposed to avoid that' or 'was I supposed to expect that?'. There is also a lot of framerate drops in a few places, but the main places I see it is when you parry and do the parry move, I guess it has to do with the blood spray. So there are problems with it, but overall still good. One of my favorite parts is how you open paths to earlier parts, like when you get to (spoilers I guess, but this game's old.) the bridge with the dragon and you get to the stairs on the side of the bridge and find the ladder that you kick down and it leads to the bonfire earlier in the Undead Burg. I haven't played 2 or 3 yet, but this game has some problems that I hope they fix. But overall great game.. Out of all three Dark Souls games, the original is the worst. It has the worst game design, worst mechanics, worst bosses and is by far the most tedious. Having said that, it is still a good game worth your time.. Most 'video-essayed' game of all time. For me, the brilliance of the Dark Souls is not about the difficulty. It's not about the mechanics, it's not about the (grossly beautiful) world. It's about the experience that you, as a person, can do everything. You just need time.. One of Dark Souls' most glaring issues is its relentless difficulty, which often feels more like a cheap means of extending gameplay than a thoughtful design choice. The game's punishing combat mechanics, coupled with relentless enemy aggression, create an environment where progress is more dependent on trial-and-error than genuine skill. The steep learning curve and unforgiving nature can be alienating to players seeking an enjoyable and accessible gaming experience.. best game of all time. Masterpiece! The level of immersion you get in this game is unreal, the atmosphere is the strongest in the series imo. And the lore is sooo good! Best Dark Souls game imo and it’s not even close.. One of the most influential games of all time. A timeless RPG that has set a standard many games try (and fail) to replicate. Play it!. What is there to say about Dark Souls that hasn't been said already? Though not first of its kind, that goes to Demon's Souls, Dark Souls spawned a subgenre known as ""Soulslike"". This game is an absolute classic that changed gaming completely.. An Absolute Classic.. An absolute classic. This game changed gaming for me and sent me down a path that I would never return from. Genuinely brilliant and innovative. Deep and engrossing. And the greatest map ever made in a video game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The level design was one of the best ever made, the game felt amazing and the gameplay was fantastic. I played this probably 10 years too late and it still felt monumental and like it was a top 20 game of all time.. This is a great game, was the easiest souls game of the series until I played Elden Ring and Dark Souls 2. The game play can take some getting used to but the fun thing about it is you can play any way you want. This games level design is magnificent and gives the player the freedom to choose whatever direction they want to go in. The story in this game is rewarded to players willing to explore and look for it. The bosses are cool and most boss fights are fair except for one very frustrating one. Overall, it's a great game that is shaped by how people choose to play it.. an absolute classic, the horrific post-apocalyptic medieval world is perfectly built the combat system is addicting, and the variety of playstyles is immense the first half of this game is without a doubt one of the greatest videogame sequences of all time, and then lacks a bit on the second half, being the the sometimes very very questionable game design of that sequence the only reason its not a solid 10. Picked up dark souls for the 360 as my first souls game, and what a great game it was. It has some rough edges compared to the later entries in the series, but is still a great game with its magnificent world design, and the ability to actually make you feel proud of yourself for overcoming the game. One of the best games ive ever played. My Introduction into the souls series and I played it in its prime from 2011 and 2012. Never before had a game given me such a challenge. It has the best characters out of any souls game. Although I prefer 2 over this it is because I prefered ds2s dark and gritty tone to Dark Souls 1s. The Multiplayer is the worst of the series with all the backstab fishing and parry baiters. The Story and its lore however is Legendary and it deserves its roses for being the father of the Dark Souls series. Also Manus I hate you.. A true masterpiece that popularized the Soulsborne series. If you have not played this game, buy and play it immediately. A must-have for every video game consumer.. The masterpiece of the 360/PS3 generation. This game is one of the greatest video games of all time. From the level design to the combat it was revolutionary and brilliant. Even playing it now in 2022 you can still see how it effected the RPG genre and enjoy it. It has incredible replay ability. Each class offers a unique play through that will make you play differently and even encounter new characters and lore. Each weapon also adds so much variety. In fact you could probably play this game through with a new weapon on each time through and the game feel new and different. The bosses are obviously amazing and the lore and world building are top notch. The games atmosphere is unmatched as well even all these years later. You feel the weight and dread, the highs let you feel a glimmer of hope only to take you down to the dark again. The difficulty is fair yet challenging. If you are constantly dying it is because you haven’t learned the mechanics or you lack patience. This game never holds your hand and it makes you rely on dialogue, environmental storytelling and remembering where you have been in order to navigate well and not lose your way. This game is not for the person who loves quest makers or fast pace shooters or quick games you can hop in and out of. I recommend this game to anyone who loves gaming, RPGs, or fantasy worlds. 10/10! P.S. When I read bad reviews for this game it only communicates to me that someone just didn’t get it.. It was elected the best game of all time for a reason. The best gameplay that you can find is right here.. Oh Dark souls. A shop employee told me it was like Skyrim on steroids and I wouldn't enjoy it. The gauntlet was thrown down that day. (2011) Still one of my top games all these years later.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dark Souls 1 is a flawed masterpiece for sure. It has its annoying parts, has its parts that feel rushed (Lost Izalith) and needed some polishing (i.e. framerate in Blight Town). But despite all flaws, it strikes with charm, satisfying combat and upgrading, great level up system and awesome boss fights (for the most part, not so much for the Demon Centipede for example, holy hell). I have played this game over 24 times I believe and put hundreds of hours into it, offline. That is enough proof for me to say that its my most favorite game of all time at this date. Its nature allows a lot of variety in playthroughs so you can challenge yourself one more unique time. Surely to be recommended, its my top 1 game in general. Only giving it a 9/10 because 9.5 is not possible and saying its 10/10, meaning perfect, would contradict my criticism above.. (PTDE review) One of the best games I've ever played. It's not for everyone, but everyone should have tried it once in their life. It's certainly hard, but not unfair. Lack of polish in late-game and obvious development constraints keep it from a full score. Also, if you get frustrated quickly and don't like to find the path for yourself, you will not enjoy it as much.. This game is by far my favorite game. That I've literally ever played. Everything about it is just incredibly well done. Well, except for the Witch of Izalith fight. I love it when videogames fully utilize the uniqueness of this method of storytelling, and that's something Dark Souls does like few others have. Some of the story is told to the player directly, some of it is hidden in the descriptions of items, and some of it you can figure out by interacting with the world, walking around, and being incredibly observant; inferring things about past wars based on where the corpses of certain characters are and whatnot. And it's really not just useless 'lore.' It really is such a fully fleshed out story. The atmosphere is another just incredibly well done aspect. Everything comes together to make this incredibly gritty and morose high-fantasy setting. The level design is truly impeccable. No other video game comes close; not even other FromSoft games can compare to the expertly designed areas here. The difficulty is undeniably one of the most iconic aspects. Yes, it's hard, but after each defeat, you fell like you've genuinely learned and that you can really do it if you just keep trying. Just a great game. Absolutely get it if you're interested in high-fantasy stories and you don't mind learning how to 'git gud.'. Gameplay..........Good. Graphics............Mediocre. Score.................Amazing.. Poorly optimised and wacky, but hey it's dark souls and it's awesome. Memorable locations and bosses. Great world and unique storytelling.. One of the best rpg if not the best, great characters, a creative map and a unimprovable gameplay, prepare to die. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 10/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 10/10 This game and the SoulsBorne franchise have ruined gaming for me. I am addicted to these games. Nothing else has nailed the a balanced in game difficulty like this. It took me a while to get into the swing of it and of course rage quit 1000 times, but there is no equivalent in gaming to beating a section of Dark Souls after struggling on it for so long. The map is incredibly intricate and linked together beautifully, and the areas are impressively varied and creative. I love Dark Souls.. Absolutely horrendous frame rate. Some areas are borderline unplayable. Such a disgrace coming from the spiritual successor of Demons Souls. Not sure how this game is rated so high. Incredible game design, level design, amazing environmental story telling, deep lore, doesn’t cater to a wide audience, is still being talked about 9 years after it’s release, literally spawned a whole new sub-genre. In a sea of uninspired generic easy as **** games, dark souls stands out as not only an “unforgiving” game but a game that respects the player and doesn’t treat them like a **** idiot. In my opinion this is without a doubt the greatest game of all time.. This game is brutal, and it doesn't always feel fair. On the positive side, the lore of this game is gorgeous, and the interconnect map is awe-inspiring. On the negative side, DS1 is less polished and evenly-paced than its 2 sequels, and the design in certain areas is sometimes questionable. This game is 100x harder playing offline without a guide, and that's how I did it during my first run. Don't do this. Just play online. You get so many hints playing online. Many parts of this game are masochistically difficult but very rewarding once you figure them out. Enemies and environmental objects are specifically placed to cause maximal frustration. You can spend 5 minutes to reach a certain point, dodging dozens of attacks, only to die from a random giant pendulum that pops out of nowhere. You then reattempt it 20 more times, dying in the same spot every time. By the time you finally get past it a frustrating hour later, you only venture another minute further before some minion skeleton jumps out of nowhere and pushes you off a cliff. There is little consistency to figuring out the location of hidden walls, so you can spend an eternity wasting time swinging at every wall. If you want bleak and brutal, but fair, go play Dark Souls 3 or Hollow Knight. Save points/bonfires in DS 1 are extremely spread out. Everything in the world, especially the environment, wants to cheese you and can single-handedly do so on your first encounter with it. There's no teleportation between bonfires for most of the game. Many bosses are cheesy. Just stay away this game unless you're a masochist like me. Though after you've finally beaten it, it'll feel like you've spent an eternity living in its bleak, depressing world. You'll realize that you've become part of it, and it just won't let you go. You'll choose to linger around as a soulless Blade of the Darkmoon, punishing others who are just starting their journey ... others who are just like who you once were.. My many playthroughs of this game have proven to me, that videogames can be art. The world this game presents is one of immense detail and rich history and its a shame the casual player won't get to scratch the surface of what this game has to offer in terms of both story and gameplay. So much is left to the imagination as well as interpretation giving the player the ability to dwell in thought of what they just experienced. Everyone knows this series for its crushing difficulty as well as its iconic boss fights, this is for good reason since they definitely live up to the hype. The bulk of the difficulty faced is completely fair and it lets the player learn from their mistakes instead of holding their hand with trivial tutorials and easy modes. The glaring issue many others and I face regards the level/boss design of certain areas of the game but outside of that this game is a true masterpiece that any fan of video games should experience at least once.. My favorite game of all time what else can I say its just perfect as a game. my favorite game of all time. yeah, it's difficult, but it's one of the best slices of media i've ever consumed.... Dark Souls is a tense inch by inch death fest where the idea of self preservation becomes a fond memory of other games you have played. You play this game to die over and over and over and than you go to sleep haunted by how to get past the thing that is currently killing you. Leveling up and item upgrading have never felt so useless, as you just continue to die over and over and over. I can picture right now the thing I'm trying to get past and I haven't played the game in months. This type of game is not for me, I feel like half the time i'm fighting enemies, and the other half I'm fighting the camera and the controls. What they have is a slow moving, grainy looking, repeat every area a dozen times game that hides all of this by appealing to our inner desire to win at any cost. All this game has going for it is gameplay time and bragging rights, everything else is just there to kill you. You don't enjoy playing this game, you take pleasure in beating it. You get there angry and frustrated and turn off the game exhausted and beaten down. Not how I like to leave a game, not a game I enjoyed. UPDATE years later: This is one of the best games I have ever played. As you can see from my review above, it beat me down. I set it aside, and came back to it a couple of years later, and this time I pushed through the learning curve and the deaths and the frustrations. What I found was a rich, beautiful, incredible game that I have now played numerous times with several characters. It is incredible and if you can get into the headspace where you expect to learn through dying, this game will reward you.. From software are the worst company ever. They make poor games amp the difficulty because they know people will eat it up. Your not good for beating this game. You need a life. Hated this game and anything else theyve done. Fix your games from. A hack n slash game that actually provides a challenge unlike many of the others.. as a guy who first played dark souls waaay late in its cycle and thus, i heard a lot of the talk about it, the first thing i MUST state is that this game is, in NO way, a rpg. anybody referring to it (so-called pro reviewers, for example) as such is naively and blatantly incorrect. this is a simple, basic dungeon crawler where you get to choose weapons and gear and fight. THAT'S IT. secondly, all i ever heard about this game was the debate between how hard it is and whether or not that difficulty was cheap or not. first, this game is hard ONLY IF you aren't able to comprehend enemy tactics. it is inherently dejavu-memorization combat. PERIOD. and, yes, the game purposefully puts you in at a disadvantage. ie. yes, there are cheap deaths. and, they are galore. THIRD -- yes, yes, this game is EASY EASY once you know its mechanics, tricks, tactics, and, it's your second playthrough. PERIOD. i can't EMPHASIZE this more- do not CHEAT on your first time through this game. you MUST play it organically. why? cuz the second and tenth playthru's will NEVER be the same since you know the game *yes, one can cheat in single-player games. obviously* the game has its share of issues but is clearly a masterpiece. when you first set foot in it there is amazement and questioning and intrigue for this superbly unique game screw-up and die and try again. and, realize that this game hinges on your ability to watch and comprehend and learn. the game is littered with poor gameplay and mechanics, yet, it is an experience like no other. what i know is that dark souls is one of the most UNIQUE games i've ever played. there is no doubt that it's so-called ""difficulty"" is a sham and can be debated away with ease. there's no doubt that this is NOT a rpg. this game is purposefully repetitive. the ""story and lore"" that fanboys try to prop-up is still relatively nil. AND, your second play-through will NEVER be the same as the first. nevertheless, this is an instant classic and one of the greatest Unique games of all-time: tho, overall, its simply a great game. Best game ever made. Anyone who actually gets to the end of the game or at least halfway through falls in love with it. The people who don't like it are those that gave up on it too early. No one likes this game right away. Just like the first time you took a sip of your daddy's beer. Grow up and drink the effing beer or shut up.. Dark Souls is not just a game, but an entire experience. Dark Soul is not your average RPG, where you grind your character untill you can destroy the world, but you as a player grow to master the mechanics as a whole. Levels matter here, but your handle of the game matter the most. The melancholic atmosphere and great narrative choices made this game an unforgettable experience for me, and everyone who likes RPGs should play it.. A master piece. This game treats gamers like actual grown people, it doesn't treat you like you're stupid. Perfect combat, interesting lore, epic bosses, beautiful art... Not recommended for wimpy people ;). Fun if you are good. There is a lot more to the game than being hard. But if you can't get past the first undead areas, then this game will be terrible 4 u. I love it for it's amazing combat, amazing visuals, the soul system, and the difficulty. (which is fair btw) If u play it smart u won't die. While this game does have quite a few frustrating areas, the way that it is burned into my memory shows just how, well, memorable it is.. Probably the worst game I have ever bought. Game was fun for a short while when I fought common enemies and discovered new things but quickly became a nightmare when I encountered bosses. To say they are very unfair is an understatement. Avoid this overhyped game at all costs.. As everyone and their grandmother has probably recognized by now, Dark Souls is a legendary game franchise. This entry in the series is the one that many people see as the pinnacle of that experience - I think this is a prime example of nostalgia blindness, but am willing to validate the multiple things this game gets right. Dark Souls is a game in which you really must earn everything. It also tells you very little about what you need to do - some will adore this lack of forced direction, while others will be enraged by it. Additionally, the game has a phenomenally high learning curve that is rewarding to overcome, but hell to try and manage in the beginning (or at least, it was for me). This approach to game design is truly love-it-or-hate-it, with most players falling into the 'love it' category, if its rabid cult following is to be believes (key word being 'cult' - ergo 'niche'). While Dark Souls is a great game with many environments that are undeniably beautiful and impressive, some areas of this game (and some of its bosses) present a kind of frustration that is incredibly off-putting and alienating. Specific examples include: The framerate-killing Blighttown; the visually staggering brightness of Lost Izalith (and its utterly infuriating puzzle-style boss, the Bed of Chaos); the egregiously dark and overwhelmingly difficult Tomb of the Giants; and the ragequit-inducing battle against the camera that is the Capra Demon boss fight (which invites cheesing the boss instead of fighting it). Despite being what I would call 'unrefined,' Dark Souls' interconnectivity between its areas, its challenging but rewarding combat, its vicious bosses and its overall artistic design are absolutely enthralling. The game has such a storied status in the video gaming world for a reason despite its flaws.. I dropped this game at first but later came back and beat it and now i regularly come back to beat it again.. As everyone knows, Dark Souls brings a totally different proposal comparing any other game for its generation, bringing challenging that is too much missed in any other videogame. But the PC version is too much better than consoles. Computer version has been enhanced about playabiliy and few about graphics. The game, not being hard enough, its simply unplayable in X360 because of difficulty of moving character and rolling on the combats. To play this worthwhile game, come and buy the PC ""Prepare to Die"" or ""Remastered"" versions instead of console's common.. Perfect game, is not hard but exigent, the game only gives you the bases of how to play and the rest of the game you will have to discover it on your own in a wide world without restrictions. At first I really liked this game but the more I played it got less and less interesting. The setting and the difficulty of the game was really appealing. But the more I played it started to feel very repetitive. .Sure the game got different environments and enemies. But the overall gameplay and combat became stale and repetitive. And after a few hours of gameplay new bosses didn’t seem interesting to me and the magic that had hooked me to the game wore off. If I could have stayed as interested as I was at the start throughout the whole game I would give this game a very high score. But that was not the case. But at the same time I can understand why others would love this game. Tough in the end it was not for me.. I really hate useless _/10 scores, but this platform forces one, so wait until the end for a recommendation on how much you should buy it for, as I feel it to be a more accurate representation of whether the game is, you know... worth it. Dark Souls is an Action RPG by From Software. Dark Souls is a game I enjoy quite a bit, and I'm going to spend the bulk of this review talking about why, and what gave me pause even in my blind admiration. First off, the sound design on the whole thing is wonderful, from satisfying sound effects to amazingly orchestrated boss themes, the game excels in its sound design. Graphical design is the first thing I start to have a bit of a problem with. The game looks great for the most part, but some things are just hard to get over. The lava in the game quite literally hurts to look at, some of the backdrops aren't even slightly worked on (though others are to excess) and, one thing I really can't get over: there are some spots that are straight up unfinished. The stairs into the Lower Undead Burg straight up don't have anything to the left of them, just a gaping, lazy hole. Now, story wise, Dark Souls can't be touched. it's told through item descriptions and optional character dialogue, with very little laid out for you. This allows you to piece together an expansive and complete world. The gamplay is where this series shines, however. Rolling is responsive, blocking is responsive, combat is calculated but an adrenaline rush all the same. Some of the bosses, like Orenstien and Smough, are some of the best in all of gaming. However, other bosses, like the Bed of Chaos, are inexcusable, awful bits of the game I wish I could just skip. So, is the game worth it? YES! Get it now! at its current 20$ price point (For both the game and it's DLC.) it's a steal. Definitely one of my all time favorites.. This game is a flawed masterpiece. Some areas are the best designed ever in videogame history and some of the later ones are just flat out bad. But the game is great anyway. The combat system, the lore, the setting and mood of the game are on point. The DLC is one of the best i've ever played. Both because it encreases the challenge and because it has some of the best boss fights of the whole game. Buy it with any doubt if you still haven't. I'm giving a 10/10 even if it isn't perfect. It has both problems regarding fps issues and game design ones imo. Nonetheless is one of my favourite games.. My first experience with Dark Souls was crazy. I got the game extremely cheap off the Xbox marketplace back in 2012. I played it and turned it off 20 minutes later and didn't touch it for another few months. I again give it a second chance. I play for longer this time, making it to Blighttown and again giving up and restarting my save only to get there again and giving up once again. almost an entire year passes and I give it 1 more chance and I'm glad I did. I went in with a fresh save and a fresh mind. I took every bit of detail this game had to offer and stopped trying to have a perfect save and not to worry if I couldn't make it to my souls after dying. Since then, I have beat the game 4 times and currently playing my 5th play through, i can safely say that Dark Souls is one of the best games ever made. I have played this game a lot and I always find something new every time I play and I can't say the same for other games. I don't want to get into detail on why this game is so good but I am still unsure whether this g","""dark souls"" is one of the best games of all time hands down . the map is perfect, the **** of gwynevere PERFECT. disgustingly overrated . overall score a 10/10 and definitely in my top 5 of all time ."
42.The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / Four Swords,"It wasnt bad, but i expected more, the other 2d zelda games are much better in my opinion. Yes, I completed the game 100% and it is really worth playing, I only deducted 1 point for 1 reason, when you die in the game (unless you are hiding a fairy in the magic bottle) it throws you back a lot, for example I was very close to killing the crystal boss and I died and it threw me to the entrance of the dungeon, it was really annoying, other than that the music, story and items of the game are really beautiful and well thought out.. Undoubtedly the greatest game of all time. It not only redefined the concept of gaming but remains unmatched in atmosphere, aesthetics, and innovation.. Not as good as Ocarina but better than most other Zelda games including the ones on Switch.. I havent played four swords since I only have one gba, but replaying alttp was fun. One of the best games the SNES has to offer, now only even better on GBA with the addition of Four Swords. The game measures a good balance between the openness and exploration of the first LoZ game while also offering just enough direction to make the game more approachable. The world is full of useful items, collectibles and other secrets to discover, and dungeons are similarly well designed. The nonlinearity of the dungeon order is mostly a positive too. While it does unfortunately limit the dungeons more than other Zelda games due to being needed to be completed in a wide variety of orders and can't utilize items from other dungeons, the replay value and freedom this offers to the player makes those limitations worth it, especially when the dungeons are brilliantly laid out regardless. Sprite quality is very visually appealing and the soundtrack and sound design are great and one of the most important in relation to the LoZ series. While I don't think this game has of high of highs as some other amazing Zelda games, there's also not much bad you can say about it. My only real criticism might be the combat which can be pretty limited, but its also not the focus of the game and holds up well enough due to not being at the forefront of the player's challenges.. Simply a wonderful game. I think this title still holds up today. This was the first Zelda game I ever played and is also one of my favorites.. I played it like 50 times when i was a **** was one of my first games on consol at that time.I played it on Super **** me its the best Zelda game of all time.. The snes game ist better, but it ist my favorit zelda game of all time. Must play. An excellent game will be excellent no matter when you play it, and it is the one.. It is easily the best Zelda game, great dungeons good pacing, great exploration, good story and timeless graphics. No modern Zelda game can reach this Masterpiece. This is the best game ever. The gameplay is just amazing and amazing. The story is long and very well told. The world is just huge and full of secrets. The feeling of discovering so many caves, secrets and unveiling a world that feels like a huge living world is incredible. The dungeons are long and fun. Weapons, settings, bosses. It's all fun and the difficulty is very well balanced. Don't buy TOTK. Instead, play The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past.. Four Swords is unfortunately a multi-player only game, but the inclusion of SNES classic Link To The Past still makes this a worthy purchase for the single player.. A super complete Zelda game with everything you expect: open world, lots of dungeons, lots if items and mechanics, lots of puzzles, lots of NPCs and side quests. Difficulty slightly higher than in other Zeldas. The main issue, and it's a BIG one, is the randomness of everything. There are almost no clues, no indications. You need to guess all the time. The items are super hidden, even the key ones. How are you supposed to know that for access a dungeon or beat a boss you need an special item you never seen, that's in the opoosite side of the map, in a hidden cave, under a random rock if nobody is pointing you there. This happens all the time and results in making the game harder if you don't find something useful or simply frustrating if you NEED something that you have no way to know where is. Same happens with many enemies that you need to test every single weapon/magic you have to guess how to kill it. In case it's not inmortal or you need something you didn't find yet. The combat is greatly affected by the non responsive directional controls, terrible hit box and annoying knockback.. Great Classic and an Amazing Zelda. This is really the best way to do a 2D Zelda, and i would be very happy if they make a remake of this game. The game is great. Compared to it’s remake, Link Between Worlds, the dungeons are more challenging (by Zelda standards) but the puzzles are simpler. It’s a shame that bonus dungeon is locked behind multiplayer content (Four Swords), which I haven’t played.. Its the second best snes game besides earthbound. Its It's nowhere near the pinnacle of the series, but its great. The combat is as complex as it needs to be, the music on display is great here, and its fulfilling in length. Its pretty hard too! It may not be perfect, because some of the bosses are annoying, dungeons can be too convoluted. Bit despite its age, its worth coming back to. One of my favorite games of all time. It hasn't aged at all. Play it so you can appreciate all those innovations this game introduced to the series and gaming in general.. The best 2D Zelda ever made and the first legend of Zelda game I ever played! There may be some problems but nothing is perfect well except for ocerana of time. The best super nintendo game in my opinion A Link The Past is an amazing zelda that brings an excellent story to its time with dungeons and impressive items. This game is good, but it is very dated. The game design is solid, with clever puzzles, solid (if not simple) combat, and a pretty pixel-art world to discover. Secrets are abundant and make you feel like a genius every time you prod at something suspicious or engage in a bit of outside-of-the box thinking. However, there are progression points that are incredibly unintuitive, and I feel demand outside help or previous knowledge of the game. The game has a hint system using fortune tellers, but it is terrible and almost never provides you the information actually necessary to progress. This happened to me on 4 occasions, and I wasted hours of my time trying to figure them out on my own, only to defeatedly look it up and find a solution that I never would have found. An example of this is the part of the game where you buy the flippers. The hint in game says something along the lines of ""go to lake area and find a Zora"". I do this and scour the entire area multiple times, only finding dead ends and look it up online. Turns out in one of the dead ends you have to stand in front of a waterfall in a specific place for the Zora to appear. Design like this is fine for 2002, today its just annoying. The music in this game is decent, but is sorely lacking for a Zelda game. If the hint system actually worked my score would probably be at an 8-9, but a game that requires you to look things up to beat it is a flawed game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Masterpiece. It's what gave us everything Zelda is today. I highly recommend you to play this.. I really enjoy this classic originally made for the Super Nintendo gaming console. It was completely awesome back in the day and is still a very good Zelda game. Sure, the dungeons in this one can get difficult, but not like the ones in today's Zelda games where some sort of strategy guide is almost a necessity if you want to make it through it in minimal time. This one has the classic top down view that was first seen in the very first Zelda game. It also incorporates more role playing game elements that were more prevalent in the second Zelda games because you get to talk to more people and do a few side quests. So it is a bit of a combination of the two games and together they fuse together to form one of the best Zelda adventure games! The story starts before you even start the game as you learn of a wizard who is seeking the descendants of some wise men who had to seal away a powerful artifact known as the Triforce. We start the game with Link being told by his uncle to stay put as he has an errand to run and that lasts only mere moments as Link almost immediately follows his uncle and finds himself holding his uncle's sword and trying to find Princess Zelda. He does and manages to free her and hide her in a sanctuary where an old man tells Link that the only way to defeat the wizard who has taken control of the castle is by retrieving the master sword. Soon Link must find another old man who is also a descendant and soon he learns he must find three pendants before he can get the sword that can reflect back the evil spells hurled by the wizard. However, this is only the beginning as Link will be hurled into another realm that mirrors the land he knows, but it is twisted and he will also soon learn of a foe more powerful than the wizard, Ganon! The game play is more like the fist Zelda in that the screen is top down perspective. I like this view and wish they would make more games in this more simplistic style. I would love a Zelda or another role playing game that had a more 16-bit era look to it and just make it so it goes on longer than ever thought imagined back in the day. The combat is simple as it is mainly using your sword or bow and arrow to topple foes, Link does not have to many special techniques, but the ones he does possess makes him a formidable enough opponent for the many monsters and soldiers in Hyrule and the dark world. There are a few mini games in the one town that resides in both worlds and there are other people you can find to gain more equipment and abilities to help you in your quest to stop Ganon. Like nearly every Zelda game, you must progress through a number of dungeons and gain their special item and destroy the boss to make it through the game. In this one you get quite a few dungeons, I believe around 12 or so, each with a different theme. Some of them are rather long, but none of them are going to be as difficult as the water temple in Ocarina of Time. So, in the end, a very good Zelda game...though, not sure why they even bother to put her in the title in this one as she makes minimal impact. I guess at this point they knew that her name was the more recognizable, but seriously she is not really in this game much at all. The fighting here is simplistic and the graphics would be considered to be prehistoric to most people nowadays, but to me it still has a certain charm to it and still looks good for what it is. Graphics back in the day were more of an art form, while today they are more about make the most realistic looking characters and places as possible. So, if you can track down the game, it is still a fun diversion and quite frankly should not be that hard to track down as one can download it using many different forums, or you could just dust off your Super Nintendo if you still have on and play it old school style.. Probably the game I played the most on the Game Boy Advance. love playing it play, glad it made it to the switch online.. I hadn't played this game in over 15 years so figured I'd give it a go. I recall not liking it as much as other Zelda games, but figured **** I now remember why I've never replayed it. It's a mess. The sword's animation and hitbox are rarely on the same page, and are also inconsistently off. The same exact attack timing, distance, and enemy location and animation status will sometimes result in a hit but also sometimes not. It makes the game extremely frustrating to play when you're taking hits you shouldn't be taking, especially when hearts are so rare and enemies often do 2-3 hearts of damage. Every other 2D zelda plays much better. Even when playing the NES ones, if you get hit, it'll feel like you deserved it. Positives: Graphics, world and dungeon design and themes, and music is pretty good, though only having one dungeon theme hurts it. I believe this to be the greatest game ever made. It's pure fun. The exploration is engaging & rewarding, the dungeons are fair but challenging. This is a staple of game design - there is a reason it was the template for Zelda games for the next 20+ years.. The best game in the Zelda franchise. The atmosphere and game-play combined with brilliant puzzles and dungeons makes this one of my favorite action adventure games ever made.. This game is definitely my all time favourite game. This game has secrets hidden in every corner of the map and its combat is challenging. Completing it felt like I had just saved the world.. Good - The animations and overall graphics detail is amazing - the world is immense for SNES game. - dungeon design is very impressive. Puzzles are deep and reasonably challenging. - controls are crisp. Upgrades are cool and fun to use. Bad - the sword hitbox doesn't exactly match the animation. - moon pearl, a required item should not be missable, but it is. I was going in circles wondering where to find it. Turned out to be in a chest in a previous dungeon. - the game doesn't tell me that there are other ways to enter the dark world after beating the dark palace. This causes me to try and enter through the mountain pad entrance and try and find a way off the mountain, which was not possible - swamp palace. How am I supposed to know I'm supposed to randomly walk into a waterfall? 6 waterfalls that look identical. I'm supposed to walk through - I wish locked doors would be marked. And chests would be marked. - no hints were given that i had to use the fire rod to burn the entrance of the dark temple. The skull shows no indication that it could be burned. - Titan's mitts is missable in gargoyle palace, which is required to get into ice palace. Meaning I was completely stuck not knowing what I needed, until I refer to a guide. - game forces player to explore every nook and cranny to get potentially required items - quake medallion is required to reach final dungeon but it's missable. And I have to somehow know the order to hit the pikes to open the warp to dark world for last dungeon. - the game forces you to explore and do random quests to acquire required upgrades like silver Arrow to beat Ganon. I don't like how these important things are missable. - no price tag for super bomb. How am I supposed to know how much rupees to collect?. Definitely has not aged well. The first half of the game is pretty ok, nothing too special however. The dungeons are pretty simple, but inoffensive, I was waiting for the more interesting dungeons to come later. However what I got later was the Ice Palace, and Turtle rock. Not bad dungeons puzzle wise, in fact the Ice Palace in particular has a very nice puzzle near to the end. However what makes this dungeon unbearable is the ice physics, mixed with enemy spam. That's this ganes idea of difficulty, just putting too many enemies on screen. Both of these dungeons have boss rooms you can't leave, and you need magic to defeat them. If you're out of magic, you're out of luck. Its simply a frustrating mess in the endgame, and an inoffensive, but nothing special early and mid game. Links Awakening on the GameBoy is better than this.. I just started the Zelda series, I had a hard time in the first 2 games and couldn't finish it. But I was able to finish this game finally. First of all, it is an incredible quality game for its year. There is a revolutionary improvement compared to the previous 2 games. Excellent pixel art. Musics. Level design. It's a beautiful world to explore. Various characters. Various items and spells. Nice puzzles. Everything is as it should be. But.. man, this game is so hard. First of all, combat is brutal. If you are playing for the first time like me, you will die a lot. Yes, you will be very angry. I said I finished the game but not alone, stuck in 2-3 places too much. I spent a day trying to find it. I finally gave up and had to look for the solution from the forums. I wish it was a little easier, aside from combat, it is very complicated to find the necessary items.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A flawless example of less is more. A textbook Zelda adventure on a mobile console, and a must own game.. very relaxing zelda game. combat is easy so far and it runs smoothly on my switch. very good.. Link to the Past hasn't aged very well. This is still a good game, except that it is too outdated to compete with other newer Zelda games such as Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild, or even Ocarina of Time. It's soundtrack although having some nice tracks, is hard to listen to due to the technical limitations of the SNES and GBA. There are also way too many caves, in which. Lovely RPG game, one of the best in the GBA world, I grew up playing it a lot alongside Pokémon, Golden sun, super Mario, sonic etc.. Best game ever made. As Metacritic ignores old systems I must start by saying I only played this on the SNES. I don't know if playing handheld takes away from the atmosphere but I can't understand why some have put low scores. Zelda 1, for its day was brilliant but held back by hardware. Link to the Past is amazing in every way. I agree with the person that said it got a bit hard. I was never great at gaming and found it hard but it was still amazing. The graphics, gameplay and music just gel and compliment each other perfectly. I played this when I was young but I'm not nostalgic about things. Of all things I liked as a kid only two feel the same now. A Link to the Past and The Mysterious Cities of Gold Season 1. When I play this now I find the sound more fitting and captures the mood more than any game I've played. If you are into RPG's you probably won't like this game. If you like action adventure puzzle games then this is top of the class. I think this smashes Ocarina. It controls nicer than 3D, the textures in some of the 3D games look like washed out mud. I prefer games that are enjoyable without finger gymnastics, so if you need to be doing finger gymnastics to enjoy a game this also won't be for you. To sum it up it is a puzzle game beautifully balanced with atmosphere and action. Update: and it pisses all over Breath of the Wild.. A masterpiece for its time -SNES or GBA version - i loved it - the story the dungeons- many items that we can acquire - the first Zelda that i played.. Even in 2020 it would be a masterpiece. And it was released in 1991! Should I say more.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. terrible hit box, you only swing on one side of your body, if enemies are circling you you have to wait for them to get to the right side of your body. You can die real quick, and save spots are very far and few between. Disappointing uninspired boss fights as well. Its just frustrating. The whole dark world thing is super overrated as well, oh boy! You turned into a pink rabbit! Isn't that trippy? Its soooo cheesy and uninspired, and does not belong in Zelda.. Legend of Zelda a link to the past is one of my favorite games of all time because of its amazing art style that even coming out many years ago still holds up to this day. Also another reason why it is such a great game is the gameplay with its tough dungeons and bosses and it many secrets, but a other great thing about this game is the music. The music in this game is one of the the best soundtrack in all the legend of Zelda games and in all games, with music that is still being used in the latest games. It's fun. The back and forth thru dark and light worlds reminds me of ovarian of time. The story is basic but gameplay is great.. It's no surprise that this game has mostly positive reviews since this the game that first develop the legend of zelda formula. i spend 25 hours to finish the game and 100 percent it and it's quite a hard game right after you reach the dark world, enemies start doing double or triple the damage and bosses are way harder. i manged to die quite a lot in this game but i will still recommend it to play on the switch or wii shop, i don't know if it's on the wii u.. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a masterpiece ****, almost everything about this game is amazing. Out of all the Zelda games i've played it has had the best dungeons, the only 2 dungeons that i genuinely disliked were Skull Woods and Theives Town, other than those two the rest of them are amazing and unique. This games bosses are also amazing, all of them are icredibly unique, most of them are challenging, but most importantly, they are all fun. The gameplay itself is also really good, most of the time the combat is fair but isn't as good as some of the 3D Zelda games in my opinion. Where the gameplay shines the most in my opinion are the puzzles and items, none of the puzzles are unfair and most of them are not as cryptic or repetitive as the first 2 games. Most of them are fun, the only ones i disliked are the ones that are timed. The items in this game are each very fun to use, whether it's turning anti-fairies into fairies with magic powder or using the mirror to travel from the dark world back to the light world. Also, the boomerang in this game is so broken, it makes this game so much easier, so make sure to spam it. The story in this game is great, but that's all i am going to say. I won't spoil anything, go buy this game if you haven't already. This game is easily the best GBA game i have ever played, it's a strong 10/10 and a must own if you have a GBA or a SNES and if you don't have a GBA or a SNES then go buy one and buy this game. It's not the best game ever, but it's currently in my top 5. Now, about Four Swords.. i haven't played it because i can't, i'm sure it's good but i don't have any friends that own this game, let alone 3.. My first game in the series and one of the best 2D zeldas next to the Seasons in my opinion. Essential.. The very best game on the SNES and one of the best of the Zelda series. Getting new items felt immensely good and keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting. The dungeons had so many difficult puzzles and challenges but accomplishing them and figuring out the solutions brought out a great feeling of satisfaction. The world was fun to explore as well, with surprises and secrets lurking around every corner. It's a game you'll find yourself spending hours on at a time, and will give you a feeling of joy you can't experience on any other game.. This game is simply a masterpiece. Every person should watch or play this game thru.. This game is an absolute must play for anybody who is a fan of puzzle and adventure games. It’s one of the best Zelda games out there and it is seriously unforgiving at first. I played it for the first time and died over 250 times but then I replayed it and only died 4 times. The bosses can be annoying at times (Moldorm) but all in all it’s an amazing game and I’d recommend it to anybody.. i have always been on team mario, and had only recently entered the world of Zelda through Breath of the Wild. I loved that game, so when the SNES game application made its way to the switch, i immediately started to play A Link to the Past. I wasn't disappointed. Everything about this games feels just right. The amount of dungeons will keep you satisfied, the gameplay is tight. The puzzles which come out of the gameplay and the world keep you engaged, and forces you to use your intuition and curiosity in using newly aquired items and obstacles in your way. The bosses also are good for what they are, and Gannon is a fantasic ending boss. The world is a great, interesting place with unique areas, and the characters and enemies have lots of charm. This game hasn't aged one bit, and visually the game looks stellar. Fantastic, and i recommend it fully. A link to the past, the perfect 2D Zelda, amazing controls, story, gameplay, ítems you have everything it can be considered the best game ever but Ocarina of time is as good so i dont know which one is better, but what i know is that is a masterpiece and a must play 10/10 obviously. One of the best games of all time in portable! The best top-down Zelda game ever made. Just keep in mind that the gameplay is not as easy as it looks. It really ""punishes"" you if you are not careful. A must-have and must-play for every gamer.. This is by far my favourite Zelda game and the game that got me into adventure and RPG style games. As a kid I loved playing it on the SNES and have revisited it on several occasions.. What Kind of Adventure? Action-Adventure Was it fun? This is a very enjoyable game, hands down my favorite Zelda game ever made. Are there any similar games? This is a video game series that really transformed the action-adventure genre. Its hard for me to pin point a game that its similar to. Favorite Character? There really isn’t a lot of character development in this game so I guess its going to have to be Link. Favorite World/Stage? If you want to be a technical ass, I guess its technically a “dungeon” but my favorite one is probably the Ice Palace. Its so cool and has penguin enemies, how is that not everyone’s favorite? Would you play it again? Yes this game has a lot replayable value. How many hours did you play it? As a kid, I would probably say its too long. But as an adult, I think its a great game. Its hard but I absolutely love playing it.. Though there are occasional annoying sections, well-made leveling and puzzles are really fun. If you love dot graphics, you will not be able to do this badly. The story is fairly poor, but it covers everything with game-play. It seems to be a complete version of shooting + puzzle + RPG.. The first game I ever truly hated. This delayed my becoming a Zelda fan for over a decade. I will never forgive it for that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing, a true classic. This game is one of the bes things that ever grazed the world of gaming. The Zelda series is truely amazing and which game is the best is up for debate but one thing is for certain, it's the Zelda game with the most replay value.. Im here to talk about SNES version. This game may be a little hard to play these days, becouse of its difficulty level and controls. But if you get into you will get game that introduced the classic Zelda formula that we all love today.. A Link to the Past hasn't aged very well. This is still a good game, except that it is too outdated to compete with other newer Zelda games such as Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild, or even Ocarina of Time. It's soundtrack although having some nice tracks, is hard to listen to due to the technical limitations of the SNES and GBA. There are also way too many caves, in which it is very easy to get lost and can become tedious and frustrating. The overworld is good and has many hidden secrets. Most of the dungeons are still pretty good, such as Swamp Palace or Misery Mire. However some dungeons are just awful, such as the Ice Palace, I have raged so much while playing through this dungeon, there are enemies everywhere and the slippery floor doesn't help the game's controls, definitely in my top 3 worst Zelda dungeons of all time. Turtle Rock and Eastern Palace are also pretty tedious and outdated. Overall this game is still a good game and hasn't aged as bad as Super Mario Bros 3, but it is not one of the best games out there anymore unfortunately. This is a game I can only recommend to hardcore Zelda or Retro gaming fans. I also recommend playing this game casually rather than intensely.. I say the GBA Remake of Link To The Past is one huge improvement over the SNES Version and here is why i think that: The Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past is not a game i say is 10/10 best game ever because every game has its flaws Sonic 06 is well Sonic 06 or how Metroid Fusion suffers from long intro the SNES original has more than a few it has around a dozen i will only name a couple so this doesn't drag on and on but i do think i should get on with it so first off one major problem is, Music the music on the original is good but adding sound effects of link talking is not needed it makes the game harder to play if your ears are THAT sensitive it doesn't affect the gameplay just wanted to point that out but i always see lots of people bashing this Remake for that reason its been in the series SINCE OCARINA OF TIME BUT NO ONE SAID THAT WAS A BAD THING just blah blah blah this isn't as grand as every makes it out to be. Really best Zelda 2D game. This game is awesome in various ways. I really loved the way who Nintendo get and sell for us gamers. First i have play it on SNES, after in GBA. And I really loved. Recomend.. Overrated AF. try playing this game after Ocarina of time. Good luck. Why do people love this game so much? It's unbearable, after finishing the opening in Hyrule castle I was so bored.. My favorite game of all time. This game came out on the Super Nintendo in 1991 and set the real standard for all future Zelda games. The very definition of MASTERPIECE!. There will be endless debates about which Zelda game is better, this or ocarina. For me, it's this. Its 2D action adventure perfection. Still to this day I dont think there's another 2D action adventure that's as good at this. The controls are perfect, the story is there if you want it (I've completed this game at least 10 times and still have never read the story, which says more about me than it does the game), the levels are amazing, and the bosses ramp up the stakes each time you meet one. It has an amazing inventory which rarely gets the praise it deserves contains some of the coolest weapons ever in video games. Screen clearing with that thunder medallion never gets boring. But it's music which cements it in my top two snes games of all time. The tunes that the composer squeezed out of the tiny little sound chip are amazing, far surpassing the work of entire orchestra's in many modern games. It won't ever be my favourite game on the snes, but it will always the best game on the snes.. Overall, an enjoyable, challenging experience. I enjoyed my time with this one, but it felt fairly brief and had its shortcomings. While it is still a fantastic game, I spent a fair amount of time grinding for Rupees or playing dungeons over and over on the ludicrous bosses (MOTHULA). While the game itself manages to show a strong adventure of a character, the adventure itself was short, and the final boss fell down easily. All in all, a good way to prepare yourself to the Zelda series, but by no means the greatest entry.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.].

420.Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2,"played and beat this game maybe 6 times Has really grown on me with a few memories of my buddy coming over to play love the idea to earn the chance to unlock a car soundtrack is memorable and Great tracks and scenery are awesome as well. A sequel to a PS1 game, ""Hot Pursuit 2"" is an exhilarating and addictive racer. It's one of the best entries in the series. The selection of cars is superb, the graphics are terrific and the sense of speed is awesome. Single player mode is divided into two campaigns: racing and chasing. As a cop, you're given tools to bring a stop to the race car drivers. And as a racer, you must outrun the police and win challenges. In addition to the single player mode, you can compete with fellow players in split-screen. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.7 out 10.. I loved this game for the time are best racing game Need for speed hot pursuit 2.

A wonderful game, the best part in the series so far. Simple, fun and a lengthy career mode (what does get a bit boring at a point, though). That's it.. This game is the epitome of classic Need for Speed games! Fancy cars: check. Exotic tracks: check. Extreme speed: check. Pissy cops: check. All that you need in a simple and straight forward package with a brilliant soundtrack. Pity the game came out the box at a 480i resolution. 720p or even 480p would've done it nicely.. This game is cool and it what made Blackbox an unforgettable development team.. the only cool thing about this game is the multiplayer, other than that the campaign is horrible. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 2 Gameplay : 7 Graphics : 10 Fun Factor : 8 Environment interaction : 4 Sound effects : 6 Overall Immersion : 7 There's no such thing as a perfect game. I remember being highly addicted to ""Hot Pursuit 2"". It's a fantastic racer featuring an amazing sense of speed, outstanding graphics and a great selection of cars. The game includes two sets of challenge modes; racing with a sports car or chasing in a cop vehicle. This is a better game than the ""Underground"" entries and Criterion's ""Hot Pursuit"" reboot. It's a pure joy to play. I'd rate it with an 8.7 out of 10. Decent racing game and awesome that they have a Rush song in it! I would say it's not one of the better games in it's genre for PS2 but you'll get some satisfying hours in playing it. Despite one big problem the game is great fun, especially because compared to many other games and the successors ""underground"" and ""underground 2"" you cannot stay on full throttle all the time. The biggest problem with the game: On the PS2, even though the gameplay is pretty fast, it feels somehow slow because the framerate is not at the standard I got used on the PS2 and the controller input is pretty delayed in responding to car steering. Especially when the screen is full and you do a hard curve, you have the impression the car reacts half a second after you start steering. The latter NFS games on the PS2 have the same problem, and I wonder why there is written so little about that. Maybe I am more sensitive to that problem? Anyway there is a lot of fun in racing over the different landscape tracks, chasing speeders or getting chased by the police, when you got used to the sometimes delayed controlls and the not very fluent framerate in the gameplay. What makes the game great anyway, besides the controll problem, is the real arcade game mechanics: You can enter a curve at top speed and spontaneously release the accelerator when you are too fast for the curve and step back on it when you feel that you get the curve and accelerate out of it. That is so much fun. Why do so few games integrate this game mechanic? NFS underground 1&2 have a typicall arcade game mechanic: Allways stay on full throttle. Boring! And other games who are diffrent from that do it too much in a simulation style way: You have to know the curve or see how steep it is and know at which speed you can enter it and have to brake down to that speed before out start steering. No, thats not how an arcade racers should be. Therefore I like NFS Hot Pursuit 2 very much, even though the delayed steering drives me up the wall sometime - in both senses.. The quintessential Need for Speed game; its' lone detriment being the absurdly long career mode events, which see the game's starter cars embarking on multi-event championships long enough to cramp you hands. Provided you can deal with the artificially extended campaign mode, and some of the grinding to unlock the high profile vehicles, Hot Pursuit 2 is easily the PS2's best racer by a significant margin.. I recently revisited this title, and, simply put: it's one of the best, if not THE best racing title from the PlayStation 2 era (Need for Speed Undercover 2 and Most Wanted; and Gran Turismo 3 and 4 included). The cars and environments are all beautifully done, for the era, with crests and dips to the circuits that genuinely affect how the cars behave over them. Courses have these shortcuts that aren't necessarily marked on the map but can help get you back in the fray if you suffered from an unfortunate crash early on in the race. The police chases are also quite well-executed with police that, particularly at higher wanted ratings, won't stop at hell or high water to get you. Unfortunately, they can be pushovers on the lower wanted ratings. Neat details include car sounds that are all unique from one another, though the AI cars all suffer from this generic drone more fitting of a commuter car (even if they're driving the same car as the player). The Chevrolet Corvette Z06's engine note is particularly good. Also, in the bumper cam, the gauges are facsimiles of the real thing. And while the soundtrack isn't the most extensive ---four licensed songs with instrumental versions--- it suits the style of the game quite well. But, best of all, the tracks are all fun to listen to outside of the game. In all, it's a fantastic game, and if you have a PS2 and haven't played it yet, you really should.. Probably has the best soundtrack in any game to date. With artists like Bush and Rush songs constantly playing while racing with epic cars on amazing tracks and police chasing, it is an incredibly iconic game in the racing genre.. This is probably the best race game on the PS2. Nice graphics and a fairly good soundtrack for a race game (most soundtracks in race games ****!), sweet cars, interesting tracks and fantastic controls. The police chases are incredibly fun. You can also play with two players racing each other, or one of you can be the police while the other is the speed devil. The player who is the police can call in helicopter support, spike strips or road blocks, which makes for a very exciting chase. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 delivers everything it promises: hot pursuits and hair-raising speed!. First of all, I loved the soundtrack in this game! The songs that they picked for this game really matched to the game. Finishing a race and unlocking the next car felt so good!. One of my favorite racers of all time. Plenty of cars and modes to play around with. My personal favorites are "" You're the cop"" and race knock outs. My only problem with this game is the track selection. It's one of those games that simply reverses a track and calls it new. I don't have a huge problem with that just when there are 6-7 sceneries it gets old seeing the same thing after a while. Everything else is pretty much flawless with this game.. I just had so much damn fun with this game. I can't tell you how many hours and how many nights I lost just trying to get a better time trying to slander those idiots off the road. There is something to be said about creating a simple game with amazing graphics an incredible sound that many developers today seem to be missing.. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 is the best Need for Speed game I've ever played. Better than the current ones? I think so. The game is a great racer and definitely a game for people who love exotic cars because there is a great selection of them from Lamborghini Murcielago to the Ferrari 360. The tracks are nicely designed and are fun to race on although they are long in length. The police pursuits are intense and the police will stop at nothing to bust you. Typical police equipment like helicopters and road blocks are at the polices disposal to take you down. The graphics are fantastic and the cars handle nicely. There is a meaty single player campaign which consists of racing in events in a championship to escaping the police in hot pursuit events. You can even be on the cops side and try to apprehend your opponents in some events. Also the soundtrack is pumping and really good when your racing along at high speeds. As I said before, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 is the best NFS I've played and a lovely addition to the racing genre.. The game builds on the first one and while it didn't feel as fresh it was still a nice ride and any fan of the racing genre that is looking for a fun arcade racer should pick this up.","a sequel to a PS1 game, ""hot pursuit 2"" is an exhilarating and addictive racer . the single player mode is divided into two campaigns: racing and chasing . overall, i would rate this with an 8.7 out of 10."
421.Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony,"Very interesting story add-on in which I spend many many hours. The great main game became even better.. Best DLC this gen. period , the graphics are better than normal GTA IV, combat is improved , and the game is really fun.. Was waiting to play as Gay Tony because of the title. This is false advertising. Don't play this game.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. As a bisexual dude, i approve the ballad of I LOVE **** tony,, i love the ballad of gay tony. Gay ****. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 9 Story: 8 Total: 8.83. Those who wanted gta iv to be a little more crazy and fun are in luck. This expansion is one of the best in the history of video games, better than many full games The story of Luis López also joins that of Niko and Johnny but somewhat less and has a lot of personality. We will meet characters as good as Tony and Yusuf Amir, we will see Bulgarin again and he has the craziest missions of gta The novelties of this expansion are among other things: New songs, new vehicles, minigames, fighting, triathlons, base jumping, drug wars, club management and also the graphics improved in all its versions compared to gta iv and tlad And also added new modes and features to online mode This expansion closes the fantastic story of niko's gta iv, with the stories of the biker Johnny and the manager Luis López. Mixing three stories of liberty city where people are crazy and anything can happen. I think I'll play it again, I love it. They've added some new improvements to this game which is also used in GTA5. It's a good expansion. The were less visible pop-ins, good draw distance and no grain filter like the lost and damned expansion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even better than ""The Lost and the Damned"". This second and final DLC to GTA IV brings back some of the fun of the previous entries. It's less serious and more over-the-top. But think ""Vice City"" more than ""Saints Row"". It's arguably even better than the main game. I would rate this with a 9.4 out of 10.. A DLC getting a **** 10?! TBOGT takes this underrated Grand Theft Auto story to the top! introducing Luis Lopez the ""Dominican Devil"" who happens to be Gay Tonys personal body guard. the DLC introduces parachuting, more accessible helicopters, nitro racing to the series. a short awesome side story that takes place during the events of the original GTA IV. night clubs, new guns, new rides and allies..this story is a dangerous party.. Grand Theft Auto IV’s second and final story expansion, The Ballad of Gay Tony, is how you end the night with a bang as you experience the final and fun moments that Luis Lopez’s story has to offer in the nonstop nightlife of Liberty City.. A perfect dlc story and even could have been a perfect game on it’s own, the shooting and hand to hand combat is still amazing 10/10 perfect.. This DLC completely changes the gloomy and dirty mood of Grand Theft Auto IV to bright and flashy looks of Liberty City, with its crazy fun, San Andreas-like missions. But what made The Ballad of Gay Tony so special is the whole glamorous nightlife vibe of it: fancy cars and helicopters, nightclubs, lots of new electro dance music. Rockstar truly succeeded at recreating this easy-going, party-like atmosphere.. Definitely a nice game by itself, but I prefer the original GTA IV over TBOGT.. Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony is a literal explosion of fun. It is so much fun, and downright hilarious. The same great gameplay is here, with plenty of great new weapons and vehicles. Easily a must play.. does any know how to get gay tony and the lost damned on gta 4 xbox 360.................................................................................???. I could see an improvement in graphics from GTA 4 and GTA TLAD. What I liked about this DLC is that it reintroduced classic things like parachuting but also new things like replaying missions, which would have made GTA 4 a whole lot better. I loved how each protagonist's missions from the GTA 4 DLC's intertwine and we can see things from a different perspective. I enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to other people. I would say this is the best GTA DLC I've ever played (So far). I find it better than IV. Parachuting, expolsive bullets, episodic weapons guns, clubing, etc. A lot more content than IV.. The story is ok. It's not as good as TLAD and IV, but it's not bad. The changes in this game since IV are: Bass Jumping which is fun at first, then I never did it again, and Clubbing: I never would have thought how fun clubbing would be in a GTA game, but it is.. TBoGT is more like an expansion pack than a DLC. In my opinion, TBoGT adds some of the content that I missed in GTA IV. What actually made GTA IV really GOOD was the storyline and improved game engine. But outside of the story, and the very REPETETIVE mission design, not enough was to be found. Nightclubs, drug deals, golf, all kinds of random side-missions such as working as a security gaurd at a club, doing drug deals, jumping parachute is now in TBoGT. Unfortunately, a lot of things that did exist in GTA does exist in TBoGT, such as vigilante missions. Still, this is a very impressive EXPANSION PACK / DLC, but its downside is that all the content that is included DOESNT GET included in GTA IV.. For those who're waiting for MID-AMERICAN DREAM , bit settled guy with a fun over ride .. this is just it !! ... Its the grate brighting and rainbow theme and for those who think that LAD was brown and dark .. story is however decent .. but still much improved than LAD ... gameplay is just like as it is .. but some cool new minigames are also making it much better .. Missions are some very great and some are totally regret .... but however voice acting is always at its 100% ... it's a good enough to be an expansion pack. Great DLC for a all-time great Xbox 360 game. Luis, Tony, Yusuf, etc. all likable characters. Cheats still available. A better DLC than GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned. Best DLC this gen. Period , the graphics are better than normal GTA IV, combat is improved , and the game is really fun. I think its an amazing even if it was released as a full game.. The game looks beautiful, except that after 15 minutes of play the pc starts to whistle due to overheating of the processor .... and it happens only with this game. The point however is the huge demand for resources that this game requires.. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Why doe this only have an 89 metascore!? This is my favorite piece of DLC for any game EVER!! The amount of content and story here is enough to be a new GTA game altogether!! Excellent atmosphere here as well.","this expansion closes the fantastic story of niko's gta iv with the stories of the biker Johnny and the manager Luis López . the graphics are better than normal gta IV, combat is improved , and the game is really fun . i think I'll play it again, I love it ."

423.The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,"I 100%ed it, yes, even the figurines. It was my first Zelda game and I think it kind of warped my vision of the franchise. For instance, fans seem to consider Ganon being the antagonist as automatic and obligatory... and to me he's the weirdest and worst antagonist in the series. Pig demon really ? Episodic vilains are better. Vaati is much better. I loved the scenario from this game. Excello was a great partner and I admit I cried a few of the times when he had to go. Reforging the master sword was a great quest as well. I loved getting to know the world from two different perspectives big and small and I remember a lot of the characters having fun and colorful personalities. I liked the combat system, not much to say about it, I could probably beat 20 of the hardest enemies at the same time, right now.... The pinnacle of 2D Zelda. Capcom created the outright definitive 2D Zelda experience. In 20 years we have still not quite gotten a proper 2D Zelda game in this style, although Link Between Worlds, and Echoes of wisdom are fantastic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I needed to consult a game guide multiple times, because sometimes it's not clear where you have to go or what to do; but even so, I loved it!. Very fun little adventure, i really love the artstyle, music and characters, capcom did a great job with zelda. Such a great 2d Zelda. I love the graphics, the music, and the concept. Sometimes I found it hard to navigate through the world. Sometimes I just couldn't find my way to the quest I was heading. Besides that, it's a must-have for the Game Boy Advance!!. Sometimes it’s boring or annoyingly hard (or I just ****) but in general this game is pretty good, and the best 2D Zelda. I like the travelling parts with for example, climbing the mountain in the beginning. This could be just me, but I find the dungeons rather difficult and annoying, with me using a YouTube guide by almost all of them. But this game has a lot of charm to it, and that is what makes this game so amazing and worth to play in 2024 (if you haven’t already).. THE BEST 2D ZELDA, I love this game sooo much, it has such great vibes and the music, and Vaati Is Super badass, Ezlo Is the best zelda partner I love this game. This is the most underrated game I've ever played. This game was amazing, the Kinstones were super cool! The only negative thing about this game was the wind temple.. I bought the game my game boy advance just to play this game and I can wholeheartedly say it is the best 2D Zelda I have ever had the joy of experiencing. This game has some of the best dungeons and bosses I have ever seen. I love this game and can very much say you should play it. It's such a unique experience for a Zelda game. I have played through it twice and each time I have loved it. I give this game nothing but praise. Go play it.. the game is so good the graphicson this game to gameboy advance is so good to and art aesthetic retro game. what a childhood memory ang the nostalgia.. Amazing game. Played it on the Vita, great memories. A fun and simple zelda, fitting for the portable gameplay and the mechanics are way too fun.. And the wheels keep turnin'She hit my phone, but it's way too earlyI swear are you watching me, I swear that you watching me. An aesthetically beautiful game. Generally great dungeons, generally boring/obtuse as **** overworld progression. The fusestone mechanic had potential, but I simply stopped caring about their rewards by the end. Some side quests are so ridiculous/high effort that I didnt even touch them after I found out the amount of work I'd have to put into it. Amazing final boss sequence, tho.. Better than most of the console Zelda Games, including Majoras Mask. I liked the dungeons, the story, and the gameplay. Next to A Link Between Worlds, this one is by far one of the best handheld Zelda games.. A solid game in the Zelda library and must play for Zelda fans. Minish Cap is full of puzzles, Secrets to find and mysterious shells to find. All the dungeons are different, fun to play and have different items needed to complete them. The boss battle at the end is a high point for me well designed like the rest of the game.. It seems a great Zelda game for the first hours but then slowly gets bad. It's super colour-ish, good soundtrack, not so bad story, quite creative with the gear and tools, even for a Zelda game. A bit more casual than most of the Zeldas. The use of the map for indicating important places is so well made. The difficulty curve is not too well balanced. With super easy parts and some enemies that you can barely hit. The main drawback maybe is the repetition. The minimizing feature is overused. It has a super long animation and the need to change from big to small several times in a row to complete the puzzles makes it boring. The game needs some extra features to avoid using the minimize that much. Then the figurines and kinstone fusions are super tedious. Figurines because there are so many and it's completely useless. There are also too many fusions and you need to backtrack a lot. Searching people that will only fuse at a certain moment of the game that you don't know. Then most of the fusion rewards is also useless so it will be better to have less and more worth of this. This two topics add a lot of grinding to a Zelda franchise that never relied on grinding. Finally adding post-end game content seems a good idea first, until you realize that you get useless trophies and gear that you'll not need anymore.. Another hugely playable arcade RPG with lovely graphics and fun puzzles that effortlessy draws you into its magical world. Easily one of the best RPGs on the Advance.. Full disclosure, my first time playing this game was on NSO. In my book as a long time Zelda fan, Minish Cap beats out Oracle of Ages as the worst Zelda I've played. I can enjoy A Link to the Past or Oracle of Seasons even today. I think what made me dislike it so much were the graphics. I was frustrated because I had a hard time with the puzzle logic--sometimes you'd do supernatural (albeit cool) things you'd never think of, and other times it was nigh impossible to tell height differences. The dungeons were a disappointment, but the bosses were fun. I liked the hat and shrinking to a different world was definitely cool. The Kinstones were an interesting addition that I may have been more interested in had I not felt the need to end the game as soon as possible. I do think there were too many--Kinstones as a whole limited exploration. I can see how my favorite entry of the franchise, Skyward Sword, was influenced by this game. In the end, lots of cool, creative ideas were put into this game. But it just wasn't fun for me.. one of the best zelda games ever made. this tiny adventure brings massive enjoyment. the game has some frustrating roadblocks, and the pacing of kinstone interactions necessitate an added degree of backtracking that doesn't always feel fluid or organic compared to other zelda games. imo there are also a few issues with the control scheme due to the lack of buttons on the GBA. this makes the introductory experience in minish cap a bit strange, as it's really not a conventional zelda title. there is also a lengthy trading sequence about halfway through the game which i did not personally enjoy at all and which required a walkthrough because many characters had to be talked to several times in a row in order to get a specific reaction from them, which is not normal for a zelda game. it's very easy to walk directly up to the solution, do the right thing, but have the game not quite accept your action yet, and that's a pretty serious flaw in this title. essentially, you can tell that capcom made this game, as they do not seem to fully understand every aspect of the game they are developing from the player's perspective. still, the game improves drastically from there forwards, with some very fun and challenging dungeons, silly npcs, and great boss battles. it also has some really great and colorful pixel graphics that still look good today, and while looking at it directly next to other GBA titles it's hard to disagree that the visuals have a superior degree of artistic polish, and graceful use of pixel art, compared to many gba titles that were still giving everything a thick black outline and struggling on how to deal with the resolution. it seems there are quite a few unique optional encounters in this game, which does give me a good feeling about a second attempt. finding out that i can't get the light arrows at all if i don't do [spoilers] was a pretty big letdown though, as from what i can see it may be a bit overpowered to get them that early in the game. still, i can't find precise info on how much more powerful they are, so i will have to try it a second time. regarding minish cap supposedly being shorter: you *can* beat the game very fast. at the same time, it's drastically longer than link's awakening and not much shorter than alttp. especially if you have a good memory of the game, you can beat almost any zelda game in one sitting. what's much more relevant is how much content is in the world, and there is a huge amount of it in minish cap. the overworld is small, but if you factor in all of the areas you explore as minish it is actually quite a bit larger.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the very best of the series. The game is very impressive in its simplicity, as it seems to have understood the core of the Zelda franchise before its time. Aging very well, the game offers beautiful and diverse environnements, with an increasing but never too tough difficulty curve. Surely one of the easier games in the series, but that makes it probably the best entry point together with Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The charming world and innovative mechanics truly set this game apart from its predecessors on Game Boy.. Played this for the first time recently on the NSO service and was blown away. It's a fantastic title and I'd rank it highly among the series. The Minish Cap is in most ways appears to be a straight forward iteration of the structure of the 2D Zelda series, but it has an immense amount of charm and great game design which make it stand out. The mechanic of shrinking down to Minish size was really fun, and I loved seeing the spritework of objects at this scale. The spritework in general is some of the best on the GBA, and looks great throughout. I had only a few minor nitpicks, such as a lack of enemy variety in the late-game, but apart from that it was a perfect and highly engaging experience.. It’s a nice game but not one of my favorites. I don't think it's particularly difficult and I don't think it takes long to complete the game. The only time I was a little bit challenged was against the final boss. But as always there is a good storyline and it’s fun to play.. Minish cap has really good side quests and the kinstone are really cool.I like that it barely focuses on the story but it's boss fights dungeons are really good. The world and the characters aren't as good as the other 2d Zeldas and there are alot of cryptic bull **** that makes no sense. What I love about Zelda games is that they don't age. I recently played this game and it's amazing. The Minish mechanic is another original that gives new puzzles to solve and a new aspect of the overworld. Must play.. The best zelda for game boy advance with a very good story and new characters 10/10. I love this game and it's one of the best games of all time. It may have a few flaws like it being too short or one particular part like the library book part being too criptic with the rest being pretty easy but other then that it's a great game. Me and my brother got the game when we were 11 years old and my brother beat it with the guides help but for me, I did it without the guide. I beat the game after my brother and it was a good experience and yes the game doesn't too much to innovate but if it aint broke, don't fix it. It borrowed alot from four swords but they really went all out with the engine. The graphics are very good to look at expecially if you're on a giant vine or when you're small. The vine part reminds me of when I was at tahoe and I was looked at the lake from afar when I was skiing. I would say the biggest problem with the game is that it's only 6 dungeons long but there is things to do between them.. First Zelda I played and one of the first games i had as child on my gba. So many memories. I'm jealous of people who got to play this as a kid. I thought it was incredible as an adult, 17 years after it was released, so I can only imagine playing it as a kid when it came out.. The game was very fun. I tried to do all the sidequests etc. I'm probably 95% done. There are many things to do in the game. Collecting shells, learning various sword techniques, I learned all the techniques and the game became incredibly fun. Especially searching and fusing Kinstones was my favorite thing in the game. I spent a lot of time in Hyrule town because it is constantly changing and the town is so alive. Dungeons are easier than previous 2D zelda games. You can move forward without getting lost. Except for the last boss, other bosses are easy. Graphics are good. Story and characters are good. A nice zelda game where you can spend your time.. It may be my favorite zelda because it is the one I played the most. It anyway one of the best games for the gameboy.. This game is leagues better than Link to the Past. Honestly the best 2D Zelda so far, with Link between Worlds cutting pretty close to this one, although Kinstones kinda **** in 2021.. Great 2d Zelda. The shrinking mechanics add so much depth to areas such as Hyrule town. Using the kinstones is a pain though.. They are not real puzzles, you are going to spin more than a spinning top, but the hero's journey runs through the tales of classical culture. This game is such a classic. The world, mechanics, story, art etc all work so well. It is definitely worthy to be considered a sleeper top 5 Zelda game. My only real issue is how short the game is because everything about it had me wanting more. It's a game worth replaying time and time again to revisit the Minish, or to simply absorb the charm of the game once more.. Its my first GBA and Zelda game. This game is just adorable. I still cant understand why this game is 89.. Minish Cap is a fun game. It isn't anything amazing, but it is a fun trip nonetheless. I would have to say that the overall dungeons were some of the best 2D dungeons in the series. It had an interesting and engaging story as well. No Ganon this time which is kind of a breath of fresh air. Vaati had appeared other times in the series before this, but this is easily the best he's been. We have seen the same art style before with Four Swords, and Four Swords Adventure, but it is definitely the best here. It has one big side quest through the game with these things called Kinstones, and it was really fun. When every you saw someone you could merge Kinstones with you always wanted to fuse them together. Although I'm talking all these great things about the game it does have one big problem. The quests, or missions you do before getting into the dungeons can be really annoying sometimes. It's not that they aren't fun it's just as soon as you complete one thing you have to do another, and another, and another. But other than that it doesn't have much bringing it down. While not as good as others in the series, it is still a solid adventure. I give it a B+, and an 8/10.. I realize I am in the minority here, though I never felt the same level of adoration that others feel for this Zelda installment. Sure, it's a fun, solid experience. But as far as gameplay is concerned, I think it doesn't live up to the standard the Zelda has set from others in the series like Link's Awakening or the Oracle games. This is a subjective opinion, but I feel that the overall game arch is not intuitive. Other Zelda games do a good job of hinting to the player about next locations to visit and whatnot. This simply doesn't feel as organic, and left me wandering around more. The world is okay to wander around in, but again, I just expect more. Now don't get me wrong: the dungeons are great, the storyline is fun, the Easter eggs are much appreciated (I particularly appreciate the nod to the unfinished Oracle/Mystical Seed of Truth game), and I recall really enjoying the design of the final boss fight. The final dungeon is also a gem to play in. For me, this one is a great Zelda game, just not on par with others.. I love top-down Zelda games. This one has the reputation of being a lost classic, As it’s only available on older (DS) or less popular (Wii U) consoles. It does have that classic Link’s Awakening / Link to the Past feel to it. This time, the added game mechanic is being able to shrink to hang out with tiny gnomes who love amongst humans. It’s excellent graphically, with Link wandering through tableaus of huge leaves and blades of grass. But the game has some weak points. Some of the puzzles are of the “gotcha” type, and leave you wandering the map or a dungeon for prolonged periods. I eventually used a guide for some puzzles and the answers were ridiculous: a single discoloured tile signifying a bomb wall, on the tiny DS screen is, to be frank, poor game design. That should have been saved for an optional secret, not the essential path forward. So, while it does have a classic Zelda feel, the game design flaws mean it’s a solid but imperfect entry in the series.. I'm a huge fan of the 3D Zelda universe but this game made me also fall in love with Zelda's 2D environment. The strength of this game is definitely the art. The game looks beautiful and the gameplay is super fluid. It does not offer the same feeling of 'epicness' found on some of the greatest Zelda games but this mini world was super entertaining to explore and the visuals and setting were pretty unique. Must-play Game Boy game. I also recommend this for fans of beautiful pixel art. You can't go wrong with this gem.. So much content in such a little game... very easy to get into and a lot to discover. Gets very difficult towards the end and beating Vaati is so rewarding! Post-game content wasn't necessary though after such a journey in my opinion. A short but wholesome experience with many welcomed mechanics adding onto the experience. Top down Zelda's are the best and this one all though I'm only half through has been great fun. More complex than I expected.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Minish Cap once again sees Link having to save Hyrule, this time from an evil sorcery known as Vaati. For the most part The Minish Cap sticks to the well used Zelda template. The single biggest innovation is the eponymous cap, an item that Link comes into possession of early in his quest. As well as offering Link directions and advice it also allows him to shrink significantly in size and interact with with a tiny race known as the Minish. Not only does it allow Nintendo to create excellent new puzzles but it also gives the developers the chance to show off the world of Hyrule from a never before seen perspective. It’s unlikely this idea will be enough to tempt those who haven’t enjoyed previous entries in the series but, even for someone like me who would only consider themselves a minor fan of the series as a whole, this was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and ranks amongst the best of the 2d Zelda titles.. I was mesmerized by the art of this in 2004 when I was 15 years old. But I didn't have the money then to buy it. So I'm really glad that I was able to play it now in 2018 and finally enjoy it. In the end, it was more of a meh. Playing it after Breath of the Wild is more pain than fun. +Link and Ezlo pixel character design is kawaii. Additional points for huge Goron. +Downsizing and then walking between huge leafs and acorns is so cute. +It's a well crafted dungeon crawler. Imagine an old school real-time PRG and that's exactly it. +Burning grass in 2005 was innovative. +The Legend of Zelda lore simply works. So many familiar designs from Breath of the Wild. +Multiplication mechanic feels fresh. -You need to collect all figurines to get all hearts. And that is stupid and lot of boring A-button pushing (like few hours of it). Awful. So I had 19 hearts in the end. -I collected all kinstones. And mechanics are good on general. But boy oh boy, some of them are not well programmed at all. Like this teacher at school to whome you need to talk first. Also beans and wall placements for kinstones look the same so I was confused. -Too many items. Like for some dungeon rooms I was simply checking all of them one by one to see what gonna work. In puzzle segments that led to unnecessary frustration. Also, so much time of the game is spent in a menu, switching items. Boss fights lose dynamics because of that. -The fighting itself is meh. I never actually enjoyed boss fights or felt that monsters are interesting to fight. -The world map is not well connected and feels really closed (more like a Batman Arkham Asylum). So getting from point A to point B is always pain in the ass. It's not a stealth game so it is frustrating.. My first impression of Minish Cap is that it looks like the Windwaker but plays like a 2d version of Skyward Sword. You can unlock heart pieces by fusing kinstones in much the same way as striking goddess cubes unlocks treasure in SS. Like SS, there is a lot of backtracking and a somewhat annoying companion to deal with. These shortcomings aside, Minish Cap also boasts some of the best dungeons in the series much like Skyward Sword. I do think Minish Cap is a fun game and I would be lying if I said it wasn’t one of my favourite games in the 2d series. The Minish ability presents a clever twist on the world within’ a world concept inspired by a Link to the Past. So to break it down: Pros: Art style Minish ability Dungeons Cons: Short Easy Backtracking Final verdict: a solid 8/10.. The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap is the best of the portable Zelda games by far. It's wonderful art style and the fluidity of the combat within the game reveal such an underrated and amazing entry into the Zelda franchise. The game has an intriguing story surrounding a villain other than Ganon known as Vaati, an while he may not be as strong of an antagonist as Ganon Vaati still does the job. Link's arsenal in this game has plenty of the old weapons fans will know and love, but it also has the brand new items that are completely unique to the Minish Cap. In addition, the unique Kinstone mechanic adds a lot to the game world and is an interesting way to cause the player to have to backtrack. At know no point did I find myself angry that I had to backtrack, only excited to see he new treasure I was going to get, or enemy | was going to face. Despite being shorter than most other main series Zelda games The Minish Cap holds up extremely well with it's bright handheld visuals and it's fantastic gameplay. Any Nintendo fan or Zelda fan that hasn't already played the Minish Cap must definitely try it as soon as possible because it's truly one of the best Zelda games and one of the best handheld games of all time. Cons Shorter then average Zelda game Can be too easy for some players. One of the most underrated Zelda games of the series. Some people don't even know it exists! I love this game so much. The mechanics and story are so different from other entries, that it to this day feels fresh and exciting. The only thing I don't like is that it is relatively short compared to other Zelda games. Other than that a pretty much perfect game.. For a gba fantastic and big game, but in comparison with other entries in Zelda series it's a little too short. Liked dungeons, items and diffrent attacks that Link can learn. Being smaller was also great addition, I wish someting like this was implemented in next 2d Zelda game, because it really has potential.. This is my favourite handheld Zelda game. People often complain that this game is too short, but if you do all the side quests and try to finish the game at 100%, you're in for a treat. This game has some of the best side quests in the franchise. Switching between human and minish size is fun and allows to see two different worlds. The dungeons are simple, but very fun. The visuals are pretty impressive for a GBA game too, and the music also impressed me. I highly recommend this game.. This GBA game is very fun and those bad reviews are 100% WRONG. This is my 2nd favorite Gameboy Advance game. This game has perfect gameplay and perfect dungeons.. I don't like Zelda and Ocarina of Time is not very nice game, but Zelda for GBA is very good . The Legend of Zelda Minish Cap is RPG as all games in this series and I think best games in this series are Twilight Princess and Minish Cap and Brath of The Wild (TBA Game) and I think this game is one of the best GBA Games and at the moment you must use your head in this game . Awesome and amazing .. Not the best game in the series, but definitely an incredible game in its own right. Very solid game with no glaring flaws dragging it down. Well worth it.. **** love this ,, best hand held zelda game everrrr,, the items are awsommee... This gane is better then a link between worlds honestly.. I took this game for granted yo. Minish Cap doesn't quite live up to the legacy of other Zelda games like A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, Minish Cap is still an commonly forgotten classic. It combines top-down Zelda games with 3D Zelda games and does it well. While it still mostly plays like the older Zelda games, convenient additions like rolling and sword techniques make the game very unique compared to other top-down Zelda games. The game is a little short, and the story isn't anything very impressive, but that doesn't keep Minish Cap from being a great game. It has its fair share of sidequests, and some of the boss fights are fantastic. Other bosses aren't so impressive, but not every Zelda boss is good. Overall, Minish Cap is far from perfect, but is still a game I recommend getting if you have a Gameboy Advance or DS.. Without a doubt, this game is the absolute best 2D entry in the Legend of Zelda series. It's up there with the best like Ocarina of Time, a true masterpiece of game design.. This game blew mah goddamn mind!! I'm a Zelda fan and always have been it's true, but I can admit when a Zelda game is bad. *cough* Spirit Tracks. *cough* However I have yet to find a true handheld Zelda game that stuck out to me. I tried a lot in my past and they never seemed to really cut it for me. Recently my fiancee handed me Minish Cap and I gave it a try. IT BLEW MAH GODDAMN MIND!!! I used to believe I knew my top three Zelda titles. 1. Ocarina of Time 2. Twilight Princess 3. A Link to the Past However, after playing through Minish Cap I finally realized that my childhood, an nostalgia would have to get in the backseat of the car and shut up and let Minish Cap drive. I have since changed my favorite list. 1. Minish Cap 2. Ocarina of Time 3. Twilight Princess Let me run you through as to why this game blew mah goddamn mind. 1st off...SWORD LASERS!!! I have missed the ability to fire sword lasers, and to finally see them given back to you in Minish Cap was just so overwhelmingly awesome that I forgot all about Ocarina of Times **** charged spin crap. Now of course you have to learn to fire your sword lasers but I don't ****'s worth it. 2nd off...Vaati!! I love Ganon as much as the next guy but it was super refreshing to finally see a new bad guy, and I think he does it well. He's evil to a certain point that he's kind of creepy, and where Ganon has failed multiple times Vaati pulls off his plan the first time. I love him, he's a manipulator, not a power house like Ganon. 3rd **** gameplay is rock solid and a serious upgrade from old Link to the Past. I love figuring out how to apply all of my awesome items, and I believe remote bombs should have been in every Zelda game ever. This gameplay is so rock solid that I have yet to get frustrated with something not working the way it should. Much like in Ocarina of Time...your stupid **** boomerang always flew in a different pattern every time. This did not do anything like that. 4th **** remake of the original Zelda dungeon theme...just...blew mah goddamn mind!! That's also to say the music was some of the best I've ever heard. The music is the best in the Zelda series as far as I'm concerned. I had no idea my GameBoy could produce such lovely melodies. 5th **** blew mah goddamn mind!! Safe to say if you have a GameBoy or even a DS get Minish Cap. It will blow your goddamn mind!!. I didn't enjoy this game one bit. The story is very forgettable which makes the game as a whole rather forgettable. The dungeons and overworld feel very constricted, and the sidequests were pretty terrible as well. This is such a disappointment for the Legend of Zelda franchise.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. for me this is the best 2d nintendo game ever made even more then link to the past metroid mario bros 1 and 3 and links awakening nintendo at its best i really sad this is the worst selling game because people should play this game. When I see a Nintendo game with the Zelda name on it, I immediately pick it up, the same went for Minish Cap, and boy did it deliver. Handheld Zeldas are frequently overlooked, and this one is the most overlooked of all the overlooked Zeldas, as you turn on the game, you find the Capcom logo in front of you, so you know it's gonna be awesome, right? Well, the graphics are colorful and pleasing, the dungeons may be easy, but they are well designed and have some unique items -Gust Jar, Cane of Pacci and the Mole Mitts- that have unique uses. The story is different from what you expect a Zelda story to be and it still delivers. There are a lot of sidequests including the damned figurine quest which I hate completely, and the Kinstone fusions are a new and innovative addition. This game is suitable for everyone and it's a perfect introduction to the series. If you find it for a good price, then don't hesitate to get it!. It's certainly on the shorter side when it comes to length in the Zelda series. Keep in mind though, it's a GBA game. Even so, the graphics are really nice, the overworld is quite large and the dungeons are clever as in pretty much every Zelda game. It's very underrated, mostly due to the fact that it came out when the DS had already been out. But, if you haven't played it, get it on the Wii U Virtual Console! 10/10. Man is this game underrated. Just like any portable Zelda game, this game gets so overlooked that is disgusting. The worst thing is probably that is one of the best games to introduce new players into the series, along with Wind Waker. It has it's flaws and there's really more enganging Zelda's out there, but I think we must stand for this little gem for what it is.. The minish cap is one of my favorite zelda games of all time. I had so much fun playing it and just the aspect of being able to shrink down to the size of a pikori was awesome. It felt really alive and happy and the town was great. Just thinking about it now makes me want to go back and play it again. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's just so charming and fun. Still stunning and lovely to look at. The Minish Cap & The Wind Waker are my favourite Zelda games because they're timeless.. Another amazing game of this amazing series. It's shorter than the others but still you'll have fun when playing it. Especially, I really love the puzzles, they're just mindblowing.. The Minish Cap is a good Zelda game, but its definitely not the best in the series. First of all its too easy. enemies deal very little damage and yet hearts are everywhere. And","i totally loved this game, yes, even the figurines . it was my first Zelda game and I think it kind of warped my vision of the franchise . in 20 years we have still not gotten a proper 2D Zelda experience ."
424.Homeworld: Cataclysm,"I liked emergence alot. The story and campaign was engaging and was addictive whilst playing through. It had great a great voice cast and I could not wait to finish it! The fleet used was also very unorthodox, so will give a mostly different play experience from Homeworld. .However, The story was flawed slightly.....****************I played this on the GOG released emergence which also exhibited bugs which made it hard to play, which I would reduce to 8/10 for that reason including:poor ship balance - Super Capital-ships can kill strike craft easily amongst other things: -pathfinding broken at times - making it extremely hard to get units into position in engagements...I dont know if this is Emergence, or Cataclysm as a whole. I will add that harvesting feels easier and the user interface feels more user freindly than the original, thanks to a couple of features.. THIS IS EPIC. its LEGO BATTLES IN SPACE. it is truly awesome like killer keemstar said: ""homeworld catalysm is only second best to lego battles wich is the best game ever"" - Killer keemstar 1937. The shocking truth that so many people would never really want to consider here, is that Cataclysm is not only a fantastic sequel, but hands down- the best game in the series. What we can immediately pull away from the amazing presentation is the knowledge that a very intelligent developer named ""Barking Dog Studios"" saw the potential for the series and worked very hard to make it a better experience all around. If anyone hasn't played Homeworld in a while, you'll remember that it had a fantastically executed story held back just a smidge by occasionally buggy fleet A.I., a killer difficulty curve after the 3rd mission, an almost unfair amount of frustration at times, and of course some cumbersome interface quirks. This has really all been cleared up by Barking Dog, since not only have they patched and filled some of the irksome frustrations of the interface, but they've completely cleaned up the issue with unit balance as well. Incorporating a unit cap was an incredibly good idea, it adds quite a bit more strategy in when you choose to build your units. Though this was frowned upon as an overall game-changing mechanic, I thought it made unit preservation that much more important. And with how much faster paced Cataclysm is compared to its predecessor- it makes a good deal of sense to implement that feature. Without getting too much into the story, the actual flow of combat is what really drove me to enjoy this game over and over again. The back and forth of the main factions in game are nothing short of nerve-racking. Slowly preparing a fleet to do battle with a foe that can reverse your technology and assimilates your ships is terrifying and incredibly interesting. Working out the balance of your fleet, researching new ways to counter your borg-like foe are all part of the campaign as well as the skirmish modes. To mention briefly the sound design is nothing short of brilliant, its much more engaging than the original game, though some of the voice work does sound a little goofy initially, overall its very well implemented as well. The atmospheric soundtrack is back, and though it doesn't feature anything that standouts as well as the first game, it is still very good. The games engine itself was starting to see some gray hairs unfortunately, so of course it was polished as well as it could be for 2000. Between the much more involved story line, the pacing of various space battle, the more efficient research and harvesting system- the game easily outdoes 1999's origin tale. If not by design alone, it certainly features a much more engaging plot that really goes all out in conveying the urgency of stopping your mistake that was born from foolish ignorance. If you have always wondered what the best ""sequel"" was, this is it, this is the actual ""Homeworld 2"" and their is really nothing like it inside the real time strategy genre.. Actually a very enjoyable sub-sequel (it was originally meant to be an addon, but ended up being released as a stand-alone game) to the original, with huge amounts of atmosphere and many of the little annoyances of the original ironed out (combat commands from map screen implimented, auto-harvesting resources at end of missions instead of waiting for hours, etc). Very worth aquiring this one for any RTS collection.. Cataclysm is a game that does an acceptable job of attempting to live up to the greatness of its predecessor. The strategy, tactics, and gameplay HW 1 fans know and love is all here. However, everything isn't all honky dory with this package. While the core gameplay, story telling and atmosphere are all top notch, there are several issues that detract from the overall experience. The most notable being the implementation of a Support Unit system, or rather, HOW it was implemented. The Dev's wanted to convey to the player that your Kiith (clan) is weak, and it's reflected in how inferior your combat units are at the beginning of the game. I have no problem with this; What I take issue with is the ridiculous population cap that is thrusted upon you. Within the first 10 missions, your fleet will be severely limited in size (for example: 24 fighters, 1 processor, 4 workers, 1 MCV, a ramming frigate and two hive frigates). In Homeworld 1, you would have a larger fleet by mission 4, let alone mission ten. Another annoyance with the SU system is the inability to capture ships if you're near the SU limit. I can understand this too; however, when it prevents you from fulfill objections and leads to a frantic scrapping of ships, it's becomes problematic. Another issue is the obscene amount of resources you get; you can never truly use them due to the population cap. It should be noted that these issues can be solved with a Trainer. However, i must judge the game solely on what is in the game; not can be added to edit it. If i did include the Trainer, this game would have an 8. As it is, it's a good game. Not as good as the original homeworld, but an adequate successor nonetheless.","the story and campaign was engaging and was addictive whilst playing through . the user interface feels more user freindly than the original, thanks to a couple of features . the shocking truth that so many people would never really want to consider this is that homeworld catalysm is hands down the best game in the series ."
425.Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin,"I don't think it deserves 10/10 for a simple reason: chain orders are not properly executed by tanks. But that's it. The rest is absolutely perfect. So... What is this horrible looking game? Basically, for newcomers, it's a turn based strategy game. Both players provide, at the same time (paused game) orders for their troops. Those orders are rather standards: move, attack that unit, crawl, run etc. After both players provided their orders, the game runs for 1 minute and both players simply watch their units (trying to) execute the received orders. When the minute is over, you can keep the orders provided from the previous turn or provide new orders. Then again, once everyone provided their orders, game runs for an extra minute and so forth. This way of doing is so gratifying as you watch, with an increasing heartbeat, your troops firing, panicking, hiding, not executing the orders. You will exult as your Stug explodes a T34 and rage behind the screen as your cannon misses or your troops start panicking. The game may look at first sight hard to handle, but it isn't. Deploy your troops, make sure your squads aren't too far away from their officers and officers aren't too far away from the HQ or else orders will be executed with a more or less substantial delay. The game itself is FAR more realistic and strategic as it may seem, and infantries react actually in a very realistic way to which players are not used to. Example, from the woods to a Trench you order your squad to run across a wheat field. As a gamer you would expect them to simply run and jump in the trench, even if under fire. Here, it won't. If a MG is suppress-firing the squad, even though not hurting anyone (they are hidden in the wheat field), the MG will prevent them from running. And that's actually how real soldiers would behave. Once you are used to this kind of behavior, you understand the huge strategic decisions you must undertake. Suppose you are the player who owns the MG. Maybe there is another squad nearer, easier to kill. But that squad running across the fields may represent a danger if it reaches the trenches because you want to get first to a house nearby. If that squad reaches the trench, it will prevent your troops to reach the house and secure the entire area. You see the point now of this game and how important very small decisions may be. Furthermore, as the orders are provided at the same time, as a real general, you must foresee what your enemy will try to do. And as a real general, once your orders are provided, there is nothing you can do to cancel it quickly. And, as a real general should expect, the reality of the terrain and situation well may prevent your soldiers to accomplish their duties. Graphics aren't nice. Interface is not very well done. You don't have any feedback-feeling from the animations providing you a high sense of immersion (see soldiers dying, running, recharging etc). But, if your mind is open enough to conceptualize the situation, not only you will find a completely immersive and tense game, but you will find one of the best WW2 strategic game ever released with Sudden Strike Forever. Believe me.. Still the gold standard for WEGO, squad-based, company level ""strategy"" games set in the Second World War. Panzer Command is coming along nicely, but lacks a decent map editor. It's unfortunate BFC put this one in the rearview mirror with a couple of minor bugs still on the workbench, but it shouldn't deter players from still enjoying this one, even years after release.","for newcomers, it's a turn based strategy game . both players provide, at the same time, orders for their troops . the game may look at first sight hard to handle, but it isn't ."
427.Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty,"Truly amazing. If I could Experience any DLC again for the first time, I'd choose Phantom Liberty. Everything is just perfect, not too much content, you don't feel Overwhelmed, but it's not just some simple extra storyline. That's just fits Cyberpunk 2077 perfectly. Masterpiece game with masterpiece DLC. I just love everything about this piece of fiction.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolutely outstanding and far better than the main game. One of the best story games of the year.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is undoubtedly one of the best DLC's of all time. Had Dogtown been larger with more activities, I believe it could be a very good standalone game. It makes you feel literally like a badass spec-ops spy. The ideas were otherwordly in my opinion and the mission development is as good. The characters were also spectacular with Solomon Reed being one of my favourite characters in both Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty. In conclusion you gotta play this by all means. And I will say again what I always like to say. One of the biggest what-if's in the history of gaming is ''What if Cyberpunk 2077 was in it'sofficial release what it is now after the 2.0 update. That atrocious first launch destroyed the game's reputation. And still it is not bug-free but in a PS5 or a high-end PC I think especially after the 2.2 update the only sort of bugs one will face have to do with model/texture pop-ins. Congratulations CD Projekt Red for not giving up on your game and finally making it a peak experience along with this canon DLC. To anyone reading, in a world full of EA's be a CD Projekt Red and/or a Rockstar Games.... It was the best dlc i have ever played with fantastic writing and very good pacing the only bad thing about this dlc is sometimes in dog town you get pretty bad performance. A work of art. Immersive. Fun. Unmissable. I have vicarious FOMO for the poor souls yet to experience this world.. This is everything I wanted Cyberpunk 2077 to be. Phantom Liberty is a masterpiece of an expansion, it fixes every single issue I have with the base game while at the same time, it contains the best content made by CD Projekt Red, I'm not exaggerating. The story and the characters are simply amazing, every mission feels so cinematic, it's like watching a movie, the cinematography, the dark atmosphere, the performances, everything. Also, choices finally matter, not only in the story, but in every single mission, there are so many different outcomes. When it comes to the side content, I really enjoyed exploring Dogtown, every side quest is great, and there are actual side activities to do as well, like going to a bar to drink or dance and things like that, there are some quality of life improvements that make the world feel more immersive. I do wish Dogtown was a little bit bigger, because even though it's filled with people and side content, its size is too small, making it difficult to navigate. This might just be my favorite videogame expansion of all time, or at least one of my favorites. The compelling storylines, the brilliant action sequences and emotional payoffs, and the improved RPG mechanics make this the ultimate cyberpunk experience. It's pretty much what we were promised the base game to be, in fact it's way better than the base game, you just simply can't miss this, there is no Cyberpunk 2077 without Phantom Liberty. Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.. It goes from James Bond to Mission Impossible to Alien Isolation, Amazing game!. The dlc brings in new interesting characters, forces you to make difficult moral decisions, and overall makes you feel like **** after playing it, what more do you want? Play it right now! :D. It add's 10+ hours of great story. There's also new ending in a game after finishing the dlc. However gameplay wise it's still the same game.I've played it all together and sometimes it was a struggle to keep going on. Anyway definitely worth playing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game Cyberpunk 2077 seemed like an interesting project to me on one hand (I vividly remember moments when I logged into the game every day, wandering the streets of Night City, immersing myself in the life of the city, doing side quests, and following the main story). However, on the other hand, it felt dull, lacking the depth needed to keep me engaged for a long time. Therefore, the extra time I had to spend in the game felt more like wasted time—though, to be fair, this is a subjective impression of the expansion. I clearly recognize that it just didn’t captivate me: at times, I missed parts of the plot or skipped dialogues, and by the end, after the credits, nothing came together as a cohesive story for me.After 80 hours in the main game and 15 hours (or so) in the expansion, I still don’t understand who Reed really is as a person (especially his deeper thoughts), nor why characters like Songbird, Morales, and so on are essential. The expansion seemed bland and unengaging—it didn’t help me relax; instead, each extra minute in Dogtown felt more like **** only thing I’d like to highlight is my appreciation for the visual updates the developers managed to add with the latest patch. However, despite this latest patch, the game still frequently crashed on me—not just crashing, but freezing and crashing without saving, which meant I had to replay certain scenes multiple times.Overall, I don’t want to say the game is bad—far from it! It’s actually quite good. But for me, after playing other games where the developers put more effort into optimization and development from the start, Cyberpunk, with its vast world and interesting plot but rather blurry background, simply can’t compete for a spot on my list (despite the fact that I’ve spent over 75 hours in it).However, I still recommend checking it out, even if just on a surface level!. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty continues the high standard set by version 2.1, with expanded scenes, storyline, and gameplay, further enhancing the depth and appeal of this futuristic open-world game.. Very disappointed with this DLC after all the glowing reviews. I found the characters tedious and grating, and the main quest derivative and linear. The new area is small and uninteresting to explore.. one of the best DLC for any video games that has been ever created, the game is a master piece and this DLC made go far above the top, too bad that this is the only DLC for the game.. Wow! Amazing! The music is amazing. The story became even better, so now it's breathtaking. The cutscenes are very cinematic and beautiful. The characters are alive and different. The voice acting varies from very good to amazing. The gameplay is very fun. And the missions are very hard to pause and go to sleep. There are still bugs, but by this point, they are even adorable and dear to my heart. I played 100+ hours in the original game, and then 100+ hours in the game with the DLC. Totally worth it.. This expansion is really great on all fronts. From the main story with different endings, to the added gigs and world building. The expansion is perfectly integrated in the game and makes it better in every way.. I finally got around to playing this. And even in October of2024, they have a game ending glitch on the final mission. Read many people had the same issue, where you have to reload and redo. Tried it 5 times, wasted an hour. Loved this game but this is unacceptable, it’s a broken game, how tf have they not fixed massive issues like this. Perfect in everything! Really good story. Idris Elba. New area is really good. Side quests are all really good. Skill tree additions. They still havent fixed Judy being unable to romance Male V. There is no reason to have that restriction. Amazing! good story, good mechanics, I played after the bad release so I didn't experience bugs at all.. good expansion!. CDProjekt's dlcs never fail to impress me. The story is even better and more fluid than the base game, with characters and side quests quality.. With the dlc i started my 3rd playthrough of the game and all i can say it's a thing of beauty. Cyberpunk is just more than a game it is an experience and you kinda live it throu V's eyes. I even liked cyberpunk back in the day when it was buggy but it worked for me the most of the time so i can't say much negative in general. About Phantom Liberty: it's an expension with a thrilling story wich drags you in like the main game. You get an new map-district ""dogtown"" new quest of course which can easily mess with those of the main game and a mainstory you won't forget. Of course you also get a new ending but sure no ending you would expect.. This Addon for me just proved that without the amazing Night City Center, the game has not much to offer . Movement is clunky, while the main game had a shallow stereotypical ""Rebel against the System"" story. This DLC just went into the opposite ""James Bond saving the President and the World "" story. The added city district feels just like a junkyard with some nice indoor locations sprinkled in it. It's an average game with great graphics.. Langston Abdullah on: Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is a game-changing expansion that significantly revitalizes the base game, delivering a rich and compelling espionage-focused storyline, enhanced mechanics, and an immersive atmosphere. Set in the sprawling, neon-lit dystopia of Night City, this DLC centers on a covert spy mission where the protagonist, V, is caught in a web of political intrigue, betrayal, and high-stakes **** DLC introduces Dogtown, a new district in Night City that feels grittier and more militarized, adding depth to the game’s world. This area is filled with new quests, characters, and secrets, all dripping with a tense, Cold War-esque atmosphere. Players are thrust into a narrative that involves complex alliances, working alongside seasoned operatives like the new character Solomon Reed, portrayed by Idris Elba, whose performance adds gravitas to the story.Phantom Liberty emphasizes choice-driven gameplay, where the decisions V makes can alter the course of events dramatically, enhancing the role-playing aspect. The new storyline feels darker and more mature, focusing on themes of loyalty, trust, and the morally gray nature of spycraft. The stakes are high, and the narrative is packed with twists and emotional moments, giving players a gripping experience from start to **** addition to its narrative, Phantom Liberty introduces significant gameplay improvements that address many criticisms of the base game. Combat is more fluid, thanks to revamped AI and improved mechanics. New weapons, cyberware, and abilities allow for greater customization and more strategic approaches to combat, catering to various playstyles. Vehicle combat, a feature missing from the original game, is finally introduced, adding a thrilling new dimension to action **** DLC also brings a host of technical enhancements, including better performance, smoother animations, and an overall more polished experience. This is especially evident in how Dogtown feels alive, with dynamic events, improved NPC interactions, and a heightened sense of immersion compared to the original release. The world feels more responsive, and exploration is rewarded with new side quests and hidden lore that deepen the game’s already complex narrative.Visually, Phantom Liberty is stunning, with Dogtown showcasing striking contrasts of gritty underworld environments and high-tech military structures. The soundtrack complements the expansion's intense, brooding atmosphere, adding layers of tension during key moments and exploration.Despite the overall improvements, Phantom Liberty retains some of the complexity that may still overwhelm new players, particularly those unfamiliar with the core game’s mechanics. However, for returning players and fans of the cyberpunk genre, this expansion is a must-play, offering a dense, narrative-driven experience with deepened **** conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty revitalizes the original game with a gripping story, improved gameplay systems, and a fresh, immersive world to explore. It stands as a redemption arc for Cyberpunk 2077, showcasing how much the game has evolved while delivering one of the best DLC expansions in recent years.. Cyberpunk in 2024 is a true work of art. It took a while, but I think this game is now at a point where the devs can say they've translated most of their vision onto the game. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience atm. Definitely a must play.. this should be the real ability for CDPR. the original Cyberpunk 2077 should've got the quality like DLC. thank the developer for saving this game from the disaster debut. but all this should be avoided at the beginning.. This game isa masterpiece even though it had avery rough launch it has had an amazing redemption arc. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! Everything about Cyberpunk 2077 The Phantom Liberty is Excellent. From the Story to the Graphics to the Combat to the just plain CYBERPUNKFeeling is EXCELLENT! Highly Recommend Purchasing it because its a GREAT Addition to Cyberpunk 2077. Particularly on PC. Recommend at least RTX 2080ti or Higher and i7 10700 or Higher Intel CPU for best gameplay at 4K ENJOY! 10 out of 10. The new Skill System is wonderful. The the new World Part is ok. The new Story is boring. No Sandbox only straight boring Shooting Missions. Cyberpunk Vanilla is 8/10 this is 5/10. Somehow this DLC manages to top even the main game in some regards. The story is intriguing and has higher stakes. The updated combat and progressions systems are excellent, and all the new gear is fantastic. This is like the main game on steroids. I cannot wait for Cyberpunk Orion!!!. Even after a large number of updates, the game is full of bugs.Boring mechanics, nothing special and new. Very far from what was promised.. Six months ago I felt like I was living in a parallel world during the 80 hours of play, (I played the game with photorealistic mods), take your time and do all the side quests, it's a life experience. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It might be one of the few games that were not absolute **** also the comeback from the state of the game at launch is something to be applauded of cdpr they could've left it after a few fixes in first few months of release and have moved their focus towards Witcher 4. Even though the game has one hell of a launch itself, CDPR has successfully redeemed themselves to create a game and a dlc that exceed my and many others fan expectation from the character, visual, music to the worldbuilding around Dogtown. Edgerunner and this DLC really saved the whole game. Love the plot and the music. Fabulous.. Great expansion and new features. This is how every DLC should be done. Well done CD!. What a wonderful experience. Dense, intense, provocative. Sense release of Cyberpunk 2077, I don't follow the hype. The game have it's issues, but man, it's a master piece sense the beginning. With Phantom Liberty, ah, a lot of fun and moment to reflect. Love the game, love the dlc.. An amazing expansion to an amazing game. This game is amazing. One of the best videogames ever created. I am so happy I got to experience Cyberpunk 2077- trust me, just play it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best open world shooting game and u can experience in first person mode. Game really have repeate value. Must play. an amazing spythriller adventure that adds in to an already 10/10 game, also adds 35 gbs worth of extra content, you’ll be playing for a while. If you still find Cyberpunk 2077 problematic after the Phantom Liberty and 2.0 Updates, the problem might be with you. Because Phantom Liberty is nothing short of a phoenix for Cyberpunk 2077. For me, the most amazing gaming experience right now was definitely playing Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty together. Improved mechanics, in-game bug fixes, atmospheric execution, graphics, an amazing soundtrack (e.g., Phantom Liberty and Worlds), character design, story—whatever you can think of, this game is a masterpiece in every aspect and will remain so for many years. The initial release of the game might not have been good enough, but in its current state, it offers the best gaming experience in the world. This is a masterpiece.. Hot garbage, cant really say more. Completely ruined the perception of the main game for me.. I like it more than original game. I played through Cyberpunk 2077 5-th times, and Phantom liberty, for me, more interesting than main story. A true redemption story for Cyberpunk 2077 narrative aspects. An amazing game by it self. I strongly recommend it to people like me that maybe were a little bit deceived of the original game story. This is an incredible demonstration of what this world has to offer in term of lore, story, narration and especially characters (which are to me the real gem of this DLC). DLC Integration into V's life and story : 10/10 This DLC is amazingly integrated into the original game and you never feel like it's a random distraction that will eventually lead you back to the status quo (which is often the case with mid-story DLCs) Characters building and development : 10/10 Amazing characters, i have nothing else to say. Amazingly built and developed (or should i say revealed). The acting performance (in English that is) is amazing and moving. They are incredibly believable and endearing. Story and narration : 10/10 Every quests packed into this DLC is a full story on it's own, Side quests and GIGs are infinitly better, longer and deeper that their base game counterparts, the main quests hit so much harder too ! I only played the game once with one of the possible ending but it was extremely satisfaying and truly seemed like the sum of my choices and actions. World (details and environnment) : 10/10 You know, it's cyberpunk, one of the best looking and detail packed game of history, the new zone introduced in this DLC is no exception. Game-play: 7,5/10 With the 2.0 update it trully feels like the game is funnier and offers more challenge, which is a very good thing. I still believe the game lack balance and that it doesnt offer enough challenge especially as you level up but this update is definitly moving the game towards a way more fun experience.. This game is a masterpiece, I played it on PS5 and PC. The best version is the PC one 'cause u can put mods on and do wonderfull things. I love this game and I cried many times. I recommend it to anyone who asks me what it's about and what should be done in it.. I keep going back and forth, and I've decided not to discuss in detail the lore and expansion of their universe as it is beyond my understanding. To put it simply, I recommend this game.. “The game is fixed” Amazing expansion. CD Projekt Red redeemed themselves with this one.. not a big fan of dlcs at all, but sometimes if it is an additional contet to main game its fine, this one is additional, you can play it in the middle of main story and itll be logical but because of some bugs i had to play it after main story and this addon if we look at it as a stand alone project is terribly boring and useless. zero info about all that characters, all new things are not interesting. i dropped it, but ill place a rewivew cuz i played 6 hours. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Extension of content in a big way. Great main plot and many add-ons and extra missions. Recommended if you enjoyed the base game.. A strong game that competes with famous games. It gave me one of the best stories and choices that I have never forgotten. It is a strong game.. Give credit where credit is due: Cyberpunk 2077 went from an ambitious mess to one of the greatest games of all time. And it took years of updates to get it there. This expansion, however, is more of the same. The side quests are more fleshed out, and there’s a liveliness to Dogtown that we don’t find in Night City. But the espionage storyline is pretty by the numbers, and I don’t feel like it did enough to make me care about the main characters the way I should. The ending is really weak, and it runs objectively worse than the main game. But hey, more **** game is never a bad thing, right?. I couldn't play more than 10h this game it's just not good in my opinion, both the story and universe aren't enjoyable.. Great addition to storyline that expands lore beyond Night City! Great localization (thanks for ukrainian), characters, environment. Refactored gameplay is just what was missing to become a masterpiece.. As much as i like the original game...this was a massive disappointment. Jump and Run ? Really ?Escort against hordes of Enemies?. Amazing story. Very immersive. Almost perfect rpg mechanics. Gun play is very satisfying.. This is truly the generation-defining game. The world, the story, the characters, the city, everything is above anything we've known so far. I can't wait for the continuation as it's going to be only better I'm sure.. A day late and a dollar short on a game that had the potential to define a generation and instead was a massive flop and ruined the credit a company had built with their fan base.. It's not a bad add on. In fact as add ons go it is better than average. But seriously jumping puzzles? The only games since Donkey Kong that had fun jumping puzzles were Portal, Portal 2 and Braid. The random sequence of requirements? Dive through A to reach B to open path to C reminded me more of King's Quest 1 than of Cyberpunk 2077. And wouldn't it be awesome if we threw in some missions where you didn't get to use all of the skills and attributes you accumulated during the game. It would be just like a non-RPG nested within an RPG? I'm sure the RPG gamers that bought the game are going to love that. And, finally, why add driving missions when your driving simulator is so, so awful compared for example GTA5? I can go on and on. Mission design was as if done by kids. On the upside, it's more Cyberpunk. On the downside, it's more Cyberpunk that isn't as good as the original game.. the first time i finished the DLC i was in tears never though they could make a comeback from the problematic launch yet this DLC showed that they could and did. Story was definitely better than the main one but in expense of dlc being incredibly short! In sequance dlc goes ; go talk to some person, wait 2 days do side quesnts mean while, than go talk to some other person and wait 2 more days only than! You can go talk to someone else so afterwards you can wait two days to do some action.. Great game if it wasn't for over-marketing and overflowing bugs. It's only gotten great now, but the disappointment was really huge.. The developers have really put their all into this and now in the state it is, it is really a superb game and better looking than most games that are released now.. I hate Phantom Liberty. The base game was surprisingly good, so I got this DLC on sale for $40 CAD, regret buying it, not worth paying for! Total waste of money. The DLC story is agonizing copaganda garbage, the DLC areas are 1000x glitchier than the base game content, with excruciating loading times. You get no choices to impact the narrative, you have to become a cop and save the president. You have to team up with murderer-cop Idris Elba to fight beige military bros. and repeatedly help the police. Base game is good, don't waste your time with the expansion. Regret it.. I first played this game in PS5 after the “Edgerunners” update. One of the best single-player action role-playing games I have ever played. Anyone should play this game just to see the effort the CD Project red put into this game. The art direction and the atmosphere is amazing, you can easily immerse into the world while playing. Gameplay is really really good despite its complexity and it has a ton of options to customize your playstyle. Story-rich, with different possible outcomes! P.S. I finished the game and noticed 0 bugs. (in PS5). An absolute masterpiece everything about the dlc is beautiful its worth every penny. This expansion came to give a new life to Cyberpunk 2077. Probably one of the best expansions in the market right now. Check if your PC meets the necessary system requirements for the game.. Perfect dlc, the real movie experience. It'sincredible how this game changed lastyear'sand Phantom Liberty shows how much potential there are in this universe and it'sthe perfect example of differencebetween new and old generation. Night city beyond Dog Town seems so empty at the moment.. The graphics are a visual feast, with a level of detail that's nothing short of breathtaking. Night City comes alive with vibrant colors, towering ****, and bustling streets filled with characters that seem to have stepped out of a cyberpunk dream. The ray-tracing technology adds an extra layer of realism, making each reflection and neon glow a mesmerizing spectacle.. I played over and over again. Story,musics,actors,characters,universe 10/10. Great game minus the bugs. The expansion is fun but not enough new content to justify the release price.. Very cool. Fixes basically all the major bugs. Adds TONS of new content aside from Dogtown like the graves of the crew from edgerunners.. I enjoyed it just as much as the base game, the game's stealth mechanics are used perfectly for this and every new addition (from appearances and side quests to characters and district design) is 10/10. the only problem was some minor bugs that are now completely gone. What a journey! I loved how they managed to implement dlc content to the existing world of Cyberpunk 2077. I dropped the game after I'd completed it back in 2021, so I was nervous about how I was gonna return to this universe after all this time. My worries were proved to be wrong. Great DLC! It feels so good to be back in NC.. Epic story, cinematic picture, multiple endings, some hard choices and moral questions raised, played with pleasure. Next gen graphics, good level design, good dialogs, 'first person' view giving awesome immersion. 2.1 patch - finally the game is ready ;) had only 1 bug for dlc (and a whole game so far), just restarted the mission part. Definitely worth playing it now and regret for all whom played it before all bug-game fixing. So any cyberpunk newbie like me is excited, for me it's better then gta 5.. Phantom Liberty achieved everything that the original Cyberpunk2077 was trying to. Real choices that affect your gameplay and the story drastically are finally present. CDPR kept their promise and the game even brags about it as it should. The universe is finally sunk into-able and I wish this is the Cyberpunk everybody remembers. Ten years of waiting paid off, no doubts.. Great DLC for a great game. The story was tense, new content was great and I'm sad we won't have any more DLCs.. Incredible storytelling. Impactful and strong. Left me thinking about what I did days later. One of the best expansions in gaming.. phantom liberty is like taking the main game, excluding all the bugs and issues at launch, then squeezing the amazing story, worldbuilding and originality into one big DLC, which feels smaller than it actually is. The history is good, is a separate history from the main history. Interesting to see Idriss Elba here. Stunning expansion. Combined with update 2.0/2.1 I am absolutley blown away.. Amazing Thanks for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty And Cyberpunk Thanks Cd projeck Red. I wish Night City is a real place the architecture and urban planning are just exquisite. Had they released this game in 2023 instead of 2020 this could compete for the Game of the Year. This DLC is a redemption for Cyberpunk, no doubt.. Phanom Liberty is how I expected the main game on release to be. It is well polished, has a great story and no technical issues. At least for me. The main game was a 7/10 for me because it was released before it was finished.. A decent addon to the main game, which I do not regret playing. It adds a lot to the game and manages to keep its influence in the game world. The added side story is actually great, I liked it alot. However, the way the missions play is just different. They feel very Hitman-ish and less Cyberpunk, the approach you do missions with is basically given to you, you can´t choose as much as you could in the main game. What I did expect after the horrendous launch of the main game was for this DLC to be polished as all hell, it was not. The added missions contain just as many bugs as the main game right now (2.1) which would be fine if CD Projekt would not have a reputation to repair. I guess we can be glad they´re not game-breaking. And without spoilering: I have noticed 2 voice lines which were added into the main game storyby the DLC. And they ****. One sounded entirely different like it was jammed into a preexisting conversation (which it was) and that pretty much ****. Would have loved to see a bit more effort.. Amazing!!! Best of the alll time for me this game and expansion pack. Most play.... i don't know what is wrong with press lately, they seem to play all games on easy and normal mode. i don't want to take anything away from the writing and characters in the expansion. this is why the game is for me a solid 7. but when it comes to video games gameplay is of utmost importance. so how is it then, that in this expansion there is a focus on a call of duty cinematic action taking away the rpg focus especially on the harder difficulty levels? the level design forces you to play with weapons you don't want in a style you did not put skill points into. boss fights are very mediocre as in the main game.. What can i say. As ridiculous as it may seem, it seems that such a future awaits us. A futuristic game with a well-drawn world of the future. -9/10 story -8/10 gameplay -10/10 environments -8/10 characters -9/10 music. I replayed the base game once more before touching the expansion. First time I finished it after the initial launch and it was rough, but it has it's charm. Phantom Liberty has none of it. It's a slap to the face for anybody that bought it and cannot refund it.Please don't buy this game if you have no way to get your money back. Think about every thing that is wrong with current game dev, extract the essence and you will get Phantom Liberty. Ok, except **** characters are completely unlikable. Desperate, I tried skipping dialogue and just enjoying the gameplay, but it turned out that If I want to freely explore, I will get shouted at in a condescending voice. Then again, a lot of the ""gameplay"" is just walking along a linear path and jumping from time to time. New skill tree consists of 10 skills, personally found it to be useless. If you don't feel bad enough about paying for this overpriced mess, then you can go talk to the CEO and some dev on the first market. Yes, they did a self insert, probably just so they can laugh at you in the game as well. There are also the bugs, some game-breaking, but you know, it's Cyberpunk, so if this would be prohibitive for you, then you would not consider buying this in the first **** the upside - the new locations looks pretty nice. Got some different feel than the rest of the game. Shame it's so hard to enjoy them. Last game from CD Project RED that I bought. Tried to defend them in the past, but enough is enough.. Good gameplay, action and story. I played on PC with a 3080 and Rog Ally and it looks good on both.. masterpiece! dense atmosphere, brilliant dogtown. the extra ending made my heart ache. I have a moral hangover. The DLC brings a lot of new, original content (new map, side missions, etc), but where it shines most is it's main story. I was invested from start to finish, but I believe that one of the two available routes, that you can take is much better, and has a lot more content than the other one. Still, even then i","if i could Experience any DLC again for the first time, i'd choose Phantom Liberty . everything is just perfect, not too much content, you don't feel Overwhelmed . a work of art. Immersive. Fun. Unmissable ."
428.Tetris Effect,"this game was really fun, its just like any other tetris game it will make u really mad or really happy, i loved the music except for a couple of them, i love the online mode and i just like the pretty visuals! if u dont rate this game in the green u cant have a big **** (hehehehe). amazing. classic tetris gameplay with great music. i love tetris as well. good game right here. Well where do I start. Basic graphics, irritating music. Once you have done a bit of the game it suddenly speeds up to the point it is unplayable. The effects are nice but don't really add anything to the fact its a basic bad port of tetris. Very disappointing. I think the programmers have given this numerous 10 star reviews with a botnet or something. Why won't they listen to my ideas for a VR game? I think they are scared mine will be far better. Dave, Pauline give your heads a wobble! You are making our country look like a untalented bunch of morons. Give me a chance :D. I bought the game primarily for the online multiplayer and it proved to be a huge let down. First of all, it's usually pretty difficult to find somebody to play with, sopmetimes you have to wait for a few minutes to find another player. And then it's usually a handful of the same players that you get. Second of all, from the few players out there, a greta majority if very experienced and so it's really difficult to score any points at all as a new player whop's just learning. And the game offers no balancing system, where it would match you with players with similar seniority only. Third of all, the scoring system is very unbalanced. You gain few point when winning, but lose a lot in case of a loss. It's pretty demotivating. Overall, I don't enjoy this game.. To an extent, someone's enjoyment of Tetris Effect over other entries will be heavily influenced by their enjoyment of the music, which is sometimes surprisingly poppy. However, even as someone who doesn't often listen to this type of music, I found myself extremely enamored give or take a couple songs. In fact, I often listen to the soundtrack on Spotify while I work - it's great for focus and pep, considering the whole idea of the game is to lean into the deep concentration many already experience when playing standard Tetris. Music aside, I think most will agree that the lavish, particle-filled visuals and evocative backgrounds are wonderful. Fans of Rez, Lumines and other games of its kind will find that same vibe paired very well with the classic Tetris mechanics. My only gripe is that the modes feel a bit sparse - I would have liked more options for simple customization, such as being able to set up revolving playlists of my favorite songs. Overall, though, this is one of my favorite versions of Tetris if only because it uses its presentation to induce the euphoric hyper-focus that makes me seek out a game like this in the first place.. Tetris Effect takes it to a whole new level. I always thought tetris has good music, but this game has great music. The story mode features various level designs, with songs to match each level. Pros This creates a dynamic environment and you really feel like you are progressing through an adventure, which concludes with a final level with an amazing soundtrack and blends so many beautiful backgrounds and lights and sound effects. -The controls are great on the PS controller -Many different game modes -Offers leaderboard scores and events Cons Some of the design layouts and effects actually hurt my eyes and can be rather distracting, but I would only say that's a few of the themes, most of the levels are solid. lack of a dedicated multiplayer to go against others Really amazing game and I still play this years after its release date.. Tetris, with added emotions. The fact that it can be played in VR is a welcome addition, however do yourself a favour and invest your time and effort in this amazing title.. With countless iterations over the last thirty plus years it’s hard to really do anything all that new with the classic puzzle formula, but Tetris Effect when played in VR it manages to do something truly original. In terms of gameplay the only real addition is the ‘zone mode’, which allows players to freeze time and fill multiple lines at once, and adds a new level of strategy to the game. Where Tetris Effect really shines however is when played in VR. The music and graphical touches, that react in response to the players actions, are simply mesmerizing and it’s difficult to describe the experience. If you’re a Tetris fan this is a fairly fun iteration, but if you have PSVR, it’s a must buy!. This classic retro game makes a lot of fun to play in VR. The music and sound concept is really good, but the visuals did not reach this quality. The tetris bricks looks blurry and has bad antialiasing, it also looks like there is no PS4 Pro enhanced support to push a higher resolution. For such a simple 3D scene it could be a lot better, by sure! All in all it is a mediocre game, the experience in VR is nice but nothing more on these days. I did not understand the hype, because it isn’t one of the best games for PSVR, at least not in 2020. The most fun comes from the Tetris gameplay itself, which we know already since 25 years. For this reason it is also heavily overpriced. A non-VR usage makes no sense at this price tag, playing in VR is the main selling point for this title.. At it's best this game is a 10/10. A perfect synergy of gameplay, visuals and music. The final level, if it all clicks for you, is one of the best in videogame history. A moment to remember. However the game never hits those highs again. It also loses that just-one-more-run feeling all too quickly when compared to the GameBoy original. A brilliant game, while it lasts.. Pretty good Game, especially in VR. Would suggest with a PSVR and is a good experience.. Never forget, never forgive! #BoycottEnhance #BoycottTetris #FTetsuyaMizuguchi #FtheEpicGamesStore #FEpicGames #FUnrealEngine #Source2ForLife #FTencent. Quite addictive. It's just a casual tetris game but the art, effects, sound design make much difference. The only problem is there's no much content inside.. This wonder **** will reach the 10/10 once it gets the much needed multiplayer. ""Connected"" NEEDS MULTIPLAYER. Other than that, what a spectacular game!. THE ""MEH"" EFFECT. Ok i'm not the Tetris fan boy, but I know it for a long time now, it's been 27 years I played my first Tetris, I never got into it a very long time, never got into a try hard on it, my feeling was the game drops in my hands like soap. So here I am, starting the more acclaimed Tetris for a long time now, and after a short time I land on Da Vinci Stage, suddenly the game has a speed up following the old has-been trans goa music, and yet it is almost impossible to put a simple bloc in the right place, it's makes me think ok it's already the end of it. I'm not convinced at all with the game, I should have tried the demo, the only effect this gave me is a ""meh"" effect, and sure I will miss a full pack of outdated music.. Absolutely beautiful game, this game touched me on a emotional level that I wouldn't have expected from a Tetris game before.. Tetris Effect can be both relaxing and stressful depending on the speed you're at. The soundtrack in the game is phenomenal, I already saved the playlist on Spotify already, My only gripe with this game is the background sometimes, it could be distracting when there are a lot of lights then the speed is like in 12 and above the stress just piles up, but the game is wonderful!. Best effects I have seen so far. Make sure your VR glasses are super clean Graphics 6/10 Story 5/10 Gameplay 9/10. You'd imagine it's nearly impossible to massively improve Tetris without making it lose its essence, but Tetris effect has somehow managed to enhance all the classic features of the game and dunk them in increidibly immersive visuals and music. Can something be stressful and peaceful at the same time? Well, now it is. The game itself keeps you focused and addicted, while the scenes, the music and the dance of colorful particules makes you dive in a tranceful experience. The soundtrack is brilliant, mixing lots of styles in a very positive uplifting and relaxing way.. I'm not sure what's wrong with the users posting negative reviews. Maybe it's toxic masculinity. Maybe they don't really like Tetris. Maybe they don't like puzzle games. Maybe they're afraid of how emotionally powerful and moving Journey mode is. I'm not sure how anyone with a heart and an interest in puzzle games could not fall in love with this game. It's the best Tetris ever made. Tetris never needs to be remade again after this. The soundtrack in Journey mode literally brought me to tears. Play this game on Journey mode with a powerful surround sound system for epic emotional experience. This is one of my favorite ten games of all time. Endlessly replayable and absolutely the most emotionally satisfying puzzle game of all time. I have cried many times playing this game... but then I'm playing it at reference volume with Pioneer Elite THX Ultra receiver and a bi-amped Klipsch 5.1 system. I think that the negative reviewers might not have a good enough audio system to really see the beauty of this game. Look... just give it a shot. And start by playing the game this way: Play Journey mode on beginner, regardless of how good you are, and do not stop playing it until you beat the game. Set aside a couple hours or more if you're not good, and do it only when you can have the volume cranked. Do this and you'll be floored. Seriously... I never thought a puzzle game could make me cry multiple times, but I was literally balling when I finally beat the last level on expert mode... which took a long time for me to be able to do. One of the best games of all time. The music is absolutely fantastic and unforgettably mixed into the way the game is played. Stunning. Ignore the morons giving it negative reviews.. Beautiful yet simple game. Great graphics and awesome music. Great both in VR and nonVR. Masterpiece and fun. It needs dlc and multiplayer support. Thats all its missing.. I haven't played almost none other Tetris games . At least not for last 20 years or more. But this one is amazing, I keep going and coming back. I bought it in April and I only finished the journey mode on beginner around 3 weeks ago. This is the only game 1/1000 that I keep on trying and trying. The visuals and music are amazing and I love the gameplay. I keep getting better and making progress the more I play, This is just not one of the best puzzle games I ever played but one of the best games I played from the last couple of years. I highly recommend it, I am still a n00b with it but I am way better then when I started around 6 months ago.. While Tetris Effect is a beautiful game, a game it feels like I’ve waited my whole life to play—it’s plagued by the very thing that makes it fun: the audio visualizations. If you play Tetris Effect you’ll notice that when moving your tetraminos, a little sound plays to the beat. This is a lot of fun if you play the game to the beat of the music, but if you want to play Tetris as fast as possible the sound cue will slow you down or mess up your accuracy. There’s a solution to this, and it’s called turning the volume off on the game—but then, you don’t get to enjoy the reason you just spent $40 on a Tetris game, and you’re just playing Tetris with a controller which is objectively worse than mouse and keyboard for pin point accuracy. The other issue is that when you level up to the next stage, the beat (or time signature, if we want to get musical) does not consistently transition into the next time signature, it’s very abrupt and jarring and often happens out of sync. For a game that is trying to immerse you in its music and visuals, it shouldn’t be that hard to program loading times between levels to finish a time signature accurately before starting the next one. The biggest problem with Tetris Effect is that the most efficient way to play it is with the volume off, screen zoomed in and the “effect” turned to minimum brightness. Which is just normal Tetris. And it’s a damn shame too, since playing with the music is a lot of fun but it feels like exactly what the title suggests: its an “Effect.” The sounds and music should be aiding you in this game, but instead they work against you. You don’t get rewarded for playing to the rhythm, which in a music game is RIDICULOUS. No score bonus, quickly placing a tetramino to the beat doesn’t give you a little extra time on the next piece, and pieces fall onto the board out of tempo. We could also mention that this is a $40 Tetris game with: - No Online Multiplayer - No Mouse/Keyboard Support - All buttons must be configured even buttons you don’t need to use like camera movement - The right stick has a turn camera that can not be reconfigured. Why would you need to turn your camera in Tetris? This game is a shallow disappointment. All flair and no substance. Smoke and mirrors. An illusive trick. I hope Tetris Effect 2, if it even comes out, handles some of these complaints. Even better, they could patch the game to address these issues. Otherwise this game’s difficulty and challenge is just an “effect.”. Presentation. 9/10 Graphics. 8/10 Music. 8.5/10 Controls. 9.5/10 Fun-factor. 7.5/10 Score. 7.9/10. The best PS4 game I've ever played, the most beautiful game I've ever seen and the most relaxing game I've ever played. Completely expected new groundbreaking game modes judging by the review scores. Instead I got a blurry version of the same 30 year old game with visual effects.. Beautiful, the most enjoyable game of Tetris. If you have PSVR is obligatory to play it, is super cool.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 9 Sound/Music: 9.5 Graphics/Art: 8.5 Story/Atmosphere: 9 OVERALL: 9. Tetris Effect I don’t see the hype Tetris Effect is your standard Tetris game, but there’s an added element of music and visuals… Don’t get me wrong, this game is beautiful and I love the musical elements, but I didn’t find this to be a mind blowing iteration for Tetris… but please keep in mind I played this game as is, without PlayStation vr… that being said Tetris Effect is easily my favorite Tetris game… there are multiple modes, campaign which can take around 3 to 4 hours to complete with multiple difficulty choices as well as an online mode where you can chase scores, just zen out and play Tetris with no game overs.. plenty of variety… I’m more of a campaign guy, so that’s where I stayed and I wasn’t that impressed… The game tricks you by giving you the best level from the jump… the first song is literally the only song in the entire game I cared for.. making me wish they went the rout of licensing music instead of just having originals, the lack of care for the music kind of dampened the experience for me… I was just out of it… focused on the puzzle of tetris while there was noise in the background, except for of course the very first level, I was immersed with the music, the gorgeous visuals in the background… I was so excited to see what more this campaign had to blow me away and it just never came… All in all if you love or enjoy tetris I highly recommend you pick tetris effect up, again its my favorite tetris game to date, but if you’ve never really been into it, theres not enough done here for me to really urge you to give it another shot.. its tetris with modern rules. I give Tetris Effect a 7.5/10. A beautiful version of that genius puzzle game called Tetris. The game looks beautiful, the music matches the visuals and gameplay wonderfully. The controls are also great and responsive. The button layout can be changed to your personal tastes. The only downside to the game is that the journey mode is quite short and a 2 player option would be very welcome. The price is a bit steep, but I definitely recommend to buy the game when it's discounted.. Tetris Effect is a visual audio experience that is extraordinary but misses a few spots to reach perfection. For the regular price tag I want to give it a 7 but as I had really fun with it I decided to give it an 8. Tetris Effect features the old-school Tetris experience combined with many other game modes such as such surprise stages, multi-stages, time attacks, marathon and many more. The core is the ""journey"" where you travel through (20?) different levels with dynamic themed musics and extraordinary graphical support in 4K HDR. Even without PSVR this game features an outstanding game experience. If you like Tetris as a game I highly suggest to get Tetris Effect. The gameplay is easy and fluent. Tutorial is at hand for newer people. You can unlock numerous avatars, soundtracks and more. There must be around 10-15 game modes all with minimal differences but they add up to a meaningful Tetris experience. Although game-play, visuals and audio are superb the game lacks a few things: - There is no multiplayer at all. I think this is a huge missed out opportunity. I m mostly on single player only games but Tetris can be really fun versus others. So this decision makes me a little bit sad. - Some of the visuals block the screen, which is really bothersome when you face levels at speed 10+. In my honest opinion, they SHOULD be fixed because it hurts the game-play experience which should come first before visuals. - The core journey is very short, which is really sad because it is an awesome experience. On normal it took me around an hour to finish which is way too short for the price tag it is sold at. If they would ve double or tripled the size with considerable stage differences the game experience would ve been insane. I want to give this game a 10 because it is awesome but the price tag does not fit. I would suggest to get it at a sale of at least 50%. For this price tag I would probably give it a 8.5 to 9. Still the missed multiplayer opportunity and some visual blockage wont make this a 10 for me. Overall I really like this game and it is a worthwhile experience coming back to Tetris after so many years.. It's a damn good Tetris game except for: 1. No multiplayer - Not even local - This is a big one. 2. There's no way to turn off the particle effects, which can be bothersome. PSVR gives the game very low latency (16ms) and this is the best way to experience it. The best Tetris game in later years is still Tetris DS.. Nice visual effects and nice music, but it is still just Tetris, so the 39,90€ price tag is completely and utterly unjustified. If you find this in a -75% discount or more, it is a buy, but with the current price tag it is just a huge disappointment.. Much more than Tetris. This game is a Synesthesia Symphony. A multisensory experience that triggers one sense by stimulating another. It MUST be played.. Even for a Tetris game this is a very unique way of presenting it. The combination of music to go along with how well you're doing in the board is great. Some of the animations though can block what you're doing on screen sometimes, and I've lost a couple of times because it was moving so fast and I couldn't see where I was dropping a piece due to that. However this is a game that is very soothing and works well to help wind a person down from a long day. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Tetris even a little bit.. The visuals and music fit perfectly to create the best version of Tetris. One of the few games to really take advantage of HDR. I don't have PSVR, but the game is great on its own. This is the type of game I will be pulling out to play at least once a week or so as a palate cleanser from all the FPS & action games I play. Plus, I picked it up for 20 bucks which should have been the original price.. You're probably wondering how Tetris could be worth £30 right? Trust me, this is the best game I have bought in 2018, it is so addictive, so enjoyable. Always asking questions of your talent, and begging you to have one more go. Insta buy status. I haven't even tried it in VR yet.. I was hesitant to spend £35 on Tetris, even after playing the Demo, but now have spent 7.5 hours so far playing it (+ about 2 hours on the demo). Yes it is just Tetris, but played on a board the size of a house, and with fantastic audio and beautiful visuals. I have enjoyed every second I have been playing this game, and I honestly can't say that about many AAA games, as they have their dull moments. This is not the case with Tetris Effect. It is wonderful from the moment you start.. Tetris Effect is easily one of the greatest versions of Tetris ever released. It's also one of the best VR games ever released. With incredible visuals and music, it's an experience you shouldn't miss whether or not you own a PSVR. Though if you don't, you should consider it for this alone. The only real con is that it's short, but with a bunch of modes and difficulty levels it shoulf last you a fair while...especially if you're a completionist.. ....................... TETRIS ist a perfect game. ......................... This is one of the best if not the best version of tetris to date, if you love gameplay you need to get it, but is not only about gameplay it's a completely a new experience a burst of music and light, having PSVR makes it a must buy.. This game is the best Tetris game you will ever find. Stunning visuals, perfect music/sounds. This is a must-buy for everyone that likes Tetris.. It's a shiny Tetris game. 4K and HDR, or VR do not make Tetris ""more fun"". The dynamic soundtrack and visuals don't add much either. I think they missed a huge opportunity to re-release Teterisphere, especially in VR. A much overlooked entry in the vast # of Tetris games, this game would have looked great with new visuals/music/gameplay. They could've added a Tetris game with the package. However, for the price tag, Tetris Effect is a no go.. When I played the demo briefly I thought it was a good gimmick but would not keep me entertained. I was wrong. This is a worthy successor to Tetris. It's actually Tetris like it should be in 2018. The weird part is that it feels and plays like Tetris but you experience it as a totally different game. The visuals are weird but great and accompanied by a very good soundtrack with matching sound effects make this game worth buying. The presentation is very inviting and clean. This is what I would call an AAA puzzler! The only thing I have to warn you about: It's very addictive. Tetris Effect has exceeded my already high expectations of being not only one of the best PSVR titles to release but also the best virtual reality experience ever. The addictive gameplay mixed with eye-watering visuals and music creates a gaming experience that will haunt me in my dreams for many nights to come. After all, the game is named after the strangest phenomena in entertainment.. Awesome game! beautiful music and visual effects! a piece of art very recommended, a local or online multiplayer would be very good to play with friends, Excellent job in this game. Best version of Tetris ever created and an amaxing experience in VR akin to thumper and REZ infinite. You enter a zen state that is almost opiate like. Everything is top notch aside from the high price but I don't regret a single cent, it's just so damn addicting, chill and at times heart pumping. If you like Tetris or liked REZ/Thumper this is a must buy if you don't mind the price.. Tetris finally became art It may not have a direct online multiplayer or local, but it compensates on music, visuals and apresentation. This game has some awesome effects. It is one of the best PSVR experiences. I also like the playlists and how they are set by mood. But it has no multiplayer, not even local. $40 is bit too much, and I expect multiplayer at that price.. No review can sum up the magic of this game. Even if you arent a puzzle game fan, try it. You wont regret it.","the game was really fun, its just like any other tetris game it will make u really mad or really happy . i bought the game primarily for the online multiplayer and it proved to be a huge let down . overall, i don't enjoy this game ."
429.Fez,"It's a very creative and unique puzzle game. I really liked solving the puzzles. The graphics are very cute. I had a problem with the map. I constantly got lost and it was tiring having to go back and forth all the time during the game. I think it would be better if I could focus more on the puzzles and less at remembering where I went.. Genuinely one of the most genius games I’ve ever played. The only issue I have with it is how someone is supposed to do some of the puzzles and decipher the language without a guide. But other than that, really one of the best games I’ve ever played.. I enjoy Fez for it's beautiful art style and unique gameplay. However there is way too much back tracking and that is something that I hate in videogames. Seeing something in the beginning **** but not being able to do anything until you come back towards the very end is such an annoying thing that developers need to stop doing. It's such a tease when you are shown something new that you cannot access and it distracts you from what you are already supposed to be enjoying. Many secrets and new areas are kept from you, requiring you to go back to the same areas long after you are finished with them. This game is nonstop when it comes to this issue and I really can't stand it. It isn't rewarding and it can be confusing when trying to make progress. Missing something requires you to back track through multiple doors, warp gates and repeated puzzle platforms. I found myself feeling less rewarded halfway through the game and more like wanted to just be done with it. I do not want to finish the game because I don't think it will make me feel like I accomplished something or had fun, which is how I hoped I would feel when I first started playing the game. Overall the art is very pleasing to me and the music is nicely done. There seemed to be some pretty interesting lore behind the world and its characters but I didn't get far enough to tie it all together. I really liked the puzzles and never had any trouble solving them it's just the constant warping, jumping, climbing and trying to go back and forth that really makes this game hard to enjoy. I do not like being forced to traverse the same levels over and over to progress in a game but unfortunately that is mostly what this game is. I don't like the map of the world and I absolutely hate not being able to fully complete a level until I have completed several other levels. Game designers should not make a game where things can not be completed in order! It makes the player have to worry about remembering to come back to places they already fully explored which is BORING. The player wants new things and to progress in a straight forward process that doesn't make you constantly wonder if you missed something in a previous level! This is very unfortunate because of this one thing, Fez goes from a charming and care free puzzle platformer to an exhausting mess that is slow and mind numbing. I really hope someone reads this before buying this game because it seems like such a good time in the beginning and you slowly just don't want to keep going anymore.. Great little game, amazing soundtrack and art. Immersive and unusual, one of the most interesting games i ever played.. The last game me and my ex-gf played before we broke up. I will never look at this game without tears in my eyes.. The good: Great work from PixelArt. It is not necessary to have all the collectibles to finish the game the first time. If you want to see the true ending you must collect 32 normal cubes, 32 anti-cubes, four artifacts, some maps, and three pieces of heart (leaving all the rooms of the maps with a gold frame). If you want to have an intellectual challenge within the game (without guide) It involves learning their numbering system and writing system. It has New Game + to give a review of the rooms where there are hidden cubes using another perspective. Any of the three finals is terrific. The bad: once you've found the joke, the game ""gets easier to complete."" The gliched room can be a processing challenge for early Xbox 360 models (and more so if you're trying to see it first-person on New Game +). Not backward compatible with Xbox One / Series What Meh: Seriously, the little man is named Gomez. By following a guide, anyone with patience gets 100% out of it. It is recommended to play with a controller that correctly serves the vibration in both triggers since these are used for rooms with anti-cubes. There is an anti-cube number 33 but discovering it generates a glitch that blocks the collector achievements and ends the game with all the collectibles. Fun experience; compelling story; decent physics; good looking retro graphics; cool and unique interface. The codes and stuff are rather brutal, but there's a lot of support online to mitigate the most enigmatic of them. Some levels rather hard to suss out how to complete; also, the interconnections between levels get really hard to navigate as the game progresses. In spite of these gripes, the overall quality of the finished product is amazing. Really too bad there won't be a sequel. Politically speaking, I recognize the desire to lavish negativity on Mr. Phil, but at this point he's long since been trolled out of the industry. This review is for anyone considering whether to plop down the two or three dollars to pick up a copy: it's fun and cool, a huge and absorbing **** least it was for me. The negative reviews here are largely attacks on the creator, and it's safe to trust the critic reviews if you're just wondering whether it's worth a go. The game-play and overall feeling of the universe are very different from Paper Mario (oft cited by those wishing to downplay Fez's innovations). Is Fish a bad guy? I don't know. He seems to have said quite a number of inane and hypocritical things. Is Fez an awesome game? Hell yes. Does the former have bearing on the latter? Not much. It's like telling someone that Being and Time was not a monumental work because Heidegger was a member of the **** party. Sartre never would have happened without Heidegger, nor Derrida. Fez, a monument in the history of gaming?! Sure, I'll tick that check box.. An amazing puzzle/platformer that has so much more to it than meets the eye! Simple to grasp and dive into with game play and sound track that keeps you playing. This is the kind of game that really is for about everyone; play through once and just solve the simple puzzles, or play again and actually dive into the language of the game and find yourself decoding hieroglyphics on the walls. Fez is very satisfying and never gets the feeling of becoming old. I was quite sad to figure out that this game would not be getting a sequel and that the creator ended up being a huge tool. The only thing that got this game a below perfect rating is the fact that it doesn't offer any kind of co-op and the fact that developer Phil Fish insulted so many fans, and really all gamers, after it's release.. If this game was made for the sake of 'artistic expression', then we already have that with good gameplay in EVE Online. Glad I didn't spend money on this crap. I only regret exposing my PC's internals to potential depression due to installing terribad software.. I got this game in a Humble Bundle and so came to it a fair bit later on than it's release. I'd read about it generally being a kind of nostalgic and finely crafted game. In response to this I would just say that I don't remember any classic platformers having zero consequence for failure, and the music sounds just like a random haze, totally unlike the finely crafted 16 and 32 bit stuff of 20 years ago. I was pretty underwhelmed by Fez, but can't really be too sad, having just gotten it in a bundle.. Great game but many of the puzzles are extremely cryptic and require many guides on the internet to figure out. Worth playing for the graphics/sound/level design. However I ran into the same save game corruption bug after getting gold on countless platforms. Now I have to start again from scratch. Deleted the game from my hard drive.. Fez is a breath of fresh air in this console generation. It's innovative game world is brilliant and fun to navigate. It's retro style is a façade for a very new experience. It moves away from the hand holding that is becoming prevalent in this generation of games. Fez creates an excellent sense of exploration and is backed up with outstanding gameplay.. This game is one of the best games I've ever played. Anyone who says its easy obviously didn't get very far. The puzzles go from simple to near impossible, for the final heart pieces.. Wicked game, so cool!! Has so many great characteristics! Should definitely go far. Just watched ""Indie Game: The Movie"", and it looks like the development is getting even better than it is!! Watch the movie. The game ideas are awesome the scenarios are colorful and beatiful this is a perfect game to relax and have fun with i simply loved it some people says ""that game is or something like that but the gameplay itself is an expression of the developer so the game deserves an 10 out of 10 simply an art in a video game. Overall a terrible game. Not fun at all and not to mention phil fish is a ****. The game is extremely boring and all the oh so revolutionary concepts in the game were used many times before. Not worth buying. Extremely boring and nothing happens at all times. Also extremely easy. I'm glad I didn't buy this and only played it from a friend's steam account. This is not a game for a mind that wants challenges, but rather for someone that has enough challenges in real life and only wants a method to unwind. Why does it cost more than 50 cents?. Absolutely loved it. 2D to 3D transition mechanic is great. This should have just stayed on Xbox, the PC port was pretty bad. Otherwise an amazing game. I would recommend this to anyone.. Very esoteric puzzler... maybe I came looking for the wrong thing (fun game play) and failed to enjoy what is really here (ambiance and mood lighting) but this was just not my cup of tea. I found this game to be very boring once the novelty of the Escher space wore off (about 2-3 hours in for me).. Loved the game for about 30 mins then my save file was corrupted. Started again and this time after about an hour the same thing happened. Third time it only took about 40 mins. Tried once more a few weeks ago and got about 45 mins into it. Great idea, gameplay and music but completely broken. Waste of money.. Ah yes, Fez the as seen in Indie Game: The Movie. It had lots of hype for a platformer, so you know it's not going to live up to it. But, this game was way worse than even my expectations. It's incredibly slow and boring for a platformer and the sound effects/music were so distracting and annoying you can only play on mute. Anyway, Fez **** IMO.. Put aside all the politics of Phil Fish and the arguing over save bugs, if you're coming to Fez fresh now you're in for a treat. This is a game of two halves, the first about exploring a bizarre and vibrant world where your focus is not on combat but finding your way through. Once you've finished the game once it really begins to shine. The second play-through is all about unravelling some amazing and devious puzzles that will constantly surprise you. Fez is not just puzzle platformer it's more like an intricate layered puzzle box that just goes deeper and deeper.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I thoroughly enjoy Fez. After the first 'introductory' period... navigating easier levels... seemingly the second half of the game's difficulty is significantly increased. The difficulty spike does feel somewhat harsh as there are puzzles that are a fair amount tougher to solve and perhaps may put some players off... so much that they don't care for completing the game. The look, sound but overall ""feel"" (a subjective term, I know) of the game is one that I miss from most games today... in the world of shooters we video game players live in. Disasterpeace's soundtrack fits the game perfectly... accompanying the sense of exploration, confusion and adventure that a player feels, traveling through the world Polytron has created. The 2D/3D shift mechanic is quite an accomplishment and actually quite lovely to figure out. An enormous game with plenty of time to enjoy it. (8.67/10 rounded up to 9). Fez is a perfect game. Underneath the layers of exploration and beautiful scenery is a story about growing up, about life, about adventure and about looking beyond our 2 dimensional lives at the bigger picture. While there is no permanent death in the game, you will be challenged in both reflex and wits. There is a reason this game took so long to come out, it wasn't released until it was perfect. Fez will make you laugh, it will make you smile, it may even make you cry, to me it was and always will be a perfect game. Thank you Polytron.. Easily one of the best games I've played on the XBOX 360, let alone the Arcade. Fez is an intuitive puzzle platformer that challenges players to think, which is also why you'll see so many bad ratings for it. Because people that gave this game a bad review are stupid.. What makes FEZ so wonderful isn't just the art style, the music, the cute Adipose-Like protagonist Gomez, or even the mind boggling perspective switching. FEZ succeeds so triumphantly because all of these aspects coalesce into game that is fun, inventive, and, probably most importantly, interesting. While arguments can be made as to its originality, even the borrowed aspects of the game, like the desirable and well executed faux-8-bit art style, all feed into the experience that makes the most of simplicity. I won't make promises that this game is truly revolutionary or that it will be the best game you've ever played, but I rate it a 10 because it does something that no game has done for me since my young childhood; it intrigued me. While I am usually dominated by an achievement hunting approach to games, I found myself going out of my way to solve puzzles that weren't pertinent to my present goals. I got off my couch and downloaded a QR scanner on my iPad to see what the game was hiding from me. And, every step of the way, I felt like I was learning the game. If you can think in three dimensions (and what modern gamer can't?) then learning to navigate this title doesn't take very long. However, you can still constantly be learning new tricks to move about more quickly, discover the treasure maps that will unlock secrets you may have been stuck on for hours, feel like a genius when you can finally read the Tetromino puzzles, or even how to use the daunting map system! There wasn't a moment of the game that I didn't feel like I was growing as a participant. Another incredibly important and enjoyable aspect of FEZ is its respect for gaming. The game is full of nods, nostalgia and throwbacks that never dominate the game, but may just make you smile, even if it's as simple as your Dot companion saying, ""Hey, Listen!"" Similarly, though the platforming may look like any old Super Mario bros installment, it still feels like its own. I'm not claiming that FEZ has reinvented platform jumping, but it has certainly done well in making this game its own. The aesthetic of the game is also very noteworthy.Unlike Sonic The Hedgehog 4, it doesn't take the glory days of side-scrolling and slap a 3D texture on it, nor does it try to be an 8-bit game with a limited color palette and weak animation. The art style screams ""retro"" in sight and sound, but it is so much more than that. The use of the 8-bit style not only increases the game's accessibility to newcomers and nay-sayers, but it also permits FEZ the freedom from the weighty expectations of a more graphically intense title. In doing so, it allows itself a more open and imaginative feel. The narrative never gets more complex than, ""Hey, this just happened. Go fix it."" And in a lot of ways, that's great. Your concern is the gameplay and having as much fun as you can learning the game. So, gathering a lot of cubes is silly. You're wearing a fez and playing MC Escher's wildest dreams, so who cares? All in all, this game is fantastic. As an FPS player, I never thought a side scroller could invigorate me as much as FEZ has. Even after I spent $500 on Halo 4 and beat its campaign on solo Legendary, I was never as truly engages as I was hopping around the delightful squares and curious cliff sides as the ever so adorable Gomez. Don't load up the game thinking your world will change from a $10 indie title, because it won't! Like Portal and Braid before it, FEZ simply takes ideas you know, love, and have probably mastered, and turns it on its side with a single mechanic that really is a game changer in every sense of the phrase. Pairing that with a beautiful setting and a soulful construction, FEZ is not a game you should pass up. This game feels right, it plays right, it looks right, and you can really tell that Polytron cares to make a great game; I can confidently say that they have. Pick up that controller, don that multi-dimensional headgear, and try not to smile. I dare you.. Love the gameplay and features, the sounds and graphics make it look old school and reminds you of the good 'ole times. But the lack of co-op or multiplayer makes you feel lonely and the player feels slightly sluggish moving around, especially on vines.. This is simply great!! The mood and atmosphere are tranquil and peaceful while the world is vividly colorful and beautiful. The music and sounds are equally beautiful, peaceful and colorful. You can really feel the personality of this game. It actually feels like it means something and has purpose behind it. This is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played!!! It has a lot of innovative gameplay as well. It really puts a smile on my face when you flip perspectives and three ladders or platforms that are miles apart from one perspective perfectly lineup from another. Buy this game!! It's only $10 and it's definitely an experience every gamer should have. This made me realize games don't have to be a $100 million production to be great..

It's a 2d platformer with a 3d twist, you rotate the level around which makes other areas reachable etc. I really cannot do it justice in words, all I can say is that it is beautiful and enchanting and needs to be played. The music and atmosphere is perfect and it really immerses you in it's cute pixelated world. It's a bit like Cave Story, only much better! It's the first game since my c64 days where I have had a pen and paper to hand to decipher in-game codes / languages etc. There is also a part where you scan a barcode using an iphone / android phone and it gives you a code, I wont say any more as I don't want to ruin any surprises but this game is the first game in years to make you feel fully immersed in it's world, so far so that you have pages of scrawls and puzzles to figure out on paper while playing. You are never sure what will be coming next and feels like a step up from standard video games where you repeat the same thing over and over. This is the best game I've played so far this year, just fun, innovative and back to it's retro roots. If you don't like this game you have no soul.. I haven't got to the end yet but have been to most of the ""worlds"" and here's my interpretation this far. The worlds are all amazing looking. Phil Fish is a very talented artist and his work on Fez is perfectly suited. Id give the art a 9/10 since there is some repetitiveness and a lack of variety in color. The gameplay is fun but it too gets repetitive. I find myself unable to play the game for long sessions as it gets boring after an hour or so and I need to put it down due to the repetition. However, the polish of the gameplay is evident as the puzzles work just as expected and what must have been a very hard challenge to code was done very well, it is fluid and error free. The navigation of the game is probably my biggest problem with it. You will feel lost at times, and the worst part is, you will end up going through the same place more than a few times trying to figure out where to go next, and the map is of very little help (its too simple to help). Overall its nothing revolutionary but I think the creator got what he expected from the game, a peaceful adventure for players to relax, enjoy the scenery and do some fun puzzles. But since the gameplay is lacking and the repetitiveness is evident I would not feel right giving it an 8 where so many other indie games deserve that score or higher so 7 it is, not a bad score and I would say its worth playing but I'm not sure if Id buy it again.. Simply put: Fez is my vote for game of the year. You need to play this game to understand the depth and genius of the design. Its games like this that revive my faith in the industry and comes as a welcome change.. For anybody out there that actually believes Fez is just an indie platformer with a gimmick, a cool soundtrack, and retro graphics couldn't be more wrong. This game is pure insanity. After you beat the game for the first time, it breaks loose into madness. The notes you have to write for this game come straight out of a serial killers notebook. Fez is crazy. Phil Fish is crazy. Video games are awesome.. I just picked this game up and was only going to play a little bit before bed and I ended up playing for an hour and a half. It's a fun addictive game.. All of the mid to low user reviews are by people who obviously did not 'get' this game at all. I mean wow, I'm shocked by what they are saying: ""plainly in sight block collecting""? This game is deep beyond belief, but it's obvious that most people just never figured anything out. Discovering the secrets in this game and just the overall feel of the game puts it in my top 5 favorite games of all time. No hand holding, truly difficult puzzle solving, this is a classic even if the COD generation doesn't understand. What a shame that there are actually people who played this game and thought that there was only little blocks to collect and jumping from platform to platform. Do yourself a favor and do not look at online guides to spoil the secrets--when you finally crack them it will be much more rewarding than just reading how things work and doing it.. Wow this game is great! Great platforming, no annoying parts, funny script and instantly entertaining! Sometimes the puzzles can get a bit too challenging, for the age group this is aimed at.. I fail to get ANY errors, in fact, the game runs beautifully. AMAZING level design, controls are fantastic. The game looks wonderful and the environment in very accessible. the only thing that is a little weak would be the storyline, but who needs that when you have such a fantastic experience otherwise. Absolutely beautiful 2D platformer with a modern twist. Pure ambience and abstraction melded into an dreamy, self contained world that seems to go on forever. If you love Super Meat boy, Limbo, Mario and Sonic, and just platformers in general (of which there is not many in the 21st century), you won't be disappointed.. Fez is one of the most breathtaking games I have played in a long time, the colours are amazing, the music breathtaking, and gameplay is great although the 3d turning has been done before, Fez does a great job with the mechanic. This game is a must buy.. As an indie dev myself along with full time QA Tester, this game is fantastic!!! There are many complaints about the game being too easy and dying has no punishment. I think this was a good call in that the world of FEZ was definitely set up to pull you into it. Simply reseting the character makes you at times have to restart areas over, but prevents from really taking you out of the game. Honestly, what difference would a punishment make other than more screens to go through? The game did take 5 years to develop and does have issues with crashing, which at times can be annoying. Here's the thing guys, those doing the cert for xbox live only have a limited time with it. They're not going to find these in that time. Also,this game was also only made by ONE guy! Overall I greatly enjoyed the world of Fez and my journey through it. It was a nice game after a long day to play through, with lots and lots of charm. My major complaint is that the music sometimes gets a little old, and randomly changes levels of volume. Other than that it lost points for the resets to the dashboard, but with knowing some of the background of this game, I throughly enjoyed it and felt it was well worth the $10. This game could be **** it ever worked. In the intro alone there was a fatal error that caused the game to crash and restart. I tried again, only to have it crash on me a second time. Within 30mins of attempted game play, Fez crashed twice, chat windows would randomly change location and size (while trying to read the same sentence), and the graphics glitched out. It's a shame really as the game could be **** I could play it.. It is such a shame that a lot of people are giving such bad reviews just because the developer had an opinion you disagreed with. It really shows the true face of the internet, an **** Do you feel invincible behind your screen? Do you enjoy hurting one another? You are the cancer of the internet, you do not deserve it. As for my review of this game, its god damn amazing. I'd like to address the negative points that are being told. People are claiming it to be just a simple flash game, with no challenge, no objective and just a gimmick holding it together. It is far from simple. There is a HUGE amount of challenge, you just haven't realised it. The intention of the game was to create a non-threatening environment to explore. You respawn when you fall for a reason, there are no enemies, no bosses for a reason. The game encourages you to explore at your own pace. It gives you a simple objective of collecting cubes, but its up to you to find the new clue, and to solve the puzzle that is Fez. The game is nothing short of fantastic. It had me writing sheets of symbols down to try and solve it, sheets of ridiculous theories that made just a tiny bit of sense in my brain. I kept searching and finding more clues, just this game did not hold my hand, it set me free into its world. The presentation is also great, the visuals are very clean and crisp, and the environments are beautiful. The music is astounding and definiately one of Disasterpeace's best albums to date. Its simply gorgeous. I haven't come across any bugs or crashs like a lot of people are complaining about, little hiccups here and there are the worst of my experiences. Please do not trust the negative reviewers, they are simply trying to hurt, destroy, our internet.. One of my favorite games so far this year.. The fact that it required the internet -- the collective hive-mind of humanity -- over a week to solve the last puzzle is unprecedented. Solving some of the puzzles in this game without help is one of the most rewarding experiences gaming has to offer right now. The art's beautiful. The sound track's awesome. The elements of the world make so much sense together, it's almost kind of magical. The only problem I have with it is the inconsistent frame rate. Hopefully, when Phil Fish gets around to porting it this to PC, that will no longer be an issue. Highly recommended.. FEZ on the whole, presents an atypical approach to its world design by presenting a pixelated 2D world in 3D terms. The concept of turning 2D to 3D isn't new; this concept can be seen in Paper Mario (by Nintendo) and Crush (by Sega). What is new is the use of pixels instead of completely flat polygons. This is a credit to Renaud BÃ¨dard's programming ability, even though he's new to the game programming realm, the world he coded for FEZ with those pixels is warm, cute and somewhat inviting; however, its not very engaging. There's nothing that draws you personally into FEZ's world and you don't get the same sense of imminent danger that the game wants to present to you. FEZ's story is that he has to find smaller bits of larger cubes in order to keep his world from disappearing. But you don't get a sense of that at all in the game's world, from the initial explanation of the story at the beginning of the game nor at the end of the game. None of the non-playable characters give you that sense either. So, since there are no time limits, ""lives"", or much of a story, you end up with an experience that has only the following three elements left: The 2D world that's viewable in three dimensions, exploration and puzzles. The 2D spin-able world looks nice. The color palette has a nice range of colors, but your eyes will beg for more. AT least mine were like that, I definitely desired to see more depth and variations in the color choices as I played the game. The creators of this game wanted it to be some kind of love letter to old games in the past, so you're only getting a color palette that's a bit better than what the original Nintendo Entertainment System could display. Moving around FEZ's world feels a bit slow due to how the main character moves and I did have one or two issues with the game play itself. After playing for an hour or more, when I went to spin the world to get another perspective to see what I had to jump on next, this action seems to happened slower and slower with each passing minute I played over that hour. When that started to happen, jumping became a minor issue as the movement would stutter. Like many other users, I did experience the crash back to the Xbox's Home screen. Fortunately, I felt that these didn't make the game unplayable, as you can quickly get back to where you left off if you restart your Xbox if these problems start occurring. I'm hoping a future patch will clear these issues up. The map isn't very helpful in finding where you are and where you've been, so I mostly skipped it in favor keeping track of places with that notebook I was using to keep puzzle hints. As for the puzzles, which outside the 2D/3D thing, is the core of FEZ, there's not much I can say without giving away hints or cause spoilers to appear in this review. The puzzles do range from the very easy, like pushing a block onto a switch to some more obtuse and abstract puzzles where being observant is the key to figuring out the answer, which allows you to get another cube piece. I think Brain Lord for the SNES had harder puzzles to figure out. But I can't really compare those two games since they are different experiences all around in navigating to the next puzzles with in the game world. Finally to the exploration aspect of the game; which I thought was a bit tough to do. Most puzzle platformers give you something to draw you into the experience. Since many of these games like FEZ rely heavily on puzzles, most of them bring you into the experience by using sound effects or music. Unfortunately for FEZ, the music is a selection of soft ambient tunes; they were so soft at times, it felt almost nonexistent to me. The chiptune sounds aren't bad in the slightest, they are wonderfully composed pieces. But having something with a bit more pep or using music to add to the tension would have gone a long way in making the game more enjoyable while you're wandering around collecting cubes and solving puzzl",i really liked solving the puzzles and never had any trouble solving them . the only issue is how someone is supposed to do some of the puzzles and decipher the language without a guide . it's such a tease when you are shown something new that you cannot access .
43.The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,"When The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask launched for the Nintendo 64 in 2000, lauded as the sequel to Ocarina of Time, it had enormous shoes to fill. However, it didn’t just live up to expectations—it carved its own distinct legacy. With its darker tone, innovative mechanics, and emotional depth, Majora’s Mask is not only one of the greatest Zelda titles but also one of the best games ever created. Alongside Ocarina of Time, it stands as a pillar of gaming history, earning a well-deserved 10/10.A Unique and Bold ApproachUnlike most Zelda games, Majora’s Mask eschews the typical “save the princess, defeat the evil” formula for something far more nuanced and experimental. It places players in a world caught in a relentless three-day cycle, introducing a sense of urgency and vulnerability that had never been seen in the series. This mechanic not only defines the gameplay but also creates a palpable connection to the world and its inhabitants, as every second feels meaningful.A Rich and Immersive WorldMajora’s Mask presents a world brimming with life, yet overshadowed by impending doom. Termina feels both familiar and unsettling, offering players an environment that constantly evolves as the in-game clock ticks. The NPCs aren’t mere background characters; they have schedules, personalities, and struggles that unfold dynamically over the three-day cycle. This unprecedented level of detail made the game world feel alive in a way that few games at the time could achieve.Innovative Gameplay MechanicsThe three-day time loop is not just a narrative gimmick—it’s the core of the gameplay. Players must strategize, plan, and manage their time effectively to progress. The innovative use of masks, each with its unique abilities, adds layers of complexity and variety to the gameplay, encouraging experimentation and rewarding curiosity.Furthermore, the game challenges players with puzzles and dungeons that are among the most creative in the series. Each dungeon feels like a meticulously crafted experience, blending challenging mechanics with emotional storytelling.Atmosphere and Emotional DepthMajora’s Mask is a masterclass in atmosphere. The game’s haunting soundtrack, eerie visuals, and pervasive sense of urgency create a mood unlike anything else in the Zelda franchise. While other games in the series focus on grand heroism, Majora’s Mask delves into themes of loss, regret, and resilience, resonating on a deeply emotional level.This emotional depth is not confined to the protagonist’s journey. The world itself reflects these themes, with every character grappling with their own struggles. Helping them overcome their challenges often yields moments of profound satisfaction and connection, making Termina feel like a living, breathing place.Technical AchievementIt’s worth noting that Majora’s Mask was developed in just over a year, a feat that makes its depth and polish even more remarkable. Built on the foundation of Ocarina of Time, it pushed the Nintendo 64’s capabilities to their limits, delivering stunning visuals, smooth animations, and an unforgettable **** It Deserves a 10/10Majora’s Mask is not just a great Zelda game—it’s a masterpiece of game design and storytelling. It dared to take risks, introducing bold mechanics and a tone that stood apart from its predecessor. Its time-loop structure, emotional narrative, and rich world-building make it a standout experience, even decades later.Alongside Ocarina of Time, it represents the pinnacle of what the Zelda series—and gaming as a whole—can achieve. Both games complement each other, with Ocarina of Time delivering a quintessential hero’s journey and Majora’s Mask offering a more introspective, emotionally complex experience.LegacyEven today, Majora’s Mask stands as a testament to the power of creativity and innovation in gaming. Its themes, mechanics, and atmosphere continue to inspire developers and captivate players. For those who crave a game that challenges both their mind and heart, Majora’s Mask remains an unforgettable journey.ConclusionMajora’s Mask deserves its place among the greatest games ever made. Its bold design, emotional depth, and immersive world-building make it a timeless classic. Paired with Ocarina of Time, it showcases the unparalleled brilliance of the Zelda series, proving that games can be art, adventure, and emotional storytelling all at once.. second part of ooc, there is no need to say more. I mean, its the second part of the best video game ever. IDK why. I have heard that this game is the best in the series and was really excited for it. I have played it on the N64, 3DS, and Switch all of which I thought were underwhelming. I don't really like the whole day cycle thing and find it limiting. The only reason I rated it this high is because I've heard others praise it and so I don't get death threats.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is ultimately my favorite game ever. With such a dark atmosphere and a great story, this genre-defining masterpiece is truly a work of art and a once in a lifetime experience. This game's dark themes and sad story this is a first for Nintendo. Not only this but it excels in innovative and creative gameplay. The idea of using masks to give yourself special abilities and even transforming into different races is truly a first. Every aspect of this game has something to love. Not to mention awesome collectibles and side content; containing some of the best and most heart-wrenching side quests in gaming, including much of challenging gameplay that is still fun, and to think that it's all optional. There's also amazing and creative dungeons, although there are only four, those four are some of the best dungeons ever. They each have unique puzzles and different rooms while all still interconnecting in some way and somehow still maintaining a theme. There are also unique bosses for each dungeon with not a single reused attack and even gaining new attacks as the fight goes on. The final quest is also exceptional, I won't spoil it but it is an amazing experience and even rewards you for collecting all masks. The true Majora's Mask experience will change the way you see games as a whole and it truly stands up as one of the greatest games to every grace this earth.. Absolutely amazing piece of art. Masterpiece of a Zelda game, shocking this game was made in the time frame the devs where given.. Majora's Mask was one of the first video games I ever played, and from that day on, I fell in love with it. The first thing that captivated me was its stunning aesthetics. This wasn’t just any game—it was the legendary tale of a young boy striving to save the world of Termina. Like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask is a magnum opus from Nintendo. It showcases their creative peak, delivering an unforgettable and truly amazing experience. Words can't describe it all, you have to experience The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is one of my top 10 favorite games. Everything about it feels almost perfect. The dark and vibrant premise - a moon that threatens to set in three days and destroy the world - is truly unique. You alone hold everyone's fate in your hands. Little by little you will witness how the people of Termina come to terms with their impending doom. Each character reacts differently: some are afraid, others are sad, some experience moments of joy, and others achieve redemption. I've never seen another game accomplishing this level of emotional resonance and realism. The phenomenal and eerie soundtrack and sound design make the premise even more clear. Each character in the game feels like an unique and individual person with their own backstories and problems. This game also has the best side quests I've ever seen because they're tied to the characters and story or just plain fun. The world/worldbuilding, dungeons, puzzles and the actual gameplay are also great. So why isn't Majora's Mask a 10/10 for me? This is because some puzzles or heart pieces are almost impossible to find blindly. While the dungeons are all very good, they fall just short of perfection—except for the Stone Tower Temple, which is flawless. However, even this temple has a weakness: its boss is underwhelming. Similarly, the final boss could have been much better. At times, the game would have benefited from giving the player subtle hints or clearer guidance about what to do during certain passages. Overall Majora`s Mask would be a god-level game (10/10) but because of the small problems it narrowly missed this rating. Definitely worth playing. 9,99/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me personally, this is the greatest game ever made. Not an exaggeration. After 31 years and thousands of games played, having played games since I could even comprehend life, this is the peak of all of them. Every single aspect of this game is perfection, even with its quirks. There is NOTHING that I would change about it, aside from the quality of life improvements included in the 3DS remaster. It’s the only piece of media that has ever made me tear up after experiencing it, and I feel an intense amount of nostalgia and emotional longing every time I play it again. I don’t think anything will ever come close to this game.. Once again, The Legend of Zelda series puts Link in another huge, puzzling adventure with one dungeon after another. However, this never gets repetitive. Majora's Mask could possibly be one of the best Zelda games ever. Although the game centers solely around just three days, there are so many things you, as Link, can do. Everything is timed perfectly. What you do one day will affect what happens the next for better or for worse. Everyone will always be at one certain place at one certain time. Nothing is random in this game, which makes it perfect for a time-traveling adventure. Everything is positioned according to time. The graphics also jump a step higher than Ocarina of Time's, keeping out glitches that nearly killed Ocarina of Time. The music is also really great. Koji Kondo put a lot more effort into this game than Ocarina of Time. I bought the soundtrack to Ocarina of Time, which was a waste of money since the music was really low. I got Majora's Mask's soundtrack for free with a subscription and expected it to be like Ocarina of Time's, but I was amazed at how movie-like some of it gets. For the record, I got the soundtrack before I got the game. The game, although it only has four dungeons, is not short at all. A lot of time will be spent running through Clock Town as a Deku Scrub at the beginning. Like all puzzle games, frustrating points pop up frequently, like trying to reach Snowhead Mountain, for example. This game could have been better if it was maybe a bit easier in some points. If you get the chance, you should really try this game out. Although I prefer the story and gameplay of Ocarina of Time (in my opinion surpassing it in general) this game is also excellent and you should definitely give it a try.. I personally like the 3ds version but both versions are amazing. The more scary take on the Zelda games was a shot in the dark, BUT IT HIT! This game is an almost masterpiece, better than Ocarina of Time. The only problem I have is the vagueness of the game. I constantly had to use google to help me get through the game. Am I dumb... maybe. But the point still stands that it is very hard to find what the frick to do. Besides that the sound track is really calming and the map is really cool. This game is a must play.. the best N64 game and one of the best zelda games of all time, great game... Majora's Mask, huh? Oh, I get it, the 'dark and deep' Zelda that everyone pretends to love. Please! You spend three days running around doing favors for people who are crying about lost chickens or missing masks. It’s like you’re playing as a delivery boy with a sword!And don’t even get me started on the time limit. Oh yeah, what a brilliant idea: let’s slap a countdown of three days on you while you’re trying to solve the problems of an entire town! You’re running back and forth, and if you don’t make it, guess what? Back to square one! What fun, right? And what’s with the transformation mechanic? Changing forms is cool, but it’s a hassle to keep switching masks all the time. This isn’t a game; it feels like a day at the office! If you think Majora's Mask is genius, you probably love waiting in line at the bank too. For me, it’s just another trick to hide the fact that the game lacks real content!. best horror Zelda game!!! must play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. My absolute FAVORITE game, if not of all time. The music alone is better then 90% of other games I've played (the 10% being Hollow Knight, Ultrakill and a dash of TF2). Game gets pretty complicated at times with the time traveling, but it’s still so great. Mechanics and gameplay are so smooth and operative. This is an N64 classic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the frist Zelda i've ever played and completed. And, one of the best. By far, it has the best character composition and depth of all zeldas. It made simple background NPCs into fleshed out characters with different personalities. The game is sad, dreadful and awesome. It has great dungeons and understandable mechanics. All of this doesn't really mean it's perfect. It does have its flaws. For example, while the mechanics are understandable, it has some annoyance to it. Thereare segments where some mechanics are hard to pull off. And some failures require a re run of a dugeon. And, it has a really complicated third dungeon. The three day cycle, while being a new and interesting thing, really makes the difficult factor spike up. It really pressures you to complete the dungeons in a fast matter, and, unless pausing a lot, affects the feel of exploration on dungeons and the overworld. But it helps to think a head of time! 9/10. Recommended 100%! Just, take in mind it WILL be difficult for new players.. Just play it. It's so good. It's such an adventure with many deep themes. The gameplay is some of the most innovative of its time and I genuinely love how it expands on the world of the Legend of Zelda.. Creativity is on display, story is interesting and exciting for the time the time loop mechanic is wonderfully executed. 10/10 on of the best games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Each game has its essence, this can have negative points at certain moments such as the theme of the days passing, or how if you make a mistake in a mission you have to restart, but since I played Ocarina and this one they have everything a fan is looking for .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply put in the least amount of words possible as to why i love this **** Gripping time mechanics,the great characters,the really good and pretty damn dark story and some of the best dungeon designs in the series.Masterpiece,. While Majora's Mask may on a surface level be a large step away from its iconic predecessor, this experimentation allows it to set itself apart from its older brother as an amazing game in its own right. This game achieves the greatest atmosphere of any game in the LoZ series; the bleak, unsettling and most of all strange setting of Termina gives Majora's Mask an identity all of its own. Similarly, the game's focus on time and a 3 day structure allows for quests that aren't possible in any other LoZ game and Majora's Mask focus on sidequests allows for plenty of side content that rewards the player for getting involved in the world and gives them more motivation for wanting to stop the moon from falling other than just being to ""defeat the evil opponent"" or ""beat the game"". While this does come at the cost of there being less main story content and less dungeons which may be a strong negative for some hardcore Zelda fans, this engaging world and side content makes up for it and ultimately succeeds in offering up something Ocarina of Time never could rather than attempting to beat it at its own game. The only real flaw I have with this game is how limited Link's new masks can feel. While the transformation masks are amazing additions and some other masks such as the bunny hood or stone mask can offer great bonuses, its a shame how many of them are just fodder for beating sidequests or obtaining a heart piece this combined with plenty of items being removed from OoT and not many new ones being added outside of the masks leads this Link to feel less versatile than his predecessors despite having multiple forms he can take.. I think this game is criminally underrated just because it uses the same assets and ocarina of time. This game is so unique in the fact its world building and character design make the gamer truly care for the world they are trying to save. It is a masterpiece.. It's a classic, an experience that everyone have to pass, about death, people's madness, love. a masterpiece.. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is quite a fascinating and iconic game that left quite a huge impression on me when I was younger. The characters are memorable as is the interesting art style. The story and soundtrack are unforgettable. I also haven't forgotten about the moon in this game either, it's one of the creepiest things I have ever seen in any video game. The overworld in Majora's Mask is more condensed compared to the overworld in Ocarina of Time where it's more spread out. In that regard, I had more fun roaming the open world in Majora's Mask especially when wearing the bunny hood or using Epona to get to different places. That said, I still prefer Ocarina of Time's dungeons and bosses for the most part. Majora's Mask had a few interesting dungeons though like Snowhead Temple and Stone Tower Temple. This is one of those games you get better at through trial and error. You have to memorize every event that occurs in this game and I recommend writing them down to help you remember them all. Not only that, but also some of the sidequests are ridiculous and take up a lot of time like the Kafei one. With the time travel mechanic, you can very well find yourself talking to the same people and recollecting the same items over and over again like it's Groundhog Day. Even though I prefer Ocarina of Time's gameplay overall, Majora's Mask still manages to be an interesting and unique game. This game is incredibly deep and will make you think thoughts related to the concept of existentialism.. This and sonic cd are prime examples of what I want in games, a fun time travel mechanic that ads way more content than a massive **** off gta map could ever dream of. It has the best story, the only game where I actually care about the characters and what they're going through especially the villain. This game could not have been made today because of how **** nintendo has become. The most creative mechanics in a videogame of all time. Loved every minute of it. Felt like a true adventure.. Perfect game since my childhood. Game interests me,especially its mask designs utterly amazed me !! I love it.. I will never forget this game, the most unique Zelda game without any doubt. I am not sure if this is better than Ocarina of Time but it is a masterpiece. 10/10.. Never played it but trough let's plays and music expirienced it.. Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 World: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall 10/10. Greatest Zelda game of all time even to this day. Incredible story, incredible atmosphere, incredible gameplay, incredible music, incredible dungeons and bosses and the best sidequests ever conceived in a Nintendo game…Majoras Mask has it all.. Honestly the best Zelda game I’ve ever played. Extremely rich story with memorable characters and quests. This game focuses on the darker side of Zelda. 10/10 Better than Ocarina. F*ck*ng masterpiece. Superior to any other Zelda in history (yes, even Ocarina of TIme). You have to play it before you die.. Majora's Mask is one of the most unique and unforgettable games ever made. Astral Observatory is one of the greatest gaming soundtracks as well.. Perfection. An incredible story. Iconic characters. One of the most emotional games I’ve ever played in my entire life. Revolutionary for it’s time of release (and even still nowadays). 20 years from it’s release and I still get emotional when I think about Kafei and Anju’s story or pamela and her father. The OST is a masterpiece, which is something that the last zelda title totk (or better said zelda fortnite) lack way too much and falls terribly short of. I miss games like this with well developed storytelling. There was a preocupation of doing a good job and deliver a piece of art instead of just something that could be fun playing sometimes. This game will be a jewel of gaming forever.. This is a really good game I spent 20 hours playing one time, very good sequel to oot.. Still my favorite video game of all time. The sense of sheer despair and grief layered through every single character of Termina is unlike any other game I have ever seen. Despite the game's fantastical premise, every character in the game feels utterly human. You feel the terror, denial, and humanity in every NPC throughout the game. Every side quest feels genuinely meaningful. Not to mention the incredible gameplay with the advent of transformation masks. Truly an indescribably beautiful experience, one I honestly doubt Nintendo will ever able to top. It will always hold a profoundly special place in my heart.. Just my favorite game, I have more than 7k hours on this game. Everyone should try this game you can't really describe it, the gameplay is just so unique. Will forever be my favorite game.. Not as good as ocarina but better than most other Zelda games. Storyline is a bit dull, gameplay is good, some temples are good others are dry.. The game is very dark compared to other titles in the series, which is why i love it so much. It's filled with magical and depressing moments. Definitely a memorable and epic adventure. My score is 91 out of 100.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Majoras Mask has the best side quests in a video game. It’s a one of a kind experience, one I wouldn’t trade for the world.. Majora’s Mask is one of my favorite games in the Legend of Zelda Franchise. The concept of not wasting anytime with being timed with 3 (in-game) days before to moon crashes on Termina and ends humanity having the ending line of “You’ve met a terrible fate, haven’t you?” Plus it is very easy to make money in this game with the lottery. Write down the lottery numbers on all the days (Day 1, 2, and 3) and you have a guaranteed chance of winning the lottery. 10/10 would definitely recommend this game. When I was younger, I hated the 24hr end of the world time travel gimmick of the game, it was frustrating and put me off of the game. It was NOTHING like Ocarina of Time. Therefore I cannot give a good review to something that actually deterred me from playing. Secondly, I still hate the timegating to this day and feel it was too complex for an E rating.. A masterpiece in gaming history. Majora's mask was able to become one of the most beloved Zelda franchise video games with only a year in development. While this is a hot take, I truly believe that Majoras mask is a better sequel to a big Zelda game than Tears of the kingdom is. While tears of the kingdom is able to shake up the gameplay in many interesting ways, it's apparent that only those who've played BoTW will truly understand and appreciate TotK. On the other hand Majoras mask was able to completely flip the world presented to us and come out on top as a game that can stand alone as a great. It achieves this with an incredibly provocative storyline backed with powerful music and diverse gameplay.. You enjoy Ocarina of time, you experience Majora's mask. Bone-grinding, heart-wrenching masterpiece that is in my opinion the magnum opus of adventure games. The satisfatcion you feel from just doing anything is unmatched. play this game. Crazy too and fro with backtracking but immersrsice addictive , a classic zelda. A darker version of Ocarina of time with a lot more side quests but less dungeons (plus a timer). Amazing dungeons and getting to each individual dungeon was also very fun although some stuff in the open world was really hard to figure out such as needing apona/a horse. The side dungeons were also super fun such as the thieves hideout and the well. The masks were an excellent system that gave this game so much to do in it. Collecting all the masks were very rewarding and interesting - also gave a cool reward at the end as well. The fierce diety mask is probably one of the best rewards in gaming. The best dungeon is the stone temple for obvious reasons. Majora as a boss was also very cool. The open world was also amazing as it was varied and felt alive. Overall a masterpiece of gaming in terms of side quests.. A fantastically eerie game with loads of fun in it's mask gameplay system. Fantastic soundtrack as usual, alongside multiple improvements due to the nature of it being a sequel. However, alongside it's N64 brethren the aging cracks are quite obvious with poor camera controls and often shotty visuals only saved by the great artistic direction.. i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!! one o f hte best games ever created, slightly better than ocarina and probably my personally favourite zelda game it doesn't have that much of exploration like other titles like botw but if you thnik for tis time it is mind blowing, Oh and for everyone you says something bad about the graphics, man wayd?. Majora's mask is weird, depressing and the most unique game in the franchise, but it is an absolute treat because of that. The oppressive atmosphere and straight up terrifying themes combined with odd but likeable characters makes this one of the most memorable Zelda experiences.. Many people prefer this one to Ocarina of Time, in my opinion it is more than compliant but it has a couple of flaws that don't make the experience as good as in the previous game, also a Great game. One of the best 3d zelda. One of the first video games to have open world depth in the genre: characters that have their own daily routines and different ways of interacting with the player. The game is still very enjoyable nowadays, although it has some not-so-comfortable controls.. Much beloved by critics although I personally preferred the earlier incarnations. There are too many sub-games and side quests muddying the narrative and I found it rather charmless; a lot of the imagery used in Majora's Mask is more like a bad acid trip than a fairytale.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The characters are some of the most memorable in the entire franchise, the 3 day cycle is actually a refreshing mechanic, the best part of the game is the collecting of the masks and being rewarded with the games ultimate mask as well as interacting with all the characters and their various quests and stories, anyone who doesn't like this game, doesn't appreciate good characters.. this game is absolutely amazing, I'd say it's better than ocarina of time, yea it looks dated but this was made in 2000, those graphics were pretty impressive back then, I still go back to this game for fun, If I had anything else to say, I'd say play it. Though somewhat contested among its fans, it is pretty simple to me that Majora's Mask is my all-time favorite Zelda game. The incredible atmosphere, equally chilling soundtrack, mixed with some of the best gameplay and story concepts the series has ever laid down, makes for the most adventurous game in the entire series for me.. The best game for the year 2000 in my opinion this game represent the all games of the zelda in 1 but the history is a little short.. Majora's Mask manages to completely flip the idea over Ocarina of Time over it's head and create an unforgettable, depressing adventure through the land of Termina. Majora excels at it's storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and emotional in-depth characters that are paranoid about the moon coming down to destroy the world. The ""mask"" mechanic is something completely original to the Zelda series, well at least masks that actually give you things to power you up. Excluding the ones in Ocarina, only one of them really does anything. I can't express enough how amazing this game is, especially for a game that had to be rushed out after the successfulness of it's predecessor. If you're into puzzle games, then I HIGHLY suggest that you go ahead and get this game ASAP. It's a wonderful experience from top to bottom, and the music, cutscenes, and unique ideas make this way better than Ocarina. If you aren't a fan of the time limit, then just... Play Ocarina. It's similar to Majora gameplay wise, but just remove the mask abilities and it's very, very similar. Well, that's all I really have to say about this game. If you love emotional games, then I suggest you do the side quests and soak in all of those moments that really give this game the respect it deserves. I don't have much to really say about this game. I can't think of that much criticism towards Majora, because I personally didn't have much of a problem while playing. This game is fundamentally a masterpiece that all Zelda fans enjoy... But I personally can't say the same for a game named, ""Breath of the Wild"" BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY.... This game is perfection. The creepy style that was the reason for the controversy of this game, gave me an unforgettable experience. It teaches you that you aren't always get requited for the good you do in this world. The story is perfect and I love how the game uses the 3-day cycle setting. The NPCs and world in general feel more lively because of this. It shows the depression of the world, and that not everything goes well. You also have a time limit now to clear a location. The dungeons are amazing and challenging as well. This game is my favourite game of all time with Twilight Princess, and I think it's a must play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A magnificent game with different mechanics and a remarkable story for sure a wonderful zelda. I love this game for a ton of different reasons: - Best 3d Dungeons: I love how the dungeon layouts can be manipulated, and even though there are less dungeons, they are some of the best in the series - Best 3d Bosses: Goht is my favorite Zelda boss ever, and honestly, all the boss battles in this game are fun and creative - Great Side Content: I love side quests in games in general since I love interacting with the world and Majora's Mask has great ones. They each have their own unique little story or some fun gameplay. Theres also other fun side content like the Spider Houses and the Deku Race - 3 Day Time Mechanic: its very detailed, and since you can always reset it, it makes the time element fun for certain side quests, unstressful when exploring, but stressful during dungeons and trying to get those stray fairies to the great fairy. Best done timer in any video game - The Masks: especially the transformation masks, I love the different abilities the masks can give you, which definitely made up a lot for that with the masks - The World: Termina is my personal favorite Zelda world from any Zelda game. Its wierdness makes everything interesting and unique and its the kind of world that even though its small its fun to explore it and find everything in it - Moon feels like a Threat: Ganon rarely feels like a threat in most Zelda games, but the moon always feels like a great threat and the third day does a good job of making you feel that - The Music: some of Zelda's best tracks, Song of Healing is one of my favorite Zelda songs of all time, and some of my favorites from OOT were brought back, like Song of Storms. Also Final Hours is an incredible soundtrack since it ma","the Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask is one of the best Zelda games ever created . the game presents a world brimming with life, yet overshadowed by impending doom . players must strategize, plan, and manage their time effectively to progress ."
430.Dead Space,"Very solid remake and actually even better than the original. Very enjoyable horror game.. It's a decent game, it's nothing out of this world, visually it's very pretty but the gameplay, without being bad at all, you take a lot of unpredictable hits. The tank controls are part of the fun but it's not really a horror game, it's a regular shooter but with monsters. One thing that seemed bad to me is that you can't ""skip scene"". Come on, we're on PS5 and they didn't add this... If you want platinum games like me, it will be tedious.. I played a ton of the classic game back when it originally launched, but I went into this one practically blind since it was almost 18 years ago (wtf). It didn’t take long to remember what playing a game in the late 2000s was like—clunky and slow movement, huge difficulty spikes, and limited guidance. The thing is, this isn’t a complaint. An amazing experience and a perfect example of how to remake a game.. Gameplay mechanics 10 Graphic and visuals 8,5 Sound and music 8,5 Storytelling and narrative 8 Replayability and longevity 9 Innovation and originality 8 Total 52 AVERAGE 8,6. Everything is great for a remake. Graphics and and story is good. But enemies are too repetitive sometimes. And those little creatures are so annoying.. It's my favorite horror game and the most horror game I've played the audios are the best. for me the best survival horror ever, silent hill 2 is scarier but dead space has a great shooting model. 10/10 for me, it's a pity there won't be a Dead Space 2 remake. ""Dead Space"" 2023 is more of a modern update than a true remake. Still, it's better than the original game. New content includes added side-missions, a talking Isaac Clarke and an expanded story. Also, the map is more useful and the anti-gravity sections have been improved. In addition, the infamous ""asteroid"" segment has been completely re-done. Overall, this is the definitive version of ""Dead Space"". It took me 16 hours to finish. And there is an alternative ending that can be unlocked with a second playthrough. I would rate this version with a 9.1 out of 10.. Its my favorite Remake so far where imo is better than the original which was already damn near perfect.. I freaking love this game! Made the mistake of playing this game in the dark, first time and peed my pants playing the 2008 version, but this time enjoyed every minute of the game. I just wish they would have change the ending of the story and Danielle would have been saved too but oh well. Also, playing the zero-g basketball part, showed that controllers are clunky or either I am getting too old for games and I ****.. The gameplay and atmosphere is fun at times but a lot of this is wannabe Resident Evil with hackneyed Alien rip off plot. We should expect more from our video games. There is one battle early on where you fight a mini boss with one weakness that there is no way of telling until the voice in the sky tells you it after you have wasted half your ammo doing no damage. Now, sure most players probably just restart the section from a save point with the new knowledge that makes the battle relatively easy, but that is poor game design and this game has too much of that. The gameplay loop is a sci-fi version of ""your princess is in another castle"". Once you have fixed something you need to fix something else and on and on. Somehow it feels more repetitive than Resident Evil though. RE is another franchise guilty of a similar cliche but Resident Evil mixes it up better. This game would be better without the padding and back tracking. I am not sure why they felt the need to make the game so long. I never played the original but I read that it was shorter. This may be a case of developers stuffing their ideas into a remake and causing bloat. The game starts out survival horror but seems to forget subtlety all together before repeating the same tricks. It would be better if they let some of this breathe a little with atmosphere and dialed down the hordes after hordes of aliens.. It STILL terrifies me when the quarantine lights go off and the xenomorphs crawl out of the walls and vents to try and impale you with their blade hands. This game is really dark- both in a literal sense and a story sense. This game is NOT for everyone, people aren't killed they are ripped in half, chewed apart, exploded, they go crazy and commit suicide, guts and blood everywhere. To me I focused on how fun it was to shoot the infected apart- it's so satisfying to kill the monsters you used to be afraid of.. I played the original Dead Space and it was great, especially for 2008th. The remake version returned all those emotions I had 16 years ago. It's a solid straightforward game with great physics, graphics, and story. What else is needed for several evening of great time-consuming? A fun fact: I've checked the gameplay of the original game and the graphics is not as outdated I thought before. Frankly I I'm not sure if this remake makes sense. Original game is not that old. Anyway looking forward for 2nd and 3rd parts re-maked :). Perfect example for a remake! They nailed it! Graphics, atmo and gameplay = 09/10. Didn't play orginal game, but this remake is awesome. Over vaery longplay i faced only one bug. But quick retrun to main menu solved issue. Liked everythink in this game: gore, visuals, music, mechanics. After comparising to original version i can say only: it is the remake we needed. I hope, that whole trilogy will have such remake.. Great game. Fantastic graphics and visuals, good combat, good story, really scary a lot of times. Its just a little too script- heavy, especially at the beginning. But other than that this is the definitive current gen horror game. 9/10. Extremely high score from me just because of the nostalgia. I loved this game when it originally released. This remake is just as good as the OG but with modern graphics. I loved every second of Dead Space remake.. The game is bugged. Played it in 2024 and still no fix, buttons you press with no response, the character gets trapped with invisible walls... Takes you out of the game. Beyond that, the story doesn't quite flow, and the gameplay feels like a list of tasks you are informed about. It's a pity, because the visual part really feels good, and the sound design, even better. The gameplay would be good if it wasn't for every thing and bug that doesn't work. I just expected more from this one.. What an experience! I never played the original but always wanted to so when I tried this version out, I was pleasantly surprised to find a well-paced, highly effective, and immersive horror sci-fi experience that delivered an incredible atmosphere and high-quality game. I loved every minute of the game! Technically, it's one of the most impressive games I've played on my PS5 and for a remake, I appreciate the added features, options, and improvements. I also can't get over how good the sound design is! Overall, I loved almost everything about this game. I think I would've liked to see a different menu system and there were a couple times when button presses were not responsive but these were quite rare and didn't really detract from the overall experience. Fantastic in every level! Well done to Criterion and motive and EA for the project. Please finish the trilogy for remakes!. Respecting the original, taking the already-great details one by one and processing them with much better way makes this Remake an incredible experience. A lesson that every developer should take inspiration from EA Motive.. After playing half way through on my Xbox 360 before it died(rip). Playing the remake absolutely blew my mind away. Dead space is genuinely the first game ever actually scare me which I didn't think was possible. The atmosphere is amazing always feels like I'm gonna be fighting for my life around each and every corner and the ambient music with the violin always playing when I'm casually walking through the ishimura. Never fails to make me uneased. Combat wise too really good it's really solid with the way weapons are handled. Characters are really well made each and every character felt connected really well not only with other characters but also with Issac. Overall 10/10 for me. Absolutely outstanding horror game! The atmosphere is just incredible, everything comes together so well: the lighting, music, weapons, sounds and enemies - together make a 10/10 game. If you haven’t played this yet, play it now!. One of the best then. One of the best now. What else is there to say? One of the few times I'd say the remake is better than the original but here we are.. What an amazing Remake and just like the original game amazing and terrifying. I did not played the og Dead Space, and saw in this remake a chance to have a great Dead Space Experience. The game is in the most top horror games lists and I always want to play. The atmosphere is good, but I don't got much horror vibe. The movements of the Isaac(the playable character) are strange, mainly the arms in walking animation. The enemies, the creatures, are great and the game design to defeat them is also good. There is some frustrating situations and the gameplay loop going objective after objective is boring. The lack of puzzles (or at least good puzzles) turn the game much more action related, because the game designers needed to put enemies at many places. I expected more from the famous Dead Space game and from this remake.. I recommend to anyone who enjoy Horror games, you feel kind of claustrophobic because the game is in space, there is a tension every time you enter a room similar to what you feel playing Alien Isolation, great experience.. Always wanted to play it and we got it for free with ps plus. Amazing game love thevibe controls enemies.. Incredibly good game! Its hard to imagine how great games were developed by EA years ago. Where are they now? Smooth 60FPS gameplay, great gunplay graphics and story. Perfect addon for PS Plus, but hard platinum.. The game inspired by my favorite game of all time (Resident evil 4) OG dead space was fantastic and horrifying and now it’s a remake improving gameplay and graphics.. Great atmosphere and good gameplay. Time flew by playing this. Can't wait for the next remake.. One of my favorite games is the original Dead Space and when it was announced that a remake was being made, my first reaction was one of confusion. There’s no need for a remake **** that’s nearly perfect and hardly that old. Especially when there are plenty of games out there that could really benefit from a full overhaul. Then I played this new version of Dead Space. This was necessary. This is something I didn’t know I needed. Dead Space is the story of engineer Isaac Clarke sent with a handful of others to repair the pride and joy of the planet crackers; USG Ishimura. The largest and most famous of these ships that harvest minerals and elements from inside abandoned planets deep in space. Clarke is there because his girlfriend, Nicole, is stationed aboard. The game starts with her face on a recording and Isaac is watching it over and over again as they approach the Ishimura which has gone completely dark on a routine mission to a planet called Aegis VII. What follows is about what you expect, everything goes spectacularly wrong from minute 1. The first thing that is apparent is how much detail EA Motive has added to a game that I found quite detailed back in 2008. It’s 2023 and we have access to so many more details! For one, Isaac’s suit is incredibly detailed and often becomes splattered with blood. The opening is mostly the same, aside from some embellishing of the dialogue. Which is not a negative, there’s just more details here. It feels very familiar with the same menus and same font but there’s added touches. I found myself pointing them out, all the way down to the enemy placements being tweaked. This is the same game I’ve played nearly 10 times and yet it’s also very different and very surprising. One of my favorite things about the original was how damn smooth it played. This wasn’t just a Resident Evil 4 clone in space. This was the smoothest and most stylish game around the block in 2008 and that’s still true except it’s somehow even smoother! I played on the PS5 and the new dualsense features are on full display here. My favorite is when you get low on ammo the trigger becomes harder to pull. At first it seems like my fingers are failing me but no, it’s the game telling me to be more precise with my shots. The combat is tighter and even more satisfying. Dismembering has never been this much fun before and did I mention scary? Oh yeah, this game is even scarier! Between the gore and the immersive details on display, Dead Space is alive and terrifying. Combine the new trigger effects with a very effective usage of the controller speaker and EA Motive has created a vastly superior immersive experience and I’m thrilled to be going around pressing buttons and fixing things on the massive ship all over again. While a lot of the plot plays out about the same, there are plenty of surprises and changes throughout the game such as a completely reworked version of the frustratingly painful asteroid shooter sequence. This time the asteroids rain down around you as you’re trying to fulfill the objectives. It’s a fresh angle on an old game and it’s beyond refreshing. Speaking of plot, there’s some significant tweaks here that make the game much richer. Isaac’s deteriorating mental state is easier to track and feels more intentional. Not to mention, you feel it along with him. That’s partly due to his voice being more present here, it’s toned down from the sequels but he has more of a personality this time around here and it’s the smart choice. I don’t think the empty vessel tactic is as immersive as we thought 15 or so years ago. I think my main worry with this remake was that it would feel heartless. I didn’t want just a blank copy of the game I love and I think Motive handled the game with care. This remake is well balanced with the new and the old and all of it works incredibly well together. Overall the thing I keep coming back to is they have breathed so much life into this game that it’s almost unrecognizable. It’s truly remarkable and firmly cements Dead Space back in the horror conversation. Can I get Dead Space 4 now?. A solid remake of the original Dead Space, sci-fi horror done right. I enjoyed it, but it does start to feel repetitive near the end. I hope the developer delivers a Dead Space 2 remake eventually.. Like the original Dead Space, this remains one of the best survival horror games ever made. The game brings numerous improvements and is clearly a carefully crafted remake. Now, Isaac Clarke finally speaks (something he didn't do in the original), and there are enhancements in the gameplay, especially in zero-gravity sections and boss fights. Simply perfect. I truly hope they release remakes of 2 and 3, and maybe even a future sequel!. To think that I almost gave up on this game when I got the rifle and faced the bat thing. I thought I was experiencing a terrible difficulty spike, but it turned out the rifle was simply the most horrible weapon in the game. For that reason alone I can't give this game a 10, it's a shame because everything else - the visuals, the sound, the story - is almost perfect.. Great game! Love how crisp, yet ominous the graphics are with the remake! I love survival horror games, and this is definitely in my Top 3. Story is fantastic, and the tension is near-constant. Isaac isn’t the most spectacular protagonist (and good LORD is he slow with that suit), but he fits the part for this game. My only cons are minimal. First, I needed to rely on the guide (R3), as it is very easy to get lost in the Ishimura. The second, missions can be fairly repetitive, as you need to turn on circuit breakers, move batteries, and destroy tendrils up the wazoo. Difficulty is just right - perfectly challenging while not rage-quit inducing. Pretty nice twist, too! If you’re a fan of Silent Hill or Resident Evil, you NEED to check this out.. This is one the best survival horror games I've played in my life and is up there with RE4 remake as one of my favorites in this genre. The production quality is also on par with RE4 remake which came as a surprise since it was made by a EA owned studio. I really hope someday soon they'll get to working on DS2 remake. I have no complaints other than unnecessarily race & gender swapping Johnston which is a very minor issue but also clearly an effect of DEI in the gaming industry. Anyways I'm not gonna nitpick cuz the game itself is perfect from start to finish!. very scary game! if you like horror and sci-fi definitely check it out in a discount. Having never played Dead Space before, I went into the remake blind and loved it. It does Sci-Fi horror really really well; it's genuinely spooky and tense throughout. I enjoyed the dismemberment heavy combat and the buckets of gore which accompanied it. Blasting limbs off the necromorphs in a frantic struggle for survival is core to the gameplay. Almost entirely set on the iconic USG Ishimura spacecraft, the game's setting is foundational to the overall experience. The ship is dark and claustrophobic, with its crew driven to madness or transformed into hideous monsters. The story ain't bad, and the lore is decent. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through Dead Space. If you like the sound of a ""Resident Evil in space"" kinda game then you should give it a try.. I'm not giving it a 10 because some small graphical details could have been finished better. Otherwise, it's a masterpiece.. This is how remakes should be done. Faithful to the original but enhances in every way. Still a classic horror game.. I came back to play the remake after so many years had passed since the original. All I can say is that I loved the original, and I love this. One of the best games I've ever played, period. I played this before I started playing Callisto Protocol, which was developed by one of the creators behind the original Dead Space. Callisto Protocol was not a great game. It had some okay elements, but it pales in comparison to Dead Space Remake. I appreciated Dead Space a lot more after going through **** there any negative aspects to Dead Space Remake? If I'm being honest, no, there aren't. For me personally, the game was perfect. There isn't a single thing I want to add or remove from the game. I have a bad history with Sci-Fi games and settings. Usually, when playing them, their repetitive areas bore me after a while. Since their setting is in the future and aboard spaceships, all areas look alike. You don't get vast cities, jungles, and mountains like in a game such as Witcher 3. I quit playing Prey and Surge 1 before finishing them for this reason. I just had enough of the similar-looking corridors and **** weird thing is that Dead Space Remake is set in the future and on a spaceship, but I never felt the boredom I experienced with the aforementioned games. The combat is very responsive and fluid. The game is a graphical masterpiece. The only downside is that the platinum trophy is too hard for a noob like me since I can't finish it on Impossible mode. Overall, I have to say that Dead Space Remake is indeed a masterpiece in the survival horror genre. I would definitely recommend it to fans of this genre. The PS3 game was already amazing back then. The remake is that and so much more. In terms of atmosphere and gameplay, it is hardly matched in this genre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Never completed the original one somehow, but finally got my hands on this remake, enjoyed so much. True horror game.. Great remake. I love that you can freely explore areas now. The game is exactly the same as the original for the most part. The voice acting is pretty stale though.. Great atmosphere and great gameplay... I hope they make a sequel... The bosses should be upgraded in the next version, although it has been reported that they don't want to make a sequel at the moment, and this is really disappointing.. The Dead Space Remake is a thrilling upgrade with better graphics and gameplay. Visually stunning, it immerses me in the eerie world of the Ishimura. Combat feels smoother, and the dismemberment system is satisfying. As a fan of the original, this remake hits all the right notes. The atmosphere is oppressive, and every encounter keeps me on the edge of my seat. A must-play for both new and returning players, it's a fresh take on classic horror that I'm thoroughly enjoying.. Wow, never played the original. In fact i returned the original to a used store after playing for 10-15 minutes causes it scared the crap out of me back in the day. This is such a amazing game, modern, sleek but weighty and impactful. Combat is deliberate (plasma cutter for the win even in the end game) the story is well paced and its just fun. What else is there to say.. Remake done right. Almost everything is better than the original. The graphics are far more detailed and the atmosphere is improved by the new lighting. The weapons are better balances and you now acquire them through exploration, the sections of the ship feel more connected, and the controls are significantly improved (especially the zero-g sections). Everything combined breathes new life into this classic.. Surprisingly a really good game. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did but I really loved it. I plan on 100%ing it later this year and I recommend that anyone play it if they can.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is dead space modernized how could u ever go wrong with that. The games as scary as ever and keeps you on ur toes. I came back and relived the terror I felt when playing a perfect game for the first time.. Good Graphics, The Atmosphere is really nice and scary, anda 10/10 recommend this game. Just like RE4r, this is a remake that really didn't need to happen. Also just like RE4r, I'm so happy that it did. It proved it's worth as a remake and outshines the original in nearly every way. I've got to say - this is a prime example of how a remake should be handled. Motive Studio has not only ticked, but excelled at every tickbox possible - from capturing the original atmosphere, while also remaining faithful to the classic gameplay mechanics, to adding a few original elements of its own. What absolutely blew me away was the sound design which is top notch. That is why I highly recommend playing this with a pair of good headphones - you'll feel a very special kind of immersion. Graphics are also incredible and help make the Ishimura feel dreadful, as it should. My only request is that EA will remake the whole trilogy and bring the complete story of Isaac Clark to life once more.. This is an excellent example of ""I got what I paid for."" It's precisely the type of game that works from the 3rd person's perspective; so happy they remade this.. Dead Space is a game I regretfully skipped over when it first came out and I’m really glad they made the remake. They demonstrated how a remake should be done with this game.. ok ım really understand... ı can cut my enemies ok... ummm any thing you can show me ? no ..ok good bye my friend. game is too dark, in 95% situations you not see the enemies and shooting in random directions. All game situations is you walk for long dark tunnel with screamer of jumping enemies on front and same time back of you the original game played more more fun. Upgraded definitive edition of an already great game. Great blend of satisfying gunplay and good survival horror, as most games usually cannot nail both so well.. It is the king of horror games. ""Isn't there a game that will scare me every minute?"" If you say, this is the best job. However, when I include all the elements I give it 8 out of 10. If u like the gender this is a must and an example of how remake's should be done... I'm looking at you Konami>,>. For me, Dead Space is one of the best games in history. The 2023 remaster didn't give me anything new. It's been 15 years since I played this game. But according to my feelings, I completed it yesterday, and today I started playing in a new way. Yes, the graphics are not bad (although there were some strange friezes). But this is the same game. I just don't quite understand this terrible criticism of The Callisto Protocol. (yes, the game is not perfect, but still it is a new game). And all the delight that an old (yes, a masterpiece), but still an old game was released with updated graphics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good remake, high fidelity to the original work but still feels like a fresh game. The Dead Space Remake endeavors to contemporize the visuals, gameplay, and storytelling of the original, but unfortunately, it falls short of addressing key issues that have long persisted. Despite the visual facelift that brings the dilapidated halls of the USG Ishimura to life, the attempt to modernize controls and combat leaves a clunky residue. The overhauled movement system struggles to shake off the awkwardness, diminishing the intended vulnerability players should feel while navigating the unnerving environments.While combat was a focal point for improvement, it treads a thin line between intensifying the experience and descending into monotony. The Necromorph encounters, once nerve-wracking, devolve into a predictable routine, robbing the game of the pulse-pounding unpredictability that characterized the original. The horror factor, once a hallmark of Dead Space, has dwindled, failing to instill the same level of fear that made the original a standout in the **** Remake's reliance on nostalgia becomes a double-edged sword, attempting to draw players in with familiar settings and scenarios. However, in doing so, it struggles to provide a fresh and genuinely frightening experience. The scares feel less impactful, leaving long-time fans and newcomers alike yearning for a more immersive and fear-inducing **** disappointments extend to the technical side, particularly on the PC platform. Performance issues, ranging from frame rate drops to stuttering, significantly hinder the overall experience. These problems not only disrupt the visual splendor promised by the graphical improvements but also disrupt the flow of gameplay, creating a frustrating and disjointed **** conclusion, the Dead Space Remake, while making strides in visual upgrades and attempting to align with modern gaming expectations, ultimately fails to rectify longstanding issues. The clunky controls, monotonous combat, and a diluted horror atmosphere, coupled with technical hiccups on PC, collectively dampen the potential for an exhilarating and fear-inducing experience. It seems the Remake struggles not only to recapture the magic of the original but also to stand out in the current landscape of horror gaming.. Looses automatic points for unoriginality as this is a poor remake (not a remaster of a classic). I can't understate how much I am fan of 2008 Dead Space. A game I have replayed annually since release on 360 console & PC. The Intro of 2008 Dead Space was amazing to the point of cinematic. This version just fell flat without any of the tension of the orginal. The voice actors for other characters nowhere near as good. So a double whammy downgrade to the atmosphere of the previous Dead Space. Wow they hit Issac & Nicole with a ugly stick & aged them up. Picked up on the current dialogue cringe asap. So what good is left? The graphics? Dead Space is the sum of it's parts & this one is so lacking overall. Current day companies can't help trying to fix what ani't broke thinking they can do better, lol, no. Hard pass DNF going back to classic 2008 Dead Space. Was gifted the disc so yup one for trade in for sure. Mid out of 10.... This dead space remake surprised me. I thought it was going to feel like a chore to play through again since I already beat it a few times in the past, but this remake really brought new life into the game. They did an excellent job of making the game even better this time around. I enjoyed all the new additions. I forgot how fun Dead Space made survival horror. It really became the king even besting Resident Evil. I hope we get a return of Dead Space because I really missed the series. Only negatives were the game starts to drag a bit near the end and the combat starts getting predictable and repetitive. Also, I wish there was a way to set custom marker waypoints. That would have made using the map a lot easier.. A very good game in my opinion. The Necromorphs aren't like other enemys in games. Sometimes it was a little bit frustrating.. They had a perfect game, the original, I don't understand why they have made changes..... also changes for the worse. The game is still good, a little buggy at times, but playable. The changes in the story make it worse, I think a lot worse. I don't think I get carried away by the bad reputations of companies, but in this case EA I'm starting to see where the fame comes from, if something is perfect, don't touch it... and if you see that it's getting worse, much less so.. The Dead Space Remake is nothing short of a modern horror classic, in any medium. The ambiance, sound design, art direction, music, etc. I could go on about how much work and detail Motive put into creating one of the most eerie survival horror experiences I've ever played. Gunner Wright's performance also brings life to Isaac actually making him a memorable character and more than just a badass costume. I've yet to mention to mention the dismemberment system which is Dead Space's most iconic feature. Hacking off limbs and using them as projectiles allows for a grotesque yet satisfying combat loop. I'd say it's quite approachable in terms of its difficulty, with impossible mode not being all that impossible. Dead Space is a must play title that's up there with the all-time greats.. Don't like scary games,but this game(the dead space remake) is friggin awesome. You feel helpless yet overpowered thanks to the amazing guns and the ability to stop the enemy to a pulp. On ps5 atleast the graphics is awesome, the use of darkness and light is crisp and makes the game scary af. As I said before idon't really like scary games but this is awesome overall, and the fear is well complimented with overpowered decapitating weapons. Characters are good and the way the ""HUD"" works feel so natural and unimposing and natural . Like it's not WE the player that see the HUD,it's the character that sees it. And little things like the fact that the first letter of every chapter creates a message is just awesome . Amazing game.. best remake , i love you dead space i love you single player game, my best game. This game is ridiculously fun and is great horror. After playstation gave me Callisto Protocol for free, and I liked it, I decided to play that game's far superior dad, and I had an awesome experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horribly outdated game design, repetitive, and not worthy of a remake. Callisto is far better.. Really good game, superb graphics, cool story.Just the last opponent was a little bit weak.. I played Dead Space (2023) in 2023 and thought it was an amazing game that I loved.. Taking from Capcom’s successful revamps of the Resident Evil series, EA has remade one of the most well known horror games to great avail. The environment design, I cannot stress enough, is UNBELIEVABLE - truly allowing for a tense mood to be developed. However, EA’s inability to fully develop concepts is evident here, as the horror element falls quickly as Isaac is developed more, making it slightly more akin to a run and gun shooter.. They made solid remake this is for sure. Thoughts about horror game in space was a revolutionary idea. But this game is not a horror game its a thrille","""Dead Space"" 2023 is more of a modern update than a true remake . new content includes added side-missions, a talking Isaac Clarke and an expanded story . the infamous ""asteroid"" segment has been completely re-done ."
431.Cave Story,"just finished this game an hour ago, it is very cute and fun to play. the highlight for me is the art quality and consistency, i love the sprites used, the attack visuals, and backgrounds especially. I did get stuck 2 times and had to use a walk through, but im a dirt eating homunculus with no attention span, so this makes since.. Despite a few issues (Slow loadings when changing music, Ost not always rearranged brilliantly), the Wii version is surely worth playing through for any Cave Story fan and non.. This game is soo good, it's kind of hard to know where to start. This game was a master piece, and made by one person in the original version. Incredible. If I had to tell every thing I love about the game, I would exceed my character limit, so let me keep it short and sweet. I didn't know a 2d platform shooter rpg could have such entertaining, I was fun and challenging. The plot was also solid and very well made. God, this was a great game. Boss battles were soo much fun. (except for monster X, that boss fight was an a**, this game might give you the rage of a megaman game, sorry be warned, this is not an easy game, especially if you're going for the best ending. It helps if you save a lot however. My only complaints are, 1. I hated the fetch quest in the bushland. 2. It is very un obvious how to get the best ending. My final comments, get the game. You will love it, there is so much to love about it. Though, you may be saving and dieing quite a bit. This game is sooo much fun, and is a masterpiece when you include the plot and likable characters. Now keep calm, and shoot on.. Incredibly charming, inspiring, and intuitive. The graphics are retro and simplistic. The music is extremely catchy and memorable, the main theme in particular. The gameplay is enjoyable and familiar. The gameplay (let alone the entire game itself) is more or less a throwback to old NES titles such a Metroid and Megaman. Gameplay almost never feels repetitive, unless the area drags on or barely introduces something new. The weapons are all interesting, and the incorporation of a weapon-level system is brilliant. Each area feels relevant to the story, is littered with secrets and upgrades, and more often than not introduces a new weapon or mechanic. The level design is simplistic, but adequate. However, I feel that without the strong presence of story and hilarious writing, the gameplay and design would be nothing special. The story is omnipresent, likable, and surprisingly emotional for admittedly childish subject matter. The majority of the characters are incredibly charming. This game is fantastic, however, it is far from perfect. Some of the areas do tend to feel like filler, and if you are playing for a long time, the gameplay will get repetitive. This game heavily relies on the use of save points, so saving at any given time is always recommended. This does not bode well with the game's extreme difficulty. The game gets very hard very fast. The intense difficulty in conjunction with scarce save points makes failure become incredibly frustrating, as you often are forced to replay large portions of the game that are also painstakingly difficult. Rage-quitting is inevitable if you intend to complete this game 100%. This game features a lot of choices, for better or for worse. It works in terms of weapons, but not in terms of endings. Particularly the ""best"" ending. In order to get the best possible ending, you have to get all the best weapons, make sure certain characters don't die, and get all the obtainable health and missile upgrades. Once that is done, the final area of the game becomes excruciatingly difficult. Normally, the final area is four incredibly challenging bosses that get progressively difficult up to the forth and final boss. To get the best ending, you complete that same boss rush, only afterwards you have to complete a ""hell level"" and four more near-impossibly difficult bosses. Even if you manage to do all that, there's no real payoff to getting the best ending. Only play Cave Story for the ""good"" ending, for the sake of your sanity and patience. Even though completing the game to it's fullest is near impossible, Cave Story opened the doors for indie games and proved that one man can create a wonderful video game experience that rivals some of the triple A games in the modern market.. An absolutely gem, people who don't appreciate this game can climb a wall of ****. Seriously you can just feel that Pixel (the maker of this game) spent 5 years making it. This game is the best indie game ever Ã¡nd one of the best games of the last century.. Like Metroid, but fun. A wonderful 2D platformer-shooter with a focus on exploration. As a lifelong Mario fanatic, platformers that involve shooting aren't usually my cup of tea, but this one way just pure fun throughout. I highly recommend it. :). What an awesome game! I actually did not play this on the wii but actually just finished it on the PC but I believe they are essentially identical. I heard it was pretty good so I thought I would give this freeware game a try and I was blown away. It plays like a fabulous game from the NES days. It is pretty challenging with a story and characters that draw you in. It has three different endings and plays similar to the original Metroid but better. Check it our whether on PC, WII, or DS you'll enjoy it.. An indie masterpiece. A must have on Wii Ware. If you are a fan of classic style games this is one adventure you do not want to pass up on. I do recommend to play it with the classic music though, the new music has no flare. This game has a massive replay value as it is filled with alternate endings, a variety of weapons, multiple game modes and a bonus stage for anybody that has the gaming prowess to reach it.. What platformers were invented for. The simple fact that this was entirely the work of one person, makes it an instant classic, and a well deserved 10.. This had gotta be one of the best wiiware titles out there. Despite its expensive price tag, this game offers unique game play and a great storyline to go along with it. This game is not too easy, but not to hard at the same time, although the game can get a little frustrating (especially towards the end). I also liked how there were 3 different endings (bad, normal, good), and they were set up in such a way that you could see all 3 of them.. Cave Story is a captivating, brilliant, and nearly perfect game! I did have to deduct a few points for the game being free-to-download on PC but not on Wii which makes this version less desirable in that regard.. An inventive mix of RPG, Adventure, Platforming and Shooter? Yes please. Cave Story is one of the most unique games I have played on the Wii and perfectly mixes everything you love about the old school, pixel like games in the past. Great controls, simple but addictive gameplay and a compelling story. Brilliant from beginning to end.. I just can repeat here: ""Pixel made a Masterpiece"" and Nicalis ported it perfectly to WiiWare. I really enjoyed this game very much. Perfect story you easily get **** into, perfect balancing of the weapons , perfect boss fights. Just few highlights from my point of view.","the game was a master piece, and made by one person in the original version . the graphics are retro and simplistic, the music is extremely catchy and memorable . the gameplay (let alone the entire game itself) is more or less a throwback to old NES titles ."
432.The Walking Dead: Episode 5 - No Time Left,"This was the first game that ever made me cry and is not a game that i go back to and cringe or think that is was beacuse of nostalgia, its genuienly good. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 7 out of 10, Fun: 8 out of 10, Controls: 8 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 9 out of 10, Length: 8 out of 10, Re-play: 5 out of 10, Value: 8 out of 10 I have a low re-play score on this game because when you re-play the game (which there is a strong desire to re-play this game to try other choices) the new different choices you make either 1) don't make much difference and/or 2) the way the main character and other characters act/re-act for non-mainstream choices is highly unrealistic. I really loved this game and would of given it a 9 for my over-all score, but the re-play that I was anxious to try was a real dud and took away from my original experience; thus giving the game an over-all score of 8.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My #1 complaint about this game that choices do not matter. No matter what you do you will get the same predictable and disappointing ending. This pretty much ruined for me what could have been an incredible game.. This episode is a masterpiece, although short it was totally breath-catching, depressing and emotionally engaging...................................... How the **** did this game get 9 out of 10??? I created an account just so i could comment about that like really??? 9 out of 10??? I finished the game in 4 hours (the whole game) there's obviously no real choices you can make , the graphic were nothing special (borderlands kinda rip off) , the game has no replay value whatsoever , you just point and click pretty much the whole game, theres like 2-3 shootings scenes (1 of them is showed in the trailer ) like wtf Metacritic , 9 OUT OF 10 ?????? The only thing good about this game is the voice acting, other than that its just another game taking advantages of a succeful franchise . Dont buy this game , i was tempted when i saw it as top sellers on Steam and now regret my actions.. This is the first time ever I write a review for a game: for this one, I simply had to. This is the best game I have ever played. Period. This is as close as you can get to perfection: the story, the characters, the atmosphere, the emotions, the moral dilemmas... Telltale have not only demonstrated that they are the masters of point-and-click adventure games, they have demonstrated that this type of game can give an experience as satisfying as any other. Because Telltale has understood what is the foundation of any successful game: the story, the story, the story. You can have fantastic graphics and great game-play mechanics, but none of that matters in the end if the story ****. Let me just end this review with one last comment. I am really not a particularly sentimental guy, but this game made me shed quite a few tears. I don't recall that happening with any other video game, and I'm speaking of hundreds of them (yeah, I've been around for quite a while...). Needless to say, I hope that Telltale will go on with this series for many more seasons. Cheers!. I'm not really into this kind of genre, but i had to give it a try because of the good reviews, and i can surely tell you that the game isn't a waste of time, in fact, i'm very happy i gave it a chance. It's one of the best games i have ever played, not because of the genre itself, in fact as a ""game"" isn't that cool, but the storyline was really good, I didn't liked the fact that, no matter what decisions you make, the game will do what it has to do, but this ""decision making"" thing it's in fact, what makes a connection between you and the main character. That's why it didn't bothered me at the end. The story is excellent, the graphics ain't bad, the game itself it's ""not bad"", i would give the game a 10 if it was another genre, and maybe if it was more like ""a game"". I only see this game as an...""interactive animated movie"", not like a real game, but god, it's totally worth your time.. Man this was epic I can't believe what happened happened if you have a chance pick this up its the ultimate game one of the best episodes in the series holy poop. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Episode 5 is the last episode of the Walking Dead: Season 1. I found this episode very moving, with great dialogue and action sequences (as throughout the series). The ending is also worthwhile, which is nice. But my favorite part of this series is just playing through it. I feel like I was there with these people: Lee, Clementing, Duck, Kenny... all of them. And not too many games can do that.. Once you realize the decisions you make dont matter at all, and if you are able to look past the not very impressive gameplay, the story this game tells is pretty good. Even if I felt cheated by the game once I found out it didnt give a crap about what I chose, Im giving it a 7 for being the first game I ever played that had a child that not only didnt annoy me, but also was a really likable character.. Pretty much Cried at the end. No game has ever really struck that cord. They should just keeping making new episodes. man, i really hope they do. EXCELLENT REPLAY VALUE. Enjoy this game for what it is, an interactive comic. Taking the series as a whole, zombie fans should definitely not miss this, and more general point-and-click fans will enjoy the storyline also. As a ""game"" it lacks in interactivity (walk here, click this, hit that mostly), very simple to non-existent puzzles, linear and very little roaming/discovery, and a story-line dialogue-choice system that doesn't make a huge difference to the overall course of the game. If you are a p-and-c fan of say Syberia, Broken Sword, Lost Horizon etc., and looking for good puzzles to work through, this game will disappoint. There's none of that here, with more focus on the story and dialogue. Gets a 6 for the 10 hour gameplay/story in general, plus 1 for being nice to look at and a better than usual ending (imho anyway). Just as well really, as this last episode is the slowest and weakest of them, and a reason why it is probably not strong enough for a replay for me. An enjoyable experience nonetheless.. The half life series was what I always considered my all time favorite game, nothing else matched it though few came close namely wind waker, metro 2033, oddworld, heart of darkness, and a few more. Telltale's walking dead however makes me question what my favorite game of all time is. Holy sht this game was indescribable. If ever a game was deserving of a perfect score, this is it. Game of the year easily (to me at least).. Probably the best zombie game I have ever played. When I first looked into this game, I thought it would be some shooter resident-evil wannabe, then I found out it was a graphic adventure with lots of action on it, which is really original and cool. But what I liked the most was the story, so epic and inmersive, really at the level of the TV series and more touchy. The flawless voice acting helps a lot. The other strong point in the game is the dialogue choice options. Everything you say almost always have some kind of impact in the story, from gaining influence over some pal of your group, to trigger a whole situation that may save your life or kill you. In fact, the difficulty of the game is not killing the zombies, but preventing your group to split or fall into hysteria. The only thing that could be better, are the puzzles. For a graphic adventure the puzzles are quite weak, but it kind of compensates with a great dose of action. All crowned with a great and moving ending. This game is a must have so try it. You won't be dissapointed.. The ending absolutely ****. The consequences of so called ""decision making"" are non existent, from what I can see. I enjoyed this ""game"", if that's what you want to call it, because the story was pretty entertaining and intriguing but this pathetic episode pretty much ruined the experience. What the hell?. One of those pieces of art which will get in the deepest corner of your heart and never leave. Telltale's masterpiece has set a new standard in the interactive storytelling and all gamers should celebrate this since we all are witnessing a birth of a new era of story-driven gaming.. This game, as a whole and this finale especially, is storytelling at its finest. There are many branching paths possible for this final episode and Telltale games made it difficult for themselves with the ridiculous combination of options they gave you leading up to this point. They did a terrific job, though. Few faults exist for this game, if any. If you want a story-driven/choice-driven gaming experience, this is perfect.. Impeccably written, intensely shot, impossibly alive characters, top-notch pacing and a bravura performance from Melissa Hutchinson, a.k.a. Clementine, who is destined to be named as the most fully realized child character (if not just simply CHARACTER) in the history of video games from now on. The Walking Dead Episode 5 is everything you could wish for, the finale to a series so meticulously crafted, that's it destined to leave a mark in every single gamer that had the chance to experience this dramatic miracle.. The ending, itself, is shocking, gut-wrenching, emotionally merciless and, most of all, absolutely, positively unforgettable. A HUGE thank-you to Telltale Games for offering a true masterpiece that is Walking Dead. They actually managed to make me CRY. Thank you.. I'm disappointed by season finale. I expected it to have few endings depend on the choices you made earlier. But whatever choices you made, ending is still the same. So much for creating your own story.. In brief. it made me cry. I've never cried for a game before! It is defenitely a masterpiece, mixing the soundtrack, the characters. Oh, the characters!; the atmoshpere... Everything, just.... everything... You know what? If i could, i'll give this a 12/10! Yes! God bless this master minds. You own my true love. Thank you. Keep doing this! Please!. The game overall was somewhat disappointing. I liked episode 3 best, but the last episode was my least favorite. Some of the user actions sequences were just a waste and had no effect or consequence and I was really hoping that you would have a different outcome for the end depending on the choices you made. This game would have been a 10 if your outcome in each episode could have been different. The last episode seemed rushed and not that well planned. If they do another, I hope it has more consequences for your actions.. Few games have ever wrenched genuine emotion and sorrow from my gut as brutally as Telltale's take on Robert Kirkman's twisted world. Bravo, Telltale. This game deserves a spot as GOTY, no questions asked. #ForClementine indeed.. This will game will have a permanent spot on my top list of games i would recommend. this game was one of the biggest emotional roller coaster rides i have ever taken. this last chapter was a satisfying conclusion to the walking dead episodes. aside from a few graphical glitches and some choices that feel a bit to forced this game always gave me the feeling that i was in control of each situation and that the consequences were my fault. And clementine, my favorite character made me feel very protective of this cute little girl that i would risk my life for. if you're looking for a game with an easy to use interface and a story that keeps you wanting more then pick this one up. you will not regret it.. Amazing game just utter brilliance! I did not regret picking this game up! I know you wouldn't! All 5 episodes were amazing but this one stands the most the great, depressing and sad ending but you'll get over it that's how awesome this game was! And always stay for the credits.. Amazing game. There is always something going on and you never get bored of it. The TV series were boring and i almost fell asleep on every episode so this game was how the series should be like and not a soap opera with a little **** Carl. I cant wait for season 2.. The game ends on a fantastic and very sad climax which pulls at your heart strings. Here the choices are taken away from you almost completely except for minor changes in characterisation. The game is far far too short, giving maybe an hours worth of enjoyment but you will feel drained and emotionally raw after completing this game An excellent story behind a medecocre game.. I'm rather reviewing the whole series than just episode 5 because I think you have to look at the big picture here. Yes the game has it's flaws: technical errors (had to play the series with shadows turned off despite my more than decent rack) and, as stated by many others, the choices you make don't change the outcome like some might've wished they would. The comic-look is a pure matter of taste, I can understand that some people might not like it, but I do. BUT apart from it's deficiencies this here is something unique and I'm glad there's gonna be another series. This is not about 20 different endings or alike, it's about hope and how you're not to loose it and more importantly pass it on to and raise it in somebody else, especially the young ones. It's GRIPPING by every meaning of the word. And I can't remember any game that touched and/or moved me like this one, especially no point 'n' click adventure. I for one don't think the decisions one makes are pointless. I can't fight the feeling that many people have gotten so used to seeing people die on the screen (and I mean everywhere: the news, the movies and video-games) it just doesn't do anything for/with them anymore. I actually felt terrible and sorry for some of the decisions I made and many of the things I've seen in this game. All in all this game tells a great story with convincing characters and is a stunning, gripping experience. 10 out of 10.. Not much I can say but this The Walking Dead has one of the best stories ever in a game. You can't name many games that have made you cry, I can't but this is one of them and I'm happy to have played it. Yeah there isn't much gameplay but it isn't about that and if thats what you were hoping for, well sorry. Also I don't get why people keep saying this episode is rushed, NO TIME LEFT! Kinda says it all, you're running out of time. This is it, all we've been leading up to, there is no time to stop and think just do what needs to be done.. This is one of the best games I have ever been able to play though it is a little shorter then the other episodes it was truly breathtaking. Its so dark and sad. Not going for any spoilers but the ending had me in tears. I would definitely say buy this game. Hope it wins GOYT. This is the best episode of the season by far. You've been building up Lee character as well as his relationships with others through your choices and this is the episode where everything comes to a head. NOTHING will stop Lee from saving Clementine. The action starts right at the beginning of the episode and never lets up, it may be the shortest episode but it has both the best dialogue and action scenes of the entire series. It's true that you choices don't have a huge affect on the overall events of the narrative, but instead they succeed in making every choice feel personal, every choice you make is based on your personal morals and ethics in situations where there is no right answer. it's without a doubt the best story I've every played through in a game, though it's probably closer to a visual novel than traditional games.. This particular episode was weak for multiple reasons: 1.) it was very short. Easily less than 1 hour and I don't play fast. 2.) The gameplay was weak even when compared to previous episodes. Often times it was just walking on rails with no exploring at all. 3.) The dialogue options were weak. 4.) The ending was pretty obvious after episode 4 and imo wasn't all that powerful. I like the overall story but the characters for the most part leave something to be desired. I would like to see a more ingenious, creative character................................................ Now for an overall picture I give the game a 6/10. I agree with some of the negative posters saying the advertising is a little misleading because you do not determine the outcome of anything, there isn't much exploring which would be great in a game like this, and there aren't that many choices. It's not so much the gameplay, which definitely needs to be improved even by telltale standards, as it is the design. It just falls short on several levels including the length of each episode, how your choices don't matter after a little while, how you seem to have no control over your next action, etc. I think a lot of this fell on budget issues and since this game sold well I am hoping that the sequel will be stronger. I also wish this was released all as one game as it would have been a better experience compared to 5 split episodes over 7 months with each one being of varying quality. I would say for the next one in the series that if the developers can increase the length to 20+ hours with some actual replay value and maybe a few other options I'd buy it for $60. As it stand now it's really only worth $15 in my opinion (12 hour experience playing very slow with no replay value). So I recommend it if you can get it on sale somewhere around that price (steam holiday sale).. Bloody masterpiece... this game is a howto on making interactive movies. Probably one of the best, if not the best game I've played this year. Also, the ending, without revealing too much... very touching. Bravo.. Episode 5 is solid though it feels a bit rushed compared to other episodes, and you pretty much knew how it was going to end at the end of the last one. Despite this, it still manages to be touching and have an incredible story. If I were able to rate the episodes collectively I would place them at a 9.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I did not expect that a game can reproduce the excitement of the comic / TV series The Walking Dead. I did not expect that at all a game can trigger such emotions. The Walking Dead game introduces a great atmosphere for 5 episodes. Great shows a world of zombies. For the good elements of adventure and action, and choices, is really very good. It is a pity that the engine is really weak, and I wish that the elections did not produce a little more impact on the game. However, it is great. My Rating - 9/10. Very touching end to this story arch (apparently there may be more), but also frustrating because of the cheap deaths, a disappointing epilogue and many questions left unanswered. Definitely worth playing overall, especially if you are a fan of dark games/stories.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Walking Dead has one of the most emotional and well-crafted stories I have ever experienced in a video game. Seeing your love ones go, getting upset, even for your enemies, it's all normal. But this ending... many tears have been fallen for this great ending. I NEVER cried in a video game before. I kind of predicted the ending, but it was so well executed that it still touched my heart. This was the finale this series deserved, and I'll definitely be in line for season 2. Hats off to you Telltale Games.. Just awesome! The best of its **** story is great the conclusion is a tear jerker and the voice acting is as good as it gets, especially Clementine her voice actress should win awards. I can't recommend this game enough. i'll be damned if this game doesn't win the Game Of The Year award though its unusual for an adventure game to win a GOTY award and even more so for a point-and-click adventure game. A poignant yet phenomenal finish to an epic game which has set new standards for story telling in videogames. I really had given up on videogaming after hours of Call of Duty,Medal Of Honor,Assassin's Creed and craved for something new. This game stunningly surpassed my expectations. I feel it worth mentioning here that i am completely new to point-and-click adventure games,so i was quite skeptical about the idea of a point-and-click adventure game having as much to offer as a fast paced FPS or a thrilling action/adventure game. This game might even seem graphically unappealing to a chunk of gamers but its storyline really overshadows its shortcomings if any. Since its second season will be hitting the shelves soon,i recommend it as a MUST BUY!!! P.S : If my review seems too exaggerated to some people,i'd recommend a look at the bar above which says ""47 positive"" and just ""1 negative"" review. P.P.S: Telltale Games. you've got a new fan :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What an epic conclusion to an epic series. In my top 3 games of the year. I thought I was going to cry during the final scene. Wouldn't have minded waiting a couple of extra weeks for them to create more content as I do think (at around a quarter of the length of the others) it represents poor value for money when compared to the other episodes. For this reason, I give it 9.5. I hope season 2 can live up to the huge expectations that will surely be placed on it after all the GOTY's it will scoop. On a side note, the characterisations are so good that when me and the gf watch the series, we comment how bland they are compared to the game.. While i think The Walking Dead is one of the best games I've ever played i think episode 5 is by far the best. The other ones were great but this on was not far from PERFECT! As always the voice acting was great especially for Lee and Clementine, but this episode i actually thought Ben was the best. He was very convincing the whole time and i really liked him in this episode. While this episode did feel a bit shorter than the others i think it's the best of the 5 and it still deserves a 10!. The walking masterpiece. I hate zombie games and movies, but this one just let my jaw drop, kicked my ass with emotions, smashed my imagination with a 10-ton blow, and made me yearn form more games with so well-written characters, balanced action, awesome atmosphere, superb dubbing, and engaging storyline. A must-play and the best game of 2012, which proves that even with an old engine and not-so innovative mechanics, games can be mature, enriching and enchanting at the same time. The Walking Dead is bound to become a classic that will be mentioned alongside Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Grim Fandango, Monkey Island, Sanitarium, Broken Sword series, and all the cool adventure games that have been recently relegated to indie-game genre.. oh my the final episode was mind blowing with emotions i felt like crying at ending it was heart reaching it made me sad but when the episode ended i thought something would we would see it but then it stop i was like wtf make me wanting more........ telltale u done again perfect end for first season game hope second game more better. Telltale had make you attached to the characters for the previous 4 episodes, and it wrapped the story really well. I cried for the first time in my gaming experiences, and I am a 25 years old grown-up man ;_;. Very satisfying and very very emotional ending. I won't state if the ending was very happy or sad because I don't want to put any spoilers. Thus, I will state that the ending felt very emotionally powerful to me. I will be purchasing season 2 of this game.. As a whole, the story in The Walking Dead is a darn good'n, but Episode 5 feels as though it was rushed. Throughout the episodes, you're inundated with pseudo choices, and what that all amounts to is a universal ending for all. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the game wasn't marketed as having a unique story where the choices you make alter the game drastically, because they don't. The story somehow loops back around again to follow a set path shortly after making these so-called game changing decisions. Overall I loved the game and the story, but I believe that Telltale could've done more with regards to the decision making and the impact it had on gameplay. If I had to rate the game as a whole, all episodes included and without taking into account the poor mechanics previously mentioned, I'd give it a ten, no question. I'm left slightly disappointed though.. What can I say? I'm speechless.. The final instalment of a really fantastic game! The final ""episode"" was able to bring a good mix of everything, from the tear jerkers to the edge-of-seat action! It will make the manliest of men be reduced to tears. Throughout all the games I have ever played, The Walking Dead by Telltale Games is, by a country mile, my all time favourite.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game Of The Year.....Best game what i ever played......................................................................................................... One of the best ending of all time, that's for sure. And I'm keeping it real, I cried. I really cried at the ending. Congrats Telltale Games for making this awesome game. And my last words: Game of the Year.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think this is the best episode of the series. It's simpy amazing, and sad, and it's a very good ending to one of the best game in this year. It is for certain my game of the year.. I literally can't write any true review of this game, since I only just beat it and my eyes are still soaking wet from tears and I can't see a thing. I have to say, this is the most emotional gaming experience I've ever had. I loved all the episodes, and this one didn't disappoint either. Wonderful writing, characters and sound design. If the season two maintains this level of quality, we might have a new legendary series in gaming. I'm sorry, I can't say anything bad about this episode, it felt like all the technical difficulties weren't there anymore (or maybe at this point I just didn't care about them I just wanted to save little Clementine...). Hats of to Telltale for this season of The Walking Dead, it really honors the original comics and beats the TV series in every possible way. I hope it won't take too long until we get to see what happens next.... A very well done finale to an amazingly well-crafted and emotional story. Most worth-it amount I've spent on a game this year. I'll dock half a point for some minor technical issues like some stuttering in certain areas when transitioning between scenes, but Episode 5 is definitely worth a full 10 for its unforgetttable story and characters. The bar for story-telling in a game has now been raised so high, I look forward to the one which will surpass it. Hopefully, I wouldn't have to wait long, and Season 2 comes out soon. A definite first-day purchase for me.. I don't know what to say... This game has been quite a journey. I have never felt so into the atmosphere **** like this before. Every moment was amazing and I will never forget this game. The pacing is top notch, the story-telling is unbelievably well done, the characters continue to stay as amazing as they were before. I don't cry during video games. That law just changed.. Episode 5 is amazing, this is one of the best storydriven games i have ever played and episode 5 does not disappoint in any areas. I can safely say that this episode is the most emotional of all the episodes, the episode with the most action and so on. With a very good story and an in my opinion amazing ending this continues to be my favorite game of the year. I really recommend everyone to pick this game up, it is really amazing.. Episode 5 is simply amazing. I've been gaming since the 8-bit era and this game has the most well crafted story I've ever played. No ending could have been more appropriate for the series and I honestly believe it tops Episode 2. Can't say much more without spoiling it, but grab this game as soon as you can. Oh, and tell all your friends about it too. No one should get left out of this one. Wheezy247 9 I am going to be honest. Until the Walking Dead game series that Telltale has brilliant crafted, I cannot remember the last time I played a point and click adventure game, but I sure am glad I tried it again. Throughout the entire series, I saw my choices have an influence on what happened later in the episode or in later episodes, but never as much as that that is seen in the final episode ""No Time Left."" Telltale has successfully created a game that blends a unique art style, wonderful voice acting and a story that is probably the best story you'll play this entire year to create a series that, I believe, will have an impact on the future story development of video games. After playing through all of the episodes, I can definitely say that this was the most enjoyable episode, previously episode 2. It is such a delight to see how Telltale managed to bring the entire story together. The emotion that is brought out by the story and voice acting is so powerful, I almost cried at certain parts. I don't want to spoil the ending, but let's just say I can't wait for Telltale's newly announced Season 2. If you haven't played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to play all of the episodes. Telltale's series is not perfect, but the way they brought it all together at the end makes you understand why this game should be considered for game of the year. I would give it a 9.5/10.. Episode 5, the finale... without spoiling anything, it's a satisfying conclusion, even if you think you already know what's going to happen. I'll remember this game for a very long time.","this game is not a game that i go back to and cringe or think that is beacuse of nostalgia, its genuienly good . i have a low re-play score because when you re-play the game the new different choices you make either 1) don't make much difference or 2) the way the main character and other characters act/react for non-mainstream choices is highly unrealistic . my #1 complaint about"
433.Guild Wars,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Personally Guild Wars will be my No. 1 MMO of all time. The amount of time you can put into this game, trying so many different builds and farm methods is insane. It generally aged pretty good, but PVP is sadly filled with Bots, but everything in PVE is still possible to do Solo or if you like there are still some active Guilds playing. 10/10 best game of the MMORPG Genre. Pros -The graphics are fairly ground-breaking for the time the game was released. -The difficulty makes the game feel progressive. the last couple of areas feel like end-game zones due to the jump in difficulty. - The world building and zone design is fantastic, the diversity of biomes and the map design is S tier. - The holiday events are very in-depth and add a lot of content to the game. - The story is fantastic and the main reason I wanted a sequel Cons - There can be a lot of screen clutter due to the party size and abilities overlapping one another.. The best (mmo) rpg ever made, by a stretch. Highly recommend buying it with a friend and playing through the trilogy.. Best Game I played, ever. Unfortunately the sequel (GW2) did not follow the same mechanisms, classes and skills. It would be wonderful games with new interface and improved gameplay. 17 years after its release, I still play with great pleasure.. Awesome Game with awesome people who are still playing after almost 20 years!. The game from my point of view is a whole platform gamer's paradise most of the game play seems to involve jumping from ledge to ledge and if you dont make the jumps you miss out on loot if you're a platform game fanatic this is heaven for **** you buy the main game plus xpacs there are still areas you are gated from using, the game constantly dumps garbage items like dyes xp scrolls etc it seems they are determined to fill your stash with garbage,i guess as an incentive to buy more bag room from gem store.Character slots with both xpacs are enough to make just 5 characters you can of course buy more from the gem store. Game play can be ok but sudden 1 hit deaths kill that for you, constantly facing invulnerable mobs for no reason i can detect they just turn invulnerable in mid fight re-spawn rates are crazy if you fight a mob of 4 by the time the last falls all four are back up it must be a mechanic to force team play so a wasted purchase for solo **** game gives very little info about the task you are requested to perform quest event whatever not even the direction it might be in it is at times bewildering don't buy this game unless there's absolutely nothing else to **** graphics may appeal to some they are very good hence the score.. This game is an art. In combinations with all the 3 addons it deserves a much better succes and attention: The graphic is written geniously: beautiful and great performance. The gameplay gives you so many possiblities: great. And in the beginning it is easy to understand. So you see, the old easy to learn, hard to master principle. The idea of gathering all the players together to a town and let them group there to go through an instance is simply perfect. The campaing is great, I didnt want to stop to play, because I wanted to know, what happens next. The music is great too, I still enjoy to listen to some tracks (I downloaded them separately). I dont see any weaknesses in this game (dont forget, the game has 3 addons, that improves the basic game too). Still by far one of the best MMORPGs I've ever played. The graphics back at the time were gorgeous and made me feel very much part of the world. Roaming the crystal desert in solitude was such a hauntingly beautiful experience. The concept art, music and vistas took me away so much I dreamed about this game in my sleep. Compared to today's MMORPGs that harass you BS monetization, back then, once you bought the game, everything was yours to earn via in-game effort. Getting ectos was critical and the difficult areas, like Hall of Heroes required immense team work to pull off and luck to finish with an unstable internet connection. The PVP and multiplayer were also very enjoyable. Unfortunately Mesmers never found their place in this game, and were rejected by teams for difficult dungeons as they were poor in PVE although good in PVP. Jeremy Soule's music was a masterpiece for this, and I wish for him to return in GW3.. Guild Wars is a unique experience. Excellent story line, multiple campaigns (with hundreds of hours of extra content) and a beautiful world to explore. Easily my favorite game of all time. There's still a decent amount of people online and all the expansion so are inexpensive, I'd still recommend it now in 2016.. I spent my teenage times while playing Guild Wars. Actually there were many MMORPG's i was playing but the 'Guild Wars' was the real one. I'm not giving ""10"" points for that i was fan of it. GW deserves it. Game provides you ""Dude, you are free, you can anything you want. Build your character as you wish"" There was no power differences between classes cuz you wouldn't know your oppenents' build. Maybe the best thing was in GW, it was forcing you to use your brain. You couldn't play only spamming keyboard buttons. You had calculate your enemy and play smart and not only for pvp, pve was difficult to play too. Still best MMORPG for me and many players.. Fantastic fun world to play solo or with friends beautiful graphics and gameplay. Solid fun with epic pvp and clan/Faction building very guild oriented. Awesome Rpg i don't consider it a MMO. Worth $50. The first MMO I ever played way back in 2005. It is hands down my favorite game to this day. Everything from the story, the character attributes, skill/spell diversity, pvp, seasonal events, side quests, and community gave me some really fun memories. This game will always be special to me.. This is the game that actually got me hooked on video games. I would watch my sister and her boyfriend play, and I fell in love. I loved the graphics, the ability to explore, and the storyline. Unlike a lot of other MMORPGs , you don't have to pay a monthly fee after you purchase the game. Also, you have the ability to play by yourself, and don't have to depend on others to get through the game.. My first foray into the MMO scene and I was not disappointed in the slightest. No subscription fee, awesome gameplay, great story, and just an overall wonderful experience.. Best RPG in 2005. Good things : story lines, missions, graphics, fights with mercenaries (NPC) like in RTS games, attributes, skills, leveling up, exploring, traveling by map, elite skills capture, different regions in Tyria, towns, fights with final boss Khilbron, class specific armors. less : CORP, looking for guilds, craft, auction houses, cities, 1 playable race, 1 starting point for pve Game play : 7/10, graphics : 6,5/10, back ground : 7/10, lifetime : 7/10, sound : 7/10, community : 8/10, world : 7/10. Without a doubt, the best MMORPG I have played to date (although technically not actually an MMORPG). The graphics are gorgeous. There is an endless variety of character skillset possibilities due to the hundreds and hundreds of skills available for each character profession. This means you can never bore of the gameplay, and if you are into PVP it becomes a constantly changing arena involving teams changing/trialing new and progressively more creative builds to counter the currently winning team's build. Testing builds yourself to try and beat certain enemies/bosses, or solo certain areas is always a fun and rewarding experience. The game is complex, but not enough for the learning curve to be huge. The game itself is simple enough to learn to play, the challenge instead comes in learning how to play well. The map is huge, especially when combined with its expansions, and you will never run out of things to do. The game is free to play, and does not reward players who play for hours on end over those who are more casual. Everyone has access to gear with the same stats, the hardcore players simply pay extra in order to look better than everyone else. This was one of my favourite features about guild wars, especially over guild wars 2, which instead opts to reward hardcore players with a slight edge in stats over ordinary players due to their extensive playtimes. I only managed to stop playing this game after my computer crashed, for which I was grateful because this game genuinely ends up taking a large chunk of your life away. These days i play guild wars 2 instead, which is very fun and has stunning graphics, but feels very simple in comparison, especially in PvP due to the very limited skills available and lack of customisation.. Whenever I try out a new mmo the first thing I do is compare it to Guild Wars. That is how much of an impact this game left on me. I picked it up within a few months of it having came out and played it for YEARS. I had thousands of hours logged into this game, and STILL can't help but log on every once in a while to take a trip down memory lane. The game is of course very dated and I can't play it with the fervor that I used to, but it is still the mold with which I compare every mmo I come across. Hopefully soon a game will come which will match or surpass my image of it.. I played this game for years and enjoyed every moment of it. It plays a bit differently than other MMOs, because it is designed to prevent grinding, trolling, imbalance, and various other negative factors that typically plague online games.. I don't regret a minute of time spent in this game. The story is beautiful, the PvE is rich in content, and the community is excellent. The game offers so much versatility as well, with any class being able to take on the role of another with builds. The PvP is by far the best I've ever seen. All in all, it's a masterpiece. The only problem as of now is the community is a little on the dead side due to it's awful sequel.. All has been said in varied reviews about GW. All I can tell you is from 2005 up until now I've played for 7600+ hours. That's approximately 320 full days over a 7 year span. The only games that got me engaged in the past are Sword of Fargoal on the CBM64, Dungeon Master (and Chaos Strikes Back) by FTL on the Atari ST. I hope that ArenaNet never pulls the plug on it.. Last time I typed /age in the chat, I got as response that I had played the game over 3500 hours on this account, this excludes the time I spent on my 2 other accounts. A game that can keep me playing and enjoying it for 5 years and over 3500 hours deserves a 10.. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of MMORPGs. The only other one I've played extensively is World of Warcraft, and I preferred that game by a large margin. Why? Well, Guild Wars always seemed like a more limited version of WoW. The level cap is lower, the possibilities for playing without being in a party are more limited, and the items are less varied and interesting. None of that would matter very much if I really wanted to spend my time playing with other people, but there's nothing I find more frustrating than sitting down to play a video game and instead spending the next hour trying to get a group together, only to finally give up and turn it off. WoW offers gamers a lot of options for playing without depending on other players, and that is why I preferred it to Guild Wars.. I have had hours of fun with this game. It is beautifully atmospheric, has a good story, and a combat system capable of enormous sophistication. The world it creates feels very real and I actually cared about its fate.. This game was my first MMO and level 20 with all the expansions. As the years went on (maybe I put 400 hours into this game, or 500 but no more), the graphics got a little old and the gameplay not as fun; however, the hooks from this game was already in pretty deep. GW2 beta was more fun than GW the first time I played it. I've never played WoW. Learning all the new builds really was enjoyable, esp. all the necro. stuff with your heroes. I didn't play PvP much; I'm sure I was one of the rare people who didn't like it that much.. I wish Diablo 3 was this good. Massive world, every innovative play. Zero grinding, one of the best mmo ever made. Many many korean mmo copied guild war's style.. Guild Wars was a fantastic game that was well worth it's price. It offers more gameplay and customization than any game of it's peers. It was and forever will be a game that will be notable.. So addictive it's not even funny. Has gameplay unlike any other MMO, graphics that are a **** to the eyeballs and music that you won't be able to get out of your head any time soon. It is also relatively grindfest-free due to the low level cap, which I find to be a huge plus. While the formula gets a little stale after a while and the plot is nothing to write home about, it is still the best MMO I have ever played. Here's hoping GW2 will become a worthy successor of the original.. Why imo this game is great: (1) No monthly fee. If you do the math for other MMO's out there your going to pay a lot more once you start playing for over a year. Which to me, is very short. (2) No real grind besides what you choose to grind out, and it has insignificant impact on play. You can grind out titles which do nothing besides increase your e-peen or grind out materials for armor which have no better stats than armor you can get for cheap - again increasing your e-peen but no real benefit other than that. (3) No worries about making a mistake with your character - it's very easy to change out what you use. Fitting the no-grind theme of this game. (4) Perfect way to deal with death imo - you fail the quest but you don't lose anything like experience or items. Plus you only fail the quest after dying multiple times. (5) It's fun!. I played this game a few years back and for the life of me, could not get into it. Recently I decided to give it a second chance when I was offered the opportunity to play it again, and I'm glad that I picked it up for a second go. Once I got into the game, I became immersed in the story and the characters. The gameplay is slightly awkward for somebody who isn't used to it, but once I started to get the hang of things I really began enjoying myself. You don't have to party up with people if group work isn't your thing, and I like that a lot. I can play with friends if I want to, or I can just do things alone. I don't have to team up with total strangers that could potentially ruin my experience. Granted, I have met some nice people and the community seems to be nice overall, which is a good thing. Really looking forward to finishing up the campaigns in this game, and especially looking forward to the sequel.. Amazing game, very addictive, and even after many years after launch, it still has a reason to be played, which is the Hall of Monuments reward system for GW2. Many of the reviews here are either badly composed or off the topic based on personal experiences or just dumb choices. This game is the cure for your wallet, it's an engaging experience that won't burn your money. The PvP is one of this game's most stable and well-designed features, make no mistake this game does have PvE as any MMO game should. Also keep in mind this game is pure perfection if you do not mind instances when out questing. If you don't know what that means is, whoever you take with you whilst leaving the city/outpost, is all you're going to have with you. No random people coming in to yoink your xp gain or kill the mobs you set out to kill. They're all there, at every load. 1. Updates> This game since release has had a variety of changes from classes to balancing. **** World> The expansions add rewarding content is persistent for each of your characters, you can visit any continent as long as you've reached the area to travel to it, the visuals are different everywhere you go, its always nice to have some new colors. 3.Since navigation is so simple and streamlined, the minimap also shows where you've walked, making it easy for you not to get lost. 4. PvE combat> PvE is well done, the mobs are easy to find and a wiki feature in the game makes it easy for you to find what you're looking for. 5. Questing and Progression>This game is extremely quick to level in, what makes your character stronger is how you build their skills and set their gear. You'll reach max rank in no time, quest, do missions and your time shall not be wasted. Missions progress you through the storyline of each campaign (that is if you have the other expansions) but if you just own Prophecies it's the same deal. **** Game> Since leveling is so quick, the true content of the game is its end game, you'll have a variety of missions and titles to gain and due to Guild Wars 2 on the way if you own Eye of the North, you will get rewards for completing them if you get the next installment. Raids, dungeons, (Speed clears) are all in the game, know your role and get moving. This game leads you to have a much different experience at each turn, each class feels different, and a second play-through known as hard mode can get you some cash.. ive played this game for 6 years now and it has is the game i have played the most my overall game-time is about 130 days. there is so much content to do with all the new expansions and dungeon's the game has very nice graphics considering its so old now and yet i can still say its still one of the best mmo-based games out there and i really cannot wait for Guild wars 2, how ever long it takes.. One of the best games I have ever played in my life. The company (ArenaNet) took some chances with this game. They went for a bit of a different skill/attribute set and a lot of other things. They really stepped out of the comfort zone and threw away the traditional MMORPG **** And guess what, it worked well. There were a few dull areas but those were overthrown by the glorious rest of the game. The missions were fun and enticing, the gear was visually appealing and could parts mixed and matched. The graphics were very good for a companies very first game. At release this game was magnificent, the cities were overflowing with people and the PvP arenas was a place to be. Now, not so much. The game has aged and the majority of players can be seen on the later expansion packs or winds of change one of the newer updates. So in all honesty, I wouldn't purchase the game based on those facts. Wait for Guild Wars 2, which still has no monthly fee. That game will be well worth the wait.. Terrible, maybe I went into the game expecting some fun PVP but its not, broken unbalanced classes. I played this game about 2 months ago. The feature of how your character auto follows your opponent (wow real skill) is incredibly annoying. The game is worse than SWTOR when it comes to being on ""rails"". I am excited for GW2 but if it is anything like GW1 I will not be purchasing.. Don't have much to say about Guild Wars. I beta tested it long ago and it didn't fail to impress. Most people who say they hate this game are fanboys of other MMOs which I will not mention, and just don't get the whole concept behind the game. It's not supposed to take months to reach a ridiculously high level, then hours of killing monsters to get ridiculously overpowered weapons and armor. It is meant to be heavily based on tactics and skill. The low level cap and the ability to get ""maxed"" weapons (weapons with maximum stats for that particular category) about midway through the main story forces players to really build their character with different skills that complement each other, then use them right. If you like grinding, raiding, and games that are based much more on having an incredibly high level or incredibly powerful equipment, Guild Wars is NOT for you. It isn't a perfect game, with limited support and a bit lacking in an MMO feel, but it certainly isn't anything close to a bad game.. I've played this game since release and it has since become my favorite game of all time. The world is beautiful and inspired, and the animations are smooth and very high quality. I actually quite like the instancing as it prevents **** from messing with you, and I am generally quite a solitary person. The story in PvE is top notch and imaginative, and PvP itself is the best of an MMO on the market.. The reasoning behind my score for this game is simple. Firstly, the game itself is great fun and a blast to sit down and play no matter how much time you have. 30 minutes? No problem, there's a lot you can get done, even if you feel like at the time you didn't. Gameplay is very good, and the scenery is breath taking. I used to play this game when everything first came out in 2005-2006 before I got really really into WoW. I gave up WoW for a year and went back but I have finally said no to WoW and decided it was time to play this game again. When I first played this game I wasn't all that great at it because I didn't try to link skills together, I just used what I felt was the most powerful skills. Now I have sat down and really looked at the skills and I have to say it is way better that I have taken the time to because honestly, I kill things that much faster. The instanced hunting grounds yes are boring with no one else there but I don't care. Crank up my music and turn me loose and I can hunt for four hours and not get bored once. Meeting people is easy if you are willing to go out of your way to try to get to know some of the people around you in town. Quest are a breeze, and with a mini map that guides you to the quest, why would you complain about not being able to jump? WoW, good luck figuring out where the crap you are supposed to be heading. Yeah some of the NPC's tell you a general direction, but that could be a huge swath of the zone if you're not careful. I can't speak for the PvP in this game because I have never actually tried it out. I do enjoy the PvE a lot but that is because I am determined and dedicated to getting what I need, no matter the ammount of time required to get it. No need for teir whatever gear to hunt? Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about. No monthly fee's? Yes please. Ability to mix two classes together to become an even more deadly fighter than you already were? Sign me up now! Downsides are yes it can be difficult to trust someone you meet on the game because there is a high potential that they will be a **** or try to scam you. It can be monotonous doing the same thing over and over, but that is to be expected with every game you play, so everyone can stop griping and get back to playing the game. No jumping. Yeah okay, I know I said it's not a big deal but it is true, who in the world can't jump? I say it for believability and natural ability of a human being, not because I want to be able to jump. Those are the only two major complaints I have for this game, and the jumping I view as a minor thing because it seems pointless to jump when your playing the game to go in and hack things to pieces. And trusting someone over a game you may never meet in real life? Not a reason the game lost points either of these things, it lost the points because I think that while the instanced hunting grounds are awesome maybe allow a few other people into the same one as you. A minimum of 20 so that way **** of people hunt together that means there is still room for 16 others. I think the chance of seeing someone else out there doing the same thing as you also would give you incentive to team up and compare what quest you both need and that would form a bond of trust and a friendship that would allow you to know you have a friend in the game you can look for to hunt with. So over all I rate this game an 8 because yes it has a lot of plus factors, but there are still a few things that could really potentially be improved, even with the greatness that this game already is. On a more personal level for comparison, WoW and GW are nothing alike. They are two completely different games that were developed by two different companies. WoW has it's own perks, one of which is not graphics. GW to me is better than WoW because of the pure individuality that you can have with the 8 skills that you put on your bar that allow you to play however you want and not only that but the ammount of skills that you learn means that you never run out of combinations and chains of skills that you could potentially set up to use for a very very long time. Great game, and to be honest, so very glad I gave up WoW to get back into this amazing game.. I had previously scored this game a 0, which was a bit hasty of me. Now, after having spent much more time with this game I have found it to be a very good game overall, with a very very bad death penalty system. Taken as a whole this game and all its additions (3 campaigns, linked as smaller parts of the bigger story and one expansion to the larger story) is very well done. The engine is old, 6 years and counting, yet the graphics are still decent and when compared to the king of MMO's (Warcraft, terrible game that it's become) they are better. Landscapes often look like art, as if you are exploring a giant painting. The characters are very nicely modeled and no two look alike. This game allows a player to fully customize their appearance through the use of gear and dyes so you can look exactly how you want to. There are also optional costumes for purchase should one so desire. The quests are typical of any MMO or RPG and should be easily recognizable to anyone who has ever played one. One thing I particularly like about this game is the monsters, of endless varieties, are not pushovers. Combat is actually challenging. You have to think before you pull, do it wrong you die. But, then enters the worst thing about the **** death penalty. You die 15% is taken off your health and mana. That pretty much stays unless you kill A LOT of mobs or have some potions (which I'm told exist, but have yet to see one). Kill a world boss, you get 2% taken off the **** much and the bosses are that much harder. Death in what are called ""missions"", the larger quests that actually tell the story reset the entire mission and could waste an hour or more of your time. Dieing in this game ****, period. The abilities and different ""builds"" you can create are vast, allowing you to choose from a pool of tens, if not hundreds of combat moves and spells. The possibilities are really endless. The guild and communication interfaces could use a modernization and the UI doesn't give as much info as I would like, but those are minor things. The game would score a 9 or best MMO type game available from me, except the death penalty really really pisses me off. Played carefully, its a great game. Oh, and for around $40 you can get all the content the game has and there's no extra cost necessary, ever. Best MMO style game value in the industry, hands down.. It was a great game. Sadly one day arenanet decided to go ""hey, let's completely destroy all PvP in the game, and then make the PvE grind the primary interest of the game"" Now PvP is filled with unskilled noobs that think grind = skill (I just recently watched a couple of obs, not a single person in any of them knew how to qstep) You are forced to either use builds fully automated bots can play better than you, or end up being significantly weaker then your enemy. Arenanet entirely fails at balancing the game, only if a skill is so unbalanced it literally gives permanent immortality (Shadow Form) is it even fixed, and that's after A WHOLE YEAR of people abusing it. I don't think I need to say much about PvE, it's fun the first time you complete it, but after that it's just pure grind. It was a great game 5 years ago, and probably would have been now if PvP wasn't destroyed. I've spent a lot of fun hours in this game, RIP original Guild Wars. Good game with its pros and cons. Pros, The game looks great and plays well. The storyline is interesting and the quest are standard MMO type quest so you won't get lost. Only having 8 skills might turn some people away but with all the skills you get over the game you can make different and unique builds to match your style of play. You also can't forget you don't have to pay monthly for this game so if you stop playing and want to come back you can at anytime. Cons. The instanced world can be very dull if you don't find other people to play with and the PVP can get annoying at times.","the difficulty makes the game feel progressive . the holiday events are very in-depth and add a lot of content . the sequel (GW2) did not follow the same mechanisms, classes and skills."
434.Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration,"I’ve believed for a long time that the games industry doesn’t value its history the way other media does, and collections like this serve as a shining light that perhaps this attitude may change in the future.. Not every Atari game stands up today as a playable masterpiece, and that’s just fine. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration provides just about the best contextually driven system for playing and appreciating classic retro games that I’ve ever hit, and it’s an absolute must-have for any gamer of any age. I mean, Tempest 2000 is worth the price of admission alone, but along the way, you’ll learn a lot about gaming history, gaming development and even the weird and wonderful deals and dodgy antics that Atari got up to in its golden age.. ""Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration"" is a unique and amazing look at the dawn of the video game industry, with Atari at the forefront. This is no collection unlike any other... 103 games, emphemera, photos, video interviews, flyers, promo materials, top secret files & more! This collection includes games from the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, 8 bit computer line and YES, Jaguar and Lynx games (for the first time!) Digital Eclipse built an emulator for the project, even! This is the NEW standard for how all such collections should be in the future, and even though it took 50 years to get there, I'm glad that Digital Eclipse was at the help. Mike Mika & Stephen Frost and team have done a great job here with this amazing game! Digital Eclipse also created 5 new 'Reimagined' games from the ground up, which are amazing! These are: Quadratank, Haunted Houses, VCTR-SCTR (my favorite), Yars Reimagined, Neo Breakout (so fun!) and SwordQuest: Airworld (which was never completed over 40 years ago!) The videos includes are on an 'interactive timeline,' which begs you to explore the highs and lows of Atari's stellar 50 year history, from the arcade origins to the 90's and beyond! It's pretty amazing stuff. Check out my full review on my website ballistikcoffeeboy or on YouTube under the same name. Grab your copy today! Available for: Switch (standard and steelbook edition), PS4, PS5, Xbox, Steam, and soon also on the Atari VCS! Price is $39.99 for standard, $49.99 for the steelbook edition! A++. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration isn’t just a treasure trove of hard-to-find titles, it’s a love letter to gaming’s history. Besides simply playing these classics — some of which have been updated with improved graphics — you get a rich history lesson about the company. Candid interviews provide a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at what it was like working at the company and give you insight into the development of these older games. This context allows you to view these classics in an entirely new light.. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration offers a completely new, very fun way to explore several decades of Atari arcade machines, consoles, handhelds, and PCs.. This is not a collection of fantastic games, but a fantastic history lesson about gaming's most important company. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is a journey that begins from the distant '70s, with Pong and the 2600, goes through the 7800 and Jaguar eras, and actually concludes… today, as besides all the classic titles, small documentary-like videos, and so on, this even includes reimagined titles, plus unreleased prototypes - and more. Digital Eclipse crafted a rightful tribute to a legendary pioneer.. Fifty years is a long old time to remain even slightly relevant in the games industry, and whilst this package probably wont win too many new fans, it gives retro fans a great walk down memory lane.. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is about as definitive an Atari celebration as you can get. It doubles as both a game collection and an extensive history lesson on one of gaming's forefathers. Not every title is a winner, but in the end, younger players will gain a better appreciation for Atari's contributions and how far gaming has come.. The retrospectives are fun and may be almost worth the price of admission, especially as somebody who has played a lot of these games when I was about ten our so. As for the games themselves... well, I really wanted to like them better, but there are a number of issues. * Conspicuous omissions. I now realize why some of the usual suspects (Space Invaders, Defender, Pac Man) aren't included... they weren't originally Atari products, so I guess they can't be bundled here. Still wish I'd realized that ahead of time. * A good portion of the games were originally released for the paddle controller. I'm thinking Super Breakout, Demons to Diamonds, etc; also I believe that Tempest 2000 also had a potentiometer. In any case, the joycon stick is too sensitive. Gradual pressure should gently move the onscreen paddle in Super Breakout. But if I do more than think about the joystick on the switch, the paddle jumps straight across the room. I can see there is a way to change the responsiveness of controls, but it's not immediately clear which (if any) would help here. * Even if the original had a joystick control, I'm walking on eggshells with the joycon stick. The original Atari 2600 joystick was all-or-nothing for each direction. Maybe I just need to get used to it, or maybe I was born too early, but I don't expect the sprite to move unless I have the joycon stick all the way to the N/S/E/W/NE/SE/SW/NW. Otherwise I'm again clear across town when I'm only expecting to go a block or two. I'll pick it up again when I'm bored... meanwhile I welcome any suggestions on how to calibrate the controls, in which case I may change my rating.. Unfortunately the best game in whole compilation, Tempest 2000 is broken, after you pass to ""red levels"" music stop playing after few seconds.","""Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration"" is a unique and amazing look at the dawn of the video game industry, with Atari at the forefront . this collection includes 103 games, emphemera, photos, video interviews, flyers, promo materials, top secret files & more . digital eclipse also created 5 new 'Reimagined' games from the ground up, which are amazing ."
436.Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies,"Spectacular. Is it simple? Yeah, it's about 23 years old. But like every AC game it makes you feel great by the time you've come to the end and it captures that feeling better than nearly every other franchise I've played.. Very fun game. Very arcadey. Super noob friendly as well. No wonder is regarder as the first of the holy trinityof Ace Combat. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved the dog wearing an apron.Haha f-22 raptor goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. The best Ace Combat in the franchise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Namco outdid themselves with this game. They certainly pushed the PS2's capabilities and gave us a solid Ace Combat game and a solid entry to the PS2 era. A lot of stuff was done right in this game over the previous 3 games, the jet controls were improved a lot in my opinion, controlling the jets had more feel and was smoother compared to AC3. The ability to return to base to repair your jet and replenish your ammo supply is also very good. Dogfighting can be tough but gives the player a fair challenge. Mission layouts were slightly improved, they still had the same ""go fly over there and destroy this and that"" sometimes, but now it more relies on a ""points system"" where different enemies are worth different amount of points when destroyed and you have to reach a certain threshold within a time limit to complete the mission. It was nice to get a mix of the old style and new style of missions. Missions were made longer as a result and often had 2 parts with mission updates after completing the first part/task of a mission, which gave the player more game time, unlike AC3 giving the player also more game time but that's because you had to deal with the weird flying mechanics and the stupid missions towards the end of the game. All in all, AC4 is a solid entry to the franchise. Also worth mentioning that this time all regions got a full fledged story which adds character and emotion to the game, making the missions feel like they have more purpose and development over the previous 3 games. I like the whole story between Mobius 1 and Yellow Thirteen being narrated by a spectator of the war.. Easily one of my favorite games on the PS2 ever. With a story that starts you off on your heels and working to gain more and more ground in a mounting conflict in a large scale war. The game has lots of tension, the 18 missions on display start from trying to gain a little bit of ground and bases, to destroying off shore oil rigs, to clearing a path on the ground in a valley, all the way to taking out a giant super weapon. The missions are varied and have a lot of tension in them as pressure starts to mount, and a mission can go south very suddenly which requires you to weigh your options on your payload before taking off. And the story is presented in a very creative way, presented through the eyes of a civilian who befriended an enemy pilot and the things he saw as a result of your actions in the missions. The graphics aren't the best, especially with things on the ground like buildings, but with a game like this its honestly not that big of a deal, especially with how fast paced the game is, there isn't a whole lot of time to take a second and look around.. I have a theory you can review and ace Combat game from how good you think the music is ,For me the music was amazing and I listen to it everyday I bicycle , Can feel feel at this is the first ace Combat game on PS2 it feels kind of over sensitive sometimes , Cutscenes are some of the best in the series which is weird when is mostly just anime seems but the Story tales is amazing , My favourite song in the game is Comona. One of the most underrated and best game in my opinion, The story-telling and the style is brilliant according to the game launch, I had a few issues with the physics/controlls with some planes, but nothing really annoying (I played with normal mode) And the AI it's a bit difficult, even on normal mode so i recommend you to be very skilled trying to shoot down a plane!. game developers and producers do not deny even this is a **** game Where in war times saw timer either aviation war iron land war or naval war the timer has been exceeded by never because it is exaggerated small weapons are not actually can not advance not at all It's not worth playing this garbage better missing something like that You can't slap him on the cheek American aviation nothing else I don't do that if I were in charge because you don't have a stopwatch when you fight a foreign enemy the only goal is whispering to beat him not to compete with him to beat him and for that you don't need a stopwatch you have to have Wikipedia to help you what in this game is not it happens to revolve around enemies without even pulling light forms Nae and the like. There is no war if your colleague does not help you and leaves you prey to the enemies. if I was in charge of the American Aviation, he forbade you this game and the one who developed this game should not develop games his life because that would have been a rest in the memory of those who fought with aviation and not only that is done in other games which is not where you can deal with a stopwatch not something like that because the enemy invites you continuously depends on How I manage to catch the enemy does not depend on the stopwatch does not exceed you straight line that arrives first on arrival Here it is which also wins here and we were looking for the meter together than in the sick minds of the developers there will probably be a stopwatch that always ticks you know it's. While Ace Combat 3 introduced features that would set the standards for the rest of the AC series, AC4 was the big game-changer. This was the series' big Sixth Generation debut, launching shortly after the release of the PS2, while also adding a few touch-ups. Not only was this my first AC game, It was one of the first games I ever played on the **** I was absolutely miserable at it. My closest experience with flight games up to that point was Star Fox 64, but that game certainly didn't require the level of skill and precision needed for Ace Combat, so sadly I wasn't able to fully appreciate it as a kid. When I got older, however, and decided it to give it another go, I immediately fell in love with the game, and it helped to kick-start my love for the series. While the series started providing a heavier emphasis on story back in AC3 (at least in the Japanese version), one of the biggest additions in AC4 was the creation of it's own alternate universe called Strangereal, a setting which would become the basis for future games in the series. The story is told from the perspective of a man recounting the days of a devastating war he gets caught up in, and reacting to not only the enemy forces (the Eruseans) that occupy his city, but also the actions and consequences caused by you, the player. It's a very well-told and interesting story, with characters that aren't just blatantly evil. Hell, the narrator even hangs out and befriends a few of the opposing forces. One of the enemy ace pilots in the game, codenamed Yellow 13, has a real sense of honor to him. He's not interested in showing off his incredible kill count or trying to impress anyone. He's just doing his job. He prides himself on never losing a wingman, and yearns to face an opponent in battle that is worth a damn (a.k.a you). As the up and coming pilot Mobius 1, you'll need to push back against the Erusean forces and basically save the world by the end of it. The core gameplay of AC4 is fundamentally the same as previous entries. It's an arcade-style flight sim where you pick your aircraft, set to the skies and complete the objectives of the given mission, whether it be destroying all primary targets or getting a high enough score before time runs out. For each scenario, you'll need to pick and choose which aircraft is right for the job. AC3 was the first in the series to make full 3D analog movement the standard, and that same great feeling of control is improved here thanks to the game running at a buttery smooth framerate. Regardless of what you choose, each of the planes feel immensely satisfying to control. One of the most rewarding parts about the game is just being able to master the levels; pulling off all kinds of advanced techniques and maneuvers to become a real ace of the skies. Of course, the biggest difference between this game and the previous three is its jump in visuals. The game looks absolutely gorgeous for its time, and even as an early release on the system, it's one of the best looking PS2 games around. Holding up just as well is it's stellar sound design. The roaring howls of jet engines, the crashing explosions caused by a missile, the authentic voice chatter, and the phenomenal soundtrack all help to make playing through this game even more satisfying. That isn't to say it doesn't have a couple of blemishes. The biggest issue being this game's lack of check points. This isn't so much of a problem for levels where the only requirement is to destroy all primary targets (the final mission being an exception), but when you get to score attack missions that can last nearly half an hour that can be frustrating. You can be at the very tail end of one of those missions, but the moment you screw up and either die or don't reach the score threshold, you gotta re-do those 20+ minutes all over again. it's very easy to see why AC4 is one of the most popular games in the franchise. It polished an already winning gameplay formula and helped to create a new universe that would give Ace Combat its defining characteristics. It's not simply on of the best games in the series. AC04 is one of my personal favorite games period. It's a must play.. Best game ever made. The plot is perfect, it holds up in graphics for its time (even now) and the gameplay is the best ever known. By far the most amazing game of all time.. This game was ahead of its time and comes with some of the best soundtracks the series has ever conceived.. A very good game with great flight controls, customization and an engaging story. The only thing that is holding it back is the outdated graphics but that's expected. Rumor says they are remastering it and when they do I would 100% suggest picking it up.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ace Combat 5 is an epic installment in the fight simulation genre. Even after more than 10 years the graphics still hold up to the test of **** story is exceptional, and variety of aircraft to choose from ensures you have an aircraft for every occasion. If you are a PS2 collector, or an aircraft enthusiast, definitely pick this up wherever you still can.. The photo realism must be seen first hand to be believed, screen shots and movie clips found around the net cannot describe half the beauty that this game is. The graphics, consistent frame rate, and responsive controls successfully creates an immersive environment of flight. There are times where I would ignore the mission objectives and fly at incredible speeds, low to the ground, amongst snow-capped mountains. One word: Bliss.. One of my favorite games from the PS2. Still looks good for an early PS2 game. Each plane is unique and controls are easy to get used to. The story itself is also unique and its a shame that they took this element out of the new Ace Combat Games because honestly the story is what really made this game.. It is truly a master piece. A game with an amazing story, game play, music, graphics, and easy to use controls. It is one of the unknown games that not many people know. This makes me a little sad to hear.. It's been 10 years since I got this game. Yet every year since, I always find time to play this game. Sure, I play games like Battlefield and Call of Duty today, but this game will always be hold a special place in my gaming library. Graphics were stunning in its time, almost on par with MGS2 (released in the same year). And gameplay, it defines fun. Of course, when you play it for too long, it gets boring (like any other game). But after a couple days (or maybe hours), when you pop it in again, it feels like a new game. If you still have a PS2, or a PS3 that plays PS2 games, go find this game. You won't regret it. Should it be released on the PS Store, buy it. If they ever release an HD remake, buy it.. The gameplay lacks, there are simply too many missions where the objective is ""score x amount of points in y amount of time"". It gets a bit tedious, however thankfully this is not every mission and some inspired missions are added in like one based on D Day, the gameplay is very much in touch with the arcade roots and some of the planes are a bit too roller coastery at times. The somewhat lacking mission variety is balanced out by the amazing storytelling and fun missions thrown in, The story is told only in pictures paired with dialogue and missions. The slideshows really show how simple a concept paired with good voice acting and exceptional writing can make a great story, you don't need animations and cutscenes. The main character, Yellow 13, has depth and you really get a feel for who he is by the time you fight him in the final mission. It also sets up the stage of the war and the town, having the feeling of an occupied town during WW2. Seeing the characters on the ground in cutscenes gives the locations life, to the point where while flying overhead you really feel as though you're affecting the local population. The final mission isn't anything too complicated, but it's built up so much by in game dialogue that it still feels as though you're at the climax of the war. Less melodramatic chatter compared to 5 really gives it a more mature feel. Flawless story paired with some good gameplay. The graphics aren't the best. That's inevitable. But as long as you don't crave the absolute best graphics, this is a phenomenal game. The missions are engaging and aren't different versions of the same goal over and over again. But what really never seizes to amaze me is the incredible story-line. It gives a great look at what war is really like. It gives an inside look at the civilians in towns that have been victimized by wars. It shows that the enemy in war thinks the exact same thing of us as we think of them. They think we're the trigger-happy murderers. They aren't bad people in many cases. They are simply people who have views, opinions, and actions that conflict with us, and so we respond with violence. Of course, there are people like Bin Laden and **** who really are horrible people, but in this game, that's not the case. What also makes it unique is that it doesn't take the violence lightly. It doesn't make it seem fun to kill all the time, like C.O.D. and Battlefield do. It shows how war breaks hearts, kills innocent civilians, and we aren't necessarily the good guys. For example, the cut scene in which they say that Yellow-13's pride doesn't come from his kill record, but from his record of never losing a squadron member, shows that the enemy isn't a gun-toting demon.",a lot of stuff was done right in this game over the previous 3 games . missions were made longer as a result and often had 2 parts with mission updates after completing the first part/task of a mission . a lot of things were done right in this game over the previous 3 games .
