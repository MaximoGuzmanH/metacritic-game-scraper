955.Medal of Honor Underground,"For a PS1 game, it's a pretty solid game aside from the low draw distance. The music are perfect for this kind of WW2 game. Poor graphics and voice acting aside (it was 2000), the game is really good. I miss the Medal of Honor franchise… damn you, Call of Duty, for being the only “war game” that people want to play today! This story is for history and WWII buffs. While Manon is a silent protagonist, she has a strong story that helps as motivation to make you want to play all the way through. The difficulty is just right - not too hard at first, but increasingly difficult up until the last mission. It’s a challenging but rewarding game to play. Now for the cons. The controls are very awkward and can be uncomfortable for gamers used to today’s FPS’s. MoHU does not use analog for mobility - at least, I wasn’t able to use them. This makes it fairly difficult to navigate and maneuver during fights. Hit detection when shooting at enemies can also be wonky, as I had many “I totally shot that guy!”moments that left me frustrated. However, as I mentioned previously, this game was released around the year 2000, so you can’t expect a polished game up today’s standards. If you’re a fan of the Medal of Honor series, or you’re looking for an FPS with an interesting campaign filled with fair difficulty: this one’s for you. While I don’t think there’s a lot of replayability value, it’s still recommended to try it once.. The game starts very well, but the quality declines during the journey. Entire stages where you go through hordes of enemies that simply spawn in front of you. Thais game is good, but the first Medal of Honor is better.. Now this is what I'm talking about. The game may be old as dirt -- it is -- but that doesn't delete the fact that it is a really good shooter. It is kind of sad that a 2000 PS1 game is better than most of modern WWII FPS with female characters.. Fantastic FPS classic. Fantastic FPS classic. Fantastic FPS classic. Fantastic FPS classic. Fantastic FPS classic.. This game gets more interesting in the latest levels and also more challenging and difficult and there's no checkpoint available during missions, the accuracy of aiming is almost non existante except for the handgun and sniper. I used configNumber 5 to play.. We need a remake of this great game just like with the first one as well. I think this is my favorite fps game ever. Atmosphere 10/10. this game is my childhood and also i'm back play this games because girls frontline and i saw Sten Mk II and StG44 on Medal of Honor Underground so on Girls Frontline they have it, also The Battle of Monte Cassino is Epic Using Sten MkII and also Wewelsburg Castle Using StG44.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favorite fps games of all time.I am not a big fan of the genre but games like this one are fantastic.This game had a lot of variety of amazing levels and the music in this game was top notch.Maybe at the end the last chapters were silly, but I did not mind at all.. medal of honor series was best shooter game when i was a child . i love it .. Medal of Honor Underground is a strategic game with high difficulty that challenges the player in precision and agility to shoot frantically against enemies. medal of honor.. one of the best fps i ever played. last time i played it when i was 5-6 but i didnt forget it .. So amazing associations when i play this game with my 7 years sister. Campaing is good but this multi and this maps OWNS! One of my favorites games.","for a PS1 game, it's a pretty solid game aside from the low draw distance . the difficulty is just right - not too hard at first, but increasingly difficult up until the last mission . the controls are very awkward and can be uncomfortable for gamers used to today’s FPS’s ."
956.Need for Speed: High Stakes,"The fourth game in EA's franchise nails the pure thrill of racing. The presentation is stellar, the cops are ****, and it's just plain fun. By not indulging too heavily in style or gimmicks (you'll find no rubber banding here!), High Stakes can appeal to any racing fan. Please play this game on PlayStation and avoid the PC port. It is not the same game and the handling is inferior. This is the definitive version, despite the bad performance. But even when it runs at 14 frames per second, High Stakes is still one of the best games in the NFS franchise.. This was one of the very first games I've ever played on the PS1. Got it when I was about 11 and finally beat it when I turned 31. When I was a kid, the game seemed very hard and I was lusting heavily after the McLaren in the **** get it, you'd have to make it to the final stage of the **** I never got past the 3rd championship. Fastwoard to 20 years later and I boot it up once again. This time it's personal, I take it to the streets to not only beat the game, but to beat it to a full 100%. After over a month of trying. it finally happened. the very last race, I believe the GT Championship is extremely difficult. If you make one mistake you'll be missing out on the gold. It took me a good two weeks just on that race alone. But I finally beat it. Unlocked all the police cars, and even the helicopter. I finally beat something from my childhood. Feels like a friendly revenge. I adore this game, but don't think I'll be playing it again. Let the nostalgia take over once more and let it be a distant memory... 10/10 for childhood memories. 7/10 for the absolutely terrible rubberbanding in the latter levels, and the chunky controls. Turning will make you mad every now and then. Overall, a very deserved 8/10.. Need for speed high stakes has left me With a few memorable moments I love the Added features to upgrade and make your car Different soundtrack was great the pink slip races can be fair but disappointing especially when the game is a moderate grind for cash The end race was super annoying but has left me with knowing the feeling was to feel amazing when beating it. I loved the need for speed high stakes with great car excellent stage. The best game in the history of the Need for Speed ​​series. The variety of cars amazes the player with the graphics and gameplay of the cars along with competitive and realistic races. Exceptional voice acting along with various maps and masterpiece music make this version a work of art.. This game is something truly special. Classic Need for Speed flaunting its best characteristics: fancy cars, good progression system, exotic tracks, brilliant soundtrack and pissy cops. Good stuff and great addition to a PS1 library!. I greatly prefer High Stakes on PS1 over the PC version, probably because I grew up with the PC version of Hot Pursuit, which runs on a simpler version of the same engine. Granted, the same can be said with the PS1 versions of the same games, but I still do prefer this one.. Third best racing game on the system by far after the two Gran Turismo games. Phenomenal graphics and physique, great car selection and new damaging model and easy to pick up and play.. This game is the original Hot Pursuit multiplied by 100, one of the best menu soundtracks of all time, good race tracks, hot pursuit mode, solid career and arcade modes. What impress me more about this game is how they paid attention on the details back on PS1 days, you can turn the lights and hazards, car damage affect your performance, and the test drive mode just feels alive (try to crash on traffic, and do a couple laps, there is a chance of barriers being added on the site of the accident), the high stakes mode for 2 players is a great feature, but I think it was better used on the PC version career as a precursor of what we see on Most Wanted.. Need for Speed: High Stakes[a] is a 1999 racing video game developed by EA Canada and EA Seattle and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation. It is the fourth game in the Need for Speed series and a follow-up to Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit. The game features more realistic elements than its predecessors and introduced a damage system that allows cars to take damage when colliding with objects, affecting their appearance and performance. It also introduced a series of economy-based tournaments, awarding players with a cash prize that can be spent on repairing, purchasing, or upgrading cars for subsequent races. The game's Hot Pursuit mode, which was introduced in Hot Pursuit, was expanded with more options, allowing players to control police pursuits attempting to stop racers.. the best classic racing game from the time of the 90s and the best cars ferrari 360, f50, diablo sv, etc and new cars and an animated 3d character in the pc version. When they say ""High Stakes"", they weren't kidding. In the Career mode you buy expensive cars and upgrade them to stage 1, 2 and 3. At the end of each tournament, you race for pinks, and you can't restart the game! Is it raining at night and you just smashed your headlight and have to drive in pitch dark? Too bad buddy. I used to pull the plug out my computer just to avoid losing my car. I don't think any racing game has made me that nervous short of NFS Most Wanted. The cops were aggressive and smart, the handling was realistic, the dashboard view was perfect, you could use your horn, your lights, and tune the car to your liking. As a cop you could switch with other cop cars to catch a racer, deploy spike strips and call for a helicopter, or even fly a helicopter! The music gave me goosebumps, and the showcase, narration and videos describing each car in detail made all of them feel very special. I hope EA comes to their senses and remakes this game without omitting any of the things that made it truly great.. The best money can buy as it is for a racing game for ps1. Test drive 6 is a close 2nd. I spent hours on celtic ruins avoiding the police spike strips and road blocks. Driving around at more than 100 mph and driving great looking vehicles. Porche's lamborghini's, ferrari's, and the awesome orange mclaren what a prize it was to win it all. I would even go as far to say that this is the most important need for speed ever created.","high stakes is the fourth game in EA's racing franchise . the presentation is stellar, the cops are ****, and it's just plain fun . it's not the same game and the handling is inferior ."
957.Dino Crisis 2,"One of the best dinosaur games of all time. Lots of species and action in a game that was part of my childhood.. I did not understand the story, but Regina is beautiful! ""at least 75 characters"". It is not great like the first one... but Regina is still Regina (kind of...). Her face and race were changed. I dislike these changes. I will find whoever did this.. Dino Crisis 2, even though it has better graphics, animations, and more creatures, is still inferior compared to the first one, as it has a terrible story, extremely frequent and repetitive dinosaur spawns, you play as Regina and a guy, Dylan (which is an okay guy, but still, naturally I expect Regina only and always), there are no puzzles, and there is no deep story; basically, the second game completely disrespects the first; if the first was a success, why change it extremely?... Are they stupid?. Dino Crisis 2 resembles The Mercenaries, the unlockable bonus mode from Resident Evil 3. It's a fast-paced, arcade-style shoot em' up with survival horror aspects. Fans of the first DC might be disappointed that it's very different. But this is a thrilling survival action game that will keep you on your toes. I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. Amazing game! Soundtracks and scenarios. Was a great experience to play this game.. The sequel is more action focus and much less survival horror. The prequel was more of a “Resident Evil with dinosaurs”. Because the reorientation works well enough I do not mind this change even if I wanted more survival horror (I did a poor job back then reading reviews). Story: Set approx a year after the events of the prequel and the recovery of the third energy data. Third energy is basically free and clean energy with a catch. The mechanics behind it are not fully understood and malfunctions lead to time / space distortions. Remark: Not in a scale you can use like killing **** or make yourself awful rich. When Edward City which had a third energy project running completely vanishes a team is deployed for investigation. What they find will be a harsh battle for survival. The B-movie inspired story has its good moments. It is not reinventing the wheel but works well enough to keep you interested. Gameplay: Like I said it is more action with only small dosages of survival horror staples like for examples of puzzles and scarcity of ammunition. You play two characters with Regina which returns from the prequel and newcomer Dylan. Both characters have access to different weapons but overlap a lot gameplay-wise. The gameplay is around defeating enemies and rewards. You are rewarded with extinction points for each enemy including a nice bonus for quick succession (combos) and a huge bonus for not taking damage. The extinction points can be spend for weapons, healing items, ammunition and bonus items. You can equip a main and a sub weapon. Like always some weapons and combinations are better than others. From there on it is straight action and it feels a bit like a shooter. There are a few mini-games for a change of pace. In total it is fun to play but not stellar. Advice: Try to find all dinosaur files and maybe something good will happen. Also the gold card is one of the most useful items early on. Graphic / soundtrack: Graphically it looked really good back then and was a clear improvement over the prequel. Of cause it aged not that good compared to modern standards but that is to be expected and cant be hold against the game. The soundtrack was fine for me and a fitting addition. Negatives: The game gets a bit repetitive after a while so I will not give a higher rating. It is not a game I will replay too. Other than that I think there are no serious missteps. Overall I think it is worth playing. Not excellent but still a good game for its time. Sadly the story was never continued as Dino Crisis 3 was set far in the future and was the weakest game in the franchise with some bold but in hindsight bad choices.. Great game , suspense, action,guns ,unique , horror+Gore Worthy pick ,you can try in 2021 tooo. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i **** love this game ever since i was a kid played it in one siting a few years back on my ps2 sdly didnt have a card so couldnt save the A rated campaign uff still wanna try the Pc port !. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GOOD.. Dino Crisis 2 is without a doubt the most **** game I have ever played. But I and many agree that it's the best PS1 Action Game to be released. The first game was no masterpiece but it was an interesting experiment with the survival horror genre. Ultimately the game suffered from some questionable RnG and boring puzzles, although the game had some eerie environments and a semi interesting plot. Dino Crisis 2 on the other hand takes the horror out of the first game and throws it out of water and to honest I think the formula created by DC2 was for the better as Dino Crisis should be a ridiculous action game with some horror elements. But what makes DC2 so special is it has great gameplay which holds surprisingly well in 2019 and is always the game I go to when I'm bored and want something nostalgic to play as it's non stop action from beginning. It might be nostalgia speaking but if you want a seriously kick ass time and or want to experience the best the PS1 has to offer look no further than this.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. masterpiece of SH. the higher point in the serie. a shame it doesnt exist anymore.... Dino crisis 1 was alright I can admit, but Dino crisis 2 really stole the spotlight when it came out. The game is a direct continuation to 1 but instead of being a resident evil clone it puts you balls deep in a sea of dinosaur shooting action. My girlfriend told me to come into her bedroom and I told her NOT NOW BETCH IM PLAYING DINO CRISIS 2 and she wasn't even mad cause she knows the game is better than anything she can possibly offer me. This game is a masterpiece and the best game I ever played. BUY IT. I will never forget the time when i was waiting for my birthday's present and this present was a PS One console. When I finally got the console it was a dream came true and Dino Crisis 2 was among my first games. I have been a dino fan for the most of my life so this game was especially enjoyable for me. Some may argue that this is a simple resident evil clone even though the overall quality of this game is on a high level. I wouldn't agree with this statement. In dino crisis 2 you have to fight swift and agile dinosaurs but not the slow zombies like in the early resident evil games so the gameplay is far more dynamic. An outstanding variety of weapons of all sorts makes killing prehistoric creatures an endless fun. I also liked the music and the great atmosphere it created. There are many interesting details in the plot that seem really obscured and unevident in the beginnig but the more player progresses the more he/she learns about the 3-rd Energy experiment and it's outcomes and the story of helmeted people who are chasing our heroes throughout the game. There are about 10 species of dinosaurs presented in this game - not a huge number for a dino fan, still, bigger than in the first game. I think, a drawback of this game is the system of extinct points. As you kill more and more enemies without getting hit your earn more points that you can spend for buying new weapon and equipment. At some point you buy some really badass guns and begin to eliminate dinos like a terminator. It's fun, exciting and entertaining but you begin to feel more like a juggernaut rather than a prey. The developers could have reduced the number of points you get for killing dinos so there would be a greater sense of horror in this game( like in the exceptional Resident Evil 4 where the number of bullets is not enough to waste but is enough for your survival). It's a great system for an action game but not for a horror( so it's not a big drawback - just my personal opinion). Still, it's my favourite PS One game. Of course, it's not among the PS One gems like metal gear solid, resident evil 2, crash bandicoot and gran turismo but a game that is worth playing. I have been playing for 12 years and I can't remember MANY great games abouts dinosaurs (Paraworld, Peter Jackson's King Kong - that's all i remember). That's why Dino Crisis 2 is a monumental game for the fans of prehistoric monsters and is also a great experience for all third-person shooter fans.. A game that was first a survival had took a major change to an action game is just wow,Dino Crisis 2 is one heck **** of avoiding and make a run for the lasergates,here you can blast your way with all kind of weapons,this game also has a huge set of arsenals in your disposal and the points you receive each time you defeat a dinosaur its rewarding,the visuals are now prerrend. Do you know you can burn raptors to ashes in this game? This game is the baby of Resident Evil and Jurassic Park. If you are like me that love survival horror games like Silent Hill and loves dinosaurs, then what are you doing reading this, go get this game and play it. Its a short game but makes up in its whole concept of blasting off dinosaurs with tons of different weapons. Not only that but the gameplay changes in different ways to make the game even more enjoyable for you, the way you have to deal with the different dinosaurs is were you'll see how the game turns into an unforgettable experience as you have to deal with a little Compy, or have to run away from a giant T-Rex and so on.. A game that was first a survival had took a major change to an action game is just wow,Dino Crisis 2 is one heck **** of avoiding and make a run for the lasergates,here you can blast your way with all kind of weapons,this game also has a huge set of arsenals in your disposal and the points you receive each time you defeat a dinosaur its rewarding,the visuals are now prerrended enviroments unlike its 3D graphics from DC1 although it makes t look quite natural,the story still is mysterious which makes you hook on the gamepad from beggining to end.Great game with improvements but a little on the shortside.. Dino Crisis 2 is one of the best games that Capcom has ever developed. Do not remember how I met this game, but if I'm not mistaken during the mid-2000s an old friend of mine made a copy of this game and gave it to me. That should have been the first time I put hand to Dino Crisis 2. The fate wanted that I immediately loved this game, because since I was a child I loved dinosaurs. The first impression was striking: a Resident Evil with dinosaurs. But playing it deeper and deeper I realized that in fact it was a game in its own right. The story, not simple, it was beautiful from start to finish. The characters were also very well characterized. The gameplay was heir to the formula of Resident Evil, so it was fun. A lot of weapons to use, one more beautiful than the other. The difficulty was pretty well balanced, never indecent. But surely the most well crafted and cool thing in the game, were in fact the dinosaurs. They were made in a fantastic way: movements, sounds, attacks, the aspect. It was thanks to them that the game had a higher gear. Playing it at the time it was a real pleasure, and it will forever remain one of the best games I've ever played, this is the reason why I still own the CD. A masterpiece.. I am The Destroyer. I will break games, complain about the littlest detail, and tell you whether or not the game is worth buying. A lot of things to say here, but can't due to the 5000 character limit. The game will be judged under year 2000 gaming standards. This review speaks from the perspective of a person who just wants to play a game, and is not necessarily a Dino Crisis hardcore fan. 1. Story It is difficult to describe the story without giving away spoilers, so rather than telling you about it, I'll just going to tell you the need-to-know: You play as 2 characters in the game, Dylan and Regina. You've been sent through a timegate to rescue 1300 residents of Edward City, which has mysteriously disappeared off the map in the main timeline. On the other side, vicious dinosaurs rule the planet, and none of them will hesitate to attack you on animal instants. Despite the dangers, you have a mission to complete. Go do it! 2. Voice Acting You can definitely feel the retro style in the voice acting, and despite a few cheesy lines, it''s done pretty well. 3. Graphics and Visuals There is an irritating lag during cut-scenes if you're using an HD television, but despite that, these graphics are at their best for the Playstation era! During gameplay, everything is smooth & laid out clearly. The jungle you explore goes together with the atmosphere like cake and icing. 4. Gameplay Gameplay refers to combat, customization, and various puzzles you solve within the game. Put it all together and it's Above Average! -Battle System- Dinosaurs can jump at you during gameplay at any time, and they'll attempt sneak attacks on you. You could be walking in an area that looks fine, then suddenly have a Raptor jump out from behind and ambush you before you have the time to react. As unfair as it sounds; that's how a predator plays. Enemies will stubbornly spawn waves after waves in any given area, and you'll always be the prey in these hot-zones. There is plenty to kill here to the point where it can get repetitive. One more thing you have to watch out for is the Auto-Aim. You could end up pointing your gun at an enemy that isn't attacking you, and then get hit for it by a different enemy. It is highly recommended for new-time players to start on Normal difficulty. Hard difficulty is meant for those who understand the controls of the game because on this mode you can die in only 2 hits, and they spawn the stronger enemies earlier. -Customization- When you kill or severely hurt an enemy, you obtain something called ""Extinct Points"" which is considered the game's form of currency. Those points must be used to restock on ammo and various medical supplies you'll be using throughout the game. With enough Extinct Points, you are able to increase the maximum amount of ammo capacity on any gun. Though keep in mind that it's not possible to increase any other stats on a weapon, so you still might end up using a certain weapon to get through an area. The key to success is to spend your points wisely, and not wildly. Once you've gotten used to the game however, customization in Dino Crisis 2 is really just what weapon you want to use. -Puzzles- The puzzles are not too hard nor too easy, but with the amount of combat put in it almost feels like it's lacking, like a cake was baked with no love, then never tried again. 5. Soundtrack Dino Crisis 2's soundtrack isn't bad, but there's nothing here to phrase. In another year when you've moved onto another game, and then reflect back, you won't remember anything about the soundtrack for this game. 6.. Personal Enjoyment The one thing I was disappointed about was even after 2 playthroughs, I never got to try the ""Dino Duel"" game mode, which you can't unlock until you beat the game. Though granted, both playthroughs were on a different file. But I did have enough Extinct Points in the end to try the Dino Colliseum mini-game, which was basically just ""kill all the dinosaurs in an empty arena type thing. The real game takes place in the actual story mode though, with minigames feeling unimportant. Both playthroughs took me around 5 hours to complete. The game was good enough for me to do 2 playthroughs before I came on metacritic to write the review, so it's definitely worth something. 7. Overall Verdict The main criticism lies in lack of puzzles, near-endless enemies in single areas, and mini-games that require multiple playthroughs just to be able to play. However, if you look past those issues, you'll see a gem behind the rocks. The verdict for Dino Crisis 2 is an 8 out of 10. Definitely worth everyone's time - you won't find a better dinosaur game anywhere else.. More Action, More Weapons, More Dinosaurs. This games is loads of fun if you're a fan of the original.................................................. Mikami has to stop that survival horror **** . I played his last game the evil within and finished that game . Why he still works to creating his new resident evil game . He cant do that . We need new DINO CRISIS game immediately ... The Dino Crisis series has undergone a great metamorphosis from a Resident Evil clone to a brand-new type of game. Dino Crisis 2 is an original, enjoyable experience.","""dino crisis 2"" is a fast-paced, arcade-style shoot em' up with survival horror aspects . it's set approx a year after the events of the prequel and the recovery of the third energy data . the story has its good moments, but it is not in a scale you can use like killing **** ."
958.Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force,"Voyager elite force stays true to its source material and offers a good dose of high quality FPS action.. This is a wonderful game and it is fun to play and i really like this game and it has wonderful missions, good maps and a wonderful ending to the game. 10/10. Star Trek Voyager Elite force remains faithful to the original TV series even infusing a sense of charm on it's own. However the gameplay may not have aged as gracefully as it could have.. Excellent plot and acting, though it's a shame they couldn't get Jeri Ryan. As far as I know, the Elite Force series is the only Trek incarnation as an FPS. Fortunately, they nkocked it out of the park with this one. It's wonderful getting to explore Voyager and be a part of their journey for a brief period. Yes, compared to today's high def graphics it looks ancient, but it still plays competently. I recommend it to any fans of the series, but it should appeal to anyone who loves sci-fi. The expansion (from what I recall) doesn't really add much to it, but getting to explore more of the ship is certainly a treat.","i really like this game and it has wonderful missions, good maps and a wonderful ending to the game . excellent plot and acting, though it's a shame they couldn't get Jeri Ryan . compared to today's high def graphics it looks ancient, but it still plays competently ."
959.Nioh 2: The Complete Edition,"I wanted to like this game, but the combat feels so clunky. Add in the absolutely boring, corny-looking bosses and weak level design... I just couldn't enjoy it.. Great souls like with mission type gameplay. The mouse and keyboard control was pretty wonky though. Took 120 hours to 100% it. Very good replayability with a lot of repetition.. My favorite souls-like game. The Yokai are gorgeous, and the stance system keeps me on my toes.. I don't like it, I am told time and time again that this game has the best combat there is and I mean yeah kind of. You have two dozen moves 6 possible dodge animations three damage output options but everything past a light attack and dodge is an eye candy you are not encouraged to expand your move set at all except for a higher damage output but I digress. Well now you are probably impressed with the deepness your movement but the actual combat in my eyes is quite ****. Because it doesn't matter how flashy your character movement is when his opponent is i.e. minecraft zombie, and that's pretty much the environment of this game. The player and the enemies don't mesh together, you throw out your combo, back off, the boss does his combo and you do yours again and repeat. I spent the first 10 to 15 hours trying to figure out how do I make the combat seamless like in DarkSouls jumping through attacks and punishing or like in Sekiro a beautiful dance of deflections and retaliation But alas Nioh is not any of those games, your character is the whole game the rest is your playground for your witty and efficient combos and enemies are there just to play the role of semi sentient training dummy.. This is an excellent game that offers a wealth of content. The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the actions are fluid, making for an engaging and enjoyable experience.. I was able to really enjoy it for a long time. The fun of combat style is unmatched by any other game.. An incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo. This game has a lot to offer: - Durability: You can spend a lot of hours by completing the campaign which is huge with plenty submissions and is very challenging. - The possibilities to build your character are incredible huge.. greater game ever made. fantastic combat and story. Great graphic and map queality. Best souls like ever made.. Best Game in the world, everything is awesome! This is perfect Game!!!!!!!!. One of the best combat systems I have ever played. Really loved the depth and variety. Difficulty was just right, and beating levels and bossed felt really good. But the story wasn’t really for me. It was forgettable and I didn’t care for it at all. Also I seriously hated the loot system. Every drop felt meaningless, and still I had to skim through all of them in the case there was a weapon that was 1% better. That is a shame, since I didn’t even go through NG+ because of the tediousness. 8/10. The best fast moving combat souls-like till date.. best souls game ever played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you like soulslike games, then you are at home. But if you don't like them that much, this won't change your mind.. This game is full of tough satisfying combat trials and situations. The combat system here is the real highlight especially when paired with the extremely strong enemy designs that really squeeze all of the juice out of this thing. That being said, the diablo loot system is tiresome/tedious and the game is overly long with too many repetitive levels and encounters.. As in the first part of a lot of unnecessary mechanics that just get in the way of playing. The developers are still not shown the computer. I think for Team Ninja PC is some kind of myth. Why was it necessary to complicate the game with a bunch of unnecessary mechanics is unclear. Only because of the good character editor I played about 15h, but more I could not endure.. nioh is garbage souls like ripp off that does everything worst -trash bosses -trash level design -trash plot -trash graphics. such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash. **** game. Demon souls rip off mixed with Mario. If you don’t mind grinding for 5 hours and falling into 10x more environmental dangers than there are enemies, this is the game for you.. A really good game. I've played the game late enough that the pc port didn't bother me, since they've fixed it by now. The combat flows really well and the game is fairly hard, though not impossible. I really like the stamina regaining mechanic, and there are lots of other items and weapons to experiment with. Some areas really require you to do a full exploration instead of just running through the place, like the third area which has you fight the final boss under harder circumstances if you haven't done destroyed statues in various locations of the area. Speaking of the area, it's probably one of my gripes about the game. There are lots of re-uses of old map - even when you don't consider the times when you go back to an area due to some submission. The mission/quest system is incredibly bland but I understand why the game developers added it into the game. The story though is utterly wack and I LOVE it, some things fly over my head, cause I'm not from Japan, but it's just really fun, even though it doesn't make any sense. Overall, a lot of things could be better, but a fun game.. his game is great! And for the people complaining, it's not really meant for keyboard and mouse, it's a controller game, similar to darksouls and NieR. Runs so much better on my PC compared to the PS4 and is honestly just super fun. 10/10 would recommend if you like difficult games.. TL;DR: The bosses can do everything, you can do almost nothing. Boss fight means: wait 20 seconds until you can place the next hit in order to do 0,001% damage to the boss. 90% of the boss moves are so fast you can't even react to them. Very cheap and lazy. I have played DS1, DS2, DS3, Nioh, Sekiro and some other Soulslikes. Nioh 2 could be a good game, but with the difficulty they went too far this time. They have increased the health pools of enemies, even normal enemies are now performing lightning fast attacks that 1 or 2-shot you. For me, it has come to the point where it is not fun anymore. Running 20 times to some miniboss only to be 2-shot by his lightning fast attack, yeah...great! The game is extremely cheap. They say that there is the burst counter and the Yokai attacks now. Hahaha! Ridiculous. The burst counter has a reaction window of milliseconds, so you mess it up 70% of the times. Dodging is safer. And the Yokai attacks, you can do 1 or 2 and then your Anmia is used up. So, in most cases useless. However, the game is fun but you must be aware that it is a lot harder and more frustrating than Nioh 1. Pros ------- - they improved the level design, there is more variety and levels are more creative - graphics are slightly better - good combat system - menus have become better - excellent, funny cutscenes - better variety of monsters and attacks Cons ------- - Insane difficulty spikes - Graphics still not on par with other 2020 games (graphics are improved but still look outdated) - Overall story is mediocre - Generic side missions - Reused levels from Nioh 1 (!!!!) - Reused bosses - Convoluted loot system - Sometimes keystrokes not registering, annoying in boss fights were you have exactly 1 second to heal. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. bad game ,repetitive enemies,,not good graphics and very very bad ending of story dont install it. Much more advanced graphics and action than Ni-oh 1 and a sense of hitting. And a lot of weapons and armor. Even more difficult than previous works Ni-oh1 and Dark Soul and Bloodborn. It's a perfect game. And overall, the game is cool. The main characters and characters that appear are cool, and the weapons and armor are cool. The sword fight as if it were actually a Japanese kendo is also cool. With pets such as wolves and eagles, It's cool to fight by transforming into a monster like Inuyasha.. Playing the menu game of Nioh 2 is just as important as the one that’s played while in combat, and it can be exhausting sometimes to spend 30 minutes or more going through literally hundreds of pieces of gear. At the same time I love and hate this game. I ended it and DLC. I made all achievements on ""kill boss with no damage to you"", so I am at my right to write all what I write here. And about difficulty too: ... What I liked: Interesting story, with cool details of Mythology... Tea cups with stats & your own house are interesting... Parry of a red-strong attacks is cool... Adding a new boob's-monsters is cool :) ...Bosses in general are varied and interesting, for me, even human... The combat system is still good and juicy... Adding a blue graves with helpers was a great idea... Auto-refill of your spirit at bosses - great, it was annoying to get it in a new ""run"" every time... Interesting new and slightly modified old monsters in DLC. Interesting story that give us a real end to whole story... And a new system of soul cores and Yokai skills. You can make a thousands of different builds with them. ... What I didn't like: The story extremely poor given through short scenes and towels of text... The same locations(The creators wanted to spit on criticism of the players for this hack with a constant return to the same places a hundred times.)... I hate Tengu, Yoki with kusarigama & Magatsu(Fu*g mixers), Especially in small rooms and on narrow corners. It was extremely mean towards players non-samurai from birth... Even if you level 50 you make 3 hits to a weakest skeleton OR at your level you need to make 15-20 sword hits - they kill you in 2-3. Perfect balance... Kodama market & rice are complete useless(I absolutely don’t understand for what, if everything is renewed at the altar)... What was in the head of the man that make a protagonist to start missions with RARE CRAFTABLE! bullets, arrows and cannonballs!? I had all the time to change and sometimes used it mistakenly... Sleeping monster sometimes wake up, sometimes they don't when you approach them(Not a damn thing is clear when and why its triggering)... Grabbing from the void(the monsters time to time can grab you from the air even if he missed you)... Shoot with a canon in one - the neighbors will be deaf and blind even in two steps away, if the target was behind them... Castle-boss shoots through his own hands... It is not clear at all in terms of the some parameters and their description(for example of AA++ and so on. Better in %)... Loot is still almost garbage on 70%... Searching for objects on the map is interesting, but things are complete garbage... Awful uncomfortable skill system. It would be better to leave the scrolls, and not to copy from PoE... Overexposures, light halos, slightly torn-eyed details(It's definetly not a level of 2021)... The fact that the game has become more difficult is normal, but from time to time there are places where the difficulty is increased somehow completely inadequate. Either due to the frenzy of the enemy, or due to the fact that many strong ones are being thrown at once. And with a Dark World included. ... And now the cherry on the damn cake. The most disgusting thing that pissed me off at the beginning of the game. I was forced to use that because of the obscene appeal to the players: I will not touch the console controls - there are no complaints here, but if you are porting game to a PC, then do it damn well, and not through the ""back seat"". And the most disgusting thing is that in the 1st part it was possible to separate the jump and dodge moves, but in the 2nd part it was no longer. For PC players who do not play with a gamepad, it is a mockery to call this porting in full. IMHO if you like. I had to leave the shift button empty and for a long time pressed it automatically and for a long time getting used to running and dodging on one space bar. ... A lot of unpleasant and repulsive moments for me completely block smaller number of big pluses. I decided to give the game the maximum yellow rating.. This game has really bad controls if you can just get the playstation or xbox version.. A real cool action game but, unfortunately, with some little issues in this PC porting. If it wasn't for these issues, the game would literally represent the best possible evolution of the first Nioh.. Much like Nioh 1, I enjoyed Nioh 2. The combat is nice and challenging but not completely unforgivable. I wish the world/levels were more connected instead of completely separate, and side missions are just re-hashes, but that can be overlooked. Date Completed: 2021-06-29 Playtime: 60h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: Played Nioh 1? You know what to expect. Souls-like fan? It's worth playing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played on PC with a XBOX controller. One of the best games I played in the last few months. Could be difficult at the beginning but the game itself provides a lot of possibilities to make the boss fights less painful. Perhaps the best combat system so far in the ARPG genre. Every weapon is extremely fun to play with. (Could imagine that playing with a keyboard and mouse might be painful, but the XBOX controller works for me perfectly.). I am not going to say much. This game is a legend. I loved the first Nioh and this one took the first game to another level. They fixed and made EVERY thing in the first game even better in NiOH2. I have never seen a company that fixes so much in a game in the sequel. A big respect and love from me. Because this game gave me a lot of joy in my most desperate time of my life. For being a big Souls/Sekiro fan, I am now an even bigger fan of NiOH series. They are so amazing and specially NIOH2 because it such a complete game now. They made everything better. Its hard to explain. You have to play both of them to understand what I mean. I wish NIOH 3 won't take long to be developed.. After hundreds of hours put into Nioh 2 – The Complete Edition, I can honestly say this is one of the greatest games this generation. It’s fun, it’s hard, it has tons of lore, flexibility in how you **** name it. At times, I feel elated in cutting through the incredible variety of enemies, and others, I feel like I’m just beating my head against a wall on just one, singular boss. It certainly keeps you on your toes. I’ll keep this short. There is a lot to master. Simply button mashing here will only get you so far. You’ll need to master the combat, combos, crafting, skill trees, and so much more to squeeze out the potential in your playable character. You’ll need to, because the enemies and bosses are relentless, and you’ll often feel like you have barely any room to breathe. That’s a good thing, because you’ll need to strategize, time your attacks, and improve your reflexes if you want to make it through this. My one complaint boils down to performance issues and graphical hiccups. Some areas will have your framerates drop, and pop-ups are common; so to the graphics aficionado, this may be a concern. Here is the bottom line. Get it. It’s good. I’ve put some 200+ hours into this, and I still have NG+ to dig my teeth in to. I’m not someone who typically replays the NG+, but for those who do, there is more than enough incentive to drop another couple of hundreds of hours in the replay. Awesome game!. Souls like at his best, great places and secrets to discover, outstanding combat gameplay, extremely deep and fun to play, one of the best game of 2021. A too bad Dark Souls copy, I play all graphic on the highest and the graphics are trash. before keyboard fix I would rata this game like 1 of 10. Now I can play normally and I see what a great job was made. Still playing with keyboard and mouse (I have dual shock 4 but not using it). I like story, I like this combat system, upgrade system, this beautiful well-optimized world. Also game runs smooth at 60 FPS with no any glitch(exccept for 2-3 crashed per a day which is not a problem for me). I really hope developers won't stop and release Nioh3 or so. Thanks for such amazing game. The best experience is when u play in coop even with randoms. You are not feeling alone :).. nice game, nice combat and skills, everything is just so good.Nice game. If you like Souls series, Nioh 2 will take part of your life.. Pretty fun game with Souls-like combat and progression system similar to Diablo. Has a decent amount of great bosses and overall cunning gameplay. Now after a recent patch that fixed K/M prompts it's a pretty great port too, since that was the only problem for me.. Really good game with a great combat system. Don't listen to people complaining about controller issues. Never expect to play a port with a mouse and keyboard as well as with another controller. Boss fights are good (well, except maybe one). Complaining about repetitive moves from bosses in a game like this is meh. You're supposed to be able to learn the way they attack so you can counter the right way. And its satisfying to learn and own a boss's ""behind"".. Do not listen to the negative reviews for this game. Look like a bunch of bots saying the same thing anyhow. Game is amazing. All of these people with potato pc's with frame drops... yeah, what do you expect? Get a halfway decent rig. As for bad mapping and people complaining about the ps4 icons displaying instead of the xbox gamepad controls on pc... you can change this. in steam as well as in the game. Its one of the control scheme options, how much easier could it get.. I'm kind of amazed by the amount of low scores this has on here (well... maybe I'm not to be fair as it's Metacritic....) Anyway, this is running perfectly on my fairly weak PC. I'm under the recommended specs but above the minimum and I've had no issues at all after 15 hours. Really impressed with it so far. I don't know what it was like at launch - maybe there were issues that have now been fixed and maybe my expectations were lowered by coming to this from Valhalla which is an absolute disaster of a PC game but I'm loving Nioh 2! It's the first souls-like game I've played that hasn't left me wishing I was playing the real thing.. doesnt get much better then nioh 2 in other games, combat system is endless, difficulty is hard to master but when you master it, you are asking yourself what was i doing previously lol 1440P 60 fps easy on max with 3070 4K around 45 frames per sec, i dont get the wining about performance. performance is ok, game has even DLSS now. Final Score: 10/10. Nice game. If you like Souls series, Nioh 2 will take part of your life. P.s. you must use Gamepad to play this game. Mouse&keyboard play is like hell.. Disgusting average user reviews score. Game is easily a 9/10. Quite possibly the best combat system ever in videogames, tremendous build variety, great bosses and very good and improved level Design. Ignore those idiots and buy the game. Game supports controller. I suggest you buy or own one if trying to play game. Keyboard + Mouse is just **** combination to fast paced action game. Little bit more harder than Nioh but brings so much more content and upgrades to table that game is masterpiece.. I honestly expected a better port for pc, but it is terribly bad, play the ps4 version if you can because the pc version is horrible.. Not understanding all the hype.Gamplay is mediocre ,poor dodge frames ,artificial difficulty with bosses and enemies dealing either too much dps or have too much hp even though you can be way above their level .Graphics and animations are super dated for a relatively recent release. Boss fights are nothing to remember since they all have repetitive attack moves and lazy level design .Nioh 1 was great ,this just feels like a recycled version of nioh .I'm not even sure why this was compared to dark souls or sekiro for that matter since they had memorable boss fights with interesting lore and fair difficulty.. Absolutely amazing game. As someone who was not blown away by its predecessor that was starring William as the protagonist, I immediately fell in love with this one after the first mission. There's just something special in being able to make your own character. Also I personally enjoyed more the story of a character local to Japan rather than an Englishman form across the ocean (no hate on William though, he's great but not my cup of tea). There is some legitimate criticism towards the PC port, namely the controls on KB+M. But in all fairness, I have tried playing all of the Souls titles that had PC releases (so 1-3, Sekiro, remasters) and honestly none of them were enjoyable on KB+M. Every single time I have ended up switching to a controller, and frankly I believe this genre simply plays better on a controller. So do yourself a favor and grab that x-box or ps4/5 (by the way, dualshock4 has flawless support in this game, it's one of not many games that recognized mine right away and had all the PS4 button prompts). Just don't torture yourself trying to force KB+M on this game. DLSS was added in a recent patch and it's stellar. It allows me to run the game at pretty stable and smooth 120fps, while before it would chug a bit when particle effects appear in large quantities. The story is fairly simple, but very well executed. I saw some people make an argument that they didn't like ""silent protagonist"" deal, and that's a valid opinion; in my opinion the protagonist is rather expressive in his/her body language, facial expressions and actions, so you don't really need a voice or lines of dialogue. It's fairly hard to nail a voiced protagonist for a player made character that would please everyone (or even the majority), so a silent but expressive protagonist that leaves some blanks for you to fill is the next logical step and IMO it works well. Gameplay is crisp, there is a good variety in weapons and ways you can build your character, lots of stuff to farm and try after the main story is done. To me, Nioh 2 did what I wanted Sekiro to do - which is a punishing and difficult action/RPG set in feudal Japan, with character customization and different era accurate (and completely made up) weapons. In the 2020 - February 2021 draught of good video games Nioh 2 is a lush oasis, with lovely story, characters, amazing gameplay and co-op (and I know it came out a while ago on console, but I don't currently own one, the review is for the PC version). While other sequels and new entries in the latest history have been anything in-between extremely disappointing and criminally unfinished, Nioh 2 surpassed it's predecessor and didn't need microtransactions, lootboxes or other scummy practices to excel. The review above is my personal opinion. I definitely agree to some of the criticisms and am opent to discuss them, but I strongly believe that the ""lack of DLSS"" (false as of right now) or ""bad graphics lol"" are a valid reason to rate the game 0/10. If you are that immature that you gonna throw a temper tantrum over nothing and rate an otherwise with a score that would put it alongside the likes of Cyberpunk, Anthem, Andromeda, Battlefront 2 on release, etc. you have no business posting reviews.. The game is totally unplayable on PC, control mapping is totally for PS users, why the dev team can offer such a game for PC users ? Play this game on PC is a nightmare, you must have to remember all keys in option menu in such a hardcore action game.... easy 9/10 . Buy a controller if you really wanna enjoy a soulslike game , end of story . Putting 0 in such a wonderful game because the port does not do justice on keyboard is criminal . Amazing replay ability , interesting story if you pay attention to it , extremely good gameplay , you feel as the game progresses that you become even better at it. I have an 3080 and only get 30 FPS (this bad optimized games aren't new for me as an Arma 3 player), this wouldn't be a problem if this came from 2015. The controls are also not the best (with keyboard), I bought an Play Station controller to play this game, with that it worked flawless. Its very challenging, that's a good thing. The levels are big and complex and the story is also not bad. If you want to play this on PC don't aspect 120 FPS, more 40-60, but you should buy a Ps4/5 Controller if you want the best experience.. Excellent Game if you Like Action rpgs. Combat offers a lot of variety and is really fun. Gamepad is a must and with a Xbox Controller i never had any issues. Runs with 60 fps on 1080 p with a geforce 1080 and I7 3770 k.. This is a console game! Be happy that you pc gamers get the game at all! If u don’t like it then get a PlayStation as you should have done in the first place !. The game right now isn't at the top with the graphics, but it still has been amazing for me playin it on a 3070, it's been a REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE, and i'm completely new to the nioh saga, if you're searchin for something similar to dark souls this is the perfect game for you, a lot of possibilities for the builds and an amazing combat system. The main quest could have been better, but i LOVED the way the game tells you about the japanese culture describing yokais, the locations, weapons, secondary characters' backgrounds and more.. I would give a 8,5/10. It's perfectly playable with XBOX One Pad on PC. Gameplay is addictiv as **** It would give a 9/10 but the PC port is not optimized and the graphics are exactly the same as Nioh Part 1. Gsync compatible is not working on my LG OLED. It has bad frametimes above 60FPS and the ingame FPS limiter is terrible and buggy. Also i only get a good HDR picture when i use borderless windowed mode. Fullscreen is washed out as hell, even in SDR. And i can't set 2160p ingame without disabling the fullscreen optimization in the exe.. Good graphics, runs like crap sometimes though and the engine gets really slow. So satisfying, haven't finished though.. This game is great! And for the people complaining, it's not really meant for keyboard and mouse, it's a controller game, similar to darksouls and NieR. Runs so much better on my PC compared to the PS4 and is honestly just super fun. 10/10 would recommend if you like difficult games.. These bad reviews are crazy, buy a controller! Some games just work better with a controller. Use the right tool for the right job. Xbox controller works great and all the on screen control show up correctly. Fantastic game, amazing combat. I can run everything on high using a geforce 1080 gtx gaming laptop and see no slowdowns (1080p 60fps). True rating 9, giving a 10 to help counter the idiots.. First of all, the negative reviews are dumb. You can't rat a game 0/10, just because it is not perfectly optimized for PC. Most of the reviewers are all whining and complaining about it having poor controls on PC. That was never a problem with me, as my controller was ready before the game launched. Having said that, even if you wanna be a crybaby about it, drop 2 points maximum, not freaking 10 and review bomb it 0/10. People are so stupid. Having said that, This game is just phenomenal. Even though they basically used the same engine, the gameplay enhancements and editions are great. I found it easier than Nioh 1, but the story is a bit lacking. Nioh 1 had a generic storyline, but even that was more interesting than Nioh 2's storyline. As I launched the game, it had to live up to many expectations that I had since Nioh 1 was a masterpiece to me, and I'm glad to report that it lived up to those expectations. New bosses, new monsters, new weapons, new moves, new ****. I played a lot of Nioh 2, and I can't seem to get enough of it. I would give this game a solid high 10/10 if it was fully polished. The game drops to 4 fps when I go into fully detailed regions and that **** is unbearable. This crap deserves minus 2 points. I found switching to low or medium settings fixes the issue temporarily. Please stop releasing unpolished games!!. I don't understand people rating 10 this rushed port. Did they actually play this game on PC? They did no efforts in making the game beautiful visually, one has the impression to play a game from last decade instead. You don't realize you're playing a PC game, but a rushed console port and all environments seem ordinary and lousy. Not only that, but the game is very demanding, having a 2080ti I barely hit 43 fps on 2160p and this is not acceptable. Controls are bad too, making combos a nighmare to be performed during battles and causing deaths after deaths. Overall, there is nothing I liked from it. Forgettable port and full of issues. visally ugly game, empty world, bland sky and water, generic textures. HDR mode is a joke and adds nothing. Controls are 100% for the PS4 version, PC gamers are not considered at all. They didn't care about this port, no effort in working for it. Just like giving PC gamers a PS4 copy of the game with no adjustment. The game feels rough. Legit 10/10 for me, up there with Bloodborne. I tend to agree with negative criticisms on here, but I am having an absolute blast with this game. The last game I had this much fun with was Bloodborne years back. Performance wise, I have a 1070 GTX and my game is on an SSD, I've had no performance issues whatsoever and have kept a consistent 60 FPS graphics on high—looks exceptional to me on my 1440p 144hz monitor. I have an Xbox elite controller and the controls have felt intuitive and fluid, better than 99.9% of games and I am not exaggerating, they nailed it. Games like this are never intended for keyboard controls, and most of the time that is fixed by modders soon after anyways. Look at DS3, terrible keyboard controls until modders fixed it. This isn't something to rate the game a 1 for when they literally designed the game, from top to bottom, with controller players in mind. Gameplay wise, the only thing I'll say is that if you are coming from Dark Souls, as I was, you'll want to learn the game mechanics as the combat has essential features that aren't what you'll be used to. Once you get the hang of it, this game is the same level of difficulty as Dark Souls. Until then, you are going to think the game is difficult and unfair. To be specific, you'll want to figure out burst counters and ki pulsing from the get go, without these down you will die a lot, since the stamina system heavily punishes players who don't ki pulse. Another thing is blocking, it gives 100% damage reduction in this game, unblockable moves will overlay a white or red glow over the enemy to give you ample time to react accordingly. Don't give up on this game until you beat the first few bosses, also, don't be afraid to use everything the game gives to you, guns and bows are something you should be using all the time—the game throws money at you that isn't needed and you can stock up at the blacksmith. This game is awesome!. I found it impossible to play the game with such bad keyboard controls. I hope they will be able to patch it soon because progression in the game is stronly jeopardised by that, some combos can't be performed by no means. Graphics is another very week point, it seems very outdated and uninspired. * This is a phenomenal game. * I've played the PS4 version on a PS4 pro, and the PC version with a 3080 + HDR 144Hz monitor, so though my time might show up as only a few hours here, I am also drawing upon my PS4 experience for this review. * It's a high quality port. * The combat is buttery smooth, the action is fast, fluid and * It has a ton of depth. People who love trying out new builds, new weapon loadouts and even fashion / customization will totally dig it. The character avatar creator is top notch, and all equipment has a transmogrifacation feature so you don't have to choose between gear that looks pretty vs. gear with good stats. * It's got a ton of r","great souls-like with mission type gameplay. boring, corny-looking bosses and weak level design... I just couldn't enjoy it . the gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the actions are fluid, making for an engaging and enjoyable experience."
96.Divinity: Original Sin II,"This game is quite good for the most part. Scratches that D&D style, turn based fantasy combat itch. Great character customization, branching story options allowing you to role-play in different ways, leading to different outcomes depending on your play style. Wife and I each have over 150 hrs in our campaigns, in many cases getting totally different outcomes for the same missions. It was interesting to compare how our games were playing out differently. Graphically, it is very well done, from the intricate armor and weapons, to the environments and characters. Sound is very well done, from the voice acting, sound effects and especially the music. So good I'll occasionally listen to the soundtrack out of game. It's a long game. Wife and I have been playing for about 2 months so we've definitely got our money's worth, and we may even play through a second time. That said, the game does have a few parts that are tedious and aggravating, ""The Deathroom"" for example near the end of the game was one of the stupidest implementations I've seen in any game. A few of the quests can be tedious and unclear. Fortunately the good here vastly outweighs the bad, and it's definitely worth slogging through some of the frustrating parts to enjoy the overall grand adventure the game offers. Definitely worth playing and I'd love to see a third installment.. An amazing game. Baldur's Gate 3's biggest competitor. Game had so many depth. Story was great. Classes were distinct.. I got introduced to Larian Studios through this game and I'm thankful for it. Though the combat style was new for me (coming from skyrim and fallout) the story, writing and voice acting kept me hooked all through out the end. I felt the endings and romances could have been more fleshed out, but it was an overall fun experience.. One of the best RPGs I have ever played. It has a fantastic modding scene also. Multiplayer is fantastic, allows the host to utilize the game while other's are not present, while allowing you to control your allies. The roleplaying possibilities are endless. I have played the game as guts from berserk, wolfric, archaeon, karl franz, thor, warrior priest, templar assassin, and boromir. I've put 1000 hours in across multiple playthroughs, it is very easy to see where Larian got much of their inspiration for BG3 from. Completely recommend!. Certainly, in the top 10 best games I have ever played. From the music to the dialogue, even the graphics, this game oozes charm and immersion. It has quite a steep learning curve, but trust me, it's completely worth it.. I have played several playthroughs on different difficulty levels and also in co-op (500h) I rate the following: Graphic design: 10/10 Story: 9.5/10 Combat: 10/10 Character progression (leveling/items): 10/10 Music: 10/10 Out of all games I played (+50) I think this my new top **** opinion is that this game is close to perfection.. A true masterpiece. I can not think of a single bad thing to say about this game. The game is what you make it with enough secrets to unearth that each play through has something new to offer. Its design choices hindered my enjoyment, demanding constant reloads and external help, which detracted from the role-playing experience.. The game made me feel im on the clouds. The game made me cry end of the game. The game gave me all I wanted. Masterpiece.. Played in co-op with friends and I feel it could be better. Fights were interesting and challenging but dialogs system is just wrong in co-op. Clearly, it was designed for single player and doesn't work well when playing with other people.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. If you are an cRPG fan, it's an obvious choice. But I am not one of those people. At least i weren't, untill i finished Divinity 2. Yeah, the pace is a little off, especially near the end, and it took me like a year to complete. But I did it! I liked the narrative that gets quirky, and often doesn't treat itself too serious, but that also ruined a lot of story moments that developers tried to mark as significant? But I can accept, because some of the funniest, original dialogues I had in video game I had in Divinity 2.. Amazing game. Everything lines up - music, story, battles. Played it in coop with a friend. We had a really good time.. An absolutely amazing game to play. I have never been a fan of turn based rpg's, In fact I even played this game a couple of years ago due to a sale and I didn't give it a chance. After a couple of years of maturing as a gamer I have to say that I have never been happier in being so wrong in my decision to drop the game all those years ago. It has completely changed my opinion on turn based rpgs and has brought back the feeling of adventuring in a amazing fantasy land that I lost so long ago. The soundtrack is the best of its kind, the characters are very well fleshed out with each having their own compelling story, often causing you to get attached to them quickly in the game, the story is great and very enjoyable you will always find yourself getting surprised and wanting to find out more, and the gameplay is strategic and action packed and you will always have to adapt your strategy for every battle. I cant recommend this game enough, it is undoubetedly one of its kind and for any fantasy fans, rpg fans, d&d fans and any gamer I highly recommend you give this a good try and get immersed into its world, soundtrack and characters :) Thank you Larian. Extreme amounts of customization in this game. I strongly recommend if you have 3 other buddies to play with. But if you don't have anyone to play it with, then the game is kinda meh. It's also very grindy and can get a bit repetetive. The story is meh, although the combat system is awesome.. Great game, not quite as good as DoS1 but I'll take it! Larian makes good quality games so keep supporting them if you want more of those.. Featuring a superb narrative and compelling characters, along with intelligent writing and gameplay expertly crafted to perfection!. forever in my heart <3. Outstanding game, played it for hundreds of hours. Larian is just an outstanding developer in general. Loved the lore and setting of the Divinity series. Was a great sequel to DOS 1. Well done.. One of the best rpg games I've played. It had an unforgettable impact on me. It left me satisfied and impressed, both in terms of its underlying deep story and gameplay. Larian does this job.. Outstanding game, I'd give it a 9.5/10 if I could. I played through this game about 9 times, was so much fun, and the characters were all amazing. This is one of the best CRPGs of all time. The lore is very interesting too. This game also served as a stepping stone for possibly the best RPG of all time Bauldr's Gate 3. Larian is amazing.. Normally, I don't watch movies twice because it's boring to see something I've already seen. For similar reasons, I'm reluctant to watch story games twice. However, I've experienced this game's vast amount of content twice. It's definitely a much better game than Baldur's Gate 3. I wish the company had continued this series instead of coming out with a new name. Then everything would be as it should be, but BG3 is a big failure.. If u wanna start playing classic rpg, u could try divinity original sin 2. Personally, I am not a big fan of such games, but even for me this game was interesting when I was playing. 8/10. So many possibilities- even though Baldur's Gate 3 definitely improved on many things it didn't cover all the creativity you could use with all those barrels, acids etc this masterpiece had. Best game of all time. One of the best RPG, I can spend hours in Fort Joy just to lay down the boxes to create an barriers, in order to prepare a tough fight ahead. The game mechanic is awesome with all the environmental affect. The music is top notch, one of the best soundtrack, perfect to use it as background music at work. Thank you Larian.. Perfection, made by truely passionnated and talentend people. Astonishing story and freedom. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 84 IIIIIIIIII====================. This game is insane, if you love a good story, secrets, engaging combat and a lot more, make sure to check it out.. Great game. Good combat system, if a bit slow, and amazing writing. It gets very close to feeling like a great table-top experience.. Awesome series, thank you Larian Studios for this emotion. I buy this game on PC, Nintendo Switch and iPad. I get very good experience. ️. I played this game in one sitting for about 130 hours, this is really an rpg and I haven't played such a game for a long time. bcz I played those crap rpg games from Bethesda...definitely good game and good rpg unlike Bethesda shallow crap. The game did not live up to the hype and noise surrounding it. I felt it lacked atmosphere since the world was war-torn. The creatures did not seem to be in an existential crisis; they were just standing there either crying or doing something random. I felt something was off about it since all living beings exert themselves to the extreme when driven by the will to survive and the will to make and weave their destiny. Another thing I hated was how I went from one island to another. The only island that fully realized what was missing in the others was the first one. The rest lacked the will to survive through actions, attitudes, the complexity of feelings, and the way their lives changed. Yes, it was a prison, but that does not justify the important little details that were missing. I was disappointed in the final island and the final fight, especially as it also felt like something was missing. There was a lack of content, characters, and side stories. Lastly, the whole city atmosphere did not feel fresh, coming from the sea as a group of people who were literally torn apart. Not to mention, it was supposed to be the greatest, the centre of arts, culture, and all that's beautiful in life. I highly suspect that the lack of content was due to greedy ambition to make players buy the next games, such as Baldur's Gate 3. Some certain characters highly hinted at going to another place after the end.. The game is simply one of the best RPG experiences on PC! What I would call, a masterpiece! Pros: + Story and writing are very good! + Music score is amazing! + The world building! + Gameplay is super addicting! + The amount of options on how to play and build your character are off the charts! Cons: - Might be a little bit overwhelming for newcomers for a RPG game like this. I highly recommend to check out some guides!. It's a masterpiece! . Can't wait for Baldur's Gate 3. A true masterclass and the benchmark for any upcoming CRPG. DOS2 is such a unique and creatively designed game. There isn't anything close to it in the market with the exception of Larians current early access project, BG3.. Godly RPG with insane freedom of choices. One of the best games I played in my entire life, ngl. Huge, awesome, engaging cRPG with incredible writing and amazing quest design. I love how this game allows you to approach problems, and how it pits playable characters against each other. Story pacing is pretty wild though, Act 2 is way too large a chunk of the game.. This is a turn based combat co-op story roleplaying game. Combat, magic, thievery, swords, potions and monsters. This game masterfully combines many common aspects of roleplaying games and turns it into the ultimate experience that people ask for, a persistent world you and your friends can destroy, or save. Great for those who love DND!. This is my favorite game of all time. Great story, incredible music, some of the best turn based combat you will ever play. The game that truly revived the CRPG genre.. The best rpg I’ve ever played. So much thanks to production team for creating such a masterpiece. incredibly fun whether you're doing a solo run or playing with friends. Stories engaging and written well enough and the gameplay is ace. Looking forward to BG3.. Probably the best fantasy experience with the most freedom of roleplaying and class/character customization, has the blood of Baldur's Gate with a modern twist and runs pretty well, awesome optimization. It gives the most played with other players and friends, up to 4 players in a very long campaign, which is the climax of coop gaming in my opinion and represents the best coop experience as of now. Turn based combat might turn off players not accustomed to either pen-and-paper D&D or old schools RPG's like Baldur's Gate, but it's actually very intuitive and adds a very enjoyable tactical flavour to the experience. The very icing on the cake are mod support, the complex but creative Game Master Mode (which gives you the tools to create and fire up your very own adventure) and the huge character customization options together with a very flexible class system, giving the game a nearly endless replayability. The only small con is the relatively scarce choice of races (Elf, Human, Dwarf, Lizardmen and their undead counterpart).. Game starts off Amazing but gets tidious after a dozen of hours. The puzzles are meh RPG elements are not forgiving. Combat looks really fluid and is fun. The Physics based combat is amazing. The story is also good with the main chosen ones. the Arx part is really really bad, the game devs said **** you at the end.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This type of gameplay is just atrocious, clicking to move and braindead turn based combat, with a controller its a little more tolerable but you literally dont have commands to do some stuff, the story would have to be the best ever for for me to put up with this kind of bs game in 2023, it isnt even interesting.. Another legendary game after Divinity Original Sin. A lot of improvements upon tactical fights, a lot of new classes and abilities to choose from, more dialogues, more puzzles, great maps, amazing graphics and animations. The story is tailored to your character's background. Impactful decisions, meaningful relationship with your teammates. The soundtrack is great too. There is nothing bad to say about this game.. Only game that i've just started over again after i completed. Story is well-handled, dialogues is not boring it does not feel like a monologue at all, best combat mechs as far as i saw in an isometric rpg. Its just fablous... One of the best games ever! Good: - Everything is fine or better - Great variety of spells and attacks - Lovable characters with elaborate stories - Enormous flexibility - Fantasy at its best - Varied locations with many secrets and useful loot and resources - A few puzzles that deserve the name ""puzzles"" and don't get frustrating. - Great dialogues - Story in general is rather average, which is due to the flexibility **** role-playing game. Bad: -. Best game ive ever played! ️ The story is good. But the best are the battles the many classes and **** the freedom in the dialogues...perfect for ne koop round with friends...I love it!. This is by far the best game I ever played. Everything is great about this game; the graphics, the story, the settings, the gameplay, the sound, etc. If you like turnbased RPG's then you cant go wrong with this game! I really look forward to future games by this studio.. one of the best games to play with friends or family, highly recommend you do not play this alone while it does stand up as an amazing single player RPG it is substantially better with a partner. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best game ever made. It's super cheap at 45€ and you can easily get 100+ hours of playtime. A ton of builds to try, paths to explore and characters to bond with. Sure it's not great for tiktok kids that have a 7 second attention span (still reading this review? ;), but that's more of a positive than a negative. Not only the single player experience is flawless, playing multiplayer with a party is also tons of fun. In it's own chaotic way. On top of everything you can add mods to multiply the potential game time infinite times. I bought this game on sale and felt like I was robbing the devs. Only development studio worth supporting amidst the sea of all the greedy b*******, ty Larian for restoring my faith. God this is overrated. The story is mediocre at best. The characters are fine, not exceptional by CRPG standards. RPG elements are less than usual for CRPG standards. Turn based combat is cool, but is let down by two things: overabundance of environmental effects, and the armor system. The armor system is such a colossal stupidity that I can barely stomach playing this game. The constant looting of everything is tiring. The universe and lore are not nearly as interesting as other CRPGs. Utterly overrated in every way.. 1. Interesting turn-based battles and strategies 2. Vast conversations and various interactions between NPC and players 3. Interesting worldview and story 4. The story of the characters and the inside story of NPCs that change depending on the choice 5. Non-linear system that can go to the end no matter what you do. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. I had some jolly good fun playing this game with my pals. Would recommend if it goes on sale and the battle system is quite enjoyable. There is a lot you can do in this game and anyone can play how they like since it’s a very flexible game.. My first crpg game, in which I spent 160 hours and I don't regret it at all. An exciting plot, quests, teammates, turn-based battles, humor and much that is in this game is done at the highest level =^-^=. At first I thought this game was difficult and annoying, but after mastering the mechanics I really got into it. It has a great storyline as well.. There is nothing about this game that I could say that hasn't already been said. This may be the best CRPG ever made and it may be the best modern RPG in general. This game is a masterpiece. It is so detailed, the story is awesome, the gameplay amazing, the combat endlessly fun and strategic. I just can't express how perfect this game is. Oh and it is HARD and I love it. If you like RPGs you HAVE to play this game.. I doubted this game because of the graphics, my God how wrong I was. Get this game!. Recommended 124.7 hrs at review time Tactician Mode Gameplay 8/10 Music and sound 9/10 Screenplay 9/10 Technical 7/10. I mean its just kind of boring. This is not how you do turn based combat. Every turn should feel like your making some important decision and you have to strategise whether to heal or reload or run away. It just feels like real time combat but instead they decided to make it turn-based add to that you have so many characters you have to tell what to do it just gets tedious. Fallout 1 and 2 or HOMM or MTG is how turn-based games are supposed to work. Or Warhammer. This is just tedious and feels like a waste of your time.. An exciting journey! After 100 hours spent with the game over the course of 7 months, I am sad that this is over as I was sad when I finished The witcher 3. This game oozes passion from witty writing to mechanics. It was my first CRPG so I can't compare it to the old school stuff, but I don't have to, this is an amazing piece on its own. Gameplay was amazing and there were so many things to do and discover Graphics were good I really enjoyed the writing The sound and music were good, nothing really special On the technical side, even though I had the required specs, the game was running awful at times, but other than that I only had a one-time random crash Larian Studios, hats off!. The game is somehow fun played with friends, me and the homies spent a lot of time playing together. The only problem I have is how slow it is sometime, like I could go smoke a cigarette and after I came back 10 minutes later my friends were still playing and my turn didn't come up yet.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 6.. This is one of the greatest games I ever played. The story is good an the combat is outstanding.. one of the best games I've played in my life. the music of the game is excellent. the atmosphere, world, combats of the game are perfecttttt. It feels great to be tactical in the combat of the game. a masterpiece.. This is a great game. The basic story plot is in a straight line, but by providing various options in the game, it encourages users to naturally enjoy multiple plays.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Decent rpg compared to masterpieces like baldur's gate or PST Why such low rating? Here's an example: You arrive at second island (LVL 8-11) and at the start you get quest from chickens when you go to complete it five lvl 15 monsters appear out of nowhere and destroy your characters in one turn no matter how good you are at the game Here's another example: You decided to go right from where you arrived and you get killed by lvl 14 monsters again Here's another example: You enter sewers and there are death fog monsters (AOE instakill on death) so if you don't have ranged characters that can kill them from far or skeleton characters(immune to instakill aoe effect) you die 1/3 of game battles is you getting ambushed and enemies throwing aoe skills in your stacked in place party The game is designed around making you save scum and cheese The lore and story are very weak aswell. It's one of the best RPG:s ever made. The narrator, world, graphics, story, music, combat and setting all ties together to a great adventure. There is not much more to say, I think you should experience it for yourself. There are some negative aspects as well of course (depending on who you ask). For me those were: The later act being worse than the first parts of the game, a few annoying puzzles, the combat sometimes being overwhelming with conditions. But in the grand scheme of things there is not much to complain about. I loved this game and it's one of my favorite games of all time. Great successor to Divinity Original Sin which was also a great game! I should also add the Soundtrack is great. It's unique in style, while still fitting. One of my favorite RPG-soundtracks in a long time. I would prefer you didn't get combat-music tho. Combat music always annoyed me. + The combat Story Characters Setting Aesthetics Character creation Music Difficulty Graphics Choices matter Humor - Annoying puzzles Conditions overwhelming sometimes One later act not as fun A bit linear. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!! Graphics: 10/10 Gamplay: 10/10 Audio: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Good price compare to playtime and experience. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. A truly masterfully crafted RPG. Probably the most impressive aspect is the incredible world design, very expansive and detailed at the same time. Combat is fun as hell while remaining a challenge (at least sometimes), and above all is extremely varied, depending both on the circumstances (environment and enemies) and character builds, which means that it doesn't get tedious or repetitive even after more than 150 hours. The dialogues and narration are once again flawless, with writing and voice acting (at least in english) that are a real pleasure to listen to. The story is maybe the weakest point, which is not to say it's anywhere near bad - it's just not as emotionally engaging (at least for me personally) as some other games, such as The Witcher 3. One major pain in the ass was the inability to select and move several items in the inventory at once, which meant I spent more time shuffling about in the inventory in this game that the entire playtime in some not-too-short games... But overall, technical issues were very scarce for a game of this scope, and (apart from the inventory) did not distract me from the awesomeness of the world and the gameplay. Thoroughly recommended :). broooo what is larian doing, they are creating and selling drugs. Once you get in the world of divinity you cant go back, thats for sure.. A game of great variety and depth, that allows you to venture together with your friends. One of the best RPGs of the generation, that has already become classics and will remain one for years to come.. RPG games have always been my favorite. However, I have never played turn-based RPG. I decided to give Divinity 2 a try in view of several positive reviews. Simply one of the best games I've ever played in my life. Interesting story, wonderful immersion, battle system with multiple possibilities and with various RPG elements: character upgrade through combat skills, civilian, feats, etc! A tip for beginners: the first few hours in the game seemed very difficult, but with time everything will make sense and will get easier. It's worth insisting! There are several YouTube videos with Quest Walkthroughs! Highly recommended!. From a great story to a difficult fight, from a beautifully created world to an excellent multiplayer, Divinity: Original Sin II is a unique game offering an unforgettable experience. Despite some mistakes, another RPG giant was born. Masterpiece, one of the best recent RPGs out their if not the best, just wow.. A really solid gaming experience, though the plot becomes much weaker in the last act, and some tactic battles turned to be very tiresome (the oil swamp, I'm looking at you). With a wonderfully engaging story, intricately designed class mechanics, and an incredible art style, Divinity Original Sin II is an opus of an RPG. The world is well designed and incredibly in-depth, which constantly hooked me in as a player. Even on my replays, I found new opportunities and ways to interact with the world. The combat is incredible, with some of the best designed abilities I have ever seen in a game. The magnitude of possibilities in regards to building your character's ""class"" is endless. You can always find new ways to play through the combat of the game, in using new skills or combinations of the different skills. An incredibly enticing game, few RPG's can touch the scale of Divinity II.. Best rpg of modern day gaming no contest. The depth is absolutely insane. The combat is an unmatched strategy extravaganza.. This is an incredibly solid isometric RPG. I'm not usually one for turn-based video games, but the combat system is really solid when you have an optimized party and can effectively take advantage of enemy weaknesses. It can be challenging as well, forcing you to strategize your movements and balance out the skills of your party. The story is pretty good too, if a little cliche in part. However the world created by Larian makes up with unique settings and characters, especially the default player characters. This is a finely tuned RPG that is worth the time sink.. It is just okay, nothing more. but is has a Coop mode, thats nice. On a Sale its worth it.. Good game. LOTS of content and very consistent. One of if not the best RPG for me personally. 20hrs in and im feel like just starting the game. Characters are written with great care.. If you want to know the definition of a masterpiece you should try this one. I wasn't into this genre until I played this game. As a non-English speaker understanding conversation can be quite cumbersome though.. DOS2 is a very overrated game. it's not a bad game, but could have been much better if the DEVS would have taken a little more time on it. Here is my Good and Bad points for the game... ----- THE GOOD Multiple Endings Great Character Creation/Customization ----- THE BAD No Day/Night Cycle No Weather Effects Many Bugs/Glitches Insanely Long Battles Lag Even On Top-End Systems No Actual Class System ----- That's about it. Everyone has his/her own opinion, and I have given mine. DOS2 is just not up to par with your classic RPG. Many elements are missing, such as the day/night cycle and weather effects. In closing, I give DOS2 a 5 for effort, but that's it. If you want some ""true"" classic RPGS, skip this and grab the best RPGS ever made... BG2, PS:T and NWN. Cheerio.. As a backer of this game, it truly warms my heart to see so many people giving this game a 10/10. As a veteran who played the first game thoroughly, I started this off in Tactician Mode and suffered immensely for my hubris, but with patience and determination, I made it to the end and even developed a few unique tricks of my own to overcome the very hard gameplay, especially at the start. I loved The Red Prince, he is an arrogant s-e-x maniac who wants to be at war with the world and bring back dragons. Sadha, the Red Princess is so hot, she gives me beastiality! My custom undead lizard character also fell in love with the tortured, twisted, psycho chick Sebille. I must have necrophilia and exophilia as well! Sick! I also love how my pet died in a fierce battle from enemy AoE attacks, but his spirit still follows me around like the true loyal friend he is. Only a masterpiece work of art can think of something like this. The story is really dark! All of the Gods are manipulative and evil! The major factions are all evil and by the end, even my character turned evil! By the end of the game, I was betraying everyone left and right! A game that brings out our most hidden and sickest desires, with this much lizard and undead erotica, deserves a 11/10! Send the devs your love with a purchase even during a Steam or GOG sale. You won't regret it!. Boring monotenous trash. Fun for a few hours then becomes a slow redious grind. That fact this game has high scores either means theirs alot of people that quit early or have no lives and meatloaf for brains. Watching paint dry is more stimulating than this "" game"". This game starts out fun, but quickly turns into a game where every combat encounter feels like an ambush. You walk into a room and 6 enemies spawn out of no where. It also feels like your playing with a cheating DM. I gave up when during a fight a warrior who should know no spells used a teleport spell and 1 shot my mage. I talk to a lady, she summons 10 minions from no where and they jump my party. Walk into a room the enemies jump you. You don't even have time you place your party, so that leads to the enemy hitting you with aoe attacks while you're still clumped up while they are always spaced out and in proper position. The boss is not hard, the hard part is the 5 archers hiding behind the boss.. Pros: -Good graphics -Nice musics. -Good detailed modeling. -Most dialogues are fun. -Good voice acting. Cons: -Story ongoing is really slow and boring. -Even a small battle taking too much time. -Some characters are boring. -When a companion dies, he/she never comes back without resurrection scrolls. So you have to use mod but that will disable achievements. -Menu UI isn't obvious, hard to find quests.. Well, what is there to say? It's one of the best RPG:s of all time. That's simply a fact and i've been playing them since my childhood 25 years ago. + * The story is amazing and immersive * The chracters and their individual stories are great * Lots of secret things to discover * Combat is extremely fun but also extremely hard (to me) at times, which is fun to me because it makes it much more rewarding when you succeed, like a good old RPG. * The music is unique and topnotch. The composer has his own style entirely, doesn't remind me of anything but still the music is very fitting always. * You can have many different combat-builds which opens up a lot of freedom, however I prefer a class system myself. * The game is huge. It just continues and continues. * The Graphics and enviromental/character design is awsome * Voiceacting is amazing * Satisfying ending * Few bugs * Great choices that matter * Humor - *Annoying puzzles sometimes that add nothing to the gameplay except for annoyance. Some might probably like them, I was not one of them. * One ""act"" is a lot worse than the others. * Area over effec","great character customization, branching story options . graphics are very well done, from the intricate armor and weapons . sound is well done, from the voice acting, sound effects and especially the soundtrack ."
960.Professor Layton and the Unwound Future,"One of my favourite feautres of the Professor Layton series is how well it pulls off its plot twists, and indeed they are masterful. Recommended.. Unwounded Future may not be my favorite Layton game, but I think I’ll remember it the most. The characters are just far more endearing this time around and somehow I care about them so much more. Puzzles can still be hit and miss, but the pacing is far better this time around, and overall the ending really just makes this game so special. Another point and click puzzler from the cartoon sleuth. Different story, exactly the same game.. One of the greatest games I have ever played. I played the original games 1 and 2 years ago as child and loved them. For my 19th birthday my brother gave me lost future and I had no idea how amazing it was going to be. The story in this game is near perfect with a perfect cast of characters, with some emotional moments. The music I have saved on everything I own, Tomohito Nishiura is brilliant. Of course they made all puzzles interesting and tied the puzzels perfectly into gameplay. I can not talk more love for this game, if you have a ds or a phone download this game as soon as you can, also check the first two games in the series.. 53/100 The Unwound Future takes the series' old cast of endearing but flat characters and gives them more nuanced, well-rounded personalities, also thanks to a captivating story that explores their past and relationships, intrisically tied with the detective narrative. The story doesn't take itself seriously enough to make the stakes feel real at times, but remains compelling thanks to a rich setting and an exciting investigation that introduces new and old characters in the narrative in an organic way. The writing gradually builds towards the reveal of its driving mysteries with clear, subtly placed clues and an excellent foreshadowing, making them, as outlandish as they are, deeply satisfying. All of this is greatly elevated by the series' memorable, distinctly orchestral soundtrack and its unique, lively soft art style. As usual, the story doesn't leave much if any agency to the player to lead the investigation, but the puzzle collection is the most entertaining and diversified in the entire series so far, with a nigh-perfect balance of highly stimulating and charmingly illustrated deductive, observational and logic challenges, almost entirely deprived of the more monotonous mathematical types. That being said puzzles are slightly but noticeably easier than the previous installments, making for a somewhat less compelling gameplay. The minigames are also at their strongest, with the Parrot and Toy Car minigames offering widely different but equally entertaining planning challenges that are simple but require precise, mindful strategy. The Illustrated Book is a lot less profound and a little too easy, but charming.. I knew where the story was going, yet I still cried a ton. Amazing game with a wonderful story and the puzzles were fun too.. This was peak Professor Layton. I can recommend this game to literally anyone who doesn't mind a lot of dialogue. The characters are REALLY good though, so this is more than just a bland visual novel. Features like moving around, inspecting all areas with your stylus and puzzles make this a very immersive experience.. veru good puzzles, suspensful story and an ending that i never expected. Loved these games as a kid and still love them to this day. Professor layton is really a one of a kind game that will never be made again, will definitely be remembered in the future. Underrate franchise, great gameplay and and ending that can make cry anyone. One of the best games ever made. Simply a masterpiece. Everything is well done and you can see the developers put so much care into this gem. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece. From the puzzles, to the gameplay, to the story,,,, well, the story... Let's just say that I've yet to meet someone who didn't cry at the end. The cutscenes have the ability to just destroy you emotionally. The music is beautifully well-written and incredibly catchy. The puzzles are perfect. The characters are beautifully well-written. There's so many good things about this game, I-. I never knew that a game that a game that is is essentially just puzzles wrapped in a pretty package could have such a compelling story.. If there was a possibility to give this game 1000/10 I would have done this. This is a masterpiece. I am dead serious. I was crying my eyes out in the end. The best storyline in the series no doubt. the puzzles are all fun and all. I can not say they can be special in any Professor Layton game, so do not expect anything new. However, If you want to see the best story in the series, the story that will tear your heart apart and make you cry like a teenage girl after a break up then go and check this game out.. This was the first game in which i cried. The ending is heartbreaking and makes it worth beating all the puzzles throughout the game jsut for it. The story is a 10, like really, easily the game with best story released on the DS. And the characters, oh the characters. The development of Layton takes the character to a whole new level, i cared about every single one of them. The animated sections are also pretty cool. But of all of the good stuff the game has, the one things that outstand the most is the second half. Like really, the real story starts there, the second half is just perfect. And then it is the end. Everything, every single **** thing you did up till the end is for the purpose of the last fight and the ending, that heartbreaking ending that anyone that has played this game will surely remember for the rest of his life. This game is just too good, it is the best DS game by far, and a total and an unquestionable masterpiece.. Simply the best Professor Layton game so far...i really enjoyed other Layton games,but i must say this has something more:soundtrack(""time travel"" is one of my favourite music piece),characters,and the ending.Really,i won't spoil it,because i think this is a game everybody needs to play,but the **** is very special,i would say unique... Audio and the Video are really good,and the puzzles are very well realized. Unfortunately,the difficulty for each puzzle is often under or ****'ll probably find a puzzle that isn't worth much,but is very difficult and vice versa... Overall,a great game and,i think,a masterpiece all collectors should have! I bought this game as a present for my sister:she loved it and she finished it in 3 days!!!. This game isn't a game but an experience. The story fits perfectly, the puzzles are sometimes very difficult, the art is beautiful on the DS. This experience is great and if you haven't play this but you own a DS/DSi/3DS, go out and buy it. You won't regret it.. Play If: You enjoyed previous Professor Layton games. If you were the kind of kid who insisted on grabbing a puzzle book for a long car ride. Don't Play If: You are the kind of person who gets easily frustrated with puzzles and quickly jump online to find the answer. Or, have an issue with unbelievable and problematic stories.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hands down my favourite title in the entire Professor Layton series. The quality of the music and the visuals are slightly improved compared to the preceding two games, and the puzzles as usual manage to achieve the perfect balance between challenging and mind-boggling. This game sees with it the improvement of the invaluable Memo function, now with the ability to change ink colour. Also, the Super-Hint Coin makes its debut, meaning it's less likely you'll be needing to side-glance the walkthrough after all... What sets this game apart from the pack for me, however, is its story. It was so compelling I couldn't put my DS down. The Professor's other outings have had fantastic story lines, but the Unwound Future's personal twist on Layton's part was very touching, and the ending? Heartbreaking. Also, the vengeful villain is very enjoyable - even old rivals have to lend a hand! So, after all my gushing, why a 9? Well, one thing that is a continual let down within the first few games of the Layton series is the voice acting. Layton and Luke are always consistent, it's just the ensemble of characters who join them that always really let the games down. It's a real shame, I wasn't really impressed with a Layton game's voice acting until Miracle Mask, which perhaps sacrificed its story-line in the process... If you've never played this game but have played other Layton games, then you're really missing out - a fantastic puzzle game with a lovely story!. In my opinion this game is perfect, which is something I would never normally say. The story in this game is the best aspect as it will keep you wrapped up in the magic of it right up until the amazingly crafted ending which will make you cry. Despite some people complaining that the game is too easy, the puzzles hit the right balance of being welcoming to new players at the beginning and challenging to veterans of the series at the end. Yes the graphics aren't amazing but that isn't something I am willing to mark this game down on due to the limitations of the ds. There is something about this game that makes it so much fun to play again and again as I must have completed the game 6 or 7 times since I got it when it was first released. This is truly my favourite game of all time and is the only game I would ever call perfect which is a huge award to give as I own well over 100 games across multiple platforms. I would recommend this game to anyone who owns a ds or a 3ds as it is by far the best in the series. Go out and buy it now.. the best layton game to date. the storyline has tons of shocking twists, great villains that you will both hate and feel sorry for, and some of the most emotional moments in video game history. great puzzles, excellently animated cutscenes, a well done orchestral score, unwound future is another great layton game.. Sorry to say, but I just didn't feel this as much as I felt the others in the series. The location got pretty old quick, puzzles could be guess and checked which is exactly what you don't want to happen. The story was also pretty farfetched. Now I know, all of the stories are farfetched, but this one was so out of it. I could count several plot holes that arose from the last few twists, and this seriously ruined the experience that Layton is known for. I will give credit, however, for that emotional ending, and for some puzzles that did keep me engaged. It was just the weakest of the series, that's all, and that's still saying a lot, since this entire series is fantastic. Disappointing, on a medium scale.. I have played all of the Layton games available in the US. I enjoy the presentation of the games, presenting a story Puzzles and wonderful creative writing. Unwound future has the most puzzles, and can overwhelm you with them at times, but the ending is the best in the series, especially if you have played the other games and enjoyed them. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, as this game presents many of them with alot of variety. My favourite in the Layton series so far, and a relief after the disappointing Diabolical Box. The puzzles are of course good, as is the game design and visual style (as we've come to expect), but what makes this my favourite is the story. It may require a huge suspension of disbelief compared to the first game, but the ending is so striking and emotional. It more than makes up for minor story flaws.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this has got to be my single favorite DS game ever, the story line is amazing, the puzzles are great, i can not think of one negative about this game, i would highly recommend it to others. Most of the 5 points I've awarded this title are for the story, which is lovely, as in previous Layton games. Unfortunately the gameplay lets it down - many of the puzzles are rehashes of those from the previous games, and some really clutch at straws - some really convoluted questions and solutions. The graphics have improved from the previous title, and there are a lot more animated sections that add exposition to the tale. Layton himself shows a different side throughout the story, fleshing out the character beyond his desperate need to be a gentleman. Side missions this time around include the completion of 3 sticker books, where you need to place the correct stickers on the correct pages to tell the story; a radio controlled car game where you have a limited number of direction-changing arrows to guide the car to the end; and a parrot delivery game in which you draw perches to guide you parrot to it's goal. You get to name the parrot when you meet him - the potential for hilarity is great ;) These side missions add a lot of time and value to the game, and provide some of the most difficult puzzles on the cart. Fans of the series will surely enjoy this, but the challenge is slight compared to the previous two titles.. I have all three Layton games and this one is my favourite. The story is brilliantly told, you feel like you're solving a mystery, the cutscenes are as brilliant as ever, the characters are great and the game rewards you brilliantly as you solve puzzles and brain teasers which suprisingly, are really fun. Why a 9? Well, the problems the past two have have not been fixed. You still have to go through a million menus and searching around for hint coins with dialogue boxes popping up everywhere is really frustrating. Also, the game is set in Great Britain, but this game feels... French. Other than that, listen to my advice. If you want a puzzle game with an intriguing storyline, this won't let you down.. If you've liked the previous two Professor Layton games, then this one will not disappoint. Another large collection of different types of puzzles set to another mysterious story line. Although I found the main story a bit weaker then the previous two games, it's still wonderful and makes up for it by giving a heartfelt look into our protagonist's past. Add in the great music and animations, this is another fantastic puzzle story game for the DS.. The first couple of Layton game somehow managed to pass me by but having played this non stop for the past week i can see why they've become so popular. This is incredibly polished with graphics, cut scenes and music among the best on the DS. Although the story didn't really grip me this is all about the puzzles and boy does it excel! Full of imagination, the puzzles vary from the logical, visual and mathematical. The harder puzzles will give most people a challenge yet the handy hints system makes this a game that should appeal to all ages and intellect. Layton is THE perfect game to unwind after a long days work. If you have even the slightest interest in puzzles then you will love this game, simple as that!. Yet another enjoyable, puzzle-filled Layton adventure which only suffers from a bit too wild and massive story, and the fact that the series is becoming a little too familiar and predictable for its own good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have played all 3 Professor Layton games so far and this is by far my favorite. The formula is almost exactly the same as before (but that's not a bad thing) and the art is as good as ever. The cut scenes are clear, crisp and quite entertaining but the main point of this game is its puzzles. The puzzles are ingenious, clever and surprisingly fresh, some require hard thinking, some are visual puzzles and there are those which utterly bamboozle you until you realise the answer has been under your nose the whole time. these puzzles truly make the game great, but what makes it brilliant is the story. It is far more character based this time round and gives a brilliant insight into the characters - Luke, Layton and Flora - and really shows who they really are. It shows the player the emotions of the characters for really the first time, and we get to see Layton with his hat off for the first time!! This game is well worthy of a ten and I believe the Professor Layton is one of the best series of all time and this is a brilliant way to cap off the first trilogy.. Definitely the strongest of the three Layton games released in the US so far, Unwound Future successfully blends casual puzzle solving along with a compelling storyline. The formula hasn't changed an awful lot since the first title, though many subtle improvements to game mechanics and general presentation have been made. Cut scenes and audio files are clearer than ever, with added improvements to the second titles 'memo' function (such as the ability to change ink colour) being of great aid during those more trickier of brain teasers. The pace of the game may be a little too slow for some, though it's not difficult to become captivated by Layton's gorgeous looking surroundings and intrigued by some of the more perplexing mysteries that pop up during the final half of the adventure. Voice acting, be it fitting, can seem incredibly cheesy and at some points fails to aid the experience as it irritates more than captivates. Hint Coins have almost tripled in numbers since the first title, with the new optional 'Super Hint' function allowing far more users to solve even the most complicated of math puzzles without feeling like you've cheated. If you enjoyed the first two Layton outings- I cannot recommended this third game enough, as it's certainly the best of the three. Puzzles remain fun and do not detract from the experience as much as they did with Curious Village, with most being optional if players wish to favour the narrative and push on with it instead.",if you have a ds or a phone download this game as soon as you can . the story doesn't take itself seriously enough to make the stakes feel real . the puzzle collection is the most entertaining and diversified in the entire series so far .
961.Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines,"A major improvement over the first game in almost every way, although in my opinion the grapple feels much less like a core part of the gameplay and more tacked on as if it was a grappling hook mechanic in any game, which is disappointing. The tweaks made in this game make it feel less “Grapple Dog” to me in a way that made me want to go back and play the original at some points. Admittedly this may just be a byproduct of playing the first game too much though. GD2 is more so defined by player movement and powerups, whereas GD1 focused more on stage gimmicks and hazards. I think my heart still leans towards the first game, but I cannot deny that this is a nearly perfect sequel.. Before it released I was somewhat worried that the addition of shooting could have been unnecessary tweaking to what to me felt like an already perfectly crafted grappling mechanic but what it did is divide the game into two similar but brilliantly unique ways of exploring Joseph Gribbin's fun and fluid level designs. And as lighthearted and silly as Pablo's little world is the story offers a surprisingly tense take on the ""multiverse"" concept that doesn't feel played out or derivative of something else. Amazing game and a legit GOTY contender imo.","a major improvement over the first game in almost every way . the grapple feels much less like a core part of the gameplay . the story offers a surprisingly tense take on the ""multiverse"" concept ."
962.Star Ocean: The Second Story R,"the game is gorgeous and a hell of a lot of fun to play. the story was decent but the game has a very addicting quality to it. Big time difficulty spike at the end but other than that well worth a play. First thing, the chill's this game gave me from the very beginning is what i wasn't expecting. I loved to play this when i was young and enjoy this now that i'm old. I surely was not ready for such warmth in my heart, they didnt go overboard with this one and i really like the voice acting and the visuals. I'm ready to explore the game through and out yet again, i can't wait! <3. I actually haven't played it. I just came to check out the scores and accidentally clicked to give it a score. There doesn't seem to be option to delete my score.. This was an absolutely beautiful remake to put it bluntly. As a first timer to Star Ocean games I was completely engrossed by this game. I really love old school JRPGs and this game really just hits all the spots I love about them. Combat is cool and flashy without being too overly complex, characters are amazing, private actions is basically like a dating sim and it's unapologetically really good. What I like about private actions is that the ""dating sim"" aspect isn't solely for the main character, you can get your other party members affection up and have them date at the end too, which I think is a good choice. The visuals here are totally stunning, I love how they remade the background designs to look more 3D compared to the pixel characters, it really oddly fits and looks like a good contrast. The game has crazy replay value because you get different endings and scenes depending on who you play as the main character and learn new things, not to mention there's 99 endings in this game. There's so much to explore and experience in this game and Star Ocean second story constantly **** you in to keep playing.. An exceptionally high quality game. Even as someone who played the most critically acclaimed releases on PC in 2023, I would consider this one of the top 3 game of the year. It stands on its owm merits regardless of whether you have played the original, and even if you aren't a big fan of JRPGs this may be worth checking out.. This is how you do a remake, the modern additions alongside the classic elements that made the original so great as a jrpg. The game offers a fun combat system, options for recruiting characters (some of whom are specific choices based on whether you play as Claude or Rena) and a variety of job roles that let you create items and buff your party with benefits. The kind of remake that rekindles the love for franchises without taking away what made them classics in the first place.. Fantastic remake , great graphic style. Full of early jpg nostalgia for those of us that were there early. Strongly recommend for any Jrpg fan.. This is what I call a great remaster/remake, I never thought seeing 2d sprite characters in a gorgeous 3d environment would be so breathtaking! I mean even the soundtrack is epic here and the combat is fun!!! Give me more please.. Graphics are stunning. OST is first class but why make an action game with the battle format of a turn based RPG? Just ruined it and made it stop start. It should have been done like Ys Origin, or SAO Hollow Realisation, where you scoot from enemy to enemy. Not animations in and out. It's not as bad as Ni No Kuni but it's bad enough to slow the pace a lot. The dialogue felt repetitive too. Just been playing Nayuta and when something is being repeated, it says ""they brought ........character **** to date on the events that had taken place"". No need to repeat the same dialogue like SO2 does. If repeated dialogue doesn't bother you and you don't mind the action being pointlessly stop start, then fire away. For me it just felt awfully dated, including the battle mechanics. It felt poor in comparison to the games I mentioned earlier and one of those is getting on for 20 years old. OST is extremely important for me in games and I usually over look the game's flaws if the OST is this good and here there is even the gorgeous graphics in its favour too but it's not enough to make up for the boring gameplay. As I have no interest in carrying on, it's a very low score from me, very glad I demo'd it. It's just too dated. I'm from the NES era too, so I grew up on things that are well and truly dated now but I didn't play the original, so for SO 2S R to feel this old and clunky, then God knows how bad the original was. It is quite simply very poor by today's standards. Shame the game doesn't match the AV.. Jrpg at its finest, no cringy depressed winy 14 yo mc, no QTE boss battles. Just a amazing adventure with tons of characters with endings based on choice. And sidequests that add to the story instead of bunch of fetchquest to pad the game... The game is very incredible, but technically it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of visuals, the game is excellent, but the characters are the same as the classic Playstation 1 version and there is a little strangeness in this case, but the game is excellent but the original version of the game remains the best in my humble opinion. Furthermore, the A.I., which is the artificial intelligence of the characters, was harmed, the Playstation 1 and PSP versions are better, oddly enough and I think it could change that and then be able to launch an expansion or a correction with an update to update correct because you can change the difficulty level whenever you want, very easy and you can retry, when I will try again, try the game again at the end of the game. And there is no more difficulty level, nothing has been added, there are no new enemies, there are no new scenarios, there are no new characters, everything is the same, the entire game is the same as it was before, they haven't added anything and that leaves a lot to be desired. The original really remains the best, that's my humble opinion. Congratulations to Tri-ace, who is the original developer of the game, because creating a game from scratch is one thing and taking an already made game with character history and everything and just updating it to the current graphics, so to speak, is very easy! The game is very good but technically it has a lot to be desired, they turned an incredible and great game into a small or tiny game.. Great game it does take a little bit of getting use to with the 2d pixel characters and the really detailed 3d scenery but once your eyes adjust this is a truly fantastic game. Best Star Ocean game I ever played.. A remake of a classic that capturs the nostalgia for those who already experienced it and feel the sense of what really is Star Ocean for the new comer.. Great remake, new ost, nice gameplay and virtual, original tricks still works! Xenogears next!!!!!!. 55 hours in and avid player of the original ps1 game and I must say, amazing remake/remaster! Everything is improved with many qol features like a private action indicator so you don't miss out on those time-sensitive events and so so much more. Star Ocean The Second Story R redefines how a remaster should be handled for me and the only complaint that I have is that sprites weren't touched up at all which can often lead in discrepancies with the portraits and general art of the characters.. Lovingly crafted beautiful 2.5D visuals with a good story. Where this game truly shines is in the systems in place in the game. You can write books, compose music, craft, compound, pickpocket, fish, do alchemy, smithing, and sculpting among others. There is soo much to do and all of it is fun to do . This remake stays faithful to one the best games made in the golden era of jrpgs, Square Enix have something special on their hands with this one.. I played the original gem over 20 years ago and I would have been happy with a straight PS1 to PS5 port. The remake however is better than I could have ever imagined, it could very well be the greatest remake to a game ever done. Quality of life updates such as fast travel aside, a lot of care has gone into polishing an already great game. The original looking back felt a little lonely on the world map at times whereas now with your party running with you it truly feels like a bigger journey than ever. The uses of flavour text on the world map and menu are a wonderful touch. It really is lightning in a bottle. I thought this game would never come and it did not disappoint.. The music and visuals are simply stunning; Gemdrops took Team Asano's HD 2D style and honed it to perfection. A JRPG reminiscent of old classic games from the golden age. There is a lot about this game that I like, I give it a strong 8, very close to a 9. recommended if you like JRPG's. Better than the original and an absolute masterpiece! Story - 10/10 Music - 10/10 Gameplay - 10/10 Characters 10/10. Bloated, cramped and overloaded. It will be suitable for those who appreciate the sandbox component with the ability to create music, writing, and derive their own chemical/physical laws instead of actually, you know, saving the world, but that’s all - absolutely not what I play jRPG for. The amount of saves scumming the game encourages somehow surpasses even the third Baldurs Gate.. I played the original PS1 instalment Of Star Ocean Second Story. It was game very dear to me with fond memories of playing none stop one weekend with a friend. Forgot the name of the item but I was able to craft an item that gave a free lvl. I maxed out my character this way and upon fighting the final boss I was to weak to beat it At Max lvl and had to start a new. The remake is incredibly fun and I love the combination of the graphics. Fighting Is very fluid and who knew 2.5 bit character's could be so expressive. The games a refreshing take on old school RPGs, believe me you're missing out if you skip this one over! This game has the two things so many are missing these days, Quality and a complete game.. It's a perfect game. For those who like JRPG, this game is like a comprehensive gift set.. A reminder of age past when rpgs had levels of depth that modern games just don’t. An absolute pleasure to play.. This. This is how a remake of a 2D classic should be handled. This is the blueprint. OG soundtrack>Arranged tho.. Didn't have a chance to play the original but I love this game so much.. This is honestly one of the best remakes I have ever seen. Not only is it faithful to the original, it literally elevates the game to another universe. So many awesome quality of life improvements, GORGEOUS visuals and sound, and just all around love and care. I can't stop playing it! They literally created an entire new game. Even if this wasn't a remake of a classic it would be a top tier game. Well done!. The game takes you back to the times of the classic PlayStation, giving a touch of elegance with its improved graphics and leaving the characters pixelated.. Great game. Greetings from Poland ;). One of my top 10 games ever just got better. I feel this is a low-key respectful remake that PS1 games deserve after the terrible avalanche of HD makeovers that so many devs made with their properties. Small improvements that make the game more modern, keeping the nostalgia intact. Wish they would do something similar for Xenogears and Breath of Fire.. So much nostalgia and so many quality of life features…. I LOVE THIS game… Still can’t believe how good it is. Please, if you’re interested in JRPGs, try the demo atleast! This game is as good as it can get! Awesome story, gameplay and characters! Totally recommend it!",the game is gorgeous and a hell of a lot of fun to play . the story was decent but the game has a very addicting quality to it . big time difficulty spike at the end but otherwise well worth a play .
963.We Love Katamari,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game with a unique art style and gameplay. The game is literally one of the best sequels of all time.. This game took what made the first game great, and turned it up to 11. Everything is bigger and better than ever before! If you only play one Katamari game in your lifetime, make it this one!. A sequel to the original and bonkers Katamari Damacy (that never received a PAL release) We Love Katamari represented Europe’s first opportunity to meet the King of the Cosmos. This time around said King has destroyed/lost most of the planets in the galaxy having had a little too much to drink. In order to replace them he charges his little prince to collect objects from Earth and fire them into space. That’s were the player comes in. Within each of the games levels you start with a sticky ball (of varying sizes) that will collect anything you roll it over. The more objects collected the bigger the ball gets which in turn allows you to roll over and collect ever larger items. There is a great variety from level to level, some see you gathering objects from around a bedroom whilst another ends in the hoovering up of entire continents. In order to keep players on their toes extra challenges such as time limits or instructions to collect particular items are introduced as the game progresses but these are rarely that difficult to meet. If you managed to play the first title in the series this We Love Katamari may seem a little familiar, for anyone else however it provides one of the most unique video game experiences in the last decade.. I'm giving it a 9 because I think the controls in the katamari games are awkward. But it's still a great game!! Is there anything more fun then rolling up the sun with a huge sticky ball?!",we love katamari represents Europe’s first opportunity to meet the King of the Cosmos . within each of the games levels you start with a sticky ball that will collect anything you roll it over . the more objects collected the bigger the ball gets which in turn allows you to collect ever larger items .
964.HROT,"Really fun boomer shooter, with varied environments, enemies and weapons. The color palette does get stale after a while though.. Hrot is absolutely oozing with eerie atmosphere and somber liminality. Combine that with the tight gameplay of a modern ""quake era"" FPS, and you are left with a remarkably unique shooter that simply must be experienced by fans of the genre!. Inspired heavily by Chasm: The Rift, and throw in some You Are Empty with it. Then you pretty much have HROT. A fantastic retro shooter that delivers on all it promised to set out to do, and a commendable effort for a one-man team.. Fun gameplay, beautifully depressing locations, unique enemies. This game turned out to be awesome even though it's pretty short and gets repetitive after a while. And my first playthrough was on lowest difficulty as this isn't exactly an easy game. Anyway, I can recommend this to anybody who loves fast action and retro graphics.","""hrot"" is absolutely oozing with eerie atmosphere and somber liminality . it's a fantastic retro shooter that delivers on all it promised to do . it's pretty short and gets repetitive after a while though ."
966.Dance Central 2,"I don't think it can beat just dance but i guess it's ok for people who wanna dance but hate ubisoft. Dance Central is my very favourite dancing kinect game i have ever seen in my life. Its more advanced than Just Dance and still awesome. One bad thing that the GUI gave me eyestrains. :(. Its amazing. Good songs and they even have workout type things on it. Its fun and if you like to just dance and have fun then this is for yooooouuu! Hope you enjoy if you get it i know i did.. This is the best Dance Game ever done. The characters and venues are so good as well as the tracklist. The only bad points I see in this game is that there's more R&B - Hip Hop music than other genres and the missing of an intro movie like the one on the first game.. a great game. if your willing to look kinda stupid and just let loose for a good time you will have a blast. especially if you can get your friends to play with you. it is quite simply the best party game i've ever played on the x-box. also for single player it may lose that sillyness you get with multiplayer but it still is a blast and a great work out. i'm a guy who loves RPGs and the occasional fps, yet something about this game is fun as hell. it is one of my most played games and has become my excuse for a work out...even though i'm playing for fun.. Highly enjoyable dance experience. Good selection of music for those from 13-45. This will get you up and moving and keep your heart rate up. With three difficulty modes, there's a chance to ease in without feeling overwhelmed. One of the top features is the variety of moves in the dances. They are fun with a bit of challenge. So go out, get the game and get your groove on!. Best dance game ever created, the music selection, the dance moves, the gameplay, the multiplayer option turns Dance Central 2 into a ""must have"" game for any xbox 360 and kinect user, even though I must say that people who really enjoy dancing are the one who will get the more fun.... With a new Break it Down mode, 2 players dancing together, Crew Challenges and new songs, DC2 has made a major upgrade since DC1. I love this game, and I recommend this to anyone who loves to dance, no matter your age. DC2 is by far, the best rhythm game of the year.. Its not really my sort of thing, dance games in general I mean. Just get off the sofa and give it a go and you will discover how much fun it can be. This game keeps everything that was good from the original and improves upon it. Side-by-side dancing with a friend is really good. If you don't like dancing games then don't play them, if you're unsure then this is the place to start. A firm family favourite.","i'm a guy who loves RPGs and the occasional fps, yet something about this game is fun as hell . i'm one of my most played games and has become my excuse for a work out...even though i'm playing for fun . with three difficulty modes, there's a chance to ease in without feeling overwhelmed ."
967.Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus,"Cool artstyle. Well made platformer that frames itself to feel stealthy. Different minigames shake up the gameplay in a goofy way that works.. The game looks gorgeous, the music and ambient sounds fit great and the controls are very precise, yet this does not deserve its good reputation nor can be compared to the PS2 masterpieces like Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Dexter. Even the story is well told and the protagonists are as lovable as they can be, but I still had close to 0 fun with this game. The overwhelming problem is the very linear platforming and a required precision that is surely possible because of the good controls, but so damn annoying because of the forced camera movement. The x-axis is inverted and you can not look up or down. Especially the latter one leaves you always the feeling of missing out something and to look around free you have to switch to a first person view. I did this very frequently, because I always missed just one or two of these pesky bottles you must collect to learn new movements or upgrades (which are not even useful at half of the times). It halts the gameflow and leaves you frustrated from time to time if you have to do the whole level again, because of one of these bottles. If there where various aproaches to get to the end of a level there would be some value in replaying them, but they are so tideously simple and linear that replaying is just annoying. All in all the great movement is flawed by bad camera work and too simple platforming. The fighting is so undemanding. While there are a lot of enemy types they are all very easy to deal with and the first one who hits does win the fight. The biggest fails are the minigames and by far the worst thing is the racing. This is just crap, especially because you have to complete this garbage to progress. All in all this could be great, but the gamedesign absolutely failed. Not worth to play it if you already played the very similar but much better games of the PS2, R&C or J&D.. Awesome sooooo awesome keep it going I think fight with other a villain boss. A very fun game. Good graphics for PS2 and attractive aesthetics. The gameplay is very good, it's simple, you only use three buttons and always the same ones, it's very addictive. It has a huge variety of missions, where it introduces arcade and shooter type mini-games, among others, which make the game very varied.. One of PlayStation’s greatest games of all time still till this day. I will never forget sly cooper.. The game is one of the most charming PS2 platformers without contest. The presentation is great and there's many great touches that bring the world to life. Unfortunately the platforming itself is subpar. The game has the tightest/best platforming sections in the series but that's not saying much. The game is still a neat experience, but there's a lot of room for improvement. Alright game that puts a very good foundation for the 2 sequel games on the ps2.. simple game for children that in the middle of 2002 had great physics!. who knew that ghost of tushima would be made by this same developer. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is a stealth-action platforming video game created by **** Punch Productions and published by Sony.. A fantastic platformer with fantastic characters. Sly Cooper is a welcome addition to the PlayStation mascot family.. Maybe its nostalgia but I think this is one of the greatest PS2 games, and sly should be the PlayStation mascot in my opinion.. Fun gameplay, good animations, decent story and fire music. Also; It‘s actually not laughably easy! One of my favourite platformers! Aged like wine too. My only gripes are with the uselessness of most abilities and the underwhelming/annoying bossfights.. Great game, great levels, good plot. It has some little issues, but come on, this is the first game in the series.. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 6 Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 7 Fun Factor : 7 Environment interaction : 7 Sound effects : 10 Overall Immersion : 8 There's no such thing as a perfect game. Didn't take long for this game to wear out it welcome. Floaty, inaccurate platforming doesn't lend itself well to a platformer. Missions try to increase diversity by having multiple playable characters, but aying as anyone other than Sly felt like a chore. Childish design mixed with adult level difficulty makes one wonder who this title was intended for. Slip this and go for Ratchet and Clank a far superior franchise. Classic to me and a great way to start the series second favorite in the series.. Sly Cooper and the TheIvius Raccoonus is a fun game that holds up incredibly well even in 2021. The controls show their age but man, do I miss the days when I didn’t have to open a menu every 5 minutes when playing a game. The simplicity of shines in the way only old-school 3D platformers can. I’m honestly surprised at how a PS2 game can hold up in 2021 because of its’ art style. My only complaint is the slightly loose controls. Besides that, the level design, the bosses and the variety in the mini-games still shine. The platforming is simple enough though the controls can make it awkward. An easy recommend and on to the sequel. Glad I didn’t skip this after missing it in my childhood. Final verdict: A smooth 7/10.. Sly 1 is very interesting game. This game has good controls but sometimes they feel weird ( Maybe because its old game.). Gameplay is good too but i think others than normal levels are sometimes very frustrating. I dont know if Im so bad player but I think game has some very hard levels (Like every level in Russia : ) Story is okay its not much but this game still has story which is pretty interesting but its not giving any omg feelings or sad moments just basic story. Music its good but it doesnt have any very memorable songs. Characters are great Sly, Bentley and Murray are good but I think that Bentley and Murray dont have any backstory in this game. I still think its amazing that every enemy has their own special story. I think this games level design is perfect. Every stage has its own thing and they have suitably variation in every stage. I think this game has just perfect lenght ( 7-8 hours I think). There are not very much bugs in this game and those didn't bother me. This games goals are to get those pages and defeat the bosses I think its very good goal in this game but again not anything super. And lastly no spoilers about this games ending but its funny and I think its perfect ending for game like this. So im giving 8 for this game. Got me interested about sly series I think i need to play Sly 2 now : ) I think that if you can you should give this game a try. Like if you have PS now. Thank you for reading!. Graphics, gameplay, story, and characters are all top-notch, one of my favorite games from my childhood. Every now and then there'll be a level so horrendously boring or dependent on chunky, unreliable controls that it becomes extremely frustrating (first level of the last area, for example) and it can be a tedious grind getting past those speedbumps to get at the actual good stuff about the game. Still one of the slickest 3d platformers for the PS2, part of the trifecta of Sly, Jak, and Ratchet. Sly Cooper and the thievius raccoonus is a platformer/stealth game, with a great and somewhat dark story. For being made in 2002, it still holds up well, because of the cartoony style of the game. The biggest thing the game has going on for it, is the story which revolves around Sly Cooper retrieving the stolen family book the ""Thievius Raccoonus"". The game has memorable villains, where Clockwork in my opinion is one of the best of all time. Sly Cooper and the gang are all likeable, and a big part of what makes the game good is the relationship between them. Sly is a very well fleshed out character with a witty, cocky yet serious and grown personality. His encounters with the cop Carmelita Fox has always been delightful and fun. The reason the games does not get a ten is because it is much because of a handful of filler missions, and the fact that Murray and Bentley are not as active in the story as I would of hoped for. Gameplay wise it also falls behind its follow ups, although this is really just more a compliment on them, then an argument against Sly Cooper 1. In conclusion, the Combined story of all the Sly Cooper games (minus Sly 4) has great character development and a perfectly written story. And all in all I think this is a great beginning of one of Playstations and gaming in general strongest IP's.. Just to be clear with some idiots here, The game is neither metal gear solide, neither splinter cell, it is not a completely (stealth) game, it is an easy platformer for kids just for fun, not for a big challenge, if you want a challenge, go and play dark souls and bloodborne , don't waste your time here, The game is great and they want it to be like this, not a hard game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It feels like not too long ago every game company an their grandma wanted to create their own platforming mascot. While most faded into obscurity there were a select few that managed to break the mold and stand out, staying within the hearts of many gamers. Sly Cooper is one of those characters. His appealing design, coupled with his unique blend of stealth and platforming, helped to making a lasting impression in people, myself included. I grew up with the series and have replayed the game dozens of times, and after nearly 20 years it still holds up exceptionally well. The plot is simple. Sly is a thief. He and his friends Bentley and Murray are off to different corners of the world to stop The Fiendish Five, a group of villains that not only murdered Sly's family, but also hold the pages of his ancestors' handbook The Thievius Raccoonus. The cutscenes that play out have aged pretty badly, not gonna lie. From the stilted animation to the weird lip syncing, it's pretty comical to look at nowadays. Thankfully, the voice acting is still pretty solid and the unique, all the characters are still thoroughly engrained within my memory and the graphical style still looks great to this day. The soundtrack, while not amazing, still has a few solid stand-outs. The game is a level-based 3D platformer combined with elements of stealth. You traverse through many varied areas and platforming challenges all while avoiding enemy detection. Your goal is to collect seven treasure keys to get to the boss. Getting caught doesn't always spell defeat, but Sly is incredibly fragile in this game. All it takes is one hit to put him down. However, you can collect up to too lucky charms to give you a couple of extra hit points (even works with water). You shouldn't worry too much about dying though as the game is remarkably easy. Even the bosses, while fun and memorable in their own right, are hardly an issue (save for maybe the final boss). Despite that, however, these levels are just plain fun to traverse through, partly because of how smooth Sly controls in this game. On the occasion, the game breaks up the platforming with different gameplay styles such as turret sequences defending a character, racing mini-games and timed challenges. While most of the challenges are a nice change of pace, the races, on the other hand, are terrible. It's two things: The controls for your van are too loose and the AI rubber bands like nobody's business. They are easily the worst parts of the game. Scattered throughout most levels are clue bottles. If you break every bottle in a level, you'll unlock a safe that will give you either a new move or passive upgrade like enemy information. These are not needed to complete the game, and most of them aren't too terribly useful to begin with. While I'll certainly say that the other two Sly games on the PS2 are better overall games, Sly 1 still has plenty of merit and is still fun to breeze through to this day. Definitely recommended for platforming enthusiasts and PS2 collectors alike.. A great plat-former which presents an overall splendid experience. Like playing a Saturday morning cartoon.. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is exhilarating. No wonder why **** Punch delivered something truly amazing with the truly cunning Raccoon Thief that started it all on PS2.. This cel-shaded platformer is in the tradition of ""Crash Bandicoot"". It's great fun and has solid reply value, but it's too short and easy. Perfect for kids and adults who like old-school platform games. I would rate it with an 8.5 out of 10.. A very nice game with cool graphics and charming characters, mixing plat-form and stealth gameplay. The trip is a little bit short but you'll have good time with it.. A great first entry into this classic PS2 series, Sly 1 establishes the world and characters that we would know and love for two more entries A very fun game. GOTY So much fun back in the days, bring it back! Remaster has to happen !!!!! 10/10. the game has aged nicely and is pretty much as i remember as a child and while it might be the nostalgia goggles i think it is worth all the praise it gets. This games a fun little cartoony 3d platformed that suffers from some annoying mini games and character dialogue. And while the over all game doesn't hold up so well the base gameplay is still good time to be had.. the 1st game in the sly series is much different than it's successors, but it was a huge step for 3d platforemers in the early 2000's. the game has good controls, and the enemies all have unique characteristics that make you understand why sly is on this journey! the game does have problems though, such as the awful boat levels. it's still a classic though, and it holds up against ratchet and jak.. A solid game however it does get repetitive over awhile. Imho it comes third fiddle to both Jak and Ratchet..... A potentially great game crippled by a bunch of crappy minigames. The platforming is fun, but I always groaned whenever one of the godawful minigames showed up. It needed more focus.. Sly Cooper was a fun interesting game at first with solid gameplay and great graphics for an old Ps2 Game. The further the game went, however, the more broken and flawed the game's mechanics seemed to get, even with all the bonus abilities I had picked up by doing Collect-a-thon style missions in certain levels of the game, it was still a near impossible trek in the final stages feeling more and more of a difficulty spike. leading to an enhanced hissy fit of rage from me. It wasn't a great experience, but a good title nonetheless. ""Sly Cooper"" was one of the biggest gaming series' of my childhood. A present from one of my dad's friends and also one of my first PlayStation 2 games, ""Sly Cooper"" captivated me during my childhood and went on to become of my favorite gaming series' of all time. In light of it's lack of sales and the improvements made by its successors, ""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus,"" the inaugural ""Sly Cooper"" game, still remains as one of my personal favorite PlayStation 2 games. With some outstanding platforming, a great storyline, lovable characters, an often humorous script with committed voice acting, fun thieving abilities and fantastic visuals that still hold up to this day, ""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus,"" has a lot going for it. If there is anything bad that I can say about it, the game itself is rather short, and even then, it makes up for that with plenty of replay value. Overall, ""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus"" may not have sold much (1.21 million copies? Really?) and it might not have the same amount of general awareness that many of today's games get, but regardless, ""Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus"" is not only one of the most underrated games of all time, but it's easily one of the PlayStation 2's best games. If you haven't gotten to experience this gem, you're doing yourself a disservice. Do yourself a favor and play this fantastic game. Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". GREAT game and in my opinion it's one of the classic platformers of the PS2. It has a lot of different types of game play that are spread out enough to never get too boring. Plus, they did a great job of making most of the styles of game play feel really good, regardless of whether you're doing actual platforming or just sneaking around to pick pocket people on the street.. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is a great platformer that is still a lot of fun to play today. I had a PS2 growing up, but never played these games. I’m finally playing PS2 games that I never got to play and this game suprised me because I ended up loving this game. The game still looks good and plays very well. I’d argue that because of the art style, this game has aged very well. If you love platformers and stealth, you need to give the first Sly Cooper game a chance.. The first Sly Cooper game is very similar to Crash Bandicoot: Warped, but adds in stealth to make it feel different. The story is very good and the bosses are even better. The time trial challenges were in my opinion better done here than in Crash 3, because they are only in the basic platforming levels, and not in the mini-game ones. Overall I think this is the best Sly out of the original trilogy. The hub world is only there to get to the levels, unlike the sequels were they are bigger and slows down the gameplay. The powerups are also the most useful out of the three games. I think this game has aged really well and still has the most epic final boss in the franchise with the owl Clockwerk. SCORE: 9.2 / 10. i love this **** better than his antecesor. a great history and very funnies characters. but that is not all, also the game has a great **** the market theres a little bit of game like this. This is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my first PS2 game and I still have it, but it doesn't work anymore. I give it a 10/10 because it's an important part of my childhood and I love it.. Great, yet short game. It's not the shortest game out there, but it was mostly only lengthy if you don't know what to do, or if you try to get 100%. There's also some not-so-good mini games here and there, but those are not around as much. The game overall is really great. While I'm usually not a fan of cel shaded graphics, in this game, it's excusable, because the game is good. Great controls, cool unlockable powers, etc. This was a pretty good game to start with.. Let me tell you. I was a bit skeptical about this game at first- but I immediately fell in love with it. The gameplay, is so much darn fun! Its challenging, but with the central hub system, it makes it amazing. The graphics are very unique and thought out, the voice acting is very well thought out and so is the script, and the stealth part about this game is fantastic. Its a challenge if you're not used to these types of games, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a blast. Its a bit short, as I finished it in about a day in a half, but don't let that deter you from buying it. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this game! You'll thank me later!. Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is a platform stealth video game created by **** Punch and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Good Story and Characters + Great Plataform + Variety Gameplay. In my opinion, this Sly Cooper game is the weakest out of the 4. It does have a few frustrating moments, but it is addicting, and it is tempting to get all of the cool moves you can unlock by collecting clue bottles (think the crates from the Crash series, but them being scattered throughout the level, sometimes being hidden well).. What is this game? -You are a Raccoon thief with your turtle and hippo buddies and you gotta collect the pages of your family heirloom, a book named the Thievius Raccoonous, and you do this by beating the Fiendish Five. You go each of their lairs/bases and collect keys to open access to the boss battles. -It is an action platformer. Linear levels with some sneaking, some fighting, and some platforming Pros: -Likable characters -Fun platforming -The right level of difficulty -Good Boss battles Cons: -Mediocre voice acting -The best part of the gameplay is by far the boss fights. I wish there was a bit more excitement in the stages leading up to it. Conclusion: If this is your type of game (by genre i mean) then there is no reason youshouldn't get this game. Given the date of this review I suggest you pick up the Sly Cooper Collection on the PS3. If you think you would like this game you will like this game. It does it well and it is a good launching point for a lovable mascot which unfortunately isn't a big part of gaming in this generation.. This is one of the best games of all time, the platforming is great, the stealth doesn't get in the way and this is one of the best ps2 games on the market. **** Punch nailed it here with the start to a great new series.. The platforming levels were really fun but the rest of the stages with a gimmick were a pain to control. The characters however are really funny. The platforming stages are actually too simple. Collecting the bottles to gain powers is pointless as all but 2 or 3 are pointless. So I think this is a rather mediocre game.. SLY COOPER AND THE THEVIUS RACCOONUS REVIEW When I was little, I used to play the Sly Cooper games. 12 years have passed, now I have finally replayed through the first one. I thought that I wasn’t going to like this game as much as I used to because of no nostalgia goggles. I was wrong. I really enjoyed this game. The game play is very linear, but enticing that way. The story is straightforward. The story is pretty much Kill Bill without outright murder. The core of the game is within three awesome characters: Sly, Bentley and Murray. The way the three characters play off each other in (not just this game) but all of the games is simply wonderful to watch. The villains, like most villains in Sly Cooper games, are over the top, mustache-twirling villains, and that is completely fine with me. All of the back stories are amusing to watch. The boss battles range from extremely hard (Mz. Ruby, Clockwerk) to very easy (Panda King). One portion of the game that kept me engaged throughout the game was getting the clues and unlocking the safes. The moves and techniques gotten were all useful throughout the game play. As of right now, I cannot think of any flaws. Some may say that the length of the campaign is a flaw, however, considering the amount of treasures and time challenges are in the game; the length reaches the standard amount. The game is definitely a classic and should be played by many for years to come. GRADE: Classic NUMERICAL GRADE: 10 LETTER GRADE: A OVERALL OPINION: This is game is a classic that deserves to be played by as many people as possible.. A couple days ago, I was attending to important business at my local library. Needless to say, that went well, because I'm awesome quite frankly. Anyways, before leaving, I began to browse the video game section of that same library (no, I'm serious, there's a video game section, ironically). The library currently has plenty of PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PS2, and even Wii U games (despite the Wii U being extremely recent console). I was looking aimlessly for awhile until I found something that caught my attention: the PS2 version of the first Sly Cooper game. Well, by now, many of you IGN users should have realized that I am a pretty big Nintendo fan. A lesser known fact about myself is that I actually started gaming on Playstation rather than Nintendo (so, literally the opposite of Colin Moriarty, hehe), specifically: the Playstation 2. Meh, at least home-console wise (the first video game system that I ever gamed on was the GameBoy Advance SP, literally minutes before I played the PS2, but that's a story for another time). Anyways, it is somewhat shameful that I admit that before I rented the Sly Cooper game, the only other Sony video game franchise that I had owned/played was Gran Turismo (the third one, to be specific). To be honest, I really enjoyed Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, bro. I thought that the graphics looked great for its time, and they still seem to hold up in my opinion. I also believe that the cel-shaded graphics are a nice touch. The game seems pretty easy to get into for a primarily Nintendo gamer such as myself. **** Punch outdid themselves on this one bro, and for that, I applause them. As for story, well, it reminds me of Kill Bill. Before someone starts spamming that Kill Bill came after the release of this game, hear me out. The story states that a group of people came into his house one day, killed his family and stole his book (the Thievius Raccoonus). Now years later, he's going around the world in a minivan that he probably stole, and beating up all members of that same group to death until he gets his freakin' book back. Sound somewhat familar? Its even got the animated villain intros! Oh yeah, some critics claim that this game is too easy. Well a got a few words for yah, THEY ARE FREAKIN' LIARS!! Seriously, what? Sly Cooper dies every time he falls into the water, he dies when he gets hit by an enemy ONCE, and I'm not even going to talk about the freakin' minigames bro! Of course, it could be that I **** at it, but that isn't viable since I managed to eventually beat the game. In all seriousness though, the gameplay reminded me of Crash Bandicoot, one of the many video game franchises that I played during my childhood....Screw you Activision. Well bros, overall Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus really exceeded my original expectations, and I look to see if I can get a hold of its sequels. But remember the real lesson here, kids of the world: LIBRARIES ARE GOOD FOR YOU.. Amazing level design, interesting but simple storyline and dynamic non repetitive gameplay deliver a beautiful experience that justifies the legend that sly cooper is to this date. The story is simple after the thievius raccoonus an old thief proffesional book from the sly family gets stealed in different parts is up to sly to recover the five different parts and rebuild the book, even if the story seems like just another revenge story it just never feels like such a cliche. As soon as you begin the game you will notice the smoothness of the controls and just how challenging the game is without being unfair. Each level has the same premise, recover keys, open doors, recover more keys and then open the door that leads to the boss. It sounds repetitive but it never gets old because each level and each section of it is just unique something that for a lot of games has always been a really though challenge to accomplish every single boss and every character in the game is just interesting the game fulfills that curiosity by explaining each of everyones history by beautiful full animated cutscenes, even if they are the bad guys they have a background story that you will have in your mind meanwhile your trying to get to them it just never gets old or repetitive and as i say before is impressive since the gameplay and the story are so simple. The only problem that i would have with this game is probably the final boss, even if the ending is so satisfying you just keep wondering who's this guy what makes this guy different from the other guys why is he so special this plot holes as some might call them never ruin the hole experience but they are definitely something that need to be said. In conclusion after playing this game you will get the praise that it receives and you will just fell in love with the series as i did, Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus deserves every single score and praise that gets as a franchise.. Super fun game and one of my favorite games of all time. I like the Sly series more than the Jak Ratchet series. I feel like it's much more underrated compared to those series. I highly recommend you get this game. It's a lot more different than the other 3, it's more of a platformer/collecting game while the others are sandbox games. It is better than Sly 3, if you liked the third you should like this!. A nearly perfect game and extremely addicting. It may be short, but this game is still just too good to not play. No game has created such a great mix of platforming and stealth like Sly has. The stealth part of the game gave the developer the ability to use some unique platforming abilities, and they took full advantage of that. In no other platformer can you walk and slide across thin wires or swing across gaps from hooks hanging overhead. An easy recommendation to anybody who likes video games of any kind.. Overall, Sly Cooper and the Theivious Racconous is a great a game. While the story is basic the characters are all fun and interesting. The gameplay is fantastic. You have some great level designs each one feeling unique fun and fresh. To add more variety are various minigames thrown in, which while eh at times get the game from getting dull or repetitive. The game can get difficult at tiems,w hic is great for gameers who are looking for challenge. On top of that are some great graphics and voice acting. Words cannot describe how great this game is you have to experience it yourself to truly understand what I am saying. If you are a fan of 3D platformers and also like being sneaky then pick up this game. You are sure to love Sly 1 as much as I do, which is a lot.. There's a pleasant old-school feel to Thievius Raccoonus; the enemies are merciless but a bit stupid, and the platforming challenges come on strong and ramp up steadily in difficulty as the levels go by. The main problem is that just as you're getting into a groove and really enjoying the variety seen throughout the different levels, the game ends.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I got the game free off the Playstation Network for being a Plus member. I was expecting a poorly designed game that crapped on classic adventure games. I got what I expected. The only good thing to come of playing this game was it reminded me to go back and replay Banjoe Kazooie. Now THAT was a good adventure game. Also, the hardest enemy in this game was the Camera. I've never in my life played a game where the camera was so utterly bad it took away from the game.. best series ever. Hands down. Very fun gameplay, likeable characters, etc. Whats not to love? Good graphics too. The people who rated it bad, cant get past the boss fights LOL!!!!. Fabulous game. I immediately fell in love with it the moment I started it for the first time. If only I had discovered it sooner, real shame that I didn't. Spot on with gameplay, music, graphics and story. Missions mix it up a lot and even though it is a bit too traditional it's one of my favourite games of all time.. My favorite game of all time. I love everything about this game. I love the graphics and the gameplay beats any ratchet and clank or jak. I enjoy the stealth part of the game. The bosses are absolutely amazing but a bit easy. I have beaten this game over 10 times and i can always replay it. It was an amazing childhood game. The clue bottle collecting was a bit challenging and super fun. The master thief sprints are amazing and really challenge even very good platformer gamers. Overall i love sly cooper! Long live the thief!!!!!!!!!. It's a great game but it's really short and easy but the others are also short but they're better and more fun to play but this one's good too but the enemys are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to easy.. BAH!!! sad for those that dint enjoyed the game, this is total nirvana classic. This is a most own playstation tittle, and it will be remembered as one of the best games out there. Actually, is very simple , cartoon graphics, great humor characters and a well pace on the levels. This shows a landmark on the PS 2 library a most own for children and adults alike. Happy cheers. Though it is short, Sly Cooper is an astounding adventu","the game looks gorgeous, the music and ambient sounds fit great and the controls are very precise . the biggest fails are the minigames and by far the worst thing is the racing . all in all this could be great, but the gamedesign absolutely failed ."
969.Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved,"I loved the game, but i **** ass. I never went too far, which is a pity. I would have loved to play it for more than 10 minutes lol.. When it comes to simple concepts Geometry Wars prevail in that from. Challenging, Fun, impossible. Geometry Wars is just to dam-- hard but dam--- fun. Just like the studio, Bizarre until the end.. I love this game. The visuals are like an Einstein equation in 3D color. The control is simple. The gameplay is highly addictive. I find that I often set down for a quick round or two and before I know it I've lost hours. Two thumbs up!",the visuals are like an Einstein equation in 3D color . the control is simple . the gameplay is highly addictive . i often set down for a quick round or two and before I know it I have lost hours .
97.Unreal Tournament 2004,"Give me back these FPSs, where really if you were good, you were REALLY good in this genre. Not like now they do a royal victory on Fortnite or win a game on Warzone and feel like pro gamers... But EpicGames wanted to do the EpicFails by drowning UnrealTournament 2014 by making room for Fortnite... God forgive us R.I.P UT. One of best childhood games i ever played! I was 6 years old when my dad bought me a CD for this game, i still have it sitting somewhere.... Just pure adrenaline, I have vague memories of playing it in my childhood but replaying it again last year made me realize it was even better than I thought,. Unreal tournament never ceases to amaze me. This is still one of the best fast paced FPS deathmatch.. Nowadays still playing this masterpiece, in my opinion best fps ever. So many memories of a happy childhood with this marvelous work. Full Action Funny Score 95 Full Action Funny Full Action Funny Full Action Game. Fast-paced multiplayer fun! There are many game types and customization options to provide a tremendous amount of variety. I remember playing this game at LAN parties in the mid-2000's. Although this game really is best enjoyed for its multiplayer with real human opponents, the single-player game is also quite good. In single player, you assemble and manage your own team of players throughout a season of gladiatorial combat. Don’t forget to thrust your crotch at the end of each match!. nice shooter very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. The game that defined graphics for more than a decade. We should all just pay respect for this. In addition, who would still say no to a match? lol.... One of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had. What a great memories.. This game is a ""pure"" shooter, with next to zero story or campaign, there is one but it's basically there for practice before teaming up with friends and playing multiplayer. One of the best multiplayer shooters to this day. It's successor, Unreal Tournament-3, is an upgrade in some areas, while a side-grade in others. The Leviathan in UT-2004 is a much more powerful vehicle than in UT-3, for instance. I cannot agree with some reviewers below which claim ""the shock rifle is used most of the time"", or ""the onslaught mode is the only one played"" (onslaught is the mode with vehicles, which add complexity to the game while reducing the importance of knowing how to use the basic 9 weapons in ""infantry"" combat). I'd say all of the weapons 3 through 9 are very well balanced in UT-2004. Goo gun is devastating at close range but very quirky to use right. Shock Rifle - is a straightforward rifle, efficient at mid-to-long range, but also has a special ability Plasma rifle - has the highest DPS, and can be devastating at long range if enemy doesn't see the bolts coming at them, but has otherwise poor damage delivery. Minigun - is straightforward to use, efficient at short-to-mid range. Flack cannon - is also devastating at close range, and projectile bounce lends to interesting mechanics if used right. Rocket launcher - has the highest single-shot damage and is overall powerful, but takes skill to use efficiently. Lightning gun - excels at ultra-long range, and can often insta-kill enemies at any range - IF you land a headshot, that is! If you miss - the long recharge time leaves you helpless for a while. of the above, there's really no way to rank the weapons ""worst to best"" in any way. Special modes of the game give various special weapons specific to the map or game mode. Those are more hit-or-miss. There's the ""Ballistic Weapons"" mod for UT-2004 which is awesome but entirely breaks the balance - some weapons are better than others by a landslide, and a few are absurdly OP and aren't even trying to hide it. It's fun to fool around with and admire the weapons, but it replaces entirely skill-based gameplay with something like ""whoever finds one of the OP weapons first - wins"". Although I think you can select which weapons are available there to still have a skill-based match.. Like your typical shooter. Mindless, dumb shooter that is so simple you can't even focus on it while playing because it's just so boring.. Unreal Tournament has more weapons, more game modes, more everything than its predecessor. But at the same time, the core game is a step back from the original Unreal Tournament in almost every aspect. Kills feel less satisfying, music is generic and weapons don’t sound as good. Weapons are also not balanced, and you will end up playing only with Shock Rifle most of the time. Onslaught is the only popular game mode. Unreal Tournament 2004 is still a good game, but unless you want an arena shooter with vehicles, I see no reason to choose this over the original.. Just like Unreal 1999 + more. You could play it today and still have lots of fun. Absolutely fantastic. Going back to this game so many years later has reaffirmed how good it actually is. Maps are great, weapons are fun. UT2004 is certainly one of the all-time best arena fps games that ever existed. Hopefully one day we see the resurgence of the afps genre again.. My favorte shooting game. This game has so many stuff to do and mods to play, by mods i mean in game mods, its challenging, the A.I is good, the campaign mode is good. its full of cool weapons and nice music, physics are well made, great voice overs. Simply its fun af, worth a try even today (2019) 9/10 one of the best games ever made.. Every LAN party at some point goes for some UT2004, so much raw multiplayer fun!. When I play counter strike 1.6 i love this game. But unreal tournament it's much better than counter strike 1.6. One of the best polished Unreal games of it's time Unreal Tournament 2004 immerses the player in high energy battles and objectives / competitions. The user has the freedom to mod / build game assets and host said assets live in custom public games on the master server! that is my favorite part! This is a flawless release in my opinion, and will always be one of my favorite games to memory.. The best FPS multiplayer games from 2004. This game has action, great graphics and gameplay is awesome. You can play this game with your friends on servers or LAN. Maps are relatively large, weapons are strong. In this game you will not be bored.. Still an absolutely amazing game today in 2018, which is what, 14 years after release? Good graphics - not too busy, not too dark, not too simplistic either - yet super fast frame rates, very precise and responsive controls with keyboard + mouse, and tons of freedom of movement. The successor games UT3 and UT4 are visually more complex, which looks good in a static image, but is distracting in actual gameplay (and of course they are also more GPU intensive). If you have ever seen a FPS where the targets need to be highlighted with a red outline or a circle or something to be discernible, that's the ""too much visual complexity"" issue I am talking about. Thankfully, Unreal Tournament 2004 is visually crisp and clean enough that none of these hacks are necessary. UT3 and UT4 are also more sluggish and restrictive in their range of movement. This game isn't just instant hitscan or button mashing - instead, there are many weapons with trajectories that, with skill, can be timed and released within just the right fraction of a second for maximum effect. The online community is still going strong and surprisingly well mannered, too. Arcade like pace in 3D FPS. Protip: Get a gaming monitor with lightboost, ULMB, or similar motion blur reduction for clearest possible motion, it will make a difference in this game. My favorite game mode is freeze tag, where players temporarily freeze for about three minutes rather than die, and the game is over only when every member of a team is frozen. Frozen players can thaw in just a few seconds if a healthy team member is standing or moving right next to them - but that's a risky move for the healthy player, since he becomes an easier target. This kind of risk taking to help thaw your team members, who in turn can help you, builds a real sense of community and cooperation.. About 30 days left till we reach 2017 and this game right here is still hands down one of the greatest arena shooters of all time. If you're a veteran pc gamer and you don't have this in your collection, you're wrong and you're not a true gamer.. Unreal Tournament 2004 is a game that shows that in 2004 the games were very good. The game has very good graphics for its time and a GREAT gameplay! This is a game that I will cherish forever. One of the ways I've played most is the Instagib. I recommend you download the game, because you will spend the whole time playing this game, which is certainly a great game made by Epic Games. One way I want to play a lot is the multiplayer, which should be great. The game has a variety of good weapons, and that really pleased me.. GODDMAN THIS GAME IS GREAT! This is no doubt a legendary shooter that everybody ever interested in multiplayer FPS should play. This is one of those titles that have carved their names on the very core of video gaming. You shouldn't be even reading any reviews for it, you should try if you haven't and you should smile and nod your head while reading this if you have.. At the moment of its release and for about 7 years after this game was one of the best online shooters. Well balanced weapons, interesting maps designed to have no camping spots, capable bots. The excellent voice announcements (""headshot!"" ""godlike!"") which you probably heard re-used on private servers of Counter-Strike.. Fun and entertaining! That's my impression after playing this game. The graphic is neat and beautiful, but do not burden the computer. Everything is designed properly; maps, gameplay, sounds, musics, characters, vehicles, nature, and others. It's just that I feel less comfortable when using a sniper rifle, smoke blocking the view and making framerate decreases dramatically.. This game is probably one of the best fps games I HAVE EVER PLAYED it has amazing graphics for a game made in 2004,it meets most players' need for fast past run-n-gun action,it has TONS of maps and game modes, and is really customizable! two thumbs up and a 10/10 for epic games who's name speaks for how good their games are.......EPIC!. I bought this game on its release date about 10yrs ago now and I still play the odd deathmatch or onslaught, reason being this game is so much fun! I remember the early days of multiplayer they were so intense I went from onlsaught to CTF then VCTF to deathmatch and there's more game modes than just these. All those mods and maps available for free, Im a veteran of this game and I still see a new map or mod on servers. Best FPS ever!. This is still the best multiplayer FPS in mine opinion. The movement is fast and gun play is just best from all UT games. Another awesome thing about this game is the large number of maps and very solid number of mods.. words can't be spoken and this game is a legend on pc i enjoy playing custom mods on games but this has way better use for them then the others that i have played one thing that i like is Gameplay and guns that all i have say. This is the best unreal they have made to date, UT3 is so graphical intense that it needs a $300 graphics card and maybe a $200 CPU and a very high priced board. Now UT2004 can be played on all typed of machines high and low all WBGS members play this game well and enjoy the fast paced **** times people can be so skilled you think they are hacking, that's where Wrex comes in thanks to Wrex they really made it so we can eliminate hackers since there really is no anti cheat system.Playing this with friends is awesome also thanks to Mr.Pants and Extreme OverKill mod this is one of the best games. Remember play in servers you know and trust not random server you don't, Also just because they are populated and have a big name don't mean anything take precaution.. This game is the best video game I have ever played by far. It is definitely the perfect multiplayer shooter in just about every way. In case you are wondering why I think this game is so awesome, let's start with the gameplay. This game is not the usual class-based FPS like Team Fortress 2 or Battlefield. It is actually similar to earlier games such as John Romero's Doom or Quake in which there are no classes, and everyone can have the same weapons. This is a very good system, as it means that no units can overpower another, and no one has any real advantage or disadvantage. This is a very good system, and I only wish more shooters followed that trend nowadays. The rest of the gameplay is separated into different modes. There is Deathmatch, which pits everyone against each other in a free-for-all, where people have to score the most points in order to win. There is also Team Deathmatch, which is similar to normal Deathmatch, but now pits two teams against each other, rather than a free-for-all. There is also Capture the Flag, which has the straight-forward goal of capturing the enemy team's flag while defending your own. Then there is assault, which is a unique mode that pits two teams against each other with one on offense, and the other on defense. The offense needs to complete its objectives before time runs out, while defense needs to prevent them from doing so. The teams then switch, and the new offensive team has to beat the opposing team's time. There is also onslaught which takes people out of the large corridors of normal Unreal Tournament games, and takes them into full-scale battles in which you need to destroy the enemy team's power core to win. Then there is mutant mode, where once a player scores a kill, he becomes a mutant, and thus the target of the other players. The mutant is an overpowered unit, and is hard to kill. There is also invasion, which involves three players fighting for survival against wave after wave of enemies. Finally, there is last man standing, which is like Deathmatch, but each player now has limited lives, and once they lose those lives, they're out. These are all very creative modes, and they ensure that you will not get tired of the game very easily. This game also has great graphics. Admittedly they were much better back when this game was released in 2004, (they are dated by today's standards), however, I still say they're great nonetheless. As for the story, it's very simplistic. You make a character, and have him complete in every event in the Unreal Tournament. Even though the story is simplistic however, it is still very good. After all, this game doesn't need a massive storyline to be awesome. The story of this game is definitely good enough to get the job done, and that's all that really matters. Overall, I'd say that this game is excellent. There is really nothing wrong with this game in the slightest. It has amazing gameplay with silky smooth controls, great graphics, and a great story. If you do not have this game, for goodness sake, you need to buy it now! It is cheap on Steam, or you can get this game, along with the Unreal Deal Pack (includes this plus all of the Unreal games in one package) for the price of a newly released game. Heck, buy the whole package if you really want to. All of the games on there are excellent.. Single Player/Multi Player (2/2) (If the single player is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no multplayer) (If the multiplayer is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no single player) Gameplay (2/2) Visuals/Story (0/2) (If the visuals are better than the story, review this section as if it had no story) (If the story is better than the visuals, review this section as if the visuals didn’t matter) Accessibility/Longevity (1/2) (Review this section only on Accessibility if the game has no longevity) (Review this section only on longevity if the game isn’t accessible) Pricing (2/2) Wildcard (0) This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. One of the best arena shooters, if not FPS games ever made. Just wish it still had a large online following as most servers are ghost towns now...truly tragic.. Funny how a game released almost 10 years back is still so much fun to play. Even though I have played more recent games I always come back to it and yet it feels like the first time. Huge maps, awesome weaponry, insane game-play and the list goes on. Every installment of this series is a welcome surprise. Yeah, UT III didn't get as far, but still it's ages above its contemporaries.. In my view the best multiplayer shooter of all time together with counterstrike and quake 3. But I prefer UT2k4... It is fast and gives a lot of possibilities to attack. You have to learn a lot, even the movement is a difficult and interesting. Graphic is very nice too. Some sounds are legendary even until today. A shame what happened with UT3. Another superb hit for the franchise, it is every bit as good as the 1999 installment. With revamped graphics and a top notch AI, Unreal Tournament 2004 guarantees an absorbing single-player campaign and endless hours of multiplayer matches with original ""bombing run"" and ""onslaught"" modes.. The only fault I have with this game is it's mediocre voice acting, other than that, it is perfect. It's fun, it's fast-paced, it's easily moddable, heaps of people still play it, it requires strategy, it has space combat and over 30 vanilla maps and 10 vanilla gamemodes, if I recall correctly. 10/10.. Solid game-play, still good graphics, solid bot mechanics, good layout, cool maps, cool game modes, and good multiplayer. At a price of $13.59 on steam, with Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament III, Unreal, and Unreal II: The Awakening, this is an amazing deal and a must own NOW.. If you fancy a fast paced multi-player FPS, this this your game. Not much to say, this game was a blast online and some of the battles are down-right intense! I switched between this and Counter-Strike 1.6 back in the day, both were equally fun and rewarding in their own sense. Like I said, this game is not for everybody, but if you can handle the action you'll have **** time.. This is the last good Unreal Tournament, a very good game, a decent sequel to the series. As usual a new Unreal Tournament game released at the same time as the new Unreal Engine, that means great graphics, and revolutionary advances in gaming! A great game,let's hope that with Unreal Engine 4 will come Unreal Tournament 4 and it should be like this game not the crappy Unreal Tournament 3.. Together with Quake, this series is one of the best FPS series of all time.. mastering this game online is a real Challenge. Much different to today's game's like BF3 or MW3.. UT2004: One of my most favorite game. There are lots of game modes you can try. The original Deathmatch and CTF mode returns right here with some extra modes. I liked the Onslaught mode. It's very addicting and can waste you up hours to play. The addition of vehicles just made the game a lot more complete. If you think that the game is not balanced, there are mutators for you to add and configure. The bots are quite challenging and you can add up to 32 bots. The weapons are amazing and packs lot of punch. The graphics are decent for the time, but it's great. And if you get bored, there are thousands of custom maps and mods that you can download for free (especially Red Orchestra).. Maybe in my gaming life, I will never like an arcade type shooter game. Counter Strike, Modern Warfare and this highly acclaimed UT 2004 all seem very average to me. It's just a mindless shooting game. You run around boringly repetitive 'arenas' and shoot other people who are trying to shoot you. Most gameplay modes are just feeble attempts at making the run-and-shoot idea which in my narrow mind is an inferior gameplay design. For example, the 'capture the flag' mode, which should involve strategy, planning, and team coordination (similar to Battlefield 2). But no, you just run. And shoot. And when you get a flag, you run, while being shot at. Yet, I am not suggesting people not to try this game, I believe some people who are obsessed with this type of shooter would love it anyway. However, if you think a small amount of deliberate gameplay on the part of the design is important, just get away from this game.. Even years after its release i still play this game. It is one of the most fast paced and most fun FPS I have ever played. It is also great for competition and for LAN parties.. One of the best SP & MP games of all time. The music wasn't as great as the original but the graphics are technically the best out of this and works well in most PCs. The game modes and the multiplayer are some of the best out of this awesome game. The add-ons and custom maps are a huge hit as well.. The most fun I've ever had over a LAN party, this game elicits the greatest physiological response, epic win. Whether it's running ragged with the flag in Capture the Flag, tossing the bomb in Bombing run, or running down the opposition while providing a surf of the manta in Assault or Onslaught, there is no comparison. It's a freaking blast.. awesome game, its old, but it surprisingly aged quite well. just the sheer mayhem of the fights is really fun, and it really does what its meant to do quite well, give you a satisfying multiplayer experience. given that it doesnt actually take itself all too seriously, it really allows them to give a truly fun and somewhat silly experience for anyone looking to have some mindless fun with an FPS game.. This game is probably one of the best fps games I HAVE EVER PLAYED it has amazing graphics for a game made in 2004,it meets most players' need for fast past run-n-gun action,it has TONS of maps and game modes, and is really customizable! two thumbs up and a 10/10 for epic games who's name speaks for how good their games are.......EPIC!. Addictive.Like no other.. What makes this fun is how easily you can mod it. It is a showcase game for the Unreal engine, and as such, you can create your own skins and import them, change settings around to make things interesting (instagib, the one shot KO modified laser rifle mode.) Mind you the game has no plot at all and is repetitive, but its fun, and does what it is supposed to do.","""unreal tournament"" is still one of the best fast paced FPS deathmatch. i remember playing this game at LAN parties in the mid-2000's . the game that defined graphics for more than a decade ."
970.Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Best of I, II, and III. Game is exciting and infinitely replayable. What more can we want? All thanks to CA ! !. It's a fun game for some time, if you like CA's RTS games then you'll like this one. The thing is the formula has not changed at all ever since the first Total War. Combat is refreshed with leaders and magic, but campaign map stuff is too simple. It's basically a game of building big armies fast and keep on conquering settlements, there are almost no strategic layers unlike civilization. Coop campaign mode is appreciated, but I wish they revamp the campaign mode to add more depth.. When you pay more then 60 euros for a game, you expect it to have at least half of the available factions,not just 19,not to mention the very expensive DLS, and that's not even taking info account the many nuances that many people don't like to mention.. It's getting better. The devs are doing all the right things. I like this game alot, I hope you do too!. Meh, why bother making a total war game about Warhammer? History is much better than some geeky franchise that most people don't know about. I tried getting into it, but it felt cheesy and lame.. the game is made with the feet, if it wasn't for the work shop I would give it a 5. THANK YOU MODDERS FOR SAVING THIS GAME FROM THE NEGLECTFUL MANAGEMENT OF The Creative Assembly.. Better than 1, but much weaker than 2 imo. Props for the attempted innovation on the portals and city fights, but the portals especially just turn this game into a massive slog that stays well past its welcome. Couple that with a bunch of very poor DLC deliveries and pricing and the Mixed score is understandable. The build your own demon prince was a great addition and I hope this become a core feature they continue to build on. I would never recommend this over 2, and unless you really want to play one of the new factions you can pretty safely skip it. And unless the portal suppression mod gets fixed strap in for incredibly long, drawn out games.. I give 0 rating to games with Denuvo on principle. I will change the review if Denuvo is removed.. After 3759 hours I can say I really, really like the game. But you do need all the DLCs to enjoy it fully. If not for that, it would be 10/10 for me.. I'm a fan of the Total War: Warhammer series, even though I'm not much into the Warhammer series in other medias (not because I dislike it, I simply never got to it). The game is good, don't get me wrong. I've played, and still play, plenty of it. However I felt disappointed. There wasn't much improvement over the second game. The campaign added in the third game is okay, to be honest. There are interesting things to it. Can't help but feel like the devs insist on disappointing us when it comes to battles however. Especially with trailers that show cannons and such on the walls. This could be so much more than it is. As a game on it's own, I'd give this 8. As the third game of the series? 7 is pulling it a little bit higher - I'd say 6.5 even.. Warhammer 3 is just :- U will buy this game but you will not put money in it? Will no fun for u. best updated game and patched, has a lot of fun with it. Thx CA for the great work with it. the combat system has all the positives and negatives that you expect from a total war game. With that said it is a great entry that further tightens up the existing systems. with these games giving you access to content unlocked in past games the totalwarhammer sandbox is as fun as its ever been.. Very good game with vast world which is being continuously expanded with DLCs. There are many factions to play as. Finishing the game takes very long time. Contains multiple scenarios of how to achieve victory. My main concern is that DLCs are rather unreasonably expensive.. i havn't finished the tutorial yet but everything so far seems good. i like all of the other total war games so i don't see how this one could disappoint me.. Play Total War games for more than 15 years. This one is unreal. You will need to buy all the top content though. Check youtube for the best dlc factions, also make sure you buy all 3 games in a triology pack for the best price. It has so many different mechanics and units, the battles and the campaign map are stunning. It's not perfect but they have really come a long way from warhammer 1. The only thing I would move recommend, would be to add the possibility to customize banners, units, cities and lords.. Some things are hard to believe and I personally can’t believe that people call this piece of undigested feces a game. Kal is 2 years old and there are still bugs in it that simply do not allow you to “play”. Do you want to see how your warriors fight up close, like in any other unit? But here we don’t do that! Moving the camera closer to the warriors makes them invisible. I spent more time looking for a solution to this problem than I spent playing this game. Various recommendations were made: Turn off the ""proximity fading"" setting; Install ""Better Camera Mod""; Check local files; Restart stool; Restart the computer; Reinstall cal. Surprisingly, nothing helped. My hardware: 3060ti, 32gb ram, R7 5800x. A mediocre rant from a mediocre publisher and mediocre developers.. there is no game like the total war warhammer series. this was my first pc game and dive into the warhammer universe, it truly an experience consoles cannot offer with high replay value and constant DLCs.. Compared to the previous two installments, TW:WH 3 is a step backwards in playability and function.. Ruined castle wars for me. Played 250 hours first game 2000 hours second game. Could play this sheet 30 hours. Appearently gamepass game afterall. Since the website does not allow to format text, I'll only state my reason for low score without talking deeper about the game.Chat in multiplayer has been removed. Unlike TW:WH II The game has shipped without chat but developer assured that it will be implemented after they develop a good way of moderating it (aka censoring). However, 2 years after release not only there is still no chat... In may 2023 CA released patch to previous TW titles which removed chat from multiplayer from them! They did that even to Empire released in 2009 and doing that also broke mods. Chat is a vital feature needed to communicate with other players in multiplayer games. I can not accept that it is being removed from old titles which were sold as including it. I politely asked many times CA to add chat to TW:WH III but never received reply.. The amount of money you have to pour into this game to be able to play it fully is insane. Even at maximum discount an average working person not from first world countries will never be able to play this game. The pricing of the game like most AAA games is not fair for less fortunate individuals in developing countries. All in all there is nothing that would justify the price tag. The quality of the game is irrelevant when you can not have access to it, directly because of the publishers decisions.. One of the best or the best strategy game I have ever played.. 260€ of DLC's, hell no.. Imagine CA had Mercedes Benz called model Warhammer 2. And then these geniuses took that and turned it into a Lada - model Warhammer 3. And now imagine they are selling you a deflated spare tire (WH3 DLCs) at a cost which is nearly equal to half the price of the Lada model WH3. **** Legends.. So many bugs, youre too busy making expansive dlcs that offer NOTHING. Fix the fckin game before even considering adding new lord and units, absolutely pathetic. This game would be an outstanding 10/10 if CA/Sega would give it the proper support it deserve. E.g.: notable DLC, custodian team for maintenance, FLC again?, grander mechanic changes with updates, etc.. Unfortunately I can not support this studios recent LACK of intelligent planning around this franchise. I am not buying anything from CA or Sega until they turn around their recent events surrounding this game. I encourage any newcomers to hold off from purchasing any of their products until the suits of the aforementioned fully pull their you-know-whats out of their you-know-wheres and adequately support this game. If you don't, you are choosing to support a company whose current approach is: milk them till they bleed and give nothing back. It had a rough launch (entirely their fault) and was starting to look better with previous two DLC till this recent dead stop. Shadows of Change...fitting title. Turn it around CA/Sega, this game deserves better from you... When/If I feel this community has been adequately heard and RESPECTED (looking at you, RB), I will resume purchasing their products and remove my negative ratings on all sites.. Huge prices for DLC with no content, bugged since the premiere, optimization is poor (on the campaign map it takes up 9300MB of VRAM in 1080p), the AI is still weak and doesn't know what to do with itself on the campaign and battle maps, but threatening the community broke the camel's back. I'm not a deviant to get ****** for my own money.. I fan of total war games, but that its that the worsts game on my experience from total war. You shout to spent too much money for open all race DLC in this game. Worst camping what I ever play. The worst game for what I ever pay in my life.. I love Warhammer and Total War, so I invested a lot of time in the hope of what was to come. What was to come has not come, and is not coming. Here are the main issues why I do not like this game, and would recommend Warhammer 2 over it: - Sieges: I don't know how they did it, but they made the worst sieges I have witnessed in the Total War franchise. They have no plans to fix this, and in a war game, this is a critical mistake. - Balancing: Chaos rules all in this game. Human factions are weak and in dire need of updates to make them even playable. - Networking: Loads of crashes and glitches while playing online, leading to lots of restarting and lost save files. - DLC pricing: It seems CA is giving less content for double the price, which really makes me worried as this game is supposed to be given content for 10 years. I'm not sure if I want to pay that money for such little content when the base game is so lacking already. All in all, I am pretty disappointed. I'll stick with Total War mods on the older games and Warhammer 2.. only fix bug every half year also each DLC now are extreme overprice 25€ is almost half of one full game for less than 20% content this is definitely an anti-consumer practice,. many bugs ignored and left unfix for months. Overpriced dlcs that can buy a full game. Wind has changed for CA. Spend your time and money elsewhere.. The bugs in this game are atrocious, the dlc pricing is exploitative, the the developers hate their customers. Take it from someone with hundreds of hours of playtime in the previous games, don’t give this greedy leech of a company any of your hard earned dollars. Awful experience compared to TTW2. After more than year it feels like a beta or the Early Access. The game developers are definitely not the same who designed the brilliant tomb kings and vampire coast. While playing the same faction in TWW3, you can get more broken mechanics and much more boring gameplay as it was.. Game itself is not that but but the support of it is abysmal, paid DLCs are broken (Alariel and Nakai) and do not recieve bugfixes. Do not recomend. The worst of all Total War games... looks like devs are more interested in playing politics than in making good game.... On the start game was not really finished, and campaign is boring, but Immortal Empires campaign is great. Still need some work, and many races need updates, but now game is great. The Game offers epic battles with many races and a beautiful lore. I love how the Studio is trying to make the best out of this Game and continues to listen to the Community. As a Slaaneshi Player i am very pleased with Most of the Units. As a Suggestion it would be very nice if you could buff Chosen of Slaanesh because they feel very weak and disapointing. I know you are doing ur best guys keep on the good work!. I just bought it to play with Vampire Counts, and was just after buying it that I realize that you only can play with that faction if you own WH1 and WH2 with all their DLC, what a way to scam their costumers. игры вне политики, мудилы They stopped supporting the Russian language.. I would like to put aside political issues, which in principle should not exist in the gaming industry, so I will speak dryly and to the point. When any software developer, before selling a product, declares any product features and receives money for this product upon sale, he undertakes to provide the promised functionality. When the functionality is declared, the product is released, sold, but stops working after the sale - this is a scam. This is theft. The game was announced support for the Russian language. People bought this product on pre-orders. After 2 years, the Russian language is cut out of the game. This is theft. This is rudeness. Do not preorder from these companies. They will steal your money and wipe their feet on you. They are thieves.. Russian has always been a positive attitude towards this game, but what happened shocked me, Creative Assembly stopped supporting the Russian language a week before the release of the new DLC, it's just outrageous, such an attitude towards the consumer and the Russian community of the game is extremely upsetting, if it was done for political reasons, then it's disgusting. I believe that games should be outside politics and I will remind all Russophobes that for many Ukrainians Russian is their native language, and there is no purely Ukrainian language in the game, so this act is inappropriate and stupid in any case.. No politics in games! Stop denigrating the Russian people and their language!. They stopped supporting the Russian language. Harassment of Russian-speaking players.. The games have been patched very well now; I love it so much. Super addictive, and there have been so many small but noteworthy additions that work. Like sieges now cause attrition. If a rival nation lord is parading your lands, you can threaten war if they don’t leave pronto. The new factions are great. The sieges with supplies introduced a more protected asymmetric warfare for even more trickery with the defending army.. This review addresses the current state of the game, if it would have been written a year ago it would have been neutral if not negative. Total War Warhammer 3 manages to deliver an interesting campaign that can be enjoyed in a nice single player or a multiplayer and also features the amazing Immortal Empires (Sandbox) Campaign to all players alike. With various interesting factions which can be played in various ways and be expanded into various directions across the gargantuan map. A big selling point for me personally is the big mod support which can give players an endless amount of content for both the strategic and tactical side of the game.. Shame on you to deliver this game this last game that we loved so much in this state and worse than the previous. Feels like ok it's the last one people bought it or will let's finish this and move on.... The Release of the Game was aweful, now its the best Warhammer strategy Game. The worst game of the series! I bought it for a lot of money, for the sake of a complete lack of optimization??? for the sake of paid content in A SINGLE ALREADY PURCHASED GAME? to play for the right hero - I STILL HAVE to buy 1 part???)) BURN IN HELL). 200€!?!?! **** game is a joke. I bought this and wanted to play a sandbox game with the wood elves. The game won't let me choose them if I don't have purchased the following: Warhammer 1, Warhammer 2, Warhammer 3, and wood elves DLC. Thats 200€! I bought the wood elves DLC for 20€ and this game for 60€ and cant even play it. That's 80€ wasted, what a **** joke. I don't even care what the rest of the game looks like and don't want to play it any further thanks to this amount of ""cash grab"" in this. **** this game studio. I do not recommend this to anyone.. I made the jump from Total War Warhammer 2 to 3 more out of curiosity than necessity. 2 is a very fine game I have sunk over a hundred hours in, and wasn’t really looking for change. But, when Immortal Empires was released I thought it was time to start the Wood Elves playthrough I always wanted to do and the new hotness was too hard to resist. And now I can never go back. It’s not just the gigantic new map with the eight new and all the old factions to fight. It’s definitely not the campaign I haven’t even started yet and that I hear so much bad things about. It’s all the little and not so little gameplay improvements that were added, all of them belonging to the category “I didn’t know I needed this, but now I can never give it up”. The reworked diplomacy system finally clearly communicates why certain offers are always going to be denied. The ally system allows for an even greater variety in army composition without changing the character of the faction armies too much. The millions of little changes to the battle systems make it so much easier to navigate the great battles and pull off some really stunning reversals at times. The late game crisis events that have the potential to shake up the end game grind. And, yes, the metric tons of new content helps a lot, too. Meanwhile the core gameplay loop is the same addictive power fantasy it always was. The production values are as atmospheric as before. Hopefully the commitment to the game by the studio will be as exemplary as it has been in the past, too. With one very substantial DLC pack already out, it sure looks that way. This game is a substantial improvement over Warhammer 2, without losing any of its essence. If you liked that one, absolutely go get this one.. Can't say I was a fan. Played and found it too easy and quite boring. I really don't see the fuss about these games.. a verry overpriced expansion to Warhammer 2 packed to the brim w dlc and half baked units + buggy release. Has the potential to be great, but is too flawed in it's execution. The launch was unforgivable, missed the chance to make this one of the best strategy games ever made and turned into just another good strategy game. Great game unfortunately being review bombed by nerds. It's a fantastic achievement, especially the Immortal Empires campaign! Highly recommended!. Any reviewsfrom before now are pretty valid. Loke previous war hammers the game was buggy and some changes to the estetic arent perfect BUT mod community allows for prefe free preference changing and the company has killed it in adding/fixibg/altering the game. Catch war hammer 3 in sale at least to try the veryvwell made tutorial and if your in? GRAB ALL THE GAMES base copies and join the fight Dlc do a little research incase some stuff isnt your cup of tea. Simply the best TTW experience when added to the previous two titles to complete the game as far as I am concerned. Immortal Empires is a massively impressive gaming experience in the Warhammer universe. Once you add in some mods from the Steam workshop, one can simply get lost in the game, especially if you have a high-end PC and Odyssey Neo monitors for an astonishingly immersive experience.. One Word: Lag. The game is not even that good, it's a copy and paste from shogun.. Bought this game at launch and it was a buggy mess. Came back months later for IE, can't even start a new campaign without it crashing. I own the first two, they had their issues but were at least playable. This is a mess. I know there is a good game in there somewhere.. Just like Warhammer II, it's incredibly barren and unoptimized on launch. The rift mechanic, just like the vortex race, is obnoxious and really **** out the fun of expanding your empire. But at the end of the day, we all know that Warhammer III is just a stepping stone to Immortal Empires. The actual main game. When that's released and a couple of months pass to fix the undoubtedly broken state of it, then it will become the game for the ages.. The launch was terrible with a campaign that was only fun for 1 playthrough and very repetitive afterwards and a lot of bugs, crashes and performance issues. Now, with finally getting Immortal Empires the campaign problems are fixed and the game at least is playable for more than 1 playthrough again and running pretty smooth.. I dont think im alone in saying i have little to no interest in Total War Warhammer 3, We are all here for Immortal empires. If they had ""just"" released Immortal empires, expanded the map and races, and not bothered with the new main campaign, i think everyone would have preferred it.. THE worst game of all time. Every single aspect is implemented worse than both the prequal games. It runs so astronomically terrible, if you ever so much as crashed in Warhammer 2, you will not be able to play with graphic settings on anything higher than medium. So of course the visuals are garbage. There's no reason for the larger and harder to run game, given it arguably has less content than Warhammer 2 (despite being twice the size). And while it will surely get good after many, many updates, that's no justification for the terrible quality on release. Not to mention how slowly they have been taking on even the slightest most insignificant updates. Even at times patching some of their patches out after realizing how stupid they were. It's really no wonder why Warhammer 2 has held a consistently higher average player base.. I wasn't the biggest fan of Warhammer 2, not because it was bad, but because I wasn't that interested in that category of game. Nonetheless, it was extremely well-made and made me appreciate that genre of game. This however, did not. The storyline is boring, the fact that you don't have to be the best kingdom to conquer and win, you just have to be the first to get 4 stones is beyond boring. It also takes forever to load anything in multiplayer, not sure if that's the same in singleplayer. Definitely not worth the price, just give Warhammer 2.. Very unfriendly consumer wise business practice. The game is just dlc-expansion marketed as full price **** day one DLC ofcourse is here and who knows how many more will come... Decent game killed by greed and they wonder why the player count is lower than the older games... People arent stupid and wont pay again for the same thing over and over again.. Greed, Greed never changes!. I started up this game, saw the factions and immediately quit. Literally five of the eight factions are Chaos. The faction that no one wanted to play in Warhammer I or II, is essentially the focus of this game. Were the developers even listening to their fanbase? Did they check the metadata from people who were playing their games, or did they just let their egos decide what they would create and say, screw everyone else? Just an awful selection and until the big map comes out and I have a choice of other factions (something other than a pseudo-empire and Chinese themed faction, I mean I wonder what market they were trying to win over there?) I will not be playing this game. So my scoring is entirely based on the fact that this company could care less what their fanbase wanted, and instead created something that cost them the least amount of money to develop.. Such a bad game, disappointed. Expected more after WH2 which was a great game. Great game overall, lots of improvements over previous entries. The campaign is very narrative based and not a good sandbox experience, but personally I like that. Looking forward to what's coming next. Text within UI does not show, ""fix"" posted through google search does not work. Game has been out for almost 4 months and still no patch / fix. This makes the game not playable. Took time to make a Metacritic account just to write this and warn people.. TW: Warhammer II is one of my all time favorite computer games, so of course I bought this and, honestly, I don't get how this company could screw up so badly. This feels and plays like a middling mod for WH2. You get new map, units and factions, and that's pretty much where benefits end and problems begin. Performance is much worse than W:TW2 despite the map being smaller than ME. Graphics were not improved in any way. Bugs galore. The ""tweaks"" or ""features"" added are mostly failures - UI changes for worse, realm of chaos is clunky, new setlement-type battles with building stuff on the map are annoying. I give it a 4 because it still has the W:TW2 engine at heart, but honestly if you are new to the series - buy W:TW2 and skip this.. They charged full price for an early beta release. I play only single player campaign.. It is an 8. Most content we have ever had on release when they had to work through lockdown. Most characters, factions, and most ambitious campaign they have ever attempted. Are their issues? Yes. There are issues for every game on release. Heck Elden Ring had issues on release. They have fixed the game breaking problems, have been transparent with their plans, and have VASTLY improved the multiplayer side of the game that desperately needed overhauling. If the blood DLC, which I am annoyed with do not get me wrong, is what you are using to justify giving this a negative review then you honestly shouldn't be taken seriously.. I can see the appeal but I just didn't find the game very promising or rewarding. The campaign was uninspiring and the improvements done compared to the previous titles just weren't enough for me to dig deeper into this game.. I rather enjoyed it at the start. But the game turns into a slog. Especially if you dally with the portals. I wasn't ready for the first one and got beat out on the second. It took forever to get my four souls. Date Completed: 2022-04-24 Playtime: 45h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: If you played the first two then you can answer this yourself. I bought a game that is so unfun, it's impossible to play. Campaign is so bad. I loved wh1 and wh2. But this is terrible. Now, many people expect immortal empires campaign to fix this problem. But there is one more issue that, unless changed, also makes the game unfun - minor settlement battles. It's a choir to fight them. If those types of battles were scarce, then yeah, once in a while i could play the choke point infested boring slug fest. But those battles are the majority of all battles. I almost don't get open field battles at all. If its not changed then even Immortal Empires won't be fun. After finishing 4 campaigns, i think i can say that is a very very good game. Nice graphics, nice gamplay, nice difficulties. Ai maybe can be upgraded. Playability is ver nice but the objetive is always the same. I cant understand ""0 points"" critics here when only 0.7% of players have finished Slaneesh campaign, for example. Not a 10 because i want inmortal empires.. I love this series. The campaign is fun, new, and clever. I like really cant wait for the game to merge the maps from Total War: Warhammer 1 & 2. That will be even more fun to explore that will no doubt give me years of fun just like the previous two installments.. It's been so long since I wrote down a review. After all these years, I have wished to type pleasant words. Unfortunately, the gaming industry made huge disappointöment. Especially developers like Creative Assembly, which I'm gonna talk about them and their games. CA betrayed their real total war players. A couple of years ago, they bought Warhammer rights and began to invest in that franchise. Since then, all their historical content falling into decline. They became part of remastering trend like any other developers instead of presenting an entirely new historical game. We 'real' total war players have expected to see Medieval III total war. But the CA insisted to denied that request and never changed the idea of not making this game. The company lost its 'creativity' and truthfulness. Thankfully we have some great dedicated modders. We are able to play historical games despite even the vanilla version being unplayable. (such as total war kingdoms 1212 mod, for attila total war) The latest two historical entries of total war were also horrendous. These games are only playable with mods. Before diving into games themselves, you have to check out Steam workshop. It seems there will be no bright future for historical games. CA's failure to fulfill expectations is really frustrating. Furthermore, don't get me wrong. CA could develop and release Warhammer title I've no problem with that. But in my opinion, that Warhammer addiction of CA ruined real total war games. Not to mention many good other Warhammer games can be found on the market, like Warhammer 40k, which is far better than the CA invention 'total war version. In conclusion, not just CA itself, the whole gaming industry went into decline in the last decade. Maybe they read this feedback (highly doubt it) and reconsider their development and marketing strategy. PS: The good thing about Metacritic review is some edgy kids don't bother me with irrational replies. (yes I'm referring to youtube comments). Great game despite what some of the trolls have been saying on here. Cannot wait for the Mortal Empires 2 map!. Worst of the three parts. Totally unbalance piece of **** Not even acceptable as a dlc. The game is broken. Do not remember when was the last time I have seen such a broken game, cyberpunk 2077 was perfect on release compared to this game. The price is too high for this DLC, and yes it is DLC NOT a new game. Nothing changed including graphic, ugly UI, and same mechanics. Really disappointed, had to return the game.. So this game in its full form with all 3 games, all DLC & factions, ME, fully patched will be a 10/10. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind about that, The release version has its faults but its still an enjoyable experience. There's no other game in this genre that comes anywhere near close to Total war - war hammer. I'm reviewing a 10 for the full package and an 8.5 for the game in its current state. Review trolls below do one.. Its so, so broken. There's so many issues in this game that existed in rome, like 15 years ago, the UI, battle engine, ai strategy engine is all the same. All the issues from the very first game is here, it unbelievable that they are allowed to get away with this,. Edit: After careful consideration (3 campaigns on vHard in, ~50 hours), I can no longer recommend the game. It's buggy. Performance is a joke (looks like WH II, tanks FPS in half), Engine is still old, design choices (rifts) are bad, give no sense of accomplishment when finishing a campaign and actively punish the player for expanding. The AI is still cheating like crazy. Total War AI has always been cheating. I had hopes that Creative Assembly would stop being lazy and a) modernize the Engine (10 Bit, HDR, proper multi core optimization, DX12 features, proper Surround Sound etc) b) give us naval battles c) properly code the AI d) especially fix pathfinding, since that has always been a major problem but in the end all we got is a TW WH II reskin with a new map and a couple minor mechanics (some are just reskins from WH II DLC variants) that tanked the FPS in half. It's a bit of a shame that CA wasn't able to deliver anything of meaning after 5 years of working on this game. The groundwork is old, the AI is still programmed bad, we have no naval battles and the pathfinding and collision system is still broken, also the armor system. Warhammer III deserves better. CA has the money to deliver better. So the question is: Why didn't they? Rift mechanic was fun when I first played a campaign, instantly when I started the second, it bothered me. It's no fun for replay. There should be a button to disable to campaign/rift mechanic, so we can just enjoy some campaign gameplay. And the performance... Warhammer III runs like c","if you like CA's RTS games then you'll like this one . combat is refreshed with leaders and magic, but campaign map stuff is too simple . i tried getting into it, but it felt cheesy and lame ."
971.Fight Night Round 3,"For me this is the best boxing game their has ever been and better than the ones that came after it. The lack of a healthbar and closer camera added a sense of realism lacking in the later games. Roster of fightets could have been better though.. As a kid who didnt care about boxing or any fighting this was so fun for some reason. The combat was just so smooth.. FNRD3 was a great boxing for the time. Being able to customize your boxer was great.. this is iconic! the best boxing game EVER at the achievements 100g man thats also epic too 1000g score for easy fightings!. Fight Night Round 3 is a decent boxing game. The gameplay is solid,with smart AI,good controls,and good balance.However,the judges will f*ck you over constantly in this game! I had 2 fights in career mode which I clearly won,but they gave the other guy the win,which was total **** game also lacks content,with a small number of fighters and career mode,and that's it. The graphics have aged poorly,but the framerate never drops. Sound design and soundtrack are decent. Overall,Fight Night Round 3 is a good game held back by the BS decisions,subpar graphics,and lack of content.. Of the bunch, this is the only one I played, but I liked it a lot. Made my boxer and commenced to laying waste to the AI on my way to obtaining belts in multiple weight classes. I didn't play online or anything because I don't like you and I'd probably get my ass whooped anyway, so I can't comment on that portion of it. If you are into going through people's stuff they don't want anymore while they are watching, you can probably get this for about 25 cents at a garage sale.. Fight Night round 3 is a boxing game developed by EA Chicago and published by ea sports, is this one worth picking up? or should you leave it in the bargain bin Gameplay Their are only a few game modes some being Career, Fight Now, and ESPN Classics In career mode you fight your way to the big title, train in between and try to make it big, fight now is what you would expect it to be you can just go fight espn classics, is where you attempt to relive classic boxing matches. From personal experience you will be spending most of your time in the career mode for that's where its at. The actual boxing mechanics in this game are impeccable you use the right stick to punch and the left stick to move while the face buttons do other things. How it works is you motion the right stick how you want to punch, for example if you want to throw a right jab you push the stick up towards the right side, its very deep and rewarding. 9/10 Presentation Fight Nigh round 3 looks beautiful even though its close to 6 years old now the fighters have great depth and you truly feel like you at a boxing event. The music fits well with everything and when you get hit hard, you can tell. The one complaint I have about the presentation is the announcers they don't have very many lines and can get very repetitive but it never gets to the point where you want to mute your tv. Other than that though its very nice 7/10 replayability Will you be playing fight night over again? well, I would like to think so I have had this game for a long time and I'm still coming back to it, the depth in the fighting is something fantastic and the career mode will have you coming back. 8/10 So in short this game is a great buy, if you haven't picked it up you can from your local game store for under 5 dollars usually and is most assuredly worth it overall rating 8/10 ""Great""","the lack of a healthbar and closer camera added a sense of realism lacking in the later games . overall,Fight Night round 3 is a decent boxing game held back by the BS decisions,subpar graphics,and lack of content . if you are into going through people's stuff they don't want anymore while watching, you can probably get this for about 25 cents at a garage sale ."
973.Bastion,"MISTAKE Remove this review Never tried on Xbox 360 Cannot find delete button for this review. Little bro does not feel fun to play in modern day. Boring ass story with boring ass gameplay with boring ass enemy variety that was only ever good because videogames were worse.. Supergiant games are not for me, but Bastion still had a great ending that actually felt earn for the small amount of game there actually was. Although I did feel like I spend the majority of the time trying to cheese this game than actually learn it.. From the narration to the art design and its accompanying soundtrack, this is a beautifully crafted game.. Bastion is an indie developed RPG featuring beautiful hand drawn graphics and, uniquely, a narrator that comments upon the actions taken by the player. The gameplay itself largely consists of battling through small areas infested with enemies in order to collect ‘cores’ that the protagonist hopes will restore the world following an event known only as the calamity. Thanks to a large selection of upgradable weaponry and abilities, as well as a decent variety of enemy types, there is good depth to this combat ensuring that things don’t really start to ever become too repetitive within the games 6 hour running time. The story is told through the narrator and short cut scenes and, while it is passable, it is certainly to the games benefit that it never becomes too bogged down in trying to explain its plot. Bastion isn't quite up there with the very best Xbox Live games but it is an interesting title nonetheless and worth trying for yourself if you can pick it up for a decent price.. Style over substance, the world building while you walk gets old real fast and very frustrating! The gameplay is average, the story is non-existant, the narrator's voice gets annoying by the end. However, I still had fun for a few hours.. Pretty much just an isometric dungeon crawler. This game was enjoyable but it got it's **** **** a little more than it should have because of a voiceover style that apparently was the best thing ever created since ****. It's alright, but it's certainly no ****.. This is a must have game for any 360 owner! Went back and played through again after finishing the game the first time two years ago. Game still holds up well and is just as much fun. Well worth the $15 price tag! Hoping for a sequel with co-op play!. I love Bastion. It has one of the best soundtracks you'll find, plus a narrator that is unforgettable. The story is also top-notch. Combine that with tons of unlocks, a visually stunning world and fun gameplay and you have yourself a winner. It can be slightly repetitive at times, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a better downloadable game.. The sense of wonder and exploration is eliminated by the world's creation as you play. The context narration is innovative, but could have done without the cheese.. I was originally planning on writing a long, complex review that perfectly captures my love for this game, it's universe, story, and Logan Cunningham (the Narrator). Unfortunately, nothing I wrote could really make the cut and I erased it to write this instead. Don't be dissuaded by some critics calling it a casual romp--while there is a case to be made for that in some ways--this game is deep, emotional, and bittersweet, and flawless where it truly matters; it is a testament to originality, a triumph of narrative excellence, sophistication, and authenticity, and an unparalleled example of charm and beauty in a universe that takes itself seriously. I only wish I played it sooner.. I have yet to complete the game, but even if the ending is somehow disappointing (I do not believe that it will be), I will stand by my score right now because it is one of the most fun experiences I have had with a solo video game all year. It cannot be stated enough just how perfect the score and the narration are, doing more than simply enhancing the experience - without them, the game would definitely be less. The gameplay reminds me a little of one of my favorite NES games - Crystalis. The weapon choices and the challenges for each individual weapon are a lot of fun. The story can be a bit difficult to follow at times, but I think that in part has to do with the confusion the Kid is experiencing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a solid challenge.. This game is what i would consider a close as possible to a perfect game. NO game is perfect, but this game is a close! I can't give a 9.5 /10 so 10/10 is the way to go. Bastion is amazing in every way, It is truly a MUST BUY!. One of my favorite games of all time. Old school, yet still inventive story telling, fun and relatively balanced action, varied enemies, beautiful graphics, and a fantastic and thoughtful experience. I couldn't really ask for much more. Action RPGs make a lot of missteps these days, but Bastion is a game that does it completely right. A must buy, especially for the price.. The polished gameplay and stylish art running to the AMAZING soundtrack makes this one of the best games on XBLA - one of the games that makes me happy I bought the console to begin with.. This game is just plain awesome. I honestly can't find any faults with it. There are a multitude of weapons that can be upgrade and tweak to your preference. The challenges are fun (although some are a massive pain the...). The story is interesting and it actually has replay value because it's just fun to run around in that world. Definitely recommend this game to anyone who has a 360!. Clearly, I just don't get this game. While I LOVED the music and thought the art style was great, I gotta admit that I thought the story was stupid and found the game-play to be boring. Plus, the game is less than 5 hours long which is a little less than I would like for $15.. The gameplay and combat is standard fare for an action-RPG, nothing stood out to me as particularly positive or negative in this aspect. What truly stands out in the game to me is the constant voiceover from the narrator. I found myself intentionally jumping off of cliffs and running around destroying everything just to get different reactions from the narrator. Not only does it provide a quirky and unique aspect to the game, the narration also develops into one of the game's strongest points as the story becomes fully unveiled towards the ending. The storyline is absolutely fantastic.. This is a great, and simple game. It's greatness lies in is simple tale, with solid gameplay. This is a linear level-design platformer with a wide variety of weapons. Don't look for a branching plotline or deep RPG elements here. Most of all, I love the feel of the game. The art, the sounds, the feel of playing it. In this Bastion does right what so many bigger game do wrong. It is a cohesive experience that has a good flow to it. I like big games (ME, Elder Scrolls, etc), but sometimes I just want that simple experience and this game does it to a T.. Bastion shows yet again the ability of XBLA to produce high quality titles. It is relentlessly imaginative and the ever-present narrator is a terrific and original touch. The most striking thing about Bastion is its presenatation. The ground rises beneath your feet against a backdrop of beautiful, sharp visuals. The story may not be the most riveting you've ever heard but the way that it is told (the narrator) definitely is. Combat is satisfying although a bit simplistic but the upgrade adds a little more depth. New Game + gives the game plenty of replay value which means that you are getting a lot of content for your money.. This is most definitely the greatest Xbox Live Arcade game I have ever played. Every aspect of the game flows together so well it is surreal. At first the game seems like an average RPG with a unique art style but quickly proves its mettle. Bastion is not a game, it is a masterpiece. The art style is beautiful and the gameplay mechanics work excellently. The story is the strongest point of the game. The story is told through a narrator that redefines the way games should tell their stories. The game pulls you in through its intriguing story and immersive gameplay. Bastion also has one of the greatest soundtracks I have ever heard in a video game ever. The music helps set the mood, the game seems like a graphic novel almost but instead you are playing it and has many touching moments in the storyline. The game is only 15 dollars but it should cost so much more for the quality of it. Bastion deserves all the hype and if I were to complain about anything at all, it would be the fact that I can never experience this game for the first time ever again.. One of the best games of 2011. Every thing is tied together perfectly, creating a seamless, coherent experience. Everything about the game - the music, the art style, the gameplay - ties into the theme. A perfect, perfect game.. Bastion is, when it's working, a great game. The combat is great and varied, it looks great, and the story really got me thinking. However, it ran very poorly on my Xbox 360 (I have no idea why), took a very long time to load just the start, and then would keep crashing after a certain point of the game. I do recommend this game to anyone as it is quite good, I just hope yours works.. Bastion is, in my opinion, one of 2011's best games yet. Satisfying gameplay, lush and detailed art, immersive music, and an amazing narrator all contribute to Bastion's experience. I would have paid $60 for this game. At $12-15, it's crazy to not own it.. Fantastic game that should be played by all. Really shows what can be accomplished with a downloadable title. At the very least the free demo is worth your time, and good luck not purchasing the game after playing it.. One of the best RPGs I have played. Just wow, my only complaint is that it was a little short, but for 15 dollars it was more than worth it. The soundtrack sent shivers down my spine. The story was thrilling and engaging. The narrator added something no other game has (an awesome narrator.) Simple and fun game mechanics, overall I would have happily paid double for this and still have been satisfied. Well done Supergiant Games for making the best game I have played in a long time. I am praying you guys make a sequel!. loved the fast paced feeling of this mixture of rpg and action. albeit its short campaign the game features two (not too different) endings and a new game plus feature. love the art style too!. Bastion is a charming game with a great sense of mystery. I found myself continuing on not only to find out what was next in the story but also just because i wanted to make my character more powerful or try out the many different weapons and their upgrades. The combat is simplistic yet challenging at the same time. The art and music of the game are simply put, beautiful to experience and i find myself now looking forward to future projects from Super Giant. I'm currently debating buying it again to add to my steam library as well... Great game, brilliant story told in a novel and intriguing way, combat solid, interesting character with good back story, plenty of re-playability. Given the price and how well built it is definitely one of the best games of the year.. Everything that makes up a good games is here and then some and not only it blows my expectation of this game but also blows what I thought about indie genre.. Amazing game. The narrator is awesome to listen to and never felt over bearing or repetitive. The visuals are top notch and the gameplay is great. Can't wait to see the end of this one.. This is the best downloadable title this year as far as Xbox arcade goes. I'll start with the amazing atmosphere to the game, which Bastion must be applauded for. Never have I been so **** into arcade title, and yes the narration is a great part of that. I won't spoil the ending but by the time you get there you feel very much apart of this world. All the decisions you make while not black & white have a different weight to them, you begin to wonder if there is a right or wrong. The game play is spot on hack and slash with a little rpg element care fully added in the form of upgrades and perks. Plus the game + mode only adds to the need to unlock all upgrades. At this point I've played through the campaign 6 times and it still seems fresh. Amazing!. This is easily one of the best games I have played this year. It deserves all the praise it has received and more. Do yourself a favor and go buy this, now!. One of the best games I've played this year. Beautiful art style, tight controls and subtle but effective story-telling result in a magical game. The game has light RPG elements and training areas to mix up the pace a bit. The narration is unique and very well implemented and fortunately the voice actor is outstanding. The music is AMAZING - I bought the soundtrack the day it became available. I've played though this game twice it was so good.. Awesome game. Combat felt great, awesome story and fantastic looking world. Loved the music too - going to buy the soundtrack!!! One of the best indie games that I've played all year.. Game criticism is subjective, at best. So I'll subjectively point out I loved this game. It made me feel something while I played. A conection to it's story, to it's minimal characters but a conection nonetheless. It pushed the right buttons for me and when a game makes me feel more than just ""this is a good game"" or ""this a bad game"", then that's worth something. For me, it's worth one of the best game experiences I've had all year.. Bastion defines what is remarkable about Xbox Live Arcade. Bastion's seven to ten hour experience feels like a steal at fifteen dollars. The story, art style, and fast paced action stand out as some the best this year, regardless of size or platform. It has redefined narration in video games. In the world of Bastion a terrible event known as the Calamity has destroyed the world of Caelondia. You'll play as a silent little guy known only as ""The Kid"". As The Kid journeys through this extravagant world he meets with the compelling narrator Rucks. He assures The Kid that he can fix the Calamity by restoring and activating the Bastion. You'll go through the world collecting pink shards to restore the Bastion to life. When you do this you'll add stores in your hub world such as a forge for upgrades, shrine for idols, and a lost and found for buying additional items. The gameplay is hack and slash combat with some interesting shooting mechanics. The customization really sets it apart from other hack and slash games. You collect blue shards, which is the currency and can level up one of the eleven different weapons. The melee weapons and guns all feel different in their own way. The hammer is powerful, but the war machete is faster. The musket is best for close range crowd control, and the rocket launcher destroys everything including you if one is not paying attention. Any combination of weapons is completely viable. A player can use nothing but guns, all melee, or even just a shield that does decent damage by reflecting and repelling attacks. There is a typical level progression system in Bastion, however its in-game bonuses give it a dungeon crawler loot feel. They are all fairly balanced with very witty names for each. Bastion also has its own challenge room system by activating one or all of the idols of Caeldonia's deities. The player will get more bonuses for defeating enemies, but the risks will greatly increase as each idol is activated. The idols difficulty is quite an increase in difficulty, so try it after you beat the game. When you finish the game there is a new game plus option, which allows all of the player's weapons, experience, and upgrades to continue when he or she decides to start over. The art style and dynamic narration are what really sets Bastion apart from other video game titles. The world of Caeldonia feels like an outlandish fairy tale. The path before you rises to your feet (demonstrated by Magneto in the X-MEN 2 movie). No level looks the same and each one evokes the appropriate mood of where The Kid is in the story. Even the hub world feels like The Kid is about to walk into a magical Disney adventure before every level. The dynamic narration makes the player want to do everything and explore everywhere just to hear the narrator comment on what you're doing. A lot of games have narrators that just speak in cutscenes or during a loading screen, but Bastion's integration of action with real-time commentary is superb. There was never an experience more surreal in Bastion for me than when I was swinging my hammer and destroying things for no reason and the narrator says, ""The Kid just rages for a while."" This kind of attention to detail is what truly defines the uniqueness of Bastion and the joy of playing it. Bastion **** expectations of what downloadable game is assumed to be. The story, art style, and music alone can sell the game. Bastion's minimalist approach for story is wonderful, but a little more backstory would have been nice. The peculiar enemies and the witty humorous writing give the game more personality than it needs. The simple, yet deep combat is easy to learn but challenging to master. It is 15 dollars of fun that rivals other higher priced games.. I highly recommend downloading a copy of Supergiant Gamesâ. Simply one of the best games available right now on the Xbox. Very immersive story, amazingly fun gameplay and excellent art & music direction. I'm happy to shell out $15 to indie developers who are cranking out games of this quality. Amazing and HIGHLY recommended.. The reactive narration of Bastion really sets it apart from other shorter games on XBLA or the Steam Indie games - you actually feel like you're part of a larger story. The art, animation and environmental design is fantastic, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard from a video game in many years - definitely the best from an indie game. The gameplay is fun and satisfying - especially the ranged weapons obtained early on in the story. But what makes Bastion my favourite game of 2011 so far is its seamless blend of story and gameplay. There are almost no cutscenes (and even then, they only last about five seconds), while the rest of the story is told through the player's actions and the ongoing narrative. It's simple, beautiful, fun, and will leave you wanting more. For such a low price, it is a definite must-buy this year. If it wasn't for Minecraft's November release, I would have predicted Bastion to win every Indie game of the year award for 2011.. This game is completely mind-blowing. 10 out of 10 for story, graphics, and dialog; 9 out of 10 for combat; and an overwhelmingly beautiful soundtrack make this the best indie game I have ever played, period. Do yourself a favor and try it out.. Bastion grows on you, like a good book. It can be easy, with a simple yet effective gameplay and it can be hard, very hard (try activating all 10 idols... ), you choose. The art is amazing.. As for the narrator... I wasn't convinced at first, nor by the demo... but after my second run through this game... I love it :).. Utterly charming. Wonderful music, narration and art. The weapons are a lot of fun to play around with and the Shrine's custom difficulty system is an interesting innovation. Best isometric game since LBA2.. I loved it. The narrator is awesome, but the whole world has a great feel. I hope there is a Bastion 2. (why do I have to use 150 characters. I like to be short and to the point. ). Absolutely beautiful game. Highly recommended it, such a beautiful storyline. The narrator is amazing and it's truly an experience I'll never forget.. A seemingly traditional foundation hides an adorable game with both heart and brains. From start to finish I found my self smashing through scumbags and the like with a joy I haven't experienced in games in a long time. The game-play is both solid and intuitive, but the meat of the experience lies in its presentation: the rebuilding world and its witty and grim narrator. This is what makes this game so hard to put down. The story is presented and played out in such a beautiful and fun way that I can't recall any other game this year - Tactics Ogre aside - that it this well. It may not be my GOTY (Tactics Ogre will probably snatch that one), but it very well could be.. Bastion comes as a surprise, and it doesn't let up. Players immediately feel the amount of quality and polishing that has gone into the game play. It is novel, well balanced, beautifully rendered, oozes attention to detail and love. Above all that, the audiovisual style is unique enough to give the genre a refreshing twist. The Story has been treat with equal respect, starts up nice but quickly evolves into a much more subtle and layered world that leaves you wanting for more games to play there. One can only applaud the team for leaving the mainstream industry and becoming founding their own studio, as this level of artisanship will hardly ever be reached by large developers.. It's an XBLA/Steam title from indie developer Supergiant Games. Top-down action adventure. It's biggest claim to fame is that lush art style - and the fact that the story and the levels are narrated to you by a single character who reacts to your actions at a level of detail that rivals the Maddens of the world. It's post-apocalyptic: it takes place in a world that was torn apart by something called the Calamity, and your job is to fix it. The game's visual style is highly abstract, colorful and rich. Dial a dreamscape from a painter's storybook to 11 and you might get something like Bastion. I find it about as gorgeous as a game can get. A key thing to point out is the way the landscape flies in: you start out most levels on a single small island floating in a whirling, colorful void. As you move around, fragments of the level will fly in and assume the expected positions. It supports the core premise: that you're seeing a tale spun to life by someone's vocal storytelling, so many details are missing and you're more getting the gist of it - or maybe it's accurate, and it's because of the peculiar way that the Calamity killed the world. The player can decide. My only complaint about the visuals are the enemy designs, some of which were a bit uninspired. The animations were also one of the low points, although at worst they were mediocre, and they tended higher than that. The developers say that they told their musician that they wanted ""a fantasy frontier world"", and he obliged with a musical style he called â. Fantastic, amazing piece of work. The music, the story, the gameplay, all blends together perfectly to form a beautiful experience like no other game that I've played.. After seeing the giant surge of negative scores, I had to come in and help support Bastion. I do not understand the claim that Bastion is just a ""dungeon crawl."" I've never known a dungeon crawl to be this intense, fast, and vigorous. If anything, Bastion reminds me more of the SNES games I loved playing when I was younger, such as Secret of Mana and Terrianegma. Bastion was a refreshing change from all the games made of muzzle flash and gunmetal grey. Every minute of bastion was a joy.. Best use of 15$. Has definitely skyrocketed to one of my top ten games. It is simply amazing in my opinion. Can't wait to see what the rest of the company has to die for. Even bought the physical copy of their soundtrack. That's how good I found this game guys. Try the demo at least and if you like it get it. If not. That's okay too =). Bastion is a great game all around - the art and music are beautiful, the narrator does an amazing job, and the gameplay itself is incredibly fun! Fast paced action and tight, responsive controls combine to make Bastion an absolute joy to play.. This game was created with more heart than any games of recent. The artwork is stunning, the narration is a creative touch and the music is captivating. These factors add so much to game, yet they do not overshadow the game and the wonderful story that grabs hold of your emotions and doesn't let go. While the RPG elements may not be as apparent as fans of the ""rpg"" genre may want, there is still enough variable gameplay there to make the replay value on this $15 game high. It almost has a Legend of Zelda-like feel to it as far as gameplay goes: variable weapons and upgrades, but with a focus on action and no so much on being a ""true"" rpg. It worked for Legend of Zelda... it works for Bastion. It takes a little getting used to at first, yes, but you almost instantly pick up the style and once you get lost in the story, you won't want to put it down until you've learned all you can about this fabulous world that Supergiant Games has created. They captivate you in even more with the wonderful music of Darren Korb. All of the songs are so fitting for their parts and put you in the mood of the moment, whether it be slower, sorrow-filled pieces or high-anxiety fight scene themes. The music plays a big part in this game. On top of the music, you have the wonderful narration which not only guides you through, but also reacts to your decisions. The narration makes the game the emotional masterpiece that it is. This is a creative new element to the game which tells you the story as it unfolds as opposed to just telling you the whole story and telling you your end-game. All in all, this game is a wonderful experience, especially for the price. If you love being taken away to new worlds with stories like no other that make you actually feel the emotions of the characters, then this is a must.. Beautiful art direction, amazing score, fun gameplay! I enjoyed the heck out of it. Thanks, Supergiant Games, for the most fun I've had with a downloadable title in a while.. Bastion is amazing. The core concept was brilliant and the execution is flawless. When the credits rolled and all I saw were six names, I was floored... not to mention inspired. The aesthetics are absolutely beautiful; it's a living, breathing artwork, and Darren Korb has provided one of the most memorable soundtracks I've heard in a video game in years.. Anyone who gives this game a 0 is jaded and needs to move on. A 0 really?!? Just in atmosphere, art style it deserves a 70. The game is fun, challenging at times for the average player. Stop and smell the roses and ENJOY a game. This isn't Call of Duty where you are just working on getting to multiplayer. This is an experience. 10/10 easily.. One of my favorite games of the year, likely just one of my favorite games. Period. Fantastic combat, art, music (!!!); the narrator is a unique addition that isn't tacked on, but well executed. It's a game I see myself returning to year after year for all those reasons.Including the story actually; by the end I found myself surprisingly invested in it. I can't recommend this game enough, and the cheap price certainly doesn't hurt.. This game is described and promoted as ""role playing"" action/adventure. Reviews have mainly missed the point that this is more of a ""platformer"" with a far away 3 dimensional perspective. You don't get in close, you can't examine areas very much, and you move along a path. This doesn't mean this is a bad game, and if you like an array of weapons and things wack 'em with, you will like the game. Also the art and music is excellent. There is a constant narrator, which some may find irritating after awhile. Ultimately I didn't like the game so much, since I really wanted to spend more time exploring than fighting but that's just me. So for me it's a 6 for the effort, if you like platformers and action give it an 8 or 9.. One of the most entertaining and addictive games I've played in a long time. Great graphics, great, atmospheric music, and the levels are engaging and very unique.. From the moment you enter the world of Bastion, you can tell it will be a unique and fantastic experience. The art style is colorful and atmospheric and the controls and animations are smooth as silk. As you continue the story begins to unfold through a narrator speaking over the action; good voice acting and excellent writing make the action come alive with meaning without any interruptions. Once in the game you will notice how seamlessly the whole experience is woven together. You are never bogged down by lengthy menu or inventory screens, the story never gets in the way of the action, and the unique missions will always keep you guessing. In terms of combat, the experience can be challenging, but never frustrating. You are always equipped with a shield and dodges to stay out of trouble while you use your choice of weapons (all with their own strengths, weaknesses, and available upgrades) and special abilities to dispatch your foes. When everything is said and done, Bastion is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time and well worth the bargain price. Also, pick up the soundtrack if you can, it is beautifully varied and creative. Bastion is an exceptionally fun and memorable Indy action adventure with some heart and soul. The game layout and pacing are good, always allowing players to get back into the action with little slowdown. The way the story unfolds with a commentator commentating on events and the players actions is original and provides some good context to the story. There even are some nice touching moments in the story and atmosphere which may start to pull the emotion strings a little. The graphics and music are very good featuring a nice art style with an original mix of western and anime. The weapons and game play are very fun and its great to have challenges that give the player the chance to get good at all weapons while being rewarded. The game makers of Bastion were really on to something but I cant help but feel that while the story is good, given its potential it could have done more and been truly great and awesome. I also feel that more could have been further done with the emotion felt by the events of the story but how much more can we expect from a small Indy developer? Recommend.. Better than I truly expected. Beautiful would be an understatement. Although very linear through to the end, it was an experience through and through. The story really makes you think. I would have liked it if there were a few more voice actors...there is a bit of inconsistency in the end.. The best Indie game so far, and i played many of 'em. If you like Action RPGs, than this is a must buy. Cool narrator, good story, many weapons and skills, and many cool new and fresh ideas. Pair that with a fantastic soundtrack and gorgeous full HD 2D graphics, and you'll get the best bang for the buck in a long time. And it has a lot of replayability too!. Simply amazing, there are no words to describe Bastion YOU MUST PLAY THE GAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS GREATNESS! The music, the wonderful visuals, the deep characters all bring Bastion into the rank of Legendary. Compared to most AAA titles these days, Bastion is a true breath of fresh air, it takes the bar and launches it straight into the stratosphere. All developers should strive to bring the quality that Bastion has brought forth to the gaming scene.. Overall a wonderful action RPG. However, narration and slow fades are annoying when repeated. It is bizarre that this happens at all in a game so conspicuous about not repeating dialogue. But in the grindy earny portion of the game it happens. That's a minor **** compared to the ending. I'm not going to ruin any of the story, but to have a choice right at the ending does not make your game clever, thoughtful, or in anyway better. Introducing a gimped forced weapon at the end is a **** horrible game decision. Making the section you'd have to repeat to view the multiple endings a slow and unrewarding section is another horrible decision. This is what people are left with at the e","little bro does not feel fun to play in modern day. Boring ass story with boring ass gameplay with boring ass enemy variety that was only ever good because videogames were worse . from the narration to the art design and soundtrack, this is a beautifully crafted RPG ."
974.Devotion,"has a good and interesting story about a family I loved how the game looked as well but it is a walking sim which I know will turn some people away from the game I would still suggest it if you like Horror you can no longer get this on steam but the devs put it on their website so if you are interested buy it there. Abilityto get us hooked and was abit scary. Liked it. this game is eerie, scarry, it gave me a sense of isolation and disgust throughout my 3 hours of playthrough ... Plz support the developers and buy it from their store ... they deserve so much love and support for making this masterpiece!. A truly fascinating and horrifying piece of cultural horror. Devotion tells a remarkably complex story despite its short length, one that puts concepts of love, family, and social dynamics into question the further it goes on. The game itself looks incredible, and the little details put onto textures, sound, and environments make for a distinctly realistic East-Asian atmosphere, one that becomes warped and disturbing as the story unfolds. I do understand that there's a pretty heavy controversy hanging over this game's head. I'm not going to comment on that much as my knowledge of foreign politics -- especially relating to relations between Taiwan and mainland China -- is very minimal. While I can understand the concerns some may have, I do believe there's a fair amount of unjust negative criticism given to the game solely because of the implementation of said controversial subject matter. However, provided the inclusion of said content was done with intent by the developers, I do think it was a somewhat unprofessional move given their understanding of the political climate and the potential backlash that would follow. Quite frankly, the whole controversy seems like a mess on both sides of the argument. Regardless of your feelings on said controversy, I believe the story can still be enjoyed on its own. Apart from the one singular image (which is admittedly hard to find unless you're looking for it), this game has very little to do with politics, and even less so with the modern political landscape. Devotion is instead a much more deep and interpersonal game about many different social issues that were present in 1980s Taiwan, and even still to this day. Its execution is almost flawless, and absolutely deserves more praise now that the dust has settled.. This is barely a game. It's a slow-paced piece of interactive fiction, and sadly not an enjoyable one. The story isn't particularly interesting, it reveals itself very slowly, there are no meaningful choices or significant puzzles. I wasted a lot of time wandering around wondering what the next thing I was supposed to activate was. Maybe other people will be grabbed by a sense of suspense, but I got so little out of this.. Absolute gem ****, amazing story, soundtrack and atmosphere. It's a walking simulator but it doesn't get boring since it's really well paced. I would compare it to layers of fear in terms of gameplay but with a much much better theme and pacing. Really hope more people hear about this game since it was removed from most stores by certain dictator that looks like Winnie the Pooh and it can only be bought from Red Candle's official store. All my support to the developers and I hope they can keep making amazing games.. Nothing extraordinary. If you played any Layers of Fear games or Kojima's P.T. then you know what to expect. Clichéd story dressed up in boring ""gameplay"" (its just walking sim). Devotion had it moments but overall wasn't that good.. Amazing phycologial horror game! Game is short but worth it, it's scary and honestly just really surreal! GOG just removed the game from their store due to some issues with Chinese being ""offended"" by a joke or a small little detail in the game. #FreedomOfSpeech. I want to play it but I can't now all because CD projekt bent over to Chinese nationalists. #BoycottGOG. i tihnk its not horror game so many psychological **** rating overrated.. One of the best horror games to come out in the last decade. Sadly, it's marred by availability problems due to the controversy with the West Taiwanese market being insulted by an off joke in game. Absolutely recommended.. This game was review bombed by brainwashed Chinese idiots, the game is an indie gem, rare to find in an oversaturated market for horror games. Don't listen to those Xi Jing Ping bootlickers, and give it a try.. First i thought 'OMG what is this for a lame game' but as i finished it i was so thankful that i played it. It's a brilliant story, the game understands to drag the player step by step into it. The makers did care about so much details. On top the team proved that they have balls (or ovaries) by sticking here and there gently a stick into the big chickens 4$$. I just hope they are doing well and that they can continue their work! Everyone who is saying that politics or criticism has no place in games does sadly not know what the meaning of free expression is and the reaction clearly revealed the problem. If a dog gets hit, then he will bark.... This is a great horror game, unfortunately I won't be able to play it because chinese people can't take a f**King joke. If I had found a good game that mocks my country (Italy), I wouldn't take it personally like they did, that's childish AF. Learn what irony is before you review-bomb a good product like this, and by the way, Winnie the pooh says he got offended too.. Very scary and immersive horror game. One of the best played in the last years. There are some brain teaser and puzzles during the game that enhance your experience. The anxiety that brings this game is fantastic.. A pure jewel from Taiwan that unfortunatelly isn't easily available. 10/10 fully recommended. if the developer didn't conclude some politics in the game and the game is perfect.. Amazing story thats sad and beautiful. One of the more compelling games I've played that complements grief and horror.. This game was removed from the stores globally beause it contained an innocent joke about China's 'beloved' dictator. I played the game and liked it before this happened. My real vote would be an 8. I vote 10 to compensate forthe brainwashed chinese nationalists who downvoted it.. D to 3D, the superb presentation and storytelling remain intact. A 1980s Taiwanese condo is faithfully recreated in 3D to the extent that you can almost detect the odour. And while. Very sad story, great soundtrack. I will never forget the girl's song, I wanna cry, really.. This is the most recent horror game. I was immersed and enjoyed this game. I made a sound, a mise en scene, and various documents to understand the grief of a family well.. Now this here is a true horror **** story and gameplay are amazing and it shows what can happen's if you are too devoted on the wrong things. It is really ridiculous to judge a game simply on one easter egg. The game is great. Stop review bombing and grow up.. Good horror game with great art and amazing sound performance! There are no complex puzzles, long and boring explorations. Conversely, just right length of play time so that you can taste the implied story but do not lose your fear. Finally, Let me cite the comment from Milkdoggy ""don't care about negative comments about political issues. It all begin with an easter egg make fun of Xi, JinPing (President of the China ), and we all know what problems China have."". Great game, and please never mind the Chinese butthurt puppets. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with the game. We can make fun of our leaders, and yours. Welcome to freedom.... This is a horror game with poetic but bitter story. As a father who have a daughter, I left my tears while looking at the Ending scenes. The art and music in this game are epic. Atmosphere is quite good because the designer bring the whole 1980s life style in Taiwan into the game. The only flaw is the loading time. When you open the doors that represents different years, it takes you loading for a while, which seems like a technical problem that should not exist in modern games (I am not a game programmer, maybe it's a trade off for poor equipment players ). By the way, don't care about negative comments about political issues. It all begin with an easter egg make fun of Xi, JinPing (President of the China ), and we all know what problems China have.","devotion is a fascinating and horrifying piece of cultural horror . it tells a remarkably complex story despite its short length . it's execution is almost flawless, and absolutely deserves more praise ."
975.Sonic Mania,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it's one of the best classic sonic games but if only sega make in the future a game in this quality with brand new levels just like sonic 3&k it won't be only the best classic sonic game but it will be one of the best games of all time.. Good Sonic game. Good Product. Good Gameplay. Good Art style. Good Levels. Good Mods. Good Bosses . Good Box art. Good length of Sonic’s Quils. Good homeless person near my nearest gas station who gave me a broken disc of this game.. Masterpiece, the ost and artstyle are incredible, they should make more games like this. While retaining some of the original flavor and charm of the original trilogy of games, unfortunately this game simply has too many old stages, zones that drag on for far too long, and overall general lack of quality consistency or care put into it. While showing some promise, ultimately this ends up being an extremely dissapointing game.. (I didn't play the Genesis games until after I played Mania. So nostalgia doesn't really have an effect on me when it comes to this game.) Great level design that encourages speed while also throwing in fun platforming and exploration, amazing music and graphics, easily the best special stages in Sonic history, and a great selection of levels. The drop dash is also one of the best things ever put in a Sonic game. My only issue is that most of the levels are from the classic Sonic games and not new (8 out of the 12 zones are old). The 4 new zones are so great that I just wish more of them were new. The old stages are still a blast to play though. (Also, come on, Green Hill again? Where's the love for Emerald Hill??) Overall, for $20, you can't beat this game. If you need your 2D platforming fix, Sonic Mania has you covered.. I'm glad that a good Sonic game finally came after all this time but ai feel like the controls are really bad. While you have built Momentum, I feel like the track is made to stop you because you have to keep constantly changing direcrions but you can't react fast enough to keep the momentum. I guess you have to learn the stage good and play it many times though, but it feels more like control problems other that a mechanic in the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game looks like old sonic games. I love old sonic games my favourite game is sonic and knuckles.Mario ****. SONIC MANIA IS AMAZING. opening cutscens are flawless and while there only like 4 original stages they are very well designed and you can tell this game was made with passion. Sonic forces:ALLOW US TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES. A fun game, that im just not very passionate about, like at all, I like it but I just dont care. It’s a good throwback to previous sonic games. However, the blue sphere levels are just intentionally hard for no reason and they force you to replay them over and over again and it’s a little underwhelming.. To call this the best Sonic game is an understatement. This is the only good Sonic game since the 90s. The only good Sonic game besides Sonic 2 and Sonic 3.. Great sequel to Sonic 3. It perfectly emulates the look and feel of the old genesis games. Some stages are reused but altered so I'm not complaining. The game is slow at times and could've had more but still. It's a fun game. i have no words. this game is perfect. nothing beats it. 10/10. freaking perfect.. Wow what a game. Feels like the best 2d sonic game in forever. New and old levels unite with a great art direction. Love the character additions and new modes. Its probably a top 5 sonic game OAT.. Sonic Mania is one of those games that earned audience praise immediately as the trailer came out. Pretty much everyone was happy about Sonic returning to form, and going back to his 2D roots. On top of that, Tails and Knuckles joined him and together they all made us forget about Sonic 4 **** say Mania is a love letter to the original trilogy is an understatement, but one that I absolutely have mixed feelings on. While I understand everyone getting excited about seeing Sonic go through the same iconic stages he did in the past, I wasn't exactly happy with it. Mostly this game felt like it was hitting the same beats and motions as if I was playing the older games, and not in a way I enjoyed. Once I hit Studiopolis I knew exactly what the problem was, and that was how stilted Mania felt to me compared to when it could do something original. Studiopolis is an absolute banger of a level, with theming, level design, and music. It really is just stunning how so different yet same Stuiopolis feels, and hit that exact wonder that I wanted to feel for this game. Sadly I can't really say the rest of the game follows suit to that, and by no means is it considerably a bad drop, just one that didn't appeal to me.Along the way though, Mania absolutely crushed it with the 2 new additions to the Sonic formula, with Drop dash and the new special stages. Drop dash is an amazing addition, and something that helps keep the momentum of Sonic levels going when you feel you are about to lose them, which is both appealing to newcomers and veterans alike. Meanwhile, the new special stages are a fun take of Sonic CD's special levels, but far more tame and easier to manage. On top of that, Mania's special stages lend themselves well to revisits, as often the chaos emeralds take a while to get to full speed and thus makes them easier to capture.Overall, Mania is just kinda inoffensive to it's audience. There is a glimmer of what we could have gotten with Studiopolis, but largely I felt wanting for more original stages and less revisiting the past. The new mechanics are a great addition, but they simply don't hold my attention to want to play this game more.. Classic sonic at its best. There is little to say about this game, other than amazing.. Best sonic game ever everything about it is perfect it just hits different there is no bugs. This is a best classic sonic game ever. the best 2d sonic game. rolling around at the speed of sound. This game this **** absolute masterpiece this was!,tee lopes you've outdone yourself with one of the best ost of ANY video game ever made dude!,and the level design OH MY GAWD THE LEVEL DESIGN! this level design has the best level design out of any 2D sonic game period!,there are so many paths and routes to explore to beat the level and its so satisfying to find extra lifes you've never gotten before and this game is so good at mixing the levels with speed ans exploration and this game shows us 2D sonic games done **** the story may be meh but you do not need good story's for your game to be good,Anyway best(classic sonic) 2D game in the series not a single bad level at all better than sonic 3&k FIGHT ME! the only thing sonic 3&k does better is the story thats **** the last thing is thank you so much christian whitehead,head canon, and pagoda west for making one of the best video games ever made!. Love it. the sonic franchise was good with this game until forces came out. One of the best Sonic games. It's a overall great game and it really nails the classic era well. And improved on the physics great with the characters. It's a definitely must try game.. I grew up playing the 2D Sonic games on the Sega Mega Drive so when I saw this on PS Plus I jumped at the chance to get it and I can happily say that Sonic Mania is an excellent modern 2D Sonic game. While it’s not quite as good as the original games (partially due to nostalgia but also Sonic 3 & Knuckles was an outstanding game) it’s nostalgic enough that it keeps people like me happy and it’s also a great game by itself. If you grew up with the Mega Drive Sonic games like me then definitely give this a go!. I was really hoping on liking this game, and I did, until the 4th world. Then I started liking it less and less. I’m gonna anger a lot of fans, but it’s my opinion… My first complaint is towards the hard-boiled heavies. They have no personality. They could’ve had cutscenes that reveal their traits, but NOPE! They just reuse the same sprite but resizing and recoloring it. And this is a really minor problem I have, the first one you encounter (heavy gunner) is a mini-boss, but the other 4 are end of zone bosses, just make up your mind! Speaking of bosses, They feel out of place in what’s supposed to be classic Sonic. Take the boss of Hydrocity (who wanted that zone back?), You’re supposed to touch the bombs he spits out to kill him, and it takes about a minute to do that. Let’s compare it to the boss of Marble from Sonic 1, he spits out fire, and you have to hit him 8 times, Do you get the boss over with for time points, or play it safe for more ring points? That was the charm of the classic bosses, you could approach them any gamer type could handle. But here, you have to wait for their attack cycle to finish then hit them. In short the (act 2, at least) bosses just take to long for classic Sonic standards. And for me, the absolute worst part about the game are the special stages. WHY do people consider them the best in the franchise? AM I MISSING SOMETHING!? You have to run after this UFO that’s carrying a chaos emerald, but everything moves so fast and you move all over the place. They decide to put obstacles in the way that decrease your timer, so when you hit them with 20 or so rings left, you pretty much just lost. They seem less like special stages and more like pure luck. I wouldn’t play them twice let alone 7 TIMES. The sad part is that the other special stages aren’t all that bad. WHY DIDN’T THEY JUST SWAP THESE SPECIAL STAGES WITH THOSE ONES!? In short, Sonic mania was disappointing for me. With it’s flat characters, bosses that overstay their welcome and ATROCIOUS special stages. Better luck next time, Sega.. Sonic Mania is the best Sonic game since the original Sonic trilogy and Sonic CD. This is what Sonic 4 should have been. I skipped it Sonic Mania on release as every Sonic game I've played in the past 2 decades has been trash, but when Sonic Origins released (a remaster collection of Sonic 1,2,3 and CD) I found Sonic Mania mentioned as comparison reviews a lot, so decided to give it a try. It truly feels like a Sonic game that could've released in the 90s, it fits within the original trilogy so well that I'll always consider this the spiritual Sonic 4.. This game is too difficult and boring, I really don't know how can be so acclaimed. Levels are not fun at all, the lives system is one of the worst thing someone can pick from the old games and levels are no sense of direction. I just had a frustrating time playing it.. A Sonic game where you feel really free to run and explore. A Sonic game class.. A great return to form. Although, I wish there were more original levels instead of reused ones.... A Good Sonic game, nostalgic, solid, very fun! Is one of the best Sonic Games, but not the best.. how could you hate this game ejwbfejwbfvcbedvedknvkdnsvknewnvkoieifgewgvnesdwnvgioewnig. Best 2d sonic I can’t stop playing even better then super mario world my old favourite 2d game. Perfect level design perfect gameplay good atmosphere a lot of content the only criticism i have is that some ideas are over used. Soulless, no substance, no passion, and no reason to exist. Sonic Mania is a disgrace to both the Classics, and the franchise as a whole. Play Sonic 1 or 3 instead, they won't waste your time or your patience.. I don't like Classic Sonic at all, I think it's a bunch of gacha trap BS, that tells you to go fast and then punishes you for going fast with off-screen hazards and spikes that hurt you from the side, so I consider it to be some feat when Sega and Christian Whitehead can make a Classic Sonic game I actually like, hell, one I love. Sonic Mania is a joy to play from the controls to the level design to the music, it's all fantastic. Sonic Mania is about Dr. Eggma- Robotnik? is he Robotnik here? I'll just call him Eggman to be safe, anyway Dr. Eggman using the Phantom Ruby to screw with Sonic and... Do something, it's Sonic it doesn't matter. This is used as an excuse to have Sonic, Tails or Knuckles play through Sonic 1, 2, 3, CD and new levels, but mostly old levels, which is a shame because the new levels rock, Studiopolis comes to mind, god that song is so good, but old levels have been remixed and they feel great, hell this game made me like Chemical Plant Zone, I hate Chemical Plant Zone normally but here it's great especially Act 2. Gameplay wise it's great, Sonic doesn't feel to slippy nor too stiff, he feels perfect. Bonus Stages make a comeback here and THANK GOD IT'S NOT THE HALFPIPE, no instead it's the Ball collecting and Emerald Chasing bonus Stages and they're both good, I know the Balls make some people feel sick but I never got that so... ha. I know there's like a whole extra boss and ending if you get all the chaos emeralds but I don't feel like doing that and I like the normal ending better anyway, it doesn't lead into Forces so I can keep this Sonic pure and away from that garbage. Boss fights are pretty good, I didn't struggle with any except the final Eggman boss, it can be quite confusing knowing when to attack, if you're meant to hit him while the electric is on and avoid the tentacles or kill the bosses he throws at you with the hands, and even when you figure out it's just after the electric stops you have to get the timing down. It's not unbearable nor is it even really THAT difficult, but it stood out to me as being pretty irritating first time. Speaking of difficulty the game is fairly easy overall, not TOO easy, but easy enough that somebody who couldn't beat Sonic 2 (me) can beat it no problem, Oil Ocean can be... Oil Ocean, but it's the only one that gets kind of obnoxious. Now that music, goddamn Tee Lopes outdid himself, if like me you're a fan of SomeCallMeJohnny you'll be familiar with Lopes' work, and man does he bring his A-game here, I brought up Studiopolis earlier but it's far from the only one, the entire game is full of great tracks and it makes the game even more fun to play. Sonic Mania is a great game, a wonderful game, and I think Christian Whitehead should be in charge of any Classic style games going forward. Now if Frontiers can redeem Modern Sonic after Forces and Colours Ultimate we may be entering a new Sonic Golden Age, god I really hope Frontiers is good.... Sonic Mania is one of the best Sonic games I've ever played, no doubt, but after a few repeated playthroughs, it gets kinda boring. I would recommend it to you either way. I still prefer Sonic 3 & Knuckles tho.. The resurrection of the classic game. The new game, created with respect to the legacy, has captured fans both past and present.. this is the Perfect Celebration to Sonic its Perfect unimaginable soundtrack the Wonderful Graphics ALL ITS EXCELLENT. Sonic is back baby! This is the best Sonic game in a very, very long time. It’s probably the best Sonic game since Sonic 2. Every part of this game is crafted with love to the smallest detail, old levels return but are revamped in this new style where there’s more paths and larger worlds for you to explore as either Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Sonic and Tails together. Where this game really shines though is it’s new levels where modern game design and old school Sonic mesh for some new experiences really comes to life! This, more than anything gets me excited for a new Sonic game from this team where they get the freedom to craft a totally new Sonic experience! If you have played Sonic as a kid or never played a Sonic game before this game really stands the test of time as the great gameplay and fantastic levels carries this game more than anything else! Everyone that likes platformers HAS to play this game!. Just a fun game a great return to the classic games and is just a fun sonic game no over done story or anything just a pure and fun game and is a must own game if you like platformers or the classic games of back in the day. this game is good and the music is perfect and the frameworks well in PS4 and in every final stage there are an boss to fight but the problem with the bosses it is they are very easy, so if you like platforming games so go and buy it.. The best sonic game not because it does anything new, but because it rediscovers what made it special to begin with. This game is a victory for everyone who loves video games. Sonic mania is a fantastic game that brought the classic 8 bit 2D game play back. This game is absolutely fantastic and brings back the classic feeling of Sonic games . It has a variety of levels and each level plays differently based on the character you re using... Best Sonic Game I’ve played. Incredible job that plays like the genesis titles.. I think this game is not bad. But they added a lot of old levels. It spoils everything. You can make it a little better if you use mods. I put 5 of 10.. Sonic Mania is both an homage to and continuation of the classic Mega Drive games, and is crafted well enough to satisfy any long time fan of the series. The gameplay is nearly identical to the original games, (especially 3&K) adding only a few new ways of traversing the levels. The nostalgia pandering could be said to be the games biggest asset and it's biggest flaw, as the familiarity makes it instantly recognisable as the ""true"" Sonic 4, while too many of the levels are just revisiting the ones we've already played in earlier games (some questionable choises of such levels were made in my opinion - such as Oil Ocean). The changes include a lot of new gimmicks, which are slightly too numerous at times and hurt the flow of the gameplay. The boss fights have been greatly overhauled to be more intricate and many of them are quite tricky the first time around, but once you learn their pattern most of them get ridiculously easy during later playthroughs. Definitely a great game and well worth its price, but you can tell it's basically a glorified fan game (which to be fair, it is) and I don't think it's quite on the same level as its Mega Drive counterparts, especially not the afforementioned S3&K.. Sonic is a brilliant game is the game we so deserve after Sonic boom this game is a must !!!! For anyone who loves Sonic series is Sonic's best game in my opinion and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has not bought the game.. Does what Generations does well: celebrates Sonic. This time, rather than the whole series, Mania celebrates the era of Classic 1990's Sonic the Hedgehog. While, I wish there were more new zones, the game is just filled with passion and heart, something that recent Sonic games have been severely lacking. Definite recommendation to any Sonic fan and to anyone who played the games on the SEGA Genesis back in the day.. a tribute to old fans, with classic levels well updated and incredible new levels. Beautiful and detailed graphics in 16 bits and a good challenge, saved the Sonic franchise in this generation.. Sonic Mania brings together everything I can enjoy in the Sonic series, and removes almost everything that pisses me off in it. Excellent level design. The best blue hedgehog game!. Worth a run. Good free game on psn plus. It is a bit dated. Slightly boring. Let me quickly answer the inevitable: when watching that 25th Anniversary event for “Sonic the Hedgehog” at Comic-Con in 2016, did I, a born-in 3D gamer merely watching (or, half-watching while playing “Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time”) to get a look at the next 3D “Sonic” title, really expect that the best thing to come from that event would be a game that was essentially an amalgamation of 2D-era “Sonic” stages re-done for a new generation? No way, man, I was all about that totally-not-abhorrent Totino’s Stuffed Nachos product placement (which, I…admittedly fell for because I tried the Stuffed Nachos and…I honestly liked them). But in all seriousness, I was so intrigued (and, to some degree, confused) by “Project Sonic 2017” (which later became “Sonic Forces,” of course) to the point that “Sonic Mania” kind of faded into the background for me. I’d honestly forgotten about it until it was confirmed for a Nintendo Switch release some time later at the Nintendo Switch Presentation in 2017. Little did I know at the time that I’d not only have more fun with “Sonic Mania” than “Sonic Forces,” but that I’d come to see “Sonic Mania” as one of the most rip-roaring, off-the-wall, and best Sonic games I’ve played. “Sonic Mania,” through and through, is a love-letter to the “Classic Era” of “Sonic the Hedgehog,” and even the tiniest details scream out “passion.” The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, the game is just bursting with vibrant colors and great attention to detail, and the overall art design is just a marvel to observe. The music, as is the case with many “Sonic” games, remains catchy, immediate, and all-around fantastic, and it’s great to see that the music feels fresh, while retaining the spirit of what made these original songs so iconic. And the gameplay is equally fantastic: the physics are refined, the speed and platforming are mostly great, and while the game does spend a good bit of its time kicking you in uncomfortable areas with its difficulty, it’s still so easy to become hypnotized by the game’s clever and inventive level design that serve to remind us why the 2D “Sonic” games were such compelling competitors to the “Super Mario Bros.” games back in the fourth generation of gaming. I will say there are a few things holding this game the smallest bit back: while it’s a loving re-creation of 2D “Sonic,” it does bring about several of the frustrations and annoyances from that era, which means the game still suffers from annoyances that stem from the “trial-and-error” style of gameplay, as well as the overly-frustrating bosses that almost seem to have “fake difficult” written somewhere on them. Also, maybe this is me making a mountain out of a molehill, but I can’t be the only one frustrated that, if you get a “Game Over” in Act 2 of a Zone, you’ll HAVE to play and beat Act 1 again, right? Sega, if you plan to make another game in this style, please remove that feature. I appreciate the commitment to faithfulness, but refinement is a nice thing, too. All things told, though, “Sonic Mania” is easily one of the best “Sonic” games that I’ve played in a while, and perhaps one of the best games in the series. It may be odd saying that about a game like this, but this is nearly everything a “Sonic” game should be, and while I’m not sure if Sega is going to continue to try their hand at new 2D “Sonic” experiences, I can definitely say “Sonic Mania” lays a great foundation for them if they plan to keep going with it. Final rating: 9 out of 10 “Awesome”. I was blind after **** playing dis game, this is so sickeningly. Epilepsy **** warning. Sluggish and unresponsive controls when it comes to bonus stages , it feels rigged. Pretty damn awesome that's all I can say because no other words can do this game justice. Read my Sonic Mania Plus on PS4 review for more details. Sonic Mania is an amazing Sonic game that has to be one of the best Sonic games released in years. This game is a fantastic celebration of classic Sonic that has fantastic gameplay, amazing level design and an awesome soundtrack. If you're a Sonic fan, please buy this game. Special thanks to the team of fans that developed this fantastic Sonic game.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. A splendid throwback to the Classic era of Sonic with the uncanny look and psychics returning. It's obvious that so much passion went into this project. What I love the most about this game is the set of brand new stages. What holds it back is how most of this game is covered into repeated stages and boss fights. I'm under the impression that Sega ordered most of the levels being heavy on nostalgia-pandering for good measure. With that, I can't call it a ""true"" successor to the Classic era and I certainly won't call it the best Sonic game ever.. This, in my opinion the best series of the Sonic game. Gorgeous work of the game, and the connection from old locations, improved music, animation, levels, but I realized the plot with difficulty.. Its A Great Return To Classic Sonic With Plenty Of Rewards To Getting Everything In The Game. The Sonic the Hedgehog Franchise has had a rocky road with successes and failures and this time it feels that SEGA have finally accomplished what they've been trying to do for so long and that is bring Sonic back to his former glory. This game offers an amazing blend of both old and new with classic zones such as Green Hill and Chemical Plant whilst also offering refreshing new experiences with zones like Studiopolis and Press Garden. The game is packed with bosses ranging from fan favourites like Metal Sonic and the Death Egg Robot as well as a surprising appearance of the Mean Bean Machine. But with so many bosses, this brings up my only real complaint which is that some of the sub bosses feel forgettable. In the future I would love to see more of games like Sonic Mania and soon Sonic could be put back on track. This is the best Sonic game of all time for many reasons, the level design, the gameplay, and music are just a couple. play this game now!!!. this game was the best sonic game in years but if i had any problems with this games is just a few glitch that happens to me like when i played as knuckles and the fact im still waiting to play with mighty and ray all in all this game was a solid 10/10. its everything you grew up playing just with better tricks and level designs..boss battles are great. Sonic mania is a good game. The graphics are amazing, gameplay is tight and fair and the music is just ok. The 20€ price tag is amazing, even though there isn't anything to compell you after the end. It took me about a week to finish the game 100%, trophies and all. I finished the game on three separete save files with 3 separete characters, with all the chaos emeralds on each one with all the gold medals. After that, I only popped the game up to mess around in debug. There was nothing else to keep me coming back. Sonic mania is a 3 time wonder. Also the callbacks and referances are epic for long time fans!. The game was beautiful, well done and memorable, I'm very happy that a 2D game was able to surpass and be even better than a 3D game full of Hype. I was hoping that Sonic Forces would please me more, though, only Sonic Mania pleased me in 2017. The game is inspired by its level design, the songs are stupendous and the creative Bosses. The only negative thing about the game was the little addition of new phases, but still the experience was how I first played Sonic again!. I got this for the 2-player competitive mode that first appeared in Sonic 2. That mode remains pretty fun, with the drawback that you have to play each level in 1-player before you can play it 2-player competitively. This is dumb, particularly since this is tied to each player profile. The 1-player game is pretty meh. Gone are the digestible levels of Sonic 1&2 -- now the levels are crazy long, and yet they kept the 10-minute timer. I don't have fun exploring these levels because they're so long, winding back and forth, so I just want to get to the end and be done with it. I was also hoping for the slot machines from Sonic 2 Casino Night Zone. I don't believe those have returned.. Yes, It's a sorry moment that Sonic Forces is a bad game at any cost, but at that time Sonic Mania is different. Sonic Mania is a, well, it's the 4th 16-bit genesis Sonic game to say the ĺeast. With intense level designs and great gameplay. Sonic Mania is by far the best Sonic game out there. When you get ahold of this game you'll be in heaven, great game great graphics, and just filled with nostalgia.. Sonic Mania sees a much needed return to form. Similar to what sonic 4 tried and failed to achieve, Sonic Mania is great fun and does take you back to the old days while adding more things as to give it its own spin. It's clear the fans made this sonic game, but there is nothing wrong with that. My only real problem being the lack of new levels, as we get to see green hill zone for the 5oth time and more. But the game does make an effort to keep the levels fresh by adding new elements. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing sonic game that we been waiting for years. best classic sonic game, amazing music, fun gameplay and bosses. It's one of the best sonic games ever.. Kick of nostalgia! This game brings me back 20 years to when i was 11 playing my genesis Sat mornings in my TMNT PJs. I loved Sonic 1-3, especially 3! SM does everything right and improves on the originals. Playing those first couple zones made me smile as I got to replay some of those levels i enjoyed so much as a kid. Not only did they bring back originals the devs added to them and made their own. The music sets the mood and the game play is smoother then ever. Those new end level boss fights are epic and the mini boss fights are just a lot of fun! The mini games of collecting the blue orbs was just as hard as when I was a kid and they added some new ones that are innovative enough enjoy. Im looking forward to SM2, Sega is back! PS I bought the collectors edition that comes with the sonic statue, even though the plastic feels kind of cheap it looks pretty awesome!. This classic sonic game is the best classic sonic game by far! The graphics are very awesome! Definitely brings back the classic sonic feeling. Thank you, SEGA for making this game a reality!. Good game but Sonic 3&Knuckles was better in my opinion. i am a bit bias though because Knuckles is my favorite character and he just isn't nearly as fun to play as in mania in my opinion.. To put it simply, this is the best Sonic game of all time (thus far). The game-play mechanics feel perfect, just as they did on the Mega Drive / Genesis titles. The graphics are retro looking while being a smooth 60fps. The game controls much like it did in Sonic 3 & Knuckles, for all characters, with the exception of the new drop-dash maneuver for Sonic. The level design is simply great. There are less enemies than in older Sonic games but this has meant that you can build more momentum leading to greater speed, which to me, is a reasonable trade-off. The game has a lot of replayability; I've played this game through 9 times now and still want to go back for more! If there is not a sequel, then there is grave misjustice in the world!. Sonic Mania is a pure masterpiece that has been brought to us. Sonic Mania combines everything great about the classics while bringing its own creative spin on it, with improved physics, visuals, and even music. Sonic Mania proves to show the classics can still be in style. Mania's gameplay is a blast, with Christian Whiteheads perfectly made physics and amazing level design Mania is truly a wonder to behold. Sonic Mania's inclusion of tails and knuckles enhances this experience and makes each and every level a new experience, which in turn makes the replay ability amazing. Sonic Mania has minor flaws however the positive is completely outclassed by negative, you will find yourself having a blast from the stages, to music, to visuals, to gameplay, Mania proves sonic still has a lot of fire in him ready to be pushed out.. Probably the best Sonic game out there. Excellent level design, excellent music. Almost perfect, but a bit too much reliance on past Sonic games, and the bonus stages are not that much fun - would have been better to have bonus stages like in Sonic 3 etc, that award items. Online co-op play would have been great. Still, one of the best platformers you can buy.. Sonic Mania is a great Sonic game probably not better that most of the 3D games but pretty fun and awesome the redesigned stages are nothing like the past games and feel pretty new and the special stages are so fun and even better than th","great level design that encourages speed while also throwing in fun platforming and exploration . the 4 new zones are so great that i just wish more of them were new . overall, for $20, you can't beat this game ."
976.The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures,"Not the best , very much prefer the GBA prequel. Can be very repetitive and at this was not the Zelda game people wanted at the time of release.. A great game, a lot of surprising faces show up, and a basic story with many elements -1 point for the one stages with the water, my perfectionist ass brain spent like an hour making sure I put out every flame. Definitely the best multiplayer game. Definitely the best multiplayer game.. This is the worst zelda game imo (besides the games that shall not be named) it’s neat to see Wind Waker bosses in 2D and the story is good. But with such a large barrier to play it with 4 players. A GameCube, 4 GameBoy advances, and the adaptors to go with them. It’s more likely you’ll be playing the game alone which isn’t a great experience as all the puzzles are multiplayer focused. It was a neat idea on paper but in practice it’s a mess of wires and usually results in turning off the game in favor of Mario kart, Mario party, or smash.. This game is very interesting. I enjoyed it a lot. It actually has great challenges and puzzles even though I thought it would be easier that the main entries. I highly recommend it.. fantastic game with impressive multiplayer one of the best zeldas you can play with up to 4 friends very good. I've had good fun with friends while playing this game (played with 3 since our 4th never could make it). The fun comes from the friendly competition of gem collecting/stealing and the (mostly) solid level design throughout. However as this game progresses it becomes more and more tiresome to play. Levels stretch longer and longer, some being easily over an hour long, and if you ever end up quitting, or your GBA batteries run out, it's over and you'll have to start from the beginning of the level when you next play it. Many levels play out similarly and I often found myself questioning why we weren't playing a more fun co-op game, since there are so many others out there. I remember a session where we spent the whole time playing 1 level in world 6, my GBA ran out of batteries so we lost it all, making no progress for the day. I only really stayed because of my friends. They seemed to have a better overall time with it than me, so maybe there's value that I'm just not seeing? Don't go through the hassle of setting it all up, even if you're lucky and have the GBAs + GC like us.. Really cool game. Awesome gameplay. Makes a lot of fun but is by far not the best Zelda game.. The only thing that Four Swords Adventures has as a drawback is its the way it utilizes local multiplayer. For 2-4 Players you need the following: 1) 2-4 Game Boy Advance systems and 2) 2-4 GBA-to-Gamecube cables If you can obtain this setup, the game is one of the greatest multiplayer experiences on the system; an excellent co-op 2D Zelda game with graphics and mechanics similar to ""A Link to the Past"" and ""The Minish Cap"". Played this a lot with friends and cannot describe how much fun we had.. This game was made for trolls, I'm not sure what Nintendo thought would happen if you take four friends together and have them try to solve puzzles together but it does not turn out that well, not saying the game is bad by any means, just that my friends would end up killing me nonstop and that's all that would ever get accomplished. I think this game has way more potential than people realize. The only sad part about this game is that you were required to have gameboy adapters and that just caused the entire game in itself to be a hassle to hook up, I do like the idea of using the screens on the gameboys individually when you go inside certain dungeons or buildings though. I was also a huge fan of the ds version of this game that they did. This games are so fun and honestly I am a little sad I never had friends to play the 3ds version, that one looked like fun. I hope they make one for the switch though.. I say that this game is FANTASTIC it may be hard to set up but its not a waste of money you get the best experience by playing it with your friends (if you have any), it shares tons of assets from Link To The Past which is a good game don't get me wrong but this game is better the only thing about this game that disappoints me is why no remake? its just wrong to not have a Gamecube Gem not have a remake of some kind and if that does happen give it online multiplayer it is a grand experience the whole way through it is amazing the whole way through oh yeah its not a Zelda game without puzzles this game is chock full of challenging puzzles that are confusing this game is just incredible. It's the return of the 4 twinks in Four Twinks 2: Twinks Harder, but minus 3 because I still don't have any friends. But anyway, for some **** reason I need a gameboy to play this gamecube game, as if the government needs another god damn peripheral to spy on me and make sure I'm doing what the shadow masters told me. ELIMINATE AL GORE ELIMINATE AL GORE ELIMINATE AL GORE, but anyway, 0 out of ****g 10 because I couldn't make the disc balance on my wiener. Ted Cruz is actually a human sized dragon being that hates porn.. Four Swords Adventures if fast paced and very entertaining. Who cares if the graphics aren't 3D. They do look good and the controls and story are good as well.. This is an absolute masterpiece of local multiplayer. I hope the 3ds can get a sequel soon with online multiplayer. The only bad thing about is all the Gameboy cables. I got **** ton of them hanging around so I wasn't worried. The adventure is epic and its a great merge between Wind Waker and A Link to the Past. The game kept me excited from beginning to end.. Excellent on single player. Graphics and sound are incredible. It's retro like if a sequel to Link to The Past were released on 32bit (PSX/Saturn). I feel so dumb not having this game before. No Gba or extra cables are needed to singleplayer. The mission structure gives this one a Arcade-ish gameplay, with more challange than your usual Zelda, and no endless storytelling. The only reason not giving this a 10 is that I cannot play the multiplayer. And I envy those who did play 4-player.. It may be one of the most difficult games to organise (every player needs their own GBA and link cable) but Four Swords Adventure is one of the most enjoyable co-operative, and sometimes competitive, multi-player experiences available on home consoles. Imagine a four player version of A Link to the Past and you aren’t far off. Each player controls their own different coloured Link using their GBA, when they enter a building or cave for example the play switches to their GBA and no one else can see what they are up to. Working together is therefore vital to solving the games puzzles as well as defeating the toughest enemies. Brilliantly however each player is also trying to collect as many gems as possible for themselves. This leads to some fantastic moments when, having just spent twenty minutes working together to proceed through a level, all friendships are forgotten as you throw your mate of a cliff in order to collect the 200 rupee gem that has just been discovered. As a single player experience that are better Zelda games available but if you can find three GBA owning mates Four Swords Adventure is a game not to be missed.. Want to play a great game with your friends? Have a Wii or a Gamecube sitting around? Perfect! Look into any other game BESIDES this one! In order to play with friends you will need 4 GameBoy Advance's and 4 GBA to GameCube link cables. Everyone has that sitting around right (sarcasm)? Now I remember why I never played this back in 2004. THIS GAME WILL NOT PLAY WITH 4 REGULAR GAMECUBE CONTROLLERS! Thanks Nintendo!","it's more likely you'll be playing the game alone which isn't a great experience as all the puzzles are multiplayer focused . the fun comes from the friendly competition of gem collecting/stealing and the (mostly) solid level design throughout . as this game progresses it becomes more and more tiresome to play, some being easily over an hour long ."
977.Joe Danger,"LOL Joe from family guy is in it, and Joe biden the president 2020-2032 killed by huge **** chum becket from bikini botten. Incredible game that is very fun to play. Definitely better than the sequel. I did not finish all the levels, but I did play quite much. Joe Danger is very entertaining, one of the best bike tricks games I have played; I think its arcade style is the key. This is, for example, obviously better than Bumped BMX. It also poses a nice challenge if you want to get all the stars (something I intended to, but ended up dropping it).. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is very good. I would give it a 9.5 but since you can't go in between numbers, I gave it a 10 because it's closer to that than a nine. I bought this game for 15 bucks when it first came out and fell in love with it. I ended up finishing it to 97%. It was very difficult and isn't a game to under estimate. You get a charming, colorful and delightful game that is full of insane stunts and great obstacles. Anyway, I decided to check it out again and noticed that my save data got deleted. Guess I'm gonna have to do it all over again. But in no way is that a bad thing.. Production values are high, and the character is all right. I wasn't really impressed to give this a higher rating. I have to compare this to other games and the fact is that I've played ones just like this many times before but where you can edit the terrain and bike's physics. I think a child might enjoy this **** wouldn't play it all day.. very good big time motorcycle man, tricks an all that real fun. real all time recomend brotha this good **** brotha, better than my best reefer.. Excellent game that keeps on giving and giving as you play. Initially I was disappointed with the purchase but 3-4 hours in and the game kept introducing new, more exciting and more addictive levels and I was blown away. Trying to get all medals will leave you locked to your TV for hours and they are very fun and balanced to try and get so even if they are difficult, you never feel annoyed. I am disappointed created level sharing can only be done between friends instead of like LBP where you can just download any level from the world but I guess I was expecting too much. Definitely one of the many PSN gems. Highly recommended.. I feel this game was a let-down. Single player is ok, I played it for 5-6 hours during a weekend but haven't looked at it since. Multi-player is nowhere near as good as it could have been, no on-line gaming and only two players maximum. It's a cross between LBP and Excite Bike, but not as good as you'd think and IMHO I think reviewers has given it too high scores really. My high expectations were not met.","i bought this game for 15 bucks when it first came out and fell in love with it . i did not finish all the levels, but i did play quite much . i think its arcade style is the key to this game ."
978.Sons of the Forest,"Sons of the forest is the second part of the survival game series that excited me after the first part: ""the forest"". It engaged me with it's unique atmosphere, interesting exploration of caves and the ability to play with friends. But now 'when the second part is out of early access, I can compare them and say whether this is a good continuation of the series or not. 1) Exploration of the world: in this game you will find one of the most beautiful and realistic game worlds in the industry. There are many interesting places to visit, many new things to collect and caves, with a unique scary and overall good atmosphere. 2) Construction system: in the first game, construction was less interesting and exciting, you could not do everything you want. Now in ""Sons of the forest"" you can do whatever you want and decorate it with many new features and plan the defense of your home. 3) The part of the game dedicated to survival: many new animals give you more food options. I think in the second part you plan more what you will eat and drink, where you will sleep and what you will do if you run out of food, also now you have more deep cooking system. They also added some new types of cannibal and mutants with different movesets and abilities, as well as some new interesting weapons and the old crafting of bombs and other things that can help you protect yourself, giving you a better survival experience in this game. 4) Story: I can’t say much here, because it’s not even important in a such game, and in the first part it wasn’t important either. There is a story, but it only exists to explain some things that happen in the game. Overall, Sons of the forest is the best part of the series, in which you can easily spend a lot of time playing alone or with friends. Also, it still gets some new updates with new content. I highly recommend this game to all fans of survival games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has an intimidating start to it, story-wise (you crash in a helicopter on an island of cannibals). And the mechanics and combat seem confusing and frustrating -- at first. But sticking with it, a truly great game opens up. I find the devs accomplishment stunning, to be honest. This game is a perfect marriage of story and simulation. I can't get over how much fun I'm having. You have to build a base and defend it. You have to uncover a fascinating story and travel into eerie and mysterious caves you stumble upon. Plus this game can be scary, though it's not absurd. Eventually you get your sea legs. Also, if you are having probs getting started, just make a custom game and adjust the difficulty for the elements that are too much to handle. What a fun game.. Great game, and an very interesting story! It's an way better version of egular The Forest with way more cool features. Hope to see an sequel soon!. Some of parts of this were better than The Forest, but most of this sequel were worse. Barely any of the game mechanics were explained, like how to craft, combine, place objects, cook, change ammo. All of that was intuitive in the original game, but not in this sequel. The game mechanics are such a gigantic confusing mess, and none of it is explained. A built-in tutorial was really needed. They made the game much too open world where all the places were roughly the same difficulty. This made early game was way too hard, and late-game was too easy.. The first game is awesome, but this one is even better. Loved every aspect of this game including the graphics upgrade in comparison wih the first game. Loved that the game is more lineal than the previous one and hope they make a 3rd game in the future.. this are the game for my own like so this maybe little bit overrated rate, but it just got me in every aspect of an improvement since the last game, and to actually addA.I become our friend as a singleplayermode it just supper appealing.. is an incredible game that can give emotions. For example, it gave me the same emotions I felt when I first played Minecraft as a kid. was fun at the start but got boring very fast. this game was not for me,it was a bit left 4 dead vs 7 days to die with some decent graphics. It was fun for a few hours but got boring after +- 4 hours, so if u can grab it for 10$ sure go for it.. It has a very interesting story and it's perfect to play with a friend. The game was developed on unity so the hitboxes are a bit odd and the objects from the environment dont interact very good with the player. Son the forest is better than The Forest before .a map and main direction are given .Unlike The Forest .I get terribly lost and only have a lighter after searching most cave . Torturing my eyes . although hand drew map is classic . The battle system is satisfied,Some people enjoy cooking human meat or limbs .but weaponry need to improve reliability .Not real enough . Flying feel great ,As if I own this island . If I have the honor to recruit more men and conquer the entire island .. The building mechanics are a global leap. Even when the game was in beta, the construction was perfect. Now in the game you can build everything and more, with different materials, and you are not limited by the blueprints that the developers have prepared. You are free to create as you wish. Her graphics are just cosmos. When you turn on the maximum settings and walk in the game, it's like you're walking through the forest in real life. It's impressive. However, I want to note that the game is not suitable for all devices - it is quite demanding. The atmosphere of the game deserves special attention. The feeling of presence and immersion in the world of wild nature is achieved not only thanks to the graphics, but also thanks to the detailed sounds and environment. The game has a voice chat, which works like in real life: the voice of the interlocutor fades away, and in the caves creates a stunning echo, adding realism and increasing the tension in the underground adventures. The gameplay is addictive from the first minutes. Exploration of the island, survival in the wilderness and battles with mutants create an inexpressible atmosphere. There is a constant desire to discover something new, find hidden resources or face another mystery.Sound and music in the game deserve special praise. Sound accompaniment immerses into the world of the game, creating a sense of presence and increasing emotions from what is happening. Rustling leaves, sounds of wild animals and tense moments, when something unknown moves in the bushes, make the game even more exciting. The only disadvantage is high system requirements. However, if you have a powerful computer, ""Sons of the Forest"" will be a real revelation. It is a game that you want to return to again and again, discovering new possibilities and experiencing unforgettable adventures.. One of the best survival games I have ever played, great building mechanics, weapons, enemies and visual look. After the first chapter I expected much more but I was terribly disappointed. Always the same dynamics, the same situations and the same mechanics! I understand that it has to be more of the same but I believed that after the many years of development the game would evolve for the better. Too confusing compared to the first one and some choices are not very accurate including GPS and map and how to craft things. At times the game becomes ridiculously punitive without any logical sense. Rejected.. This game is fun with friends and has a lot going for it. The building is interesting and detailed, and the story is engaging for a long while. However, the building could use some work. There are things that were changed from the first game that made building worse. The ending was also a real letdown. It was really interesting and then just ended. It felt like the developers had a much different plan but couldn't get it all into the game, so they just jumped past it. I was pretty disappointed.. Great game, I liked it. The best game about survival, there is nothing more to say about it - the perfect game.. simply put, the first games liniar nature worked a lot better than this game. even with the newly added vehicles, the map is so large, it's still frustrating to navigate. the caves have doubled, if not tripled in size compared to the first game, proving that bigger doesn't mean better. I believe they should have just concentrated on adding cool new items to the game but kept the map size and feel the same as the forest.. For me it is the perfect open world horror game. They don't force the story on you, you can do and build almost anything you want, and the gore/horror is really effective. I loved it already in the beta, but it has gotten so much better and less empty since then. Love the unique style of ""showing, not telling"" also. The graphics are beautiful and the cannibals are so unpredictable and realistic, as well as scary. Such an upgrade from the first game, can't wait for more, and still being updated as of now. Would recommend this game to anyone who wants a horror game to play with their friends, since it is also incredibly cheap.. I played this game with a friend, the graphics are REALLY good, not compared to other games but also cool, the cannibals and Virginia AI are very well made, making the cannibals not attacking you at first. The story could be better and there could be more artifacts, also building can be boring and cannibal attacks can be annoying, but thats the fun part of the game, surviving, and it can be very easy at certain point so i would do it harder, and add new types of enemies and mutants, and wild animals that attack you, like bears.. Honestly, the game is very excellent and worth tryingI hope that new parts will be released and will be more widely distributed, including discs. Borderline a scam product: empty so called openworld with repetative activities and enemies. no real narrative material except some pretentious environmental storytelling. clearly a bloated game beyond the dev's capabilities and capacity but labled to be ""ambitious"". This is not ambitious, this is lying.. Im new to survival Games but the world is truly stunning. I dont Know if have ever played a Game with such high immersive gameplay. I was a fan of The Forest, back in the day, but SOTF blows it away with so many visceral thrills it's honestly made me lose interest in other games. Whether you're hang gliding, cave diving, zip lining, riding an EUC, hacking up bodies to cook stew or hacking up logs to build a cabin, this game is just ridiculous, insane fun. And it looks fantastic as well. There are certainly some weak points: the building system can be glitchy and frustrating, the story has too many ideas to really feel satisfying, and the enemies have a nasty habit of just appearing out of nowhere, breaking the immersive spell. But the whole thing is just such an entertaining horror sandbox, budget priced at $30, it's hard not to recommend.. I played the original and once I heard about this I was hyped. One of few games that lived up to the hype for me, I have played since early access launch. Pretty much lived up to all my expectations AND then some with all the features they have added since the initial early access release in 2023. I started over for 1.0 and I am glad I did as a few things changed. The way the game plays out is brilliant I think and how the story unfolds. It really is pretty unsettling once you start to put all the pieces together of what actually went down on the island prior to the protagonists arrival. The caves although a little more linear than the ones in The Forest, the ones in this game are much more detailed and have better layouts. Cave mutants are actually quite scary I think and that's great! I love the variety of mutants in Sons of the Forest now with 1.0, so many. The fast one gave me goosebumps for real! The way they move and react is pretty well done. Probably the best enemy Ai I have dealt with. I'm not a big crafter but I do like to setup a base, build a house on a cliff, make a wall and setup traps and watch raiding cannibals get ground up and chopped by the new powered traps. I highly recommend exploring everything to find these as they are great! The building in this game is fun for me, pretty simple but the way you can click stuff together is like playing lego to me. Some say its too limiting but it really isn't for the type of game it is, there is plenty of flexibility in the new building system if you take the time to find all the other ways to make some things work. The graphics are top notch, the forest is so incredibly dense and realistic. Performance is also great, I play at 4k60 with settings maxed out on a 4080. I really can't think of anything to complain about with this game. I guess if I had to complain about something it would be that the game lacks Ray Tracing support. This game would look even better with RTX on.. Given my limited time for playing video games, I'm exceptionally selective with my choices. Sons of the Forest stands out as a masterpiece within its genre, boasting stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, flawless crafting mechanics and perfect atmosphere that sets a new standard for survival horror. However, the reason I rated it 9 out of 10 is because the storyline seems a bit sloppy in execution. Despite this minor setback, Sons of the Forest remains an exceptional experience and is a must-play for fans of the genre.. Even in the beta is the best survival game that i have ever played, i cant imagine what is gonna be in 1 year more.. This game the best! I was love first The Forest so much, and when this game release I’m only play in it (sons of the forest). I was wait a long time sons of the forest, I love this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Why is it so hard to collect arrows from a corpse, why can you craft ANYTHING that you can't carry, and why, the hell, bother to give a second chance when it's possible to die immediately after cutting yourself down?! You're just elongating the annoyance of dying and having to reload. Not to mention a useless 3min, UNSKIPPABLE, cut scene before a boss. It's fun, just not perfect. Hopefully, it does well enough to see the sequel fix the annoyances of this game (but add more, just like this one) Also, one last note, the **** blueprints, maybe make them somewhat useful so you're incentivised to make them rather than totally useless junk, except one real **** important one.... One of the greatest survival games ever made and with the most original building systems I have ever seen. I only wish they had left the game into early access for a little more in order to create more content, like: shovels being able to manipulate permanently the ground, having boats, mining different types of ore to do proper smithing (and ammo crafting) and more things to build with electrics/electronics component; this is really the only reason why I am not awarding a 10/10. Maybe a future DLC or an integrated system to allow content creations/modding directly inside the game?","sons of the forest is the second part of the survival game series that excited me after the first part . the game has a unique atmosphere, interesting exploration of caves and the ability to play with friends . it's the best part of the series, in which you can easily spend a lot of time playing alone ."
979.Arco,"Amazing game that hides so much under the 8bit minimalist wrapping. Fantastic music. A truly unique combat system. Focuses on native experiences. I don't know what to add except of anyone must play it.. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW !!! (A review in detail might come one day but simply : WOW !!! What a game !!!!!!). Beautiful in all ways. A lovely experience. Not what I expected going in, but what a lovely surprise.. This game will capture your attention from the very beginning. The intro song is great, the jokes are funny, the gameplay is easy to catch on, and what to say abpot the graphics, good old nostalgia! This game has that feeling that, once you close it, a couple hours later you will feel the need to get back and continue playing. In a gaming world full of millions of both good and bad ""pixelated-style"" games, we are sure this one will keep finding it's own place with time. Greatly recommended. Go and play it now!","this game will capture your attention from the very beginning . the intro song is great, the jokes are funny, the gameplay is easy to catch on . a couple hours later you will feel the need to get back and continue playing ."
98.Braid,"There is no puzzle platformer that bests Braid in the puzzling aspect. It is an incredible experience in testing your mind. On top of that it looks and sounds spectacular. Yum. I finally got around to playing this recently, and I have to say I was quite disappointed. Starting with the positives; for a game made in 2006 by one man it’s impressive both how well it controls, and how deep the puzzle mechanics go. And the fact that this game decided to forgo the life counter when major studios (Nintendo) are still using them in 2023 means it aged quite well. The problems however is its non-committal attitude to collectibles. The fact that the only real gameplay is getting collectibles which can be skipped almost entirely would be ok if the leveled featured any kind of content to beat them. And a game that favors completionists over casuals would be fine if it also didn’t punish them by having unskilled and mind numbing sections that just waste your time. The only group of people who would enjoy this would be someone willing to give up after 99% completion.. Pretty good for the time, not something I'd replay in a hurry though. Original.. Gameplay and art style is on point, however I am baffled as why people call this a ""masterclass in level design"". The puzzle pieces are disguised as optional collectables... until you beat all of the worlds and realize you need to collect every single one to reach the final world. It also doesn't help that some of the puzzles are impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. I can also appreciate it draws inspiration from older platformers like Super Mario Bros., but I feel like it borrows too much. Overall - a great idea executed poorly.. One of the best games I've played in my whole life. Please, do yourself a favour and play it.. Beautiful looking and sounding game, a little bit pretentious in its narrative, but expertly designed and crafted. Braid is one of those games that makes you feel like a genius after you've solved a puzzle, even though the puzzle's creator Jonathon Blow is the real genius. Although my score isn't sky high, I'm not really a fan of puzzle games, and I completed Braid in its entirety, so that says something. Excellent and beautiful game. Really enjoyable to play, or even just to watch.. One of my favorite games of the last 10..15 years on any platform. Highly recommended. Do not look at spoilers and finish the game to fully appreciate it!. This game is a wonderful and clever puzzle-solving platformer. If you're a fan of portal, buy this game, it's a treat. This game is proof positive that 2-D games do indeed have a place in modern gaming.. Braid is just awesome. There's nothing wrong about it that I can think of. It's like Mario, except its more complex, you can go back in time and its set somewhere in the 1920's-30's. I found that Braid is actually much more challenging than Mario, in Mario you die only by having a lack of skill. In Braid, you die by having a lack of a brain. You actually have to use your brain. Buy this game.. Neither a good platform game nor a good puzzle game. Don't get me wrong it has its moments but compared to the rather large number of 10/10 reviews here, I genuinely wondered if I was playing the same game.. Some videogames contain certain ""moments"". Moments which are forever memorable because they proffer a gameplay mechanic which thinks outside the box and challenges the very preconceived design ideas that developers themselves, let alone gamers, take for granted as gospel. Think the moment when the visuals start pulsing in time with the beat and the rumble of the joypad the first time you played Rez, making your brain momentarily unsure which of your senses was being engaged. Or that moment in Portal when you learned that you could create your own orange and blue doorways to navigate around the level, and that thinking with portals was going to be absolutely necessary in order to make any progress through the game. The classics are usually the games which bestow upon you the experience of one of these moments. Well, its possible to finish Braid within 45 minutes and yet it manages to pack in not one, but about six of these moments. Time and space are truly intertwined within the fabric of Braid like in no other game I can think of. The puzzles in each of the six different worlds are centred around a specific space-time law, and the joy of discovering how each one of these abstract rules works is what I'm referring to when I describe these special moments. The first world introduces the ability to rewind time, which, apart from being of crucial puzzle-navigating importance, also has an additional advantage. It means that the hero, Tim, can never die, since you are able to simply revert back to before the point when his ""death"" occurred. This is just a cleverly-disguised way of enabling you to retry - totally on your own terms, without having to start again from an arbitrary checkpoint. It feels more natural and certainly less of a hindrance compared with how death is handled in almost every other videogame. After all, how many games will end in absolute failure when your character dies? Very few. Therefore Braid benefits enormously from this approach to demise. Subsequent worlds' innovations include objects unaffected by the reversal of time, interactive shadows triggered by the rewinding of time, the warping of time around a localised point and, brilliantly, the linking of the passage of time relative to Tim's location on the horizontal plane. When this world's trick became apparent to me it felt as if 20 years' worth of videogame conventions were being blown away right before my eyes, and a brand new part of my brain that I didn't know even existed started to whirr up into operation. Taking on board each of these rules and then applying the knowledge of their workings to solve each conundrum is an immensely satisfying undertaking, especially with the trickier puzzles. This is how it should be, this is videogaming as its own reward. No lazy ""collect x number of things"" objectives. Although you do receive a jigsaw piece after completing each puzzle, these are not meaningless trinkets, being both incorporated into the story and even spectacularly in one instance being a component of another, wider puzzle themselves. Much like Tim himself, Braid skips merrily along to the tune of its beautifully melancholy soundtrack, doffing its cap to some of its influences as it goes, in search of the princess who always seems to be in another castle. Never recycling ideas, although sometimes reusing settings, but only in the context of a new space-time rule, essentially meaning a completely new puzzle. At times it might feel a bit pretentious, but it deserves to be. It's better than almost everything else out there. It was also the game that gave the recent indie revolution some undeniable clout. Jonathan Blow is a genius but whatever he goes on to achieve in his career he will never top Braid.. Braid is my favourite platform game of all time. There are longer, more classic and difficult games out there, but this is the most complete and potent game I have played in 30 years of doing not much else. The mechanics and story mingle to create a game which is as deep as you are willing to go. I still sit there staring at the home screen thinking about what this game is really saying. Even a straight run through with no pause to consider the meaning of the game will give you some of the most technically accomplished puzzles ever put out. There isnt a platformer I can name as diverse as Braid, with each world possesing its own set of rules and opportunities for toying with time. It has made me sit back and clap myself for completing the puzzle. Self congratulating moments are earned in this game but it really does make you feel smarter than you are. Clever, clever game. The twist will truly mess with your head. As for replayability, after completing the game you can search out for impossibly hidden stars which are sometimes just as hard to reach even once they're located. They alter the final stage piece by piece, allowing for some time bending tricks which unlock a secret ending if you attempt to do something which would seemingly break the game. This in itself gives new answers and new questions to the player. Braid tests your execution and understanding of your environment. The more you can develop these, the better the game gets. 10/10. A digital marvel. Provides mind-boggling puzzles with a somewhat challenging learning curve. The design is incredibly intuitive. It never treats the player like someone who has never played a game before. That being said, an inexperienced and non-exploratory player might not experience the game to it's fullest potential on their first playthrough, for most of the puzzle pieces are optional and easily skippable. The art direction is fantastic. It's simplistic yet stunning all at the same time. The story is somewhat non-existent. It's possible to play through the entire game and emerge completely oblivious to the plot. For the curious and inquisitive players, the story is a chore to figure out, but once you do, you will find that it's actually quite saddening The atmosphere was somber enough, but if you possess knowledge of the plot, Braid will seem that much more depressing. If I had to have one gripe, it would be that sometimes the game puts too much trust into the player. The game often treats the player like a genius, when in reality the player is not. Some of the puzzle pieces and another type of secret (which I shall not spoil) are extremely hard to reach and force the player to end up giving into using a walkthrough. At that point, the level of immersion is heavily lowered, as you are taken out of the game completely. Other than that, Braid is a fantastic experience that exploits the exquisite potential of indie games worldwide, and also paves the way for more mature and respectful video games to come.. Puzzles on a vertical difficulty slope and gimmicks that are not explained nor fleshed out in any detail make this game a pile of over-hyped, over-priced, over-flogged nonsense.. A modern interpretation of Mario, Braid is among the most visually stunning games you'll find. When combined with the pleasant soundtrack and minimalistic story, it creates a pleasantly unique ambiance. The gameplay in general isn't innovative, but it works. And the time-changing mechanism is nice when executed properly. Overall, I think Braid is short and overrated, but it's definitely worth playing.. A 2D platformer that makes clever use of time control mechanics, such as rewinding and speeding up time, to create some well thought out puzzles. The subtle hints as to what is actually going on in terms of plot will also intrigue most players enough to have them looking on forums for other peoples thoughts.. *9.4* Music and visuals create an atmosphere that is spot on. Puzzles that push your mind out of its comfort zone. A story that is left to interpretation and an ending that is presented better than any game before it.. for those looking for an interactive story, play Braid. For those who want a unique and original game, play Braid. for those looking for a challenge of the mind, play Braid. This is absolutely one of the more beautiful games for how simple it is to play and yet so complicated. The music is some of the best, the artwork is beautiful, and just overall You can't stop saying praises. It's a challenging platformer with it's own twist.. It's Braid's moving, off-beat narrative and matching soundtrack that make it brilliant. The Van Gogh-esque visuals are stunning and Jami Seiber's haunting cello runs through the game like a Seam.. To review this game, I had to read other user reviews done on this site. And to be honest, I realized something: every person who gave this game a negative or even mixed review is just not getting the concept of the game or too simple to solve it's puzzles. But let me talk about the game itself. The graphics are real simple yet so beautiful. It really is a soothing game to look at. As for the music, it makes me feel lost in the game. Famous developers now a days don't concentrate on music and forget that music is part of the whole experience (Not all though, Music in Skyrim is awesome). The music in Braid just makes me feel like I'm in a different plain all together. Honestly, even if the gameplay was crap I'd still give it a 9 just because of the music (sorry for the exaggeration). But, fortunately, the gameplay is anything BUT crap. I found some people referring to it as a Super Mario clone. That is just WRONG. Some other people say that the game lacks fun. Have fun playing Call Of Duty because this game is not for simpletons like you. I had immense fun playing this game and challenging my brain. And I will be honest. THIS GAME IS HARD. I found myself pounding my head and screaming at the screen at some points of the game where the puzzles get so crazy. But did that ever make me quit? Never. I didn't quit any Point and Click adventure in my life so I am not quiting this. The gameplay is mostly platforming and jumping on enemies. Then it introduces Time Manipulation in a brilliant way. And every world has a theme to it, like one world is all about rewinding time, the other is about stopping and ****. The game is beautiful to say the least. As for the story, it feels more or less like a poem. It was MEANT to be misleading and hard to get. Although I still don't fully grasp the story, It still is an interesting one. But If I wanted to rate a story I would review a Point And Click adventure not Braid. Did Limbo have an amazing story? Exactly. I gave this game a 10 because it deserves it. And it is not over-rated at all. This game deserves the support of everyone and to rate it lower than a 9 is saying that you are a Call Of Duty fan. Which means: Don't rate our games you gamer wanna-bes.. Using some new and a few rare game play elements, Braid plays like few other games. There's also a lot of thought put into this game - the layered story and increasingly complex puzzles makes this a game great for anyone looking for more intellectual content in games as well as someone just wanting a puzzling platformer.. The first time I downloaded this I had a bad experience ( I kind of had to pay twice ), but that didn't put me off this fantastic game. The way this game is so artistic and beautiful really pulls you in to the unique puzzles and storyline. The music in this game is also extremely atmospheric and fits in well with the game as a whole. You will find it hard not to fall in love with this extremely poetic and well made game.. One of the most unusual, enjoyable, original games I've ever played. Wonderful. I would have liked it to be longer but whats there is flawless. Can be quite challenging at times but as the in game hints say - avoid looking up cheats/walkthroughs as it's so much more fulfilling when you have that ""AHA!"" moment.. Simple gameplay that invites the player's inquisitiveness to explore, which is rewarded with a profound story and sophisticated puzzles put on the backdrop of impressionism and minimalism art and music. What really makes this game special is that it doesn't ""hold your hand"" as you play - it respects the player as someone who wants to solve problems, thus allowing them to solve the puzzles if/when they want to - and shakes loose from conventions popular in video gaming, such as starting at 'World 1' or giving you objectives to complete. The metaphorical interpretation along with progressing the idea of 'video game' make Braid not only a great game, but a important video game in the industry's history. This is a must play for any player who wishes to see video games - at least some of them - respected as art.. This game is nothing but a repetitive borefest with a time travelling gimmick. The level design is extremely generic, especially for a platformer. Plus, there is absolutely no replay value. You have to 100% the game just to get to the last ""world"", which is actually just a cutscene. I don't know why most people think that it is one of the greatest indy games of all time, when it is actually one of the worst.. A great game, with good platforming, a great musical score, and one of the most thought-provoking stories out there. This is a great way to pass the time, and it is well worth the price tag. The five hours you spend playing this is worth it.. Challenging and ultimately very rewarding when you figure out the tougher puzzles. Can be frustrating in places as some puzzles require perfect timing etc but when you finish and figure out the tougher challenges you really feel a sense of accomplishment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Positive - Time-Splitting mechanics were unexplored at the time. The game is brilliant adn bueatiful. The characters are relatable. Gripes - Too expensive. (On XBLA, on STEAM it's only $6) Sometimes you play the same levels except with a different Time-Split mechanic.. When I first downloaded Braid and started playing it, I was taken back to the NES days, and thought it was charming. Then the levels got more difficult, and the game truly presented itself. I still play this game sometimes, it's just so good and has awesome replay value. Just walk away from it for a month, then play it all over again.",the only real gameplay is getting collectibles which can be skipped almost entirely . the puzzle pieces are disguised as optional collectables... until you beat all of the worlds and realize you need to collect every single one to reach the final world . the game's creator Jonathon Blow is the real genius .
980.Tales of Symphonia,"As a Japanese RPG, tales of Symphonia is one of many in the great tales of game series. The game itself is very well constructed, whether it be in the combat mechanics on it's 2.5D fighting plane, the pleasant sounding tracks amongst its world, or the plotline of the story taking place throughout the game. Below I have highlighted the greater points of the game as well as some of my minor issues with the game experience as a whole that i had. One of the greatest strengths of the game i would say is the styled backgrounds and character models. The game itself running on a gamecube with limited specs still managed to have a very quaint and charming graphical presentation. The character models in game during cutscenes are able to display a moderate range of expressions though limited. Besides the graphical presentation the music excels, every area of the game having effective tunes to convey the feeling and overall vibes of the situation. The main cast of characters in the game are all well designed and charming, the best in my opinion being the main hero Llyod and his childhood friend Colette. (This is good given the fact they both are the main leads for a lot of the story's plotlines.)The only drawbacks of the game I had as a whole were only a few, however the first would include the beginning of the game having a very drawn out overworld exploration, specifically the amount of time it would take to get from one village or city to the next. This in itself would not normally be a problem but the overworld map itself had little to nothing to find or do besides encounter monsters and go to designated towns/city. Making the overworld experience itself feel very barren and boring throughout parts of the game. This slow overworld travel as well as barrenness however is mostly alleviated after you receive faster travel options for the overworld. The only other minor problem the game has concerns the design of some of the game's dungeons. While the beggining few dungeons are simple but fun with their puzzles, the later dungeons just become quite tedious in area with the amount of backtracking as well spawn rate of the enemys all over the dungeons. (This problem is mostly shown by the last few dungeons of the game). The only other problem is more of a personal pete peeve as the english dub voice over, is lacking in one department. This being that the english dub does not voice the in game skits like the japanese dub does. Though the english dub for the overall experience is still good and its up to the player what language they want to listen to. With all this said, i would recommend this game to anyone who is wanting to play a fun and engaging RPG experience. :) I would even further recommend this game to any JPRG enthusiasts/enjoyers who want to try playing older titles or who are trying to get into the tales of series as a whole.. This is the Blueprint of an amazing Action RPG. Characters, Dialogs, Plot, Battle-System, Menu-Management, Over-World, Length, Art-Style, Sound. This is Top-tier.. amazing characters deep and moving story beautiful and interesting towns my favorite rpg ever. Just dropped by to give this game a 0, I wasted a weekend of my childhood playing this garbage pile ****.. I love Tales of series and i've heard many great things about Symphonia throughout the years. ****'s kinda started good, but ended horribly. Most unsatisfied end of the game in series. To be honest, considering all hickaps that this game have i simply don't see why everyone love it so much. P.S. right after this game i've started Symphonia 2 and oh boy it's fun! Don't listen those who say that it's bad. I was shocked, but 2nd game **** the ending of 1st one by quality, story and bossfight.. Some insane twists and really neat characters. Have played it multiple times. Gameplay falls apart pretty badly near the end of the game and the QA isn't there. Dungeons become so difficult and tedious with very little UX design built in to help players.. Despite being too bright and happy aesthetic-wise, it's a real masterpiece. The story has some clichés but it's deep enough to build incredibly complex character development. The battle system felt fresh and smooth compared to the ol'good turn based mechanics, and the anime-like design and cut scenes closed what is still for me the best Tales of all times.. one of the best games i ever played it fits best on gamecube. ps2/3 and steam just dont feel right played and beat it over 40 times. This is a strange one for me. Its a very long adventure with a very dark story. It got me hooked and i liked it alot but i took weeklong breaks and i had to force myself to finish it. Pro / Cons: +Likable Cast with great interactions +timeless graphics +music +/-length +/-convoluted story with insane amounts of mcguffins +/-deepish combat +/-rpg elements. This game deserves a waaayyy higher rating than tales of arise. One of my favorite.. It might be a tad odd that I am reviewing this classic in this day an age. However, amidst the hype for the new Tales of Arise game and seeing incessant memes about how it ""dethroned"" Symphonia, I felt I had to review it and give my two cents on my experiences with this game, along with addressing the memes. Since I cannot review Tales of Arise yet because reasons. Tales of Symphonia is a perfect example of how to transition from 2D to 3D. It's a perfect jump that strips nothing the 2D classics had and adds new and entertaining aspects into the game experience. Everything is intact and improved upon here, from staple features of past Tales games such as battle Co-op, skits, cooking etc. to the nice stylized look of the game's environments and characters which resemble the classic 2 sprites but in 3D. Exploration was kept intact as well and as a result it's engrossing and fun as always. Tales of Symphonia doesn't try to rewrite the JRPG genre or the franchise itself. It fixes what was broken and improves just about everything else from its 2D predecessors. It is the perfect 3D Tales experience. I feel the franchise started going downhill after Symphonia however, I don't know why but every Tales game after Symphonia feels progressively worse. I think people have forgotten about this game and how good it really is and are easily being swayed by the hype of a new Tales game which does a LOT of wrong to the franchise. I'm talking about Tales of Arise. Don't believe the hype about how pretty and perfect that game is. Graphics is its best quality but it pretty much fails itself in others aspects. Not only does it punch itself in the face but it fails us as fans of the franchise by exploitative and predatory practices, such as having 2 dozens of paid DLC content at release, and thus being littered by IN GAME ADS in your face about said DLCs. Everything in this game has been adapted to get people to go and pay for DLC; from the enemy scaling to one of the worst things I've seen in a JRPG... And that is LOCKING SKILLS BEHIND PAID DLC WALLS. If that isn't one of the most scummy things to be seen in SINGLE PLAYER JRPGs in recent years, I don't know what else could be. Sadly this is just two of the bad aspects of this game. This game fails in many other areas but I'll save that for the review on its respective page. So no, Tales of Arise (which should have been named Tales of ARSE instead) does not in anyway dethrone Symphonia, other than it being ""prettier"" to look at, but that's about it. The stripping of Co-Op in Arise was the first red flag for me but, I never imagined how bad things were really going to **** game is highly dysfunctional in many ways and I have no idea what the ""critics"" are thinking or how much they got paid to give it such a high rating. Do NOT buy Tales of Arise full price or preferably do not buy it at all. My Recommendation for Arise? Sail the high seas on it, it does not deserve your money.. My favourite video game of all time. I have never been so effected by a video game's story, or so completely engrossed in it's world. It may not be completely perfect, but it is about as sweeping and epic an adventure as you can hope to experience in a video game. I actually came out of it feeling like I learned something and have replayed it probably like ten times. It never gets old. It has some of the best combat I've experienced in a game (it gets much better as you continue to play) and am completely in love with it.. This game is must be played , it has the best story in any game, but the gameplay is a little bit boring. I absolutely enjoyed this game. So much replayable value and hundreds of hours you can spend playing. However it’s easy to get lost and not remember where you were going or what you were doing. All in all great game!. Fun gameplay, grand plot, and a fantastic cast of characters brought to life by some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. Truly an underrated gem of an RPG.. It's not perfect, but even decades later I still love this game–cheesiness and all :). Epic RPG that encompasses 2 worlds, 9 party members and a story that will you will not soon forget. The plot grips you right away with the ensuing conflict, and proceeds to take you on a wild ride at breakneck speed, with action, emotions and drama being plentiful. A fun, unique take on the action RPG genre with some fun combat and 100s of spells. One of the best RPGs on the system!. With sublime tunes, abundance in content, and a battle system that feels right in every way imaginable, Tales of Symphonia is able to outrun its time-wasting dungeon design and stiff production values. One of the greatest games on the Gamecube.. This game was one of my childhoods best rpg game I ever had. Even now I am still loving it and everyone who loves to play RPG games, I must say that this game is a must have in every collection of rpg gamers library. Tales of Symphonia is also my favourite number 1 of all Tales of Off games. I totally recommend to get this game on the PC. There are also some collectables to get via Steam version.. Great characters, great storyline with an insane plot-twist, a long life for a game cube game, pretty good and colorful graphisms, fun mechanics like cooking and fun sidequests, this game is a great experience and one of the best JRPG I've played. It's fun, it's engaging and you'll find yourself loving the characters and the stories they tell. I strongly recommend playing it. (The PS3 remaster is also pretty good if you can't be bothered to buy a Game Cube or a Wii). Tales of Symphonia is one of the best JRPGS of its generation. The gameplay is fun and rewarding and the story is long, deep and compelling. It is very rare that I find a game that gets me so invested in its world and its lore. The game does have some weak areas such as mediocre level design, bland visuals, childish characters and often jarring anime stereotypes. Those flaws are mostly just cosmetic though, beneath its cartoony exterior is a core concept that is actually very mature. I recommend this game to almost any fan of JRPGs and I think it is even a great starting point for many people who aren't familiar with the genre. It's accessible and fun while still offering depth. The gameplay is a cross of old school and modern. Battles take place in a confined field but unlike traditional turn based RPGs the action all happens in real time. This makes combat very engaging, while I like the strategy element of turn based combat I generally prefer real time for the sense of immersion. This game does a good job of balancing the two styles. You can quickly and easily switch between characters and you can also assign strategies and techniques. It allows you to have a lot of control and strategy while still offering the thrill of fast paced action. Combat can get a bit repetitive, as the game is very long but there are a lot of techniques to be learned so that kept things reasonably fresh. Some of the field enemies are pretty mediocre but fortunately there are a ton of bosses and some of those battles are excellent. Outside of combat, there is a lot to explore and there are some puzzles. I thought that puzzles could have been better but there were enough to at least keep me engaged. Another cool thing is the way that you interact with your party. Throughout the game you will have the opportunity for many optional conversations with party members, those scenes help to develop the characters but also add another layer to gameplay since you can make choice to either react to them positively or negatively. Like with most JRPGs though traversing the environment is a bit dull, it would have been nice to have more interactivity. Where the game really shines is its story. While the style of the game is a bit childish the story actually has a lot of dark themes, such as persecution, slavery and human sacrifice. All of these topics are tied into a massive narrative that is complex while still being easy to understand. There are some really big ideas and multiple twists that I found very satisfying. Some parts are predictable but I rarely found that detracted from the story as a whole. The middle of the game offers a great twist that I kind of predicted but because of how it was handled it was still totally satisfying. Part of the fun was trying to guess the twists since almost everything is foreshadowed well in advance, figuring it out made it rewarding in a different way. The way that you interact with the story as a player is also very interesting because it extends beyond just making choices in conversations. For example, there are certain bosses that you can lose against and still continue the game but if you win against them it will lead to a different outcome. My only major problem with the story is the tone. I played this game around the same time I played Final Fantasy X and compared to that game this one doesn't do nearly as good of a job when it comes to conveying the tone of important story moments. The deep quality content is there but the atmosphere often feels inappropriate. The characters are a bit stereotypical on the surface but as the game progresses most of them get a lot of development. They have to face tough realities about the world they live in and seeing them adapt to that provides a lot of great character moments. One of the parts I found most interesting was how one of the stories primary villains is idealized by several of the heroes and that creates an interesting dilemma when they ultimately learn the truth about what he has done. There are a ton of characters and each one has a meaningful arc. My biggest complaint with the character is that Lloyd and Colette never really evolve beyond the basic tropes. Lloyd never really seems to mature and still seems like a bit of a duffus by the end. Colette's entire system of faith is proven to be a fallacy but ultimately she remains a mary sue. She is the type of character who is shy and clumsy for the sake of cuteness, rather than it actually being a relevant, informed part of her character journey. Despite these problems though, I found most of the characters fairly likable and the diversity of the cast kept me entertained to the very end. This could have been a great story about kids growing up but they never really do. The visuals and sound design are both pretty solid but they aren't nearly the best that the genre offers. There is also a ton of extra content beyond the main story and most of it is good. I give it 85%. Tales of Symphonia is my best experience with the Tales series, so far. (Having finished 5 or 6 of them) Almost all of the characters are likeable, the story appears to be your typical RPG save the world sort of game, but ends up being MUCH DEEPER and keeps things interesting. Character dialouge from the skits are very funny and truly flesh of the personalities of your party, far better than most RPGs ever do. Combat is tight and remains fun outside of the normal RPG grinding. Plenty of side quests and things to do. I'd put this up there with the higher quality Final Fantasy games. Easily a gem and must play.. Stopped by to drop a 10. Looking back, I can't find a single thing that I didn't like about this game. Some things may seem repetitive but I didn't care/notice it because it was fun throughout.. It´s a nice game, you can find some interesting things and details in this JRPG, but is a ""pretty"" jumble. The plot has twists and the protagonists are attractive, but the antagonist looks weak. I mean, you can´t hate him, because he is just a lost child. The battle system is dynamic, but sometimes is a little confused and some puzzles are too difficult. Anyway is a good game with good graphics, good music and good appereance. This game is not a FF, but it helps to palliate the lack of RPG´s for GameCube.. Tales of Symphonia is among the greats when it comes to JRPGs. This well written masterpiece was my favourite game for the Nintendo GameCube and is my second favourite RPG next to Chrono Trigger. This game features a diverse cast each with their own heartfelt and hard-felt back stories and an overall plot that will make you think and make you feel for you party members. With a wide variety of side questing you can easily clock well over 100 hours of game time. The gameplay is fluid along with the battle system. Tales of Symphonia has a fantastic score to accompany you in the journey. Tales of Symphonia kick started my love for the Tales Series.. This is my first and favorite Tales of, there is too many memorable moment that i love to keep replaying over and over again. I have the game on PS3 now and i'm still enjoying it alot.. If I had to sum this up quickly, I would say that while Tale of Symphonia is one of the most endearing and interesting games of pretty much all RPG's, Dawn of the new World, while being a good game in itself, is one of the worst sequels you will probably ever see. Let me elaborate: Let's start with the original, Tales of Symphonia. Tales of Symphonia has a decent beginning, but it does not seem like something special. However, the story quickly evolves into something of an epic fantasy novel, with a rather unique plot and great characters you want to follow and root for. Out of all the tales games, I believe this one is the best when it comes to character-player relationships, and your choices, even, no, especially the small ones, matter to your experience and the connections between you and the characters. Playing through this adventure is a blast, and most people love it for that. Though i recommend searching for 'ToS affection system' before you begin, just saying. Now, before we talk about the game's own story and setting, let's look at why the game is a bad sequel: If you are reading, watching or playing a sequel of something, its most of the time because you enjoyed the original. Now, sone start with the sequel for various reasons, but if we look at it from wanting more of the world and story you loved so much, this game does not even satisfy, but pretty much, excuse my language, takes a **** on the original. The characters you loved interacting with? Pushed to the side for two new ones, and you can't even effect the old characters relationships, one of the cooler functions in the old game. Well, you can make ONE choice in an end-game sidequest, but that's just that, a side-quest. It's not even required. That, and the fact that it's just one choice compared to the original's many, makes it almost insulting. It was shoved in, with no build up. And don't even make me start on the setting! Just trust me, no spoilers, but's it pretty much a punch to the stomach what happened to the world after Takes of Symphonia. Now, for the game itself, without any spoilers: It's actually not bad. It's terrible in the beginning, so terrible you might even drop the entire game in the first hour, but at the end, it's not just good, it's great. However, when you reach that point of greatness, you are almost done with the game. The gameplay is a large step down from Symphonia. Sure, a few aspects are better, but it's basically.,, how do I put this.... Imagine Mario Galaxy without the spin, minus the parts where it's required: every platform segment, every normal enemy and all the tight moments where you save yourself just in time, all of that is gone. You still have a good platformer, but everything is a notch down from what it could be. And that's how Dawn if the new World feels: like something is just missing from the entire game. Combos? Branching attack choices? Special combo attacks between two characters? All gone. Have fun using the same to 'super attacks' through the entire game. Both which you unlock before midway through the game. The game itself is also filled with bad design choices, and I just don't mean stuff they could not finish in time, I mean directly bad choices that make no sense. Like how restricted the party is: you HAVE to have one of the two new characters in the party at all times no matter what. That, and one or them HAS to be in the lead. You can switch between characters inside battle whenever you want, but fir some reason you do 't just have to have a new character in the party, but you also have go start the battle with them. It takes one seco d to switch when battle begins by the way. Why would you design it like that. I could go on, but this is getting long, so I will finish my thoughts now: If you loved the original for it's characters, then this game will make them worse than they were in the first place. It's better to just play the first one again in that case. If you loved the game for it's world, then it's also better to just play the first game, trust me. If you loved it for it's plot... well, you might find something enjoyable at the end of the game, but it's a drag to get there. What I am trying to say is: if you liked Symphonia 1, then it will be a bad experience for you, or at least a frustrating one. Final verdict: Takes if Symphonia is one of the best RPG's, no, one of the most endearing and enjoyable games of all time. Tales of Symphonia 2 is better of not being experienced, as while it is a fine enough game, it actually takes away from the original game, rather than add anything of real substance to it.. It'd be great if it weren't for its target audience being young kids. Everyone can somewhat agree that JRPGs tend to be 99% teenager oriented with lots of cheesy drama, poorly made simple character relationships, and since the late 90s, silly emo villains who want to destroy the world because it's just such a bad world to live in. I've lost count of the JRPGs that did this, some of them with incredible talent and success(Persona 3 FES), some which end up as a giant pool of silliness(Final Fantasy X). ToS doesn't aim for the teenage crowd, for once. Or if it does, it's very slightly. It aims for a younger crowd. Little kids. Let me be blunt and say that this is a terrible design choice. First off, the entire game is exposing a story that is for all intents and purposes your typical JRPG story but with characters that are even more childish than usual. A simple example: like all JRPGs, you need your hero to have some sort of flirt or love interest in the party. Here, the closest thing we get to a romantic relationship is a shy talk about mundane things on a hotel's balcony. It's painfully childish at all times. It's a refreshing change to have something else than teenage, but this is even worse; Not in a sense of annoyance or stupidity, but in a sense of constant disinterest. I don't care for the childish relationships of the characters, I don't care for any of the plot devices or emotions expressed. The entirety of the story is fine but it can't pique my interest in any way. With JRPGs I tend to get interested, then get annoyed at the stupid(unless I never got interested in the first place). Here, I just let it roll without ever batting an eye. It's a constant smooth stream of cutesy childish talks, drama that is very lightly touched(whatever truly sad moments happen are grazed over and then ignored because it has to stay upbeat and kid-friendly), and humour that would probably make an 8 year old chuckle, but would make a teenager cringe, and just bore an adult like me. It's an interesting idea to have a JRPG just for kids. But the sad thing is, it simply doesn't work. I don't know of a single kid under 12 that would go through with the 50 to 70 hours of play time ToS offers. Kids I know just don't have that patience or commitment. And kids over 12 will probably find this cringeworthy or at the very least quite boring. The shame is that besides the story and characters and very childish tone, and despite a few minor issues with the visuals and plot, the entire game is a masterpiece. Its combat is brillant and extremely fun, it's one of the few RPGs where just grinding is a constant enjoyment, the music ranges from meh to very nice and never devolves into plain boring, the art style is great and cell shading technology makes this game absolutely booming for GameCube standards. It still looks great today, like the original Wind Waker. It's fun and memorable with lots of interesting elements in the gameplay, upgrade, weapon, healing, and every step opens a new little adventure or sidequest that you just can't say no to, and if the level design and music seldom soar near the heavens, they certainly do a decent job. It's just the story that is a drag and can't keep any sort of interest with me. Ironically, this might be an excellent game to speedrun, but as RPGs go, this is one of the most boring ones I can think of in terms of story. I played through it many times, and constantly stopped at yet another fortress/dungeon with their meh music, or just because I was so unequivocally disinterested with the story. A shame since it manages to do what almost no RPGs do, be fun to just play and yet have enough depth and complexity to keep you going for dozens of hours.. One of the first games I played with my sister and THE BEST GAME I have ever played. We were both engrossed in the story and I remember being so excited to come home from school so I could play this game. Even now, I still feel sympathetic for some of the characters. The game is just extremely likeable - the combat is 'real time' ( LOL I don't remember the actual name for it) which I prefer over turn-based combat, and the storyline is just amazing. Maybe I hyped it up because I played it last when I was about 12, but I love it.. I wish I could write a really articulate **** I just love Symphonia so much! It's my favorite game ever and I find no flaws with anything in it except for the lack of voice acting in the skits. Best JRPG I've ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game: Tales of Symphonia Genre: RPG-Action Developer: Namco System: Nintendo Gamecube (GCN) Total Score: 88/100 Value Score: 8.8/10 • Story: 9/10 • Characters: 8/10 • GamePlay: 7/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 10/10 • Length: 9/10 • Replay Value: 9/10 • Player Value: 9/10 Pros +Only Tales game on Gamecube +Decent story and characters +Well made visual design +Voice acting well made +Musical score is amazing +Lengthy story and great replay value Cons -Gameplay a bit rough and generic -Mechanics seem a bit slower than other Tales games. Well this game is different yes, the story is great, the game play too. I was about to give it a 9, but I had to give it a 10 because this is one of many few games I have played more than 2 times. I can;t say the same for it's Wii sequel, which I actually wanted to end so i could play something else.. This game tackles issues most games try to avoid and does it ""Tales"" style. ""Friendship"" is once again a big deal...again, but it is merely a peeve and does not hider the game's appeal. The game play is a strength and the story is even stronger, look no further if you want a champ, this game delivers from intro to outro.. To put it simply, this is the FF VI/VII; the Lunar The Silver Star; the Suikoden II; the Chrono Trigger, the Xenoblade Chronicles of its own series. To put it simply, this is the best Tales Of experience there will probably ever be, and luck for everyone there's an HD remake around the corner.. Possibly one of my favorite games of all time, Tales of Symphonia manages to excel at everything it tries to do, from the highly detailed and plot twist filled story, to the nearly perfected combat system. The story should take you around 20~40 hours on your first play through, and it is so rich with detail, you'll want to play through multiple play throughs. In Symphonia, they bring back the Artes system reworked as Techs, and it works really well. You won't learn new Techs by only leveling up, as some skills can only be learned by using a certain skill a set amount of times, not to mention the S Type and T Type systems, branching out your skills so you'll have to do multiple playthroughs to truly get all of the Techs possible. Then, we have the EX-Skills, which are bonuses added to your character depending on the EX Gems they have equipped. Note that these gems can also change your type, making these gems invaluable. The battle system is beautiful, and the game is actually challenging! You actually need to think which party members will do the best against which bosses. You will need to think of strategies to apply to the AI so you can counter bosses with enormous effect! Speaking of AI, you aren't forced to play with them, so long as you have friends, as the game is 4-player co-op! And even if you don't have any friends to play the game with, the AI isn't bad in the slightest (aside from a few suicidal moments they have in combat) meaning that even without friends, you won't be screwed! The soundtrack, composed by the wonderful Motoi Sakuraba, is beautiful. In battle, the music always gets me pumped to fight more enemies, and in the sadder moments, it really sets the tone. Character development is great in Symphonia, as all characters have an in-game findable back story, and the plot twists really make you get to thinking as to who you can truly trust, and who is really your friend. Lastly, the puzzles. They're really clever, and they really make you think as to what the solution is. Some puzzles take about five minutes, while others may take you up to an hour to fully complete. They're really intuitive, and I love them! (Even if I get stuck on them sometimes.) All in all, this is a 10/10 game, and I completely recommend the game to any J-RPG lover, or just RPG lovers in general!. This is my all time favorite game. The story is fantastic, the plot twists are intense. I think the best part of the game is the characters, you end up caring for them and you want them to explore their world and experience everything. If you love RPGs you'll love this game!. Symphonia was my first experience with a tales of game. The story is nothing special but the battle system ist just awesome and fun to play. I also like the graphic style though nowadays there are games with much better cel shading graphic out there. The soundtrack does have really good battle themes. Real good one and the gamecube hasnt that much rpgs anyway.. This is by far the best JRPG i have ever played. It has awesome characters, great story, fantastic combat system and is just overall a fantastic game experience. It also has very high replayabillity rate, being one of the only games ever, that i've wanted to play again as soon as i was done with it. The only thing that could be better about this game is if it was longer, not because it's too short, but simply because you just want more of this amazing game.","tales of symphonia is one of many in the great tales of game series . the game itself is very well constructed, whether it be in the combat mechanics on its 2.5D fighting plane or the plotline of the story . the main cast of characters in the game are all well designed and charming ."
981.Burnout 2: Point of Impact,"The feeling of racing down the wrong lane trying to avoid getting pulverized by a truck is mad adrenaline. 9/10. Thrilling road racer that was a game-changer for an entire genre and still looks good today.. The best thing about this game is the ""CRASH"" mode simply because when it ends it shows the replay in slow motion and consequently you see every piece of the car breaking up which makes the gameplay more immersive. Taking into account that it is a 2002 game, the deformation of the cars is simply sensational Dust and smoke particles are not left out either.. they are perfect. ... I give a score of 7 because the game is good when you play it for the first time but it has a very bad replay factor. Dodging the normal traffic while blasting full speed in a police cruiser is simply exhilarating! A fun, fast-paced arcade racer that could be a bit deeper.. Jesus, what a fun driving game, the controls were delicious, in my 0pinion it is a MUST PLAY for ps2. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is pretty good. The graphics were amazing for a 2002 release and the game play was pretty exciting as well. One of my personal favorites was the police mode; this kept me wanting to play this game for hours on end while not getting bored with it. There are some issues I have with it however. One thing is the lack of a story line, I know that its not a big part of the burnout series, but it would have been nice to see one. Another is the lack of cars; it would have been good to add just a little more to the lineup.. Burnout 2: Point of Impact is a very slick arcade racing game. This installment of the Burnout series is bigger and better than the previous Burnout game. There are more cars to race and crash with like the Custom Sports Coupe and the Supercar. The game play is similar to the last one: Race against 4 cars through a variety of events, race through checkpoints in a set time limit and try to come first. The game gives you a generous amount of time to race from checkpoint to checkpoint so basically, you don't have to worry about reaching the next checkpoint in time and getting a ""Time up"" screen and then ending your race (if you crashed too much in the first game, you would find it difficult make it to the next checkpoint). You have a boost bar and you fill it by dangerous driving like near missing traffic or catching some air. When you fill the boost bar and use it in one go (you can only use it in one go anyway), you'll get a ""Burnout"" in which either you'll continue boosting (depends if you ranked up enough dangerous driving maneuvers while your boosting) or gain a boost bonus towards filling up the boost bar again. The graphics have slightly improved with new environments to race around like an Airport terminal or the snowy mountains. A new mode added in Burnout 2 called ""Crash"" has you choosing from a selection of Crash Junctions then crashing your selected car into another vehicle and trying to cause a big pile up. The more cars at the junction crash, the more points (or Dollars) you earn. The crashes like the first one are very meaty but unlike the first game, you can't save your crashes which is a shame. The game also features a pursuit mode in which you pursue someone and try to ram them off the road within a set road distance. To win cars, you either have to win them in some tournaments or ""Face off"" events in the game. There is a good championship mode with races to win and tournaments to compete in and returning from the previous game, there are also ""Face Offs"" in which you race against one car and if you win, you'll unlock the car you have just beaten. The music is kick-ass like the last game and while your boosting, the music becomes more intense which is nice and because this is the last Burnout game published by Acclaim and the next ones are published by EA, this is the last Burnout game with no licenced soundtracks. The game has a fantastic sense of speed when your boosting along at such speed and with that pumping soundtrack blasting out of your speakers, Burnout 2 is an ideal arcade racer which should appeal to people seeking some arcade racing action.â","""burnout 2: point of impact"" is a very slick arcade racing game . the graphics were amazing for a 2002 release and the game play was pretty exciting . the lack of a story line and lack of cars kept me wanting to play for hours on end ."
982.Daytona USA,"Just recently picked this game up, and I've gotta say this is currently my personal favourite SEGA Dreamcast title. Although the visuals won't blow anyone way, it's the thrilling, fast-paced game play that brings you back to this arcade classic time and time again. This is pure arcade racing action at its best - no unbalanced or irritating power-ups, it's just down to you and your driving skill. There is a vast array of tracks to race around (Although initially it may seem like there is only eight, all tracks have a regular, reverse, mirror, and mirror reverse mode, effectively giving you 32 tracks.) and a bunch of unlock-able cars. Cars each have different stats and control very differently, so it is easy to find a driving style that suits you best. RGB sliders allow you to create custom paint jobs for each car, which another welcome extra. The music in this game is very odd, and undoubtedly SEGA - it's so bad it sort of does a complete 180 and becomes undeniably awesome. Even if you don't buy this game, I'd recommend checking out the soundtrack. It's certainly... unique. Alongside the cartoonish crash physics, it's clear the developers weren't taking themselves too seriously and this helps make Daytona a blast to play - just so long as you aren't looking for ultra realism. I wasn't expecting the next Gran Tourismo, but this game never claims to be, and instead basks in its own wackiness. Like many other arcade games though, this game extremely difficult. It also seems to get some sick enjoyment from singing the catchy 'Game Over' jingle at the end of every stage - even when you actually win the race. I personally really like this difficulty. Although it may not be for everyone, it gives you a great sense of accomplishment when you finally win. To come 1st you pretty much have to run a perfect race without any screw ups. This may not sound too hard, but part of the challenge lies in adapting to the controls - perhaps the most frequent, criticism of the game. In my opinion, it just takes some getting used to, particularly when you use this technique I picked up from an online video. If you move your thumb from side to side over the analog stick the controls will be very twitchy and over-sensitive. However, if you push the analog stick forward and sort of roll your thumb around the top to go left and right the car's steering becomes much smoother and easier. Still perhaps a little over-sensitive, but I certainly got used to it. The game's area of exploration and secrets lie in your control of the car - every now and again I will find a new technique, and finally being able to flawlessly drift around that particularly tight turn provides a great sense of accomplishment. Daytona USA 2001 is in my opinion a must-have title for any racing or arcade fans. The graphics aren't amazing, but they do the job. Customisation options really add longevity to the game, and the fast paced nature of the races keep you on the edge of you seat the whole time. I unfortunately do have to knock off a point for lack of accessibility, as Daytona is not kind to new players. If you don't want too much challenge, this probably isn't the game for you. However, for me, as a fan of arcade racers, Daytona USA really hit the spot and excels in almost every other area. At the time of writing this, Daytona USA 2001 is only available for SEGA Dreamcast. Although the original arcade version is available for digital download on Playstation and Xbox, this 2001 version has never seen any sort of re release. This could be the reason for it's high price online, although to be honest I don't think there is the demand to support it. I bought my copy for £25, and if you aren't familiar with arcade-style racers or difficult games, I wouldn't spend much more. But if you do like racers and you see it at a fair price, then pick this game up! You won't be disappointed!","this is pure arcade racing action at its best - no unbalanced or irritating power-ups, it's just down to you and your driving skill . there is a vast array of tracks to race around and a bunch of unlock-able cars . the music in this game is very odd, and undoubtedly SEGA - it sort of does a complete 180 and becomes undeniably awesome ."
983.Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne,"Huge breakthrough compared to the previous part in all aspects of the game. Everything in the game is honed to the max, you can only pick on it. After the training missions, it was immediately clear that this is a masterpiece.. Visual design not really good, Lack strategy features, but overall it's OK. This review has been cut in half (or more) so as to fit in the miserable 5k characters limit that metacritic impose and to combat the inflation of said character count. Check out MUH tumblr to see the full thing. [the name is GEMSimov] Hello everyone, I am the doubly wonderful Gordoth Enodious, a super gamer who has no bias, and I’m talking about Age of Wonders II: The Wizard’s Throne. Simple review details - I rank games on an out of 10 basis, granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it. Also, I am a gameplay designer and a writer so I got the credentials to talk. Gameplay Age of Wonders II is, much like Age of Wonders I, a turn based strategy game that also incorporates RPG elements. As one can expect from a direct sequel, the game has retained many features it had before, but it has also gained quite a few new ones, or has undergone some dramatic changes. The fact of the matter is, however, that magic has been expanded. As some might remember from the review of Age of Wonders I, that was something I leveled critique upon - the magic system, although interesting, felt as if it was lacking something. Alas, the changes made have not added a value to mana, other than for casting spells, but now it can also be used as a means of upkeep for some units, which makes it somewhat more impactful. The wizard is a new entry into the game, a new unit, if one will, that is pseudo-immortal, and the player loses the game if that unit actually dies. It gets revived, after being killed, at any friendly town that has a specific building constructed. If there are no such towns with that kind of building in the domain of the player, the player loses. The wizard also has a field of influence, which is the range of all the spells that can be cast by said wizard on the world-map and the area in which some persistent spells take effect. That field of influence can be expanded by having the wizard simply stand still in the middle of a town that has a certain building, capturing a certain world-map object, or having a hero waltz about. As mentioned, there are now buildings. More buildings than just walls and upgrades that allow the recruitment of units. Now, there are values like production, growth and population, which makes the game a tad more intricate than before, although management of those things is left to whether or not the player is building things and how many turns have passed. The good news are that any town can produce any level of units, as long as said town has the required building. The bad news are that the process of building up a town has been massively slowed down, due to the presence of production. Having low production, which could mean not having built the appropriate buildings to increase it, means that the speed at which the player will complete the building, or unit, is vastly lowered. The added complexity is, actually, a welcome addition, even though it is hard to manage and hard to find information on, due to the fact that population has always been some invisible stat that I could not find, even though I looked for it. I find that the added bonus of having a semblance of city management in a game that is about building up an empire is always a good implementation. Some changes I like, others I did not truly appreciate. The fact of the matter is that manual resolution of combat has been made even slower and more tedious than before. The AI has improved, somewhat, but there is still a lot to be desired. Overall, the gameplay was a bit more interesting than the previous game. 2/3 Presentation Age of Wonders II takes what Age of Wonders I had and makes it look better. Alas, it also loses out on some other things. The music of this game was a lot less memorable than the music of Age of Wonders I, which is quite impressive, as I felt that the music from the first game was passable, not great. The sound effects have also changed a bit, and I can’t truly find the comedic nature they had in Age of Wonders I. The voice acting, what little there is, is sometimes bad, sometimes simply alright, which is saddening. However, overall, the presentation of Age of Wonders II: The Wizard’s Throne is good enough. 2/3 Story While Age of Wonders I had a spectacular story that seemed to do almost everything right, Age of Wonders II fails at achieving that. The second game takes place an indeterminate amount of time after the first game, with a human king fleeing with his people from some disaster. It never becomes clear where, exactly, he comes from, nor does it become clear where the locations visited in the game are in relation to the map from the first game. The story has gone down in quality, and, although I enjoyed it, it was not as good as the story in the first game. 2/3 Legendary point No, doesn't get it. Conclusion 6/10. Slightly above average, recommended for strategy game players.. Age of Wonders 2 is an alright TBS but it gets boring very quickly. It doesn't have the depth of Civilization series and lacks addictiveness of Heroes or Disciples series.. amazing game, one of the most addictive, enjoyable and fun TBS to play 16 years later it still shines and offers a lot of fun, a true gem","this review has been cut in half (or more) so as to fit in the miserable 5k characters limit that metacritic impose and to combat the inflation of said character count . as one can expect from a direct sequel, the game has retained many features it had before, but it has also gained quite a few new ones . the wizard is a new entry into the game, a new unit that is pseudo-immortal, and the player lose"
984.Colin McRae Rally 3,"The superior power of the PS2 gives the Colin McRae series an adrenaline boost with some much improved graphics and detailed environments. It's still a one car only affair but it's still one of the best on the console.. 20 years on and I still think this game can be good fun. Even putting my nostalgia aside, the content in this game has a quality feel to it, especially the damage model that, for a 20 year old game, is still pretty solid. The only downsides to this game is the overall lack of cars, especially comparing this game to CMR04 and 2005, and the handling model that needs some time to be mastered because of the way cars steer from the center. Even so, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a simple and fun rally racer, even though the sequels are better in almost every single aspect.. what a rubbish game! the font is tiny and barely readable, before starting a simple race there are several loads that take a while the gameplay of the car is rotten. Colin 2005 is light years ahead of this ****. Actually a 10/10. I had so much fun with it. The mechanics are very good. I think it can get boring over a long time playing but that doesn’t really make it worse imo. Worth buying!. Playing this game in 2021 turned out to be much less of a challenge and waaay more of a satisfying experience. Racing games don't age too well but Colin McRae Rally 3 has avoided becoming an unplayable yet nostalgic piece of software. You can clearly see that visually it's not keeping up anymore, but for a 2002 release - the graphics are stunning. Some tricks like copying the sky texture and putting it in a lake to simulate reflections are obviously there, and apparently in 2002 spectators attending rallies were 2D flat, pixelated monstrosities but the main stuff - cars and surruounding areas - is done really well. Speaking of cars, it's technically a simulator, so your nicely rendered Ford Focus (the only available car in the single player mode - explanation below) might get wasted during the rallies. The damage mechanism is quite believable and detailed, and works differently with different kinds of tracks (i.e. it's easier to destroy your brakes when you use them very often on a slippery surface). Before each run you are given a report on how damaged your car is, and sometimes it's better to be careful, as you can destroy the vehicle entirely and basically get disqualified from the rally. Needless to say that the performance drops when the condition of car worsens. Saving your car from bigger or smaller damage will not be easy, as the driving model is quite challenging - although today it doesn't feel super realistic but I guess 19 years ago it was an ultimate driving simulator. Still believable, though. Just keep in mind that some bushes and traffic signs are indestructible and if you bump into them (which isn't hard to accidentally do) they will give your car a hard time. Quite hilarious for a game trying to be realistic. The game offers 64 tracks in single player mode (split into 8 countries) but most of them repeat itself on the course of 3 championships (6 rallies each, difficulty increasing with each championship) the player takes part in. It might get a bit repetitive but as I said, even if you memorize the levels it's not really easy to beat the clock. Additionally, weather changes are a small diversion. Each completed rally unlocks a new component for the car and sometimes a new vehicle that can be used in other modes. Because yes, it's a Colin McRae game, and you can only play the career as him. A bit limiting but I guess it's the only option Mr McRae was fine with at the time. Outside the career mode you can try to set a new record for the tracks or play with a friend with a second controller. It's classic split screen stuff, nothing mindblowing but essential for a racing game. During the gameplay I hardly noticed any glitches, framerate drops were happening very rarely and only during cutscens. For a game that probably uses a lot of the PS2 potential it's quite a good result. CMR3 kept me engaged during single player mode and some time i played with a friend and I totally don't regret giving this old PS2 title a chance - it's not really long or sophisticated like modern racing simulators, and has some silly elements that scream it's early 2000s but it's altogehter immensely fun! If you have a chance to play it, give it a try - the worst that can happen is nostalgia kicking you right in the groin (definitely check out the extras section in the main menu with a bunch of oldschool trailers for some forgotten games meant to be released in 2003. It felt like a time travel combined with treasure hunting to me).","20 years on and i still think this game can be good fun . the content in this game has a quality feel to it, especially the damage model . the only downsides to this game is the overall lack of cars ."
985.Unreal Tournament 2003,"Played this game for hours :) one of the best UT games ever made. For all players that wants a outstanding gameplay and shooting mechanics without all that CoD stuff :) pure rampage :). One of the greatest games when it was released. Extremely detailed maps, slick graphics, interesting weapons, and a whole lot of fun. Nice pace for a FPS.. Lack of some good game modes and in the need of more better maps is something I would want until UT2004 became the answer to this. Overall, a good game with some missing features.","UT2004 is one of the best UT games ever made . slick graphics, interesting weapons, and a whole lot of fun . overall, a good game with some missing features ."
986.Burnout 2: Point of Impact,"The feeling of racing down the wrong lane trying to avoid getting pulverized by a truck is mad adrenaline. 9/10. Thrilling road racer that was a game-changer for an entire genre and still looks good today.. The best thing about this game is the ""CRASH"" mode simply because when it ends it shows the replay in slow motion and consequently you see every piece of the car breaking up which makes the gameplay more immersive. Taking into account that it is a 2002 game, the deformation of the cars is simply sensational Dust and smoke particles are not left out either.. they are perfect. ... I give a score of 7 because the game is good when you play it for the first time but it has a very bad replay factor. Dodging the normal traffic while blasting full speed in a police cruiser is simply exhilarating! A fun, fast-paced arcade racer that could be a bit deeper.. Jesus, what a fun driving game, the controls were delicious, in my 0pinion it is a MUST PLAY for ps2. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is pretty good. The graphics were amazing for a 2002 release and the game play was pretty exciting as well. One of my personal favorites was the police mode; this kept me wanting to play this game for hours on end while not getting bored with it. There are some issues I have with it however. One thing is the lack of a story line, I know that its not a big part of the burnout series, but it would have been nice to see one. Another is the lack of cars; it would have been good to add just a little more to the lineup.. Burnout 2: Point of Impact is a very slick arcade racing game. This installment of the Burnout series is bigger and better than the previous Burnout game. There are more cars to race and crash with like the Custom Sports Coupe and the Supercar. The game play is similar to the last one: Race against 4 cars through a variety of events, race through checkpoints in a set time limit and try to come first. The game gives you a generous amount of time to race from checkpoint to checkpoint so basically, you don't have to worry about reaching the next checkpoint in time and getting a ""Time up"" screen and then ending your race (if you crashed too much in the first game, you would find it difficult make it to the next checkpoint). You have a boost bar and you fill it by dangerous driving like near missing traffic or catching some air. When you fill the boost bar and use it in one go (you can only use it in one go anyway), you'll get a ""Burnout"" in which either you'll continue boosting (depends if you ranked up enough dangerous driving maneuvers while your boosting) or gain a boost bonus towards filling up the boost bar again. The graphics have slightly improved with new environments to race around like an Airport terminal or the snowy mountains. A new mode added in Burnout 2 called ""Crash"" has you choosing from a selection of Crash Junctions then crashing your selected car into another vehicle and trying to cause a big pile up. The more cars at the junction crash, the more points (or Dollars) you earn. The crashes like the first one are very meaty but unlike the first game, you can't save your crashes which is a shame. The game also features a pursuit mode in which you pursue someone and try to ram them off the road within a set road distance. To win cars, you either have to win them in some tournaments or ""Face off"" events in the game. There is a good championship mode with races to win and tournaments to compete in and returning from the previous game, there are also ""Face Offs"" in which you race against one car and if you win, you'll unlock the car you have just beaten. The music is kick-ass like the last game and while your boosting, the music becomes more intense which is nice and because this is the last Burnout game published by Acclaim and the next ones are published by EA, this is the last Burnout game with no licenced soundtracks. The game has a fantastic sense of speed when your boosting along at such speed and with that pumping soundtrack blasting out of your speakers, Burnout 2 is an ideal arcade racer which should appeal to people seeking some arcade racing action.â","""burnout 2: point of impact"" is a very slick arcade racing game . the graphics were amazing for a 2002 release and the game play was pretty exciting . the lack of a story line and lack of cars kept me wanting to play for hours on end ."

99.God of War II,"Story, controlls , graphs best of his year Its soft awesome game When I play this game first time It was the best game I've ever played.. ""Zoos your son has returned I bring the destruction of Olympus"". Masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game almost the best god of war of all time and the puzzles and the combat are just so amazing like spear of destiny and blade of Olympus. Builds off of the first one and keeps the same magic and makes the improvements like any great sequel should. Great fun and I recommend strongly. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's the best God of War Game of the original Trilogy. Especially when you can get this game on PS Plus Premium with a perfect Wifi Connection. It feels so good even if the game comes so time ago.. For meone of The best games in history without A very, very fairy game i'm sad for PersonsthatThey didn't play it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not as good as the first one but still a great game, the story got a little weird but was a good setup for the third game.. The god of war franchise is great if you only played the first game you should also play this on. The sense of scale is off the charts. From the opening brawl with the towering Colossus of Rhodes to the Island of Creation—a sprawling mega-level which takes a good half of the game to traverse—God Of War II's venue doesn't feel mortal for even a moment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Like the first one this one is also a must play with upgrade combat and a very good story. God of War II may in fact be the best action game ever made, no video game to this date managed to create an iconic intro like the The Colossus of Rhodes.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A step up from the first installment and leaves you with the biggest videogame cliffhanger I’ve ever experienced.. it is the best game in the world. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. O melhor god of war. For me it's hard to say if this or God of War(2005) is better because they both are absolute masterpieces.. Goosebumps guaranteed when we travel back in time to the moment of death. One of the best stories in PlayStation games. Like gow 1 It good too. Just perfect (homelander). The good times.. Very terrible writing, gameplay ****. If you like watching movies this game is for you as there is more cutscenes then gameplay.. God of War 2 is a game that I can't help but love. It's so over-the-top and ridiculous, but it's also so much fun. Kratos is a total badass, and he's always getting into crazy situations. The gameplay is satisfying, and the story is surprisingly engaging.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Masterpiece game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. God of War 2 is a timeless masterpiece that takes everything great about its predecessor and elevates it to new heights. This epic continuation of Kratos' journey through Greek mythology is a flawless display of action, storytelling, and sheer gaming brilliance, deserving every bit of its perfect 10/10 rating. The gameplay in God of War 2 is an absolute triumph. Kratos' combat prowess is refined and expanded upon, making every encounter an exhilarating experience. The fluidity of his movements, the weightiness of his attacks, and the variety of weapons at his disposal make for a combat system that is as satisfying as it is engaging. The puzzles and platforming elements seamlessly integrate with the action, adding depth and diversity to the gameplay experience. The story in God of War 2 is a masterclass in Greek mythology and character development. It delves deeper into Kratos' tragic past, his relentless quest for vengeance, and his tumultuous relationship with the gods. The narrative unfolds with cinematic flair, filled with epic moments, unexpected twists, and unforgettable encounters with legendary figures from Greek mythology. The voice acting is superb, further immersing you in the emotional turmoil of Kratos' journey. The soundtrack in God of War 2 is a symphony of epic proportions. From haunting melodies to bombastic orchestral arrangements, the music perfectly complements the intense action and dramatic moments, immersing you further into the world and enhancing the overall experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Was playing in that game on the android platform. It similar to other games from the series. Pretty interesting plot and nice combos combat fight model. God of War 2 is even more bad-ass than the first GOW. Santa Monica Studios were on a roll.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An original game but I prefer the 2005 one as it is much more violent it has more mutilation and blood but the 2 is still good. I didn't like this one so much in relation to the first one because in this one the story didn't end completely, there was a question mark that would only be told In the third game that only came out for PS3. This game was one of the main reason to buy the PlayStation 2 in the past for me. Brutal combat, amazing Greek mythology, awesome boss fights, the best graphics on the ps2 and epic music. The latest greatest hit from the ps2 era.. A big improvement from the first game. The combat has seen a number a great improvements, namely more unique and satisfying combat encounters and some truly awesome boss designs. The game also has some remarkably well aged cutscenes. The game is quite fun, but it and a lot of the series is brought down by the stop and start pacing that cuts off the angry brutal violence so that Kratos can solve a bunch of fairly brainless puzzles a child could solve.. God of War II is the best slasher and the best PS 2 exclusive. fantastic story , gameplay , boss fights , game design and music.. It´s an improvement on the last game, but not that much. The story isn´t great, but 3 makes it worth it, kinda.. One of da best sequels to a gane everrr imo.... They literally improved everything from gow 1.Better bosses, Story, Combat, puzzles etc.. ️. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. Blades of Athena,Barbarian Hammer,Spear of Destiny and Blade of Olympics is a wonderful variety of weapons to use. Great bonus play stuff with the costumes to the different Urns that grant different things like unlimited Magic,unlimited Rage of the Titans or one that replaces Cronos' Rage Magic with Poseidon's Rage Magic to give you more of the original GoW feel. I give God of War II a score of 10. The story is fantastic, the controls are still tricky, but I really enjoy the game; it's easier than the first game.. From the coattails of the original, God of War II surpasses and excites on every level. Combat has been slightly tweaked with new combos and attacks, as well as new and returning enemies that keeps things fresh but memorable. The story hits all of the bloody beats greatly, with an ending that builds up to an exciting climax. Puzzles have also gotten a slight upgrade, however some still fall flat as either repetitive or too simple. God of War II is an incredible example of how to do a sequel right without over bloating or being too similar to the original.. best god of war of all. if u disagree u have a bad taste on game, this game is a masterpiece.. great great great What can I say about this masterpiece? All versions of God's War are masterpieces and deserve praise. Gameplay - 10/10 Characters - 8.5/10 Visuals - 8.5/10 Story - 8.5/10 Uniqueness - 8.5/10. A Great game from the greatest game series. Even now i play the game sometimes. I love this game . Masterpiece 10/10. definitely an incredible game wich improved the combat of GoW1 in many ways but the story wasn't as good as the first game. God of War ll , of the all games with I have is a of the best games of the PS2. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is the same as the first game in terms of graphics and gameplay. It has taken a broader view of the story. CGI cutscenes are very good. Boss battles have increased. But there are too many quick-time events. Weapon and skill variety is good. My favorite innovation is the ""deflect"" mechanic. Some puzzles in the game are very good, some are weird. In general, it's a little better than the first game, but I think the first game was more impressive.. It's ok. The fighting is good but gets boring pretty quickly especially if you played other games in this franchise. the first god of war game I've ever experienced. It allowed me to have a good time with its story and the different gameplay mechanics it brought to the game. When I look back, I can say that it is the best game in the series except (God of War 2018 and later).. God of War II impresses just as the original did. Santa Monica Studios has hit a goldmine.. An incredible game that improves on everything the 1st had good. A game that in every second there is action which makes the game very immersive. A simply phenomenal soundtrack. The story is amazing that ends on a high point to have a continuation in God of War III. Great combat, great music, great sequel. The only negative aspect is that the bosses are less memorable. No name in this game stuck to me (aside from a few), despite the epic intros and good fights.. In this game, kratos is already a great playstation icon, santa monica studio consolidates the respect and recognition of gamers. GAMEPLAY: 10 STORY: 10 MUSIC: 10 VISUALS: 10 PERSONAL SCORE: 10 ¡¡ A MASTER PIECE !!. That was the game that made me to buy playstation after just 2 hours. This game is after 15 years is still enjoyable and a must play.. Yes, Kratos is back and he is the God of War. At least for a couple of minutes into the game he is. It really is not all that long before he is stripped of his godly powers so that he can defeat this giant statue with this really powerful sword. Well this turns out to be a trick by the king of the gods himself, Zeus and Kratos is killed. However, this is only the beginning, with the aid of Gaia one of the titans Kratos begins a search for the sisters of fate in a quest to undo the betrayal by Zeus and to kill Zeus. You get to go through more levels this time as there is less backtracking than there normally is in a game like this. So the game stays fresh throughout. Then you get to see other characters from Greek mythology and you normally get to see Kratos rip them apart in very unpleasant ways. There are a couple of good boss fights in this one, most you have to figure some trick to defeat them. At one point when I was fighting the Kraken I just could not figure out why it was not dying, then I figured out the trick necessary to kill him. The fighting is pretty much the same as the first game, but then if it is not broke do not fix it. Though as with the first game they give you extra weapons, but the default blades are still the best. All the other weapons just tend to lag while with the default ones, combat is so much smoother. Though there are a couple of really nice spells in this one as the earthquake spell really did some damage. The game is not perfect though, there are one to many timing puzzles that drove me crazy, and the game is once again on the short side. Still, it is nice to play a game that is not tailored to the online crowd and I am hoping that God of War III is also just a very grand single player adventure.. This game is a masterpiece, just like the other 2 main greek games and the newer 2018 Nordic one.. 9/10, its a better game than the 1st one in every way, but it still feels outdated. In my honest opinion i think God of war 2 is close to perfection as a sequel can get not as a game but as Sequel cus as A game it is Amazing but not perfect but i don't think there will be something that we as Human will Create and it will be perfect. But as a sequel it is perfect it Carries the story from the first game beautifully it fixes all the problems from the first GOW has and yeah i honestly don't Have anything bad to say about this game Just eat Your vegetables and play this masterpiece if you haven't already thank you. How can we make a game more epic than the first game? More weapons, better level designs, and better boss fights. This game has taken everything that was already good in the first game and made it even better, and this is not an easy thing to do. That's why God of War 2 is a legend. Also, this is the best God of War game. God of War (2018) is also great but this one is special. Plus, I must say that the soundtrack of this game is the definition of epic.. This game is such an amazing. I like the story of sparta the god of ancient Greek. the gameplay it's stunning. This game is added to my favorite games I ever played.. A great game, an amazing story, Kratos is the best spartan warrior. I just Love it.. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. Does not hold up well! Having played the original and not liking it and then decades later playing the PS4 God of War (technically the fourth entry) and realizing it is absolutely amazing I thought I would see what I was missing in the gap between. Turns out-""Frustration"" is the answer! Every time the camera pans through a new puzzle room I cringed, each enemy encounter includes about 10-15 more enemies than you'll enjoy fighting, and the story seems more interested in how violent they can make Kratos without anyone realizing that he just smashed an old man's face in to a table. The puzzles weren't difficult in design, but with no camera control and some puzzles requiring solving while you are getting hit by enemies-it becomes a real slog. There's also a really poorly implemented mechanic where you are turned to stone by Gorgon's. If, by chance, this happens in the air mid jump you shatter instantly. Really a frustrating way to have to repeat a section. This game is a product of a time where games were meant to be frustrating with very little story. We'll see if I can still stick with the series!. Good - the hack and slash is as good as the first one. Though nothing really new. - the pre-rendered cutscenes are nicer looking - the premise of the storyline is much more epic, teaming with gaia, then fighting zeus. - new enemy designs. Bad - Unconventional logic applied to some of the puzzles. Some things I felt could be done, couldn't, but could be only for specific puzzles the devs deemed. - the took out the roll into charge, making traversing slower and less amusing. - some weird camera angles. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sony Santa Monica refined the formula further for the second game of the series and expanded the scope of the narrative and gameplay. A near perfect sequel.. Take this review with a grain of salt, as I have never been a fan of the original God of War games. It combined two game mechanics that I despise the most: Button mashing and quick time events. That is why it took me so long to return to the series, God of War II, which is often regarded as the best God of War game from the old trilogy. It is definitely a good production. Graphics, sound, cutscenes all push the PS2 to its limits so if I were a game critic, maybe I would have rated this higher. Core game is still the same and I do not like it. I still hate button mashing; I still hate quick time events and God of War II has a lot of those. It is also as much a puzzle and platforming game as it is an action, so expect plenty of puzzle solving and precise platforming. So yes, it is an epic journey with some good boss fights and a great story, but it’s just not for me.. This game is better in every aspect, new creatures more intense bossfights and story moments, the ending it self makes the next part the masterpiece it is. Masterpiece! the best game of the saga masterpiece so very good goty nice very good is so good GOOD. God of war series is always stunning without the slightest flaw. This is an action game that is really full of action. The mechanics have improved since God of War I and it's an entertaining and classic game. However, I think that being in the same setting with the same goal has a bad impact on the game.. ""God of War II"" was arguably the last truly great PS2 game. Released during the twilight days of Sony's second console, it held up amazingly well. GOW II is a big sequel that refined and expanded upon its legendary predecessor. It might borrow a little too much from the first GOW, but it's still amazing. This is one of the best action titles of the late 2000's. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. Great game, not as good as God of War I but still good. I wish Sony would make a remake of these old video games, but who knows considering the turn in style that God of War IV took.. This game is a legend. Very fun and very enjoyable. It's technically a legend for its year of release. But I don't think it had a very satisfying ending and the death of Athena made me very sad. Man what? what is there to say about this masterpiece, its another one of my favorites, my second favorite of all time in fact and its not just about nostalgia, the game is great and deserves to be praised and played and replayed many times, its just pure fun. The graphics are some of the best the PS2 has to offer, the OST is amazing, bombastic, really makes you feel like you're a GOD of war combined with the terrific gameplay. I played this game before i palyed the first one, this one is 100 times better no doubt about it. Another one that i replay constantly, every year im revisiting this world because thats just how good it is.. God of War (2005) was an excellent game that did not take long to wait and for 2 years it brings us a full-fledged sequel. Is the success repeated, as in the first part? Is it also such a MASTERPIECE, or a failed sequel? I'll tell you straight. Another awesome game! God of War II follows right on where the first part ended. Again, not much is talked about and we continue in the threshing machine, which again knows no limits and is bloodthirsty, as was the case in the previous part. Again, it's about improving the character, which results in even better action. In short, God of War II repeats what God of War I meant by what worked and still works this time. Wonderful locations enriched with a masterful soundtrack and, of course, delicious battles. There will be some more puzzles, and one of them gave me a hell of a chance before I figured out what to do. As I mentioned, the game again has wonderful locations, which have undergone a slight change. The beautiful palaces, which they did, were also in the previous work, but here they came to me a little nicer. It will also occur in parts purely outside these buildings. I don't want to spoiler much, but let's say that as the desert is in number one, we will see a few such locations here as well. To sum it all up. God of War II repeats what God of War I does, but in my opinion it brings nothing new. Yes, the fact is that a lot of people object to the fact that there is a story that surpasses the number one and I have nothing against it. Personally, I liked the one of the first a little more, so God of War II lags a little behind the first part for me. But don't get me wrong. It's not a botched sequel. What's more… it's a successful proper sequel and an amazing game that I recommend.. Awesome game but for me a little boring story. Surely first God of War was better but that game is also a very good experience. An upgrade of something wich was already insane! Masterpiece of fun and challenge!. An excellent sequel. It takes a while to get going after the amazing introduction, but it's overall a great game. Perhaps a little weak in the puzzle criteria to its predecessor and it also may lack replay value due to its linearity. These are its only downfalls however.. The best God of War game in the franchise to **** best God of War game in the franchise to date.. one of the PS2s last super exclusives before the PS3 took over, retiring it. Kratos finally achieves everything hes worked for from the first game. only for the the first 5 minutes into the **** fight a colossus statue at the beginning of the **** lots of upgrades you get along the journey to zeus. great variety of distinct bosses from different parts throughout, the infamous sex scene mini game, ripping cyclopes eye out and so many awesome action packed quick time events finishing off certain enemies and bosses. titan mode is for the committed nothing to **** around with. lengthy story and all roung great storytelling. get this as a collection.. godofwar best game best story best gam play best graphic,kratos lovely game godofwar ,santamonica my love. Almost straight sequence in the first game, at least in my view. I was at the beginning of this one, I stopped and went to play Ghost of Sparta. In some ways I prefer the first game and in some this one. The story of God of War 2 is much more complex in narrative aspects than the first, but I liked it a little more, Kratos' story captivated me. The 'prologue' is quite frantic and cool to play. But the beginning of the game is really strange, Kratos is very pissed. I did some research and saw that Ghost of Sparta was made between the first and the second game 'fixing' this hole. Zerei Ghost of Sparta and I recommend playing before that. Anyway, my main criticism of the story was the presentation, I found the rhythm of the story very bad, at first it was reasonable but here the distance of each cutscene worsened a lot. Only the beginning and end of the game are full of them. Apart from that the game ends in the 'climax' of Kratos' story, which at first is badass, but the truth is that it is kind of a joke. The gameplay is better in general, but without major changes. The parry system is much more useful and is much more 'complex' than in the first game. The number of boss fights increased a lot compared to the first game, but that left most of them in that little striking. Some pretty bad sequences, like the one with the falling pillars and the one with the skeleton elevator. In the first game, this was practically non-existent. You can use 2 weapons 'at the same time' and the way of combining the two is reasonable, personally I didn't do much combining despite switching between 2 constantly. The puzzles remained good but I found them a little inferior in general. Some checkpoints are 'bad', something I had no problem with at first. Many things were reused in the first game, with slight changes, from textures to enemies, combos, and a specific skill. The graphics are very similar in general. The cinematics are fantastic, they were good in the first one, but here they are absurd. The soundtrack remains very unique and characteristic of the saga. I found it decent but very little varied.. It's a great expansion for the God of War franchise which accomplishes mainly everything it sets out to accomplish. Furthermore, if you're into pure rage killing and amazing gory finisher moves you're in for a treat as always. A great game for a classic franchise. Following the same formula as the first game and improved in every aspect. MORE epic and fun. Probably I played this game like 20 times. One of the most amazing games I ever play with.. Maybe my favorite GOW game of all time... I have a PS2 only for this game and GTA. God of War ll review Positives -Great gameplay -Atmospheric world -Challenging enemies -Great main character Negatives -Just like the first one, this one doesn't have a complex story either. Just like the first GOW, this is a very entertaining game with great fight system and it has the most badass main character ever written to video game but unfortunately the story is very basic.. In attempt to marathon GOW and GOW2 in preparation for GOW3, I played this game and finished it in 2 very long sittings only separated by sleep and some food. I will never forget that session. The game gripped me from the beginning since it continues directly from the first one. Amazing weapons and upgrades. Gameplay is solid and also some tricky puzzles and gory finishers. Enjoyed the story and the insane set pieces a lot.. PS2 classic and one of its best games, Who wouldn't want to fight a giant statue and beat the crap out of it? That's God of War II for you.. The best PS2 game, and better that PS4 franchise game. Graphics, control, sound... a real beast this game. 10.. I replayed this game to get ready for the new God of War on the PS4. I loved it back when I first played it, but for some reason I didn't care for as much as I use to. Maybe as I grew older, I started realizing that Kratos was a one dimensional character, or maybe because I played it so much that I know were everything is by memory. Anywho, I still wanted to give it credit were credit is due.. The perfect Hack & Slash game ever, even 13 years later is better than the most actual games Nothing to change, simply perfect. Strong sequel with a brutal narrative. Dives deeper into Kratos as a character and introduces new elements to the world. Great play.. The best game in the series and a must play game for anyone who like adventure and action games.. one of the first games i got on my ps2 cause the og was just borrowed to me. i played this to death dammit i cant even keep count amazing game if it tops the og? hmm cant say but def on pair ! wich vers is better this one or the ps3 one?. Story - 9/10 Graphics - 10/10 Levels - 10/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay value - 9/10 Gameplay - 10/10 GoW II is a masterpiece on all levels, the pacing is perfect, the levels are varied and have all a different vibe to them and the gameplay is fine-tuned to perfection. This game pushed the ps2 to its limits and its still manages to impress me to this day. In my opinion GoW II has some of the best locals of any GoW game and some of the most memorable moments as well. A must play for GoW fans and for action-adventure fans 9/10. Kratos has gotten his revenge and is now the new god of war. But this is just the beginning of his journey as he has still has not gotten what he rally wanted his redemption. Now he is on a journey to do something even the gods cant do to change his faith. For the sequel they did not slow down. It is on the same level as the original. Gameplay wise it is better. The battle system is improved, works excellent and you have even more options than before. As before you can level up your weapons and get new abilities. Also you acquire new equipment that gives you new skills and challenges. The puzzles are well implemented with the before mentioned new skills. Story wise it is great but maybe a bit weaker than the prequel. Again there are good twists and reveals. The final and the cliffhanger are some of the best of its generation if not in all videogames. I showed it friends who did not play the series and all were astonished and impressed. The graphics have improved and the soundtrack is incredible good. Especially the tracks The End begins, The Glory of Sparta and Way of the Gods. I must also mention the engaging boss battles. I wont spoil but will say there are many memorable ones. Overall this was an incredible sequel on the same level as the original. Maybe it is slightly better or worse depending on your preferences.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. An epic return of Kratos with epic battles and cool new gameplay mechanics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You don’t even need to say a lot, god of war II managed to stay perfect with excellent gameplay, graphics and history, one of the best games ever made in this century. Amazing god of war game, its improved on its first game and everyone should play it.. Action gameplay feels like it is holding something back because of its release on the PS2. It feels like it's sacrificed itself to make God of War 3 good as it was. This is the best game in the series imo, great boss fights like any other game in gaming story, the soundtrack is iconic and the story is EPIC. One of the best game i ever play and the ending was amazing that i have to watch it again and again. +Combat +Parkour +Atmosphere +Bosses +QTE's +Ending - The biggest flaw of the game is **** is not as good as the first one.. An awesome sequel, the combat is improved, graphics are improved, even the story is improved, another amazing addition to the franchise.. God of War 2 is a 2007 hack and slash action-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony. + One of the best Hack and Slash + A Fantastic Story for a Hack and Slash Game with Great Voice Acting, Tons of Extras and Unlockables + Amazing Graphics and Good Soundtrack + Several more Bosses than the First Game + One of the Most Badass Ending My Score: 9.7/10. Very similar to its predecessor, GoW 2 is a little bit better with its more creative level design and slightly longer playtime. That being said, it retains the strengths, but also weaknesses (frustrating trial-and-error, quick-time events) of the original game. If you liked God of War, you'll also like God of War 2. This is another must-play for PS2 and one of the best Action games out there. Score: 84 / 100. The best game in the series, although keep in mind I've played all the games before the norse reboot so my opinion may well change. Epic cinematic feel is the strong suit of the game, Kratos controls and pulls off outlandish stunts reminiscent of the ancient warrior epics he's based on. I usually don't like brutality in games but in this game it's entertaining. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. The second God of War game is far superior to the original for the sole fact that it isn’t as unforgiving as the first game. I know what you’re thinking oh Brandon is a little girl who needs his hand held through all his games. That’s not it at all because it wasn’t the combat in the original that pissed me off; it was the unforgiving puzzles that drove me to the point of insanity. God of War 2 has puzzles that test your brain not how quickly you can jump from one box to another. The story of God of War 2 starts with Kratos as the God of War and let’s just say the dude is still **** pissed about the whole family thing. I am still not going to spoil God of War because I believe there are still people out there who haven’t played it and would like to. So Kratos decides to have his armies ransack cities loyal to certain Gods. I forget why but he is pissed at every God for what has happened. He ends up pissing off Zeus and Zeus tricks him into syphoning his powers into this sword to beat this well living statue. Which again bravo God of War it starts you out as a badass fighting a giant monster. Granted a giant statue isn’t half as cool as fighting the Hydra but it isn’t much of a step down. After his powers are drained into the sword that’s when Zeus strikes and kills Kratos. You heard me boys and girls he kills him. In doing so that sends him to the underworld, where he meets the Titians. They tell him about how the Gods came to be and they also help him escape the underworld to extract his revenge. The rest of the game is Kratos finding a way to stop Zeus from killing him. The game has a weird twist at the end for those of you that have played this game what’d you think of the twist I thought that was weak and more of a “really?” moment. The game sounds great the music hasn’t changed well at all and in all honesty in all the God of War games the music is about the same. Kratos talks a hell of a lot more he isn’t ","""Zoos your son has returned I bring the destruction of Olympus"". Great game almost the best god of war of all time . builds off of the first one and keeps the same magic and makes the improvements like any great sequel should ."
990.Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3,"An awesome tactical shooter that utilizes the Splinter Cell graphics engine. The story mode is all about clearing rooms using squad commands. When this was online, you could play through it cooperatively with three other buddies. Of course, the competitive multiplayer was the real reason this game was a success. It was the ""Rainbow Six Siege"" of its day. While it's limited to local play, Rainbow Six 3 is still enjoyable. But during its heydey, this was a 9 out of 10.. this game all I can really say is boring boring BORING this abomination **** is one of the worst games I have ever played the missions are boring is very confusing on where to go and even though this game only sells for about $1 now just don't get it. The most addictive and challenging gameplay.. A great accomplishment in game design. Great multiplayer, single player's still good. Both terrorist hunting & team survival will keep you entertained for quite a long time. Too bad they can't make a game like this anymore.","an awesome tactical shooter that utilizes the Splinter Cell graphics engine . the story mode is all about clearing rooms using squad commands . it's limited to local play, but Rainbow Six 3 is still enjoyable ."
991.Fight Night Champion,"Worst boxing game in history. The story to the roster to the controls. An absolute disgrace to the sweet science.. Not bad. Managed to get through several hours of the story and still struggled with the control scheme. The mapping doesn’t even use half the buttons on the controller, assigning punches to right stick. The over-the-shoulder camera angle is odd considering that almost every fighting game has either a top-down or side view. Perhaps I’m just a little disappointed after hearing everyone sing their praises about the game, but I found it rather lacking, the story taking precedence over gameplay.. FNC is ridiculously unfair. It seems the same maggots who judged the first GGG/Canelo fight programed this game. Filthy rat-faced cheaters. TickTock slime.... STILL the best boxing game out there... Undisputed might have just come out but believe me, nothing beats this!. The best boxing game ever.. Had some cheap thrills blasting through the campaign in amateur difficulty. There's something quite satisfying about flattening opponent after opponent with the power sliders tuned up.. A fun game but she's gotten old terribly. Interesting idea with punches on the analog.. The boxing in this game is great. The controls are simple, as opposed to the over-complicated control scheme that plagued previous releases. However, the game comes to a screeching halt when it comes to the game modes. There's Champion Mode, which is good, but you can pretty much only play it once as it's a story mode. There's Legacy Mode, which is a career mode where you **** that's it. You don't get to pick your trainer, you don't get to pick venues, you don't even get to pick sponsorships. Legacy Mode gets boring VERY fast as a result. There's another mode called Bare Knuckles Mode, which is exactly what it sounds like, but you have to buy it. Overall, a decent game if all you want to do is box, but if you're looking for a boxing game with an in-depth career mode, don't bother.. FNC was as good as it's predecessors. The joystick control is easy to adapt to.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fight Night Champion is a solid sequel to Round 4, which was already solid in it's own right. The gameplay feels quite similar to Round 4, but the brutality of the sport's biggest wars is very well replicated in this game. Movement is improved, and the controls feel far more fluid and responsive than before. So while the gameplay isn't really that different to Round 4, it maintains a solid foundation and improves on it. Unfortunately, Legacy Mode sees no major changes. Graphically, the game looks great on the 360, and runs very well. Fighters' likenesses are very close to real life, and the arenas look great. Champion Mode (the story) was where this game really put all it's eggs in the basket, but is ultimately very mediocre. I like how it covers corruption in sports, but the majority of fights are heavily scripted (i.e. one punch from a fighter will knock you out from rounds 1-3, but do nothing in round 4, or the game decides what round you can finish the fight in etc. So it ultimately isn't very enjoyable, but it's short at 2 hours, so it doesn't outstay it's welcome. The soundtrack is decent, but the sound design is great overall, due to the great sounds of punches. Overall, Fight Night Champion is a very enjoyable game that is worth playing.. Ever since I was obsessed with the NES ""Punch-Out!"", I've been searching for the next great boxing sim. With playable characters like Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, and Mike Tyson, I thought this had the chance to be great. Unfortunately, like with most pugilistic video game efforts, it is just too difficult to play without a steep learning curve. Though playing as classic boxers is fun, it doesn't make up for the fact that boxing video games have almost an impossible task when it comes to controls. I played this with some friends for a couple of hours, and after that time all we determined is that we would need more practice to truly be good. A LOT more practice. Until you completely master the various punching/blocking/dodging controls, you it is pretty much just randomly hitting buttons and hoping for results. For a comparison: Shortly after trying this game out, I also got WWE 2K14 for the XBOX 360. Within one match, I could easily pick up the controls and had great fun with the game. I knew there was more in-depth controlling I could do, but I didn't need to be an expert button-er to dive right in. This relegated ""Fight Night"" to the back of the gaming shelf. Overall, then, while this game is so tantalizing in offering all the classic fighters from days gone by, the controls still are not good enough to make it all that fun ****. Unless you really want to invest the time into perfecting it, don't bother picking this one up.. One of the best boxing game . Popular and awesome boxers eg Muhammed Ali . Awesome fight system, beatiful graphics and normal controls and gameplay . Good Game . About this game little can you said, but I think this game is best game with Muhammed Ali and this game is amazing boxing and fighting game, even one of the best game of 2011 . Good Game .. For anyone thinking of buying this game, listen to this logic: You throw 200 punches (100 of which are not blocked) into your opponent's head. Get punched twice. Now you're down for the count. There are many good alternatives to this game that won't make you rage quit after every match. The boys at EA Canada pulled out a brilliant release, a captivating game that makes you feel the essence of boxing in every aspect. The graphics and the physics are polished, gorgeous. The gameplay is slick and realistic, very intuitive. The full-spectrum controls are easy to learn, yet challenging to master. The Legacy Mode, while having a few flaws, is quite entertaining. A great Story Mode is the cherry on the top, along with the rich soundtrack. I don't get much of the user's critics. Many seem more like butthurts who just keep losing because they make fundamental mistakes. Bare in mind that this isn't your average Tekken, so it doesn't matter if you pull out a 100 combo out of your arse, because if you do, you will remain without stamina, and then it will be a piece of cake for your opponent to knock you senseless. Trust me people, this is one of the best fighting simulators around, and you can find it at a measly price. A must buy, 9/10.. I really love this game. I have never wrote a review on a game before. But I had to write my review on this game. The reason why I love it so much, is because the story mode. I hope my review helps to make EA sports continue to make boxing games have a story mode to it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was to short. Hopefully next time the story mode will be longer.this is the best boxing game ever.. Fight Night Champion is a decent game. It simply doesn't deserve anything less than 6/10 or anything more than 8/10. I'll explain why. Unlike many of the previous reviewers of this game, I have actually played it sufficiently to fully understand it's depths and what it has to offer (I have probably sunk some 600+ hours into this game). Don't let the nostalgia fool you. This is easily the greatest boxing game ever created. Unfortunately, there hasn't really been much competition in the past, has there? Let's start off by evaluating just how well this game does boxing justice. Fairly well. It does do a very good job of simulating the sweet science. Controls are fluid and responsive for the most part and punches are crisp. You will find no problem coming up with varied combinations and fight plans. One thing I will mention; if your console is aging, you could run into performance problems with this game. I have noticed delayed movement frame rate problems which constantly plague the game on my 3 year old console. I never experienced this a year or two ago. Let's talk about offline play. This game has a lot to offer in this department (and it's probably where you will find the most fun). The story mode only lasts a good 2-3 hours, however while incredibly cliche, it is fairly well paced and fun. The only tripes I have with the story mode is the incredibly annoying fights in which you are handicapped (only one arm or no body shots ect) and the final boss fight with Isaac Frost. Compared to the rest of the game, the Isaac Frost fight is needlessly difficult. I happen to be ranked 28th on the world leader boards for this game (1400 wins, 110 losses) and I still find this fight aggravatingly difficult. Regardless, it shouldn't take you more than 10 attempts to complete it. The next offline mode is legacy mode. Basically you create your own fighter and train him up while taking fights until you become champion. It's fairly boring as you'll be spending the majority of your time engaged in annoying sluggish training mini-games. The final offline mode is straight now quick match mode. I spend most of my time here fighting the CPU with various match ups. You can either use legitimate fighters or create your own. Now I have mixed feelings about the online portion of fight night. On one hand, it's incredibly addictive, but that's probably only because I am so good at it. Other than that, the game is just extremely exploitable and it shows when fighting real opponents. The first online mode called head to head allows you and your opponent to fight each other with the licensed boxers found in the original game (and the fictional story mode boxers). The problem with this is that mostly everyone will flock to the most powerful fighters for the weight class they are fighting it. Prepare to fight Tyson, Frost, Robinson, Duran and Whitaker over and over again. The second online mode called OWC (online world championship) allows you to create your own boxers and slowly improve them over time via the experience points gained from winning matches (or paying EA This mode is simply a disgrace. Why you ask? It's easily exploitable. You won't find a single person that isn't spamming the sidestep uppercut or the backstep straight or running the whole fight. Not only that, people always create boxers with the maximum allowed reach+height in order to gain an advantage over the opponent. Just steer clear of OWC. It's exploit central. This game could have been so much more, but the developers were too lazy to listen to their community. We asked time and time again for these exploits to be fixed, but no one ever listened. While the most skilled person will still usually win the fight; bums can easily fight on an even playing field just by learning a few game breaking exploits (like the backstep straight, sidestep uppercut while constantly running the whole fight). So essentially, I guess this games real problem is a combination of lazy developers and a childish exploitive community. It is possible to have perfectly functional fun boxing matches in this game, just make sure you pick your opponents wisely. graphics: 9.5/10 offline gameplay: 9/10 online gameplay: 6/10 (exploitable) sound: 7/10 story: 6/10 lasting appeal: 8/10. Firstly, I enjoyed this game, particularly the customisation available and the ability to create a character that can face off against your friends or strangers and develop. However, this game has several flaws, that take it away from being a solid game. Firstly, the Champion mode is far too short. It took me a few hours of gameplay to complete. For a game's main storyline, this is far too short. Secondly, EA made several mistakes with this game, the most frustrating for me was the boxer that you encounter in Champion mode that drains your energy when he clinches with you. He is incredibly difficult to defeat because at any point during the game he can clinch you, completely drain your stamina and then hit you with a single hook that will nearly completely knock you down due to the fact that when you have low stamina on this game, you turn into Gretchen Grundler from Recess. My final issue with this game is the online play. On the face of it, it appears to be good, and indeed in my first match I won with a knockout and I was feeling good about it, as it appeared to put fighters on a level playing field. However from then on, I constantly played fighters who were at least 10 skill levels above me (due to lack of online players) and got beaten 7 times in a row, with my blocks appearing to be useless. I thought that I had just come up against some better players until I did some research online and found that this is a common problem, it is essentially a pay to win online mode. However, this game is best played by creating interesting characters and taking them through legacy modes (which can become boring) and playing against friends. If you see this game for under £10 I would recommend it, I wouldn't be too keen on paying much more though.. The same as FNR4 but with a **** story and Impossible boss fight .................................................................................................................................... It's the worst game i've ever played (no exaggeration) and i'm a huge fan of FN3 and FN4. The entire story mode is basically Rocky 4 and lasts for about 2 hours. Online gameplay is awful, fictional characters are allowed in ranked games, Andre Bishop and Issac Frost (two made up characters) have higher stats than Muhammed Ali and Ray Robinson. EA are charging people money to buy points to upgrade their online fighters in world championship mode, i find this disgraceful. The gameplay has no fluidity, the judging system is a mess, boosters, laggers and cheaters are still up to their old tricks. It's truely awful, a 0 doesn't do it justice. How they can take a game as good as FN4 and make it as bad as FNC? it just shows they don't know what there doing. The amount of patches this game has had from it's original release to now is unbelievable. They have changed the judging, removed perfect block, reduced stamina, increased stamina, reduced speed, raised speed, messed about with power. 1 punch ko's happen all the time....i'd be ashamed if i made this game, it's a huge cluster of everyones input and ideas and ends up a complete mess. Next time release the game when it's the finished article and don't cheapen boxing fans by spending your budget on a gimmicky story mode. Stay clear. I used to box actively. And this game resembles boxing almost to perfection! :) You can move while punching. Lounge in with punches. Even throw overhands. :) You can even implement strategies like the real thing. (outside jab and move/bob weave to inside body shots etc.) So many possibilities! :) I've been playing this game locally with my boxing friends over, and we NEVER get bored with this. A real gem!. Best online sports experience I've ever had. very robust online element. huge ""legacy mode"" keeps you busy off-line as well. flash knockdowns have never felt so real. catalog of fighters is extensive. if your a boxing fan, this is your game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I like the fast pace. I like the improved punch control over FN4. I like the brutality. Those things said, this is a horrible game. Training is ridiculous. The computer is given unfair advantage in many exchanges (things like punching through blocks and miraculously surviving button-strike haymakers only to knock you out with a feather jab). Worst of all..there are constant crashes and lock-ups.... I sold it within a week of the purchase.. This game is great. It's a fun enjoyable experience for one to play with alone but it's much more fun with friends. The roster in this game is great with many famous faces as well as downloading boxers and creating your own. The champion mode is really fun and I found it enjoyable throughout. The legacy mode is great and gives you hours of time on your road to becoming the Greatest of All Time. I haven't played much online but it seems solid and I've had a few good fights on it. The game also holds a pretty sweet soundtrack. The AI seems to be the problem at the moment. It seems that it can be really dumb at times or way too hard to beat.. the graphics are pretty good and the sound is top notch (whats with the swearing in games these days?) but the controls for this game still feel a little sluggish, the fighters take forever to just move around the ring and using the analogue to punch just feels very random and you dont always feel in control of your fighters punches/moves. overall for me an average game.. Being an avid fan of boxing and video games,i say EA has done a good job of giving the player a sense of being in the ring. Whether you like total punch control, using the right analog stick, or just buttons in order to fight, the options to adjust controls are there. Once in the ring, the game appears latent until you realize the lag is apparently intentional. Button presses seem to be delayed in order to fine tune your attack/strategy. e.g. Unintentionally tap the jab button 4 times rapidly, and your character will continue to throw extra punches you may feel you didn't call for, when really 4 were input intentionally or out of panic. The punches in Champion feel solid when landing, and also demand respect depending on player used, power, stamina and/or countering with power modified* punch. Some will nitpick over minute details like static blood (pointless), and repetitive mechanics, but compare that to the performance and feel in the ring. Knockout animations are not great but are better than the last few iterations and the fights can be fought they way the player intends to. Unsure of your opponents skill or power and would rather score points and be evasive? Pick the right boxer and give it a go. Not all boxing matches are exciting to watch and frustrating an opponent into fighting sloppy is all apart of the game.. Def. not a boxing fan but i reallly enjoyed this game. It was fun and easy enough a noob to fighting games to pick this up and be able to hold my own. But the great part is its VERY deep that you can still enjoy it after learning all the nuisances. Only complaint was online matches... ran into abunch of guys dumping every point they bought into one punch and man when you do that it doesnt matter what you do if they tag you with that punch once its over.. As a huge fan of the series (well, specifically of Round 3 which is where the innovation leaped ahead and then subsequently died) this game was mostly a dissappointment to me. The new champsionship mode is essentially a very short but entertaining story mode, and even as a very skilled player I was frustrated with the final boss battle - essentially your ability to choose how to fight is completely taken away and you must ""do exactly what the game says"" and not play the game as a sentient being capable of making your own decisions. Legacy Mode is what I typically purchase FN games for, and this one is just as mind numbingly difficult as FNR4's was, except there is a catch - you see, EA has graciously added purchaseable DLC to help you improve your character, because spending real life money is significantly easier than getting even a reasonable score on the absurdly difficult and blatantly designed to make you purchase DLC training games. Yes, the training games are even more ridiculously hard than they were in FNR4. Oh, and because I picked this game up at gamestop used to save a few bucks - I actually ended up having to pay EA $10 in DLC fees just to have access to Online Mode (which was entirely not worth the money). While playing Legacy Mode and failing miserably at the training games, my character was obviously falling short of where his progression should have been I started to notice that the developers had just re-used a LOT of commentary from FNR4... which makes the game feel like the cheap EA clone factory sports installment it really is. Despite being a huge fan of the franchise, I have to give this installment a 6/10 for the complete lack of innovation, the short ""story mode"", and the annoying DLC requirements. Hopefully this will be the last time EA fools me out of my money on any sports title ever again.. Being a veteran Fight Night gamer by now, I find this latest installment of the franchise entertaining again, but unfortunately with too little of innovation. Yes, the champion mode is a welcoming dimension, in fact it is the best what the game has to offer for experienced and new players. But this mode is fairly shallow, short but nevertheless much fun. Personally I think this is the direction EA has to take with Fight Night since the legacy mode is, once again, boring and repetitious (especially trainings are still terrible). Considering the gameplay itself; the fighting has been simplified for the better and this has definitely improved the pickup and play element. Blocking has become easier and the haymakers are gone although it is possible to perform hard but slow punishments. Dodging is still tricky and needs a lot of practice to master. Sound and graphics (slightly improved) are, once again, good (although the OST of round 4 is better I presume). But is it realistic? No, it is still fairly common that your fighter is capable of throwing punch after punch after-or-while being hit by the opponent (but that's ok). Fun? Definitely still, but it is more of the same compared to the previous installments instead of truly a new game. The only new elements worthwhile mentioning are the use of button controls besides (the simplified use of the) right analog stick, the too short but fun champion mode and the soundtrack. My advice is rent for the experienced, a go for the interested.. punches flow smoothly with joystiq controls. the animation is also much more fluid i don't feel like i'm playing rockem sockem robots like i did with the previous installments. paquioa's combos look as fast and devastating as they do in real life. i give it a 8.5. 9 for multiplayer it's real fun when playing against other fans of the game. it makes for a good **** talking session. 8 for story mode.. I want to say i love this game and that i hate it. I love it because it has a story for the first time that is acually good, it allows you to use the controls however you want and the graphics are very good. BUT there are also reasons to pass this by, The story is good but not long enough it can be easily beaten within 3 - 6 hours. And when your done with the story you can try online leagues or you can try to make your own destiny where you can either make your own boxer or pick one that is already premade and that gets repetitive and boring and the appeal wares off easily. This game is one of those games that you should either pass by or wait for a prise drop.. Sorry, forgot to score it along with my rant. Its terrible. Gets 2 marks for the visuals and -8 for a rubbish interpretation of boxing. EA hang your head.. It has to be said that FN Champion's gameplay is a thing of beauty - the way the boxers move, punch, block and lean is top notch and a clear improvement from Round 4. EA Sports however decided to make the terrible decision and include the random stunning and knocking out of opponents which can turn a beautiful, tactical rendition of the sport into Mike Tyson's Punchout. Aside from that flaw other elements could have been vastly improved from R4, including the legacy mode. Whilst legacy mode has had some of the fat trimmed it still suffers from most of the pitfalls that other EA Sports 'season modes' suffer including the now legendary 'EA inbox from hell'. Your email is the place where all your most boring colleagues inundate you with tiresome tales about rivalries and sponsorship. The legacy mode could have incorporate some kind of interactive weigh in or pre-fight interview where you could decide what to do to your opponent instead of being sent the same emails with only the fighter's name changed. This is where EA Sports need to take a look at themselves, they often produce technically sound simulations but fail when it comes to making a fun and interesting experience. FN Champion can be a hoot (especially with friends) but once the gloss wears-off the flaws do tend to ****.. Solid advancement on previous versions yet nothing spectacular. best and worst of all is the new championship mode. as a solid veteran fight nighter i started championship mode on the second easiest level (cant remember the name) prgressed through with great success and definitely enjoyed the improving opponents on the way through. BUT.....lets just say completing the finale was torture. not so much too hard as too time consuming to get through to checkpoints and after hours of swearing and tantrums i finally got through. all i felt was relief and i can honestly say the adventure has completley turned me off the game. i will never play it again. all those who conquer it effortlessly i salute you.. Fight Night Champion is a good-ass game. Having not played Round 4, the leap from Round 3 to Champion is pretty damn crazy. The storyline mode they added is a nice diversion, but the best part of the game is the actual boxing. The stick controls have been dramatically improved, and the game looks and flows much better now. The motion blur makes fights look mad cool.. While like many sports games aren't really improved considering they're always released every year this one is no different. What is different however is its new story mode or as it's called champion mode. This is considered the biggest difference in the sports games. The story mixed with is well thought out and nearly perfect in regards of challenges except for one particular fight that may leave people infuriated--look at the blogs about why people are pissed off right now! The control scheme is improved for those who don't do to well with analog sticks as you can now strike with the punch of a button. No point in talking about graphics as fight night graphics is always good. Overall this game is a worthy purchase for those boxing fans as it now contains an extended roster of over 50 fighters and a brand new and surprisingly good story.. I couldn't be more disappointed in this game. I had very high hopes, considering their last installment was good. All I found was a clone of Fight Night 4, including Legacy mode which was a complete debacle, not to mention the horribly difficult training games. Online mode has many exploits and crashes constantly, and in offline mode the game crashes constantly as well. I sold it the same week, on ebay.. Best boxing game of all time, and the most well rounded simulation fighting experience on this generation of consoles. Champion mode sets a new direction for sports titles - tapping into the drama and emotion that we see in sports movies and combining that with world class simulation gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nice game. I started to play it then i was just bored. Then i watched The Fighter with Christian Bale and gained wish for playing ****...nice cinematic experience of intro campaign, hard AI.. Champion Mode is a great addition to the series and an exciting development for the sports game enthusiast. A story that pulls you along and gets you into the game. Outstanding graphics and gameplay. New controls that make it easier to start fighting and every animation in the game looks 100 times better. This is the best boxing game in the series. Hands down.. Amazing graphics, very good gameplay, improved controls and robust feature set. Champion Mode is an exciting new addition to the sports genre but Legacy Mode and online play are still a whole lot of fun. Still a little room for improvement, but easily the best Fight Night yet.. Generally, I have always been a huge fan of EA licensed sports games. My biggest criticism of them is that there never seems to be enough new or original content to justify a new game every year. For example, EA's NHL '11 had no noticeable gameplay improvements over the previous year's NHL title, and Tiger Woods PGA '11 had only minor gameplay refinements over the previous release. Fight Night: Champion (released March 1 for the XB360 and the PS3) is the newest title in EA's successful boxing franchise known for its realistic boxing physics, tight gameplay and true to life graphics. So, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Is Champion just another rehash of Fight Night: Rounds 3 and 4, or is there something more to this year's title?"" There have been several improvements made to Fight Night. Yeah, amazing isn't it? Probably the biggest update is the gameplay itself. Do not adjust your set; Champion plays a lot faster than Round 4 did. The overall pacing of the game and the punch delivery feels much faster and more realistic. I have never boxed a round in my life, but I watch it on TV occasionally, and these guys seem to move pretty quick. These refinements are made possible by the enhanced controls - gone are the days of attempting complicated semi-circles with the right analogue stick to perform punches in the heat of battle. Just flick the right stick in a specific direction to perform all the punches you need. All the same throws you know and love are still here, it's just way easier and more natural to pull them off. No weird semi-circle nonsense. Champion mode is the all new single player campaign that follows a young boxer by the name of Andre Bishop. You start out in prison, get beat down by some skinheads, then flashback to your early days competing in the Olympics. During the campaign you and Andre go through a lot together, and you witness his evolution from lightweight rookie to heavyweight powerhouse. Champion mode is meant to be an extended tutorial that teaches you everything you need to excel and stay competitive online and off. Fighting in different environments and eras was very interesting. The graphics are as sharp as ever with no noticeable frame rate issues during gameplay. The material of the boxing shorts and the sweat look photo-realistic. The punishment you inflict on your competitor's face looks great also - split your opponents lip, and the effect is seen on your body and trunks. Fight Night: Champion boasts another EA title first: an M for Mature rating. Sorry kids. The only downside to the graphics are the cut-scenes. They look good enough, but there are lots of glitches and frame rate problems. I found that the in-game graphics looked better than the cinematics. Champion features the largest roster of any of the Fight Night titles with 50 boxers over 7 weight divisions. Favorites such as; Muhammad Ali, George Foreman (young and old), Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holifield and Iron Mike Tyson are represented in all their glory. Legacy mode returns from Round 4 and is by far the least appealing part of Fight Night: Champion. You create a boxer and build him through training to be a professional swing doctor. If only it were that cool - in contrast to Champion mode, it feels slow and sluggish. In my opinion, Champion mode should be the main single player campaign, not Legacy. The plus side of Legacy is the new economy system that allows you to train in better facilities and fund your career with sponsorships earned. The multiplayer aspect of Champion is great if you prefer battling real people over the clever AI. Online you will start off severely underpowered and have to build yourself from the ground up. The ability to create your own gym and have other players join is a nice touch. If you're looking for the ultimate boxing experience than look no further than Fight Night: Champion. If you're a fan of the previous games in the series, than you will be pleased with the amount of new content and improved gameplay. All I would like to see next time is an expanded Champion mode that replaces Legacy. 8/10. This game **** for one simple reason. When in a fight, the damned referee keeps moving in front of the came","managed to get through several hours of the story and still struggled with the control scheme . overall, a decent game if all you want to do is box . but if you're looking for a boxing game with an in-depth career mode, don't bother ."
992.Katamari Damacy,"This is one of the best games Ive ever have played. Especialy at almost the end of the game, so much fun! And now even nostalgy feeling. 12/10 a must play game!!!. An extremely fun ridiculous game that is easy to pick up and go and play anyday. Mindless Fun Katamari Damacy ReRoll is a game that was recommended to me years ago and was described as, ""A game to switch your brain off and relax."" And that description has never been more apt. The premise of the game is simple, you start off as a little ball and you roll over things to make your ball bigger which allows you to pick up bigger things, until you reach your goal and spiral out of control. If I recall correctly, this version of the game is a remaster of the 2004 PS2 version, however I hadn't really heard of this franchise growing up and I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I'd have been able to appreciate it until now, even if it is technically a ""Kids game."" The art style is so cute and colourful, generally pleasant to look at. Although you can't expect this kind of game to be graphically intensive, especially when you're rolling and collecting what is essentially cities, so don't go looking for ""Realism"" in this type of game. The soundtrack is definitely one of the best selling points of this game, it definitely makes you feel good and I'd be surprised if it didn't trigger some kind of dopamine hit in your system, dancing away collecting and rolling about. This is definitely something I'll revisit when looking to decompress and chill out and overall just make my day a bit better down the line. Oddly enough as well, when I went on steam's store page, I noticed that there's a new one coming out on Steam on the 1st of June, so that'll definitely be a buy for me. Katamari Damacy ReRoll is a very Japanese game but it's super enjoyable and I don't really see anybody not enjoying it. Sure the controls can be a bit jank at times but I never had an issue completing a mission. 8/10 for what it is - Looking forward to future installments.. Katamari Damacy is all about mashing together disparate elements and enjoying the chaos that ensues. The crazy characters, weird music, and unique gameplay are all rolled up into a charming, surreal experience.. as simple as it is fun. great audio and visuals. really stands out from other videogames and genres even in 2021. deserved all the awards it's won.. One of the funniest, ridiculous games I’ve ever played. The soundtrack is superb and the gameplay is extremely unique.. Despite the simplicity of Katamari Damacy, I struggle to define it with any sort of genre label because of how unique the entire experience ends up being. Whether it be the vibrant art design, the hilarious writing, the addicting gameplay, the eclectic soundtrack or the unique control scheme, Katamari Damacy finds ways to impress in almost every single regard. You play as the son of The King of All Cosmos, A.K.A God. He accidentally destroys most of the universes stars, and also the moon. And now it’s up to you to take responsibility for the impacts of your irresponsible father’s action and make some replacement stars on Earth. How do you make the replacement stars? Well by rolling up random junk of course. The game has you push around a large ball (Katamari) and roll up objects and creatures that are smaller than the Katamari in an attempt to make it as big as possible before the time runs out – there are other level objectives in the game too which make for some nice variety. Despite having a timer, Katamari Damacy rarely feels tense, but always feels exciting. Levels are absolutely jammed tight with various items and creatures for you to roll up, and it is such a joy to see all of these different creations in play. Creatures have different behaviors, each model is just as detailed as the last, they all have their own sound effects and all of them are placed in clever spots and situations throughout the whole game. Objects and creatures must be smaller than the Katamari for you to roll up, this means that certain routes and areas in levels will either open or close to you as you play. For example; you might make your Katamari too big and will be unable to find hidden items under a car, or your Katamari might be too small and will mean you’re unable to get up some stairs. This means levels and the way you navigate them are constantly changing as you play, and it never gets old. This core mechanic of tracking down the next right sized thing to roll up, plus trying to get as big as possible in the time limit paired with the fact you also need to be observant of your surroundings makes for a really clever and fun little game. As well as obviously trying to make your Katamari big, you also amass a collection of different items throughout the game which can be viewed from your home planet in between levels. This is a fun little addition which makes for some good replay value, as well as making your time rolling up random junk a little bit more meaningful. There are plenty of hidden items and other hidden bonuses that make for some great optional content and expand the games length significantly. The most contentious aspect of Katamari Damacy would have to be its controls. Both analogue sticks are used to control the direction you push the Katamari in while the camera follows whatever direction you’re facing in. In a way, it actually simulates the action pushing a large object. Holding up and holding down on different sticks at the same time will make you turn around in place, pulling in the opposite direction you’re moving in will cause you to suddenly come to a halt, quickly pushing each stick up and down in succession will cause you to boost and so on. The controls take some getting used to, but once you master them you’ll be glad that you don’t have to control your movement with one stick and the camera with another like most games. And in all honesty I don’t know if I would even enjoy the game as much without the controls, because of the control scheme you’re so much more invested in the movement of your character, and it makes something as simple as moving forwards feel more enjoyable than it would be otherwise. The only nitpicks I have with the game are sometimes the camera can get a little congested in tight spaces, and sometimes your character will get stuck in between things which can be extremely frustrating. But all in all, the good far outweighs the bad, and Katamari Damacy ends up being one of the most enjoyable games out there. It’s simple and joyful gameplay is addicting and doesn’t get old in the short time you have with it. The writing and the music is always surprising you in new ways and making for some fantastic and unforgettable moments. The narrative is virtually non-existent, but it doesn’t need to do anything. The game is silly, and it knows it. It’s an absolute blast to play, and I couldn’t recommend it more.. The best 2000's game, the most original of the decade for consoles, a real piece of Art, Katamari Damacy's soundtrack is a masterpiece of its own.. Best game I have ever played, I would say. It's simple, new (or it was new when I got it 13 years ago!) and cute. If you don't understand this game, hey, I don't blame you. But definitely worth checking out anyway.. One of the happiest, simplest gaming experiences I've ever come across. Roll a ball until it's big enough to **** up buildings. Watch people panic and scream while catchy, happy-go-lucky music gets stuck in your head. If you're open to unconventional experiences in gaming, this is absolutely worth your time.. The music, the insanely charming art style, and the pure FUN of this game makes it one of the most surprisingly good games of the PS2 era. Just you try getting that catchy theme song out of your head! Na naaaa, na na na, na na na na, na na na na na na naaaaaaaaaaaaa~!. This game is the WORST experience of my LIFE. How can people rate this so frikin' high? You take a ball, role stuff up for like, 10 hours worth of levels, a time limit like superman 64, which, compared to this, superman 64 is like a masterpiece, a incredibly weird and not understandable storyline with nothing deep to it, a super bad soundtrack that will drive you crazy, extremely ugly characters, dumb levels, low content, the list goes on. Verdict is the worst game ever, worst than Ride to Hell and Superman 64 combined, 0/10 would rate it lower.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even though it's not the most innovative, Katamari Damacy is certainly one of the most unique games of 2004. Pros: Stylish gameplay; lavish colors; varied level design; wonderfully weird characters. Cons: Quirky controls and camera angles; short; limited multi-player mode.","mindless fun Katamari Damacy ReRoll is a remaster of the 2004 PS2 version . the art style is cute and colourful, generally pleasant to look at . the soundtrack is definitely one of the best selling points of this game ."
993.The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar,"Despite the game being old, it is still playable. It’s nice to be a part of the LoTR story. There are alot of quests to do and that can also be one of the downsides of the game because some need to be unlocked from the store and there are too many are fellowship quests.. Good MMO. It can be really cozy to Tolkien fans, and I think LOTRO has some of the best quest writing I've ever seen is this kind of games. I do think it is worth playing (if you are a fan), there's a good chunk of content that can be enjoyed without spending a cent and even the paid content is very acessible.. When I was playing Warhammer Online, there was a rumour that would hurt us very much. Warhammer Online servers would be shut down. Unfortunately, this happened in 2013. I started playing Warhammer Online in 2009, but that same year I got another highly praised MMORPG. Tolkien's world, one of the most admired and beloved fantasy writers, was packed into an MMORPG. It also offered a tremendous experience, with hundreds of side missions and epic missions. While playing Warhammer Online, I wanted to play LOTRO at the same time. I got the game and joined the world. What I saw gave me goosebumps, not because of fear, but excitement. There were dozens of places I could visit, hundreds of missions I could complete, and dozens of events I could experience. It was a great experience! Honestly, what I want to talk about is its game economy, although there is a lot I can say about the game. Warhammer Online, unfortunately, when they shut down their servers in 2013, I gave all my intensity to LOTRO. Did I do it good or bad? I'm still undecided. However, while one part of me is good that I have spent so much time on this game, on the other hand, I feel sorry for the economy of this game that I play from time to time. Free Player, Premium Player and VIP Player. I guess you understand what I mean. We are living in 2021 of the 21st century, but they still keep an annoying style in the economic system, which I cannot even call old-fashioned. I am not saying old-fashioned, because even old-fashioned games would do this terrible thing! For example, Ultima Online or Dark Age of Camelot. These two games are some of the best examples that can still survive. There is also WoW. What a good example of WoW, I'll leave it to you. I think WoW's economy looks good too. Now, I said the economy. Because the LOTRO economy now has an incredibly absurd structure. To get a mount for your hero, you first need to obtain a Riding Skill. So where does this get from? The right guess is from the LOTRO Store! Riding Skill is a Skill that you can buy with LOTRO Point. When you become a VIP member, you can get this Skill for free. You just need to find the NPC. Apart from that, many items are locked in the game, but you can obtain them with LOTRO Point. You can get LOTRO Point by completing Deed. However, this happens to drop by drop. For example, a Deed gives 5 LOTRO Points. The same economic model is in Star Wars: The Old Republic. This system is not working. You have to accept this now. While LOTRO is a nice game to spend time with, some of its items might bother you. So try not to think of these while playing the game. If you want to keep playing, you can pay $14.99 a month if your economic situation is good, or in whatever country you are in, in the currency shown to you. I do not prefer it. I play the game just for the sake of Middle-earth.. so much reading, then a small burst of ok combat, then back to reading. And i'm not usually one to complain about graphics, I still think Ocarina of Time looks fantastic, but this game just bugs my eyes.. LOTRO, this is the same MMORPG, where it is much more interesting to read quests. The story that the developers show us goes in parallel with the main story of the Lord of the Rings novel and is no worse than the original! Once you plunge into this world and now you can stay in it for 11 years!. This game was great... ages ago. But now it's majesty become a legend, a legend faded to myth and in days present it is just a p2w garbage, full of bugs, microtransactions and pay to do everything wall.. you have to pay for everything you see in this game except the starting areas If you want to ""grind"" pay2win cash as f2p you need to make dozens of chars and waste hundreds of hours doing mindless things Also graphics are from cave age combat is like vanilla wow. This game has become a pathetic joke since SSG took over. They secretly jack up prices on old content, dont fix long standing bugs but instead make them worse, such as the door not opening bug, and break things that have worked fine for a decade, such as all the problems with chat failing. The management and administration is by far the worst I have seen in ANY online game. The game is absolutely POLLUTED with BUGS, SCAMS, CRASHES and CHEATERS. Gangs of multiboxing gold farmers/cheater roam around lagging everything down and killing off all the quest and deed targets. EVERY other game on the net handles cheating far better than SSG. If you speak out about it the people from the worst cheating kinships turn it into a major flame war in chat. Speak up about cheating and GMs will Shadow Ban you. You cant even use your own kin chat, and it says you have to use the help system but they never respond to the ticket. GMS regularly just delete tickets you submit without even a response. These people don't deserve a CENT until they get their act together. Buying Mordor was one of the biggest financial mistakes I ever made. Operations of this company should be turned over to someone that will do the job properly and knows how to program and administer game servers.. The beginning of the game is very good: You have a lot of story and I was surprised by the good graphics, it is like in Guild Wars. There are some good new ideas in the game, for example you can change your character strategically by certain elements. They created a great world of Tolkien, so normaly this game should be one of the best, but... You will be annoyed with the shop and buying stuff already in the beginning. You cant even choose 2 classes without buying them. Even if you re subscried and pay some money every month, there are still a lot of stuff you need to pay extra and you have a lot of restrictions. This is the biggest fun killer in the game. In addition you get +100% XP by subscription and you cant turn it off. Yes, the game is too easy too. Like all the other MMOs LotRO needs a lot of time and have content, that is boring (killing quests). It was once a good game (around 2010). However, Turbine has not upgraded the graphics/gameplay in years. The f2p model has dragged this game to 100% mictro-transactions. You will be nickeled and dimed at every turn. The servers are now all dying, and the very few players left and transferring to the last servers with still a population. WB Games chocked its player base to leaving via lack of upgrades and an extremely expensive/aggressive store. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!. LOTRO is at its core a WoW clone. However, unlike Rift it does not copy and perfect but instead just createa a cheap copy that doesn't feel as good. This doesn't mean its a bad game however, and it does show real promise. PvP PvP in LOTRO is very basic, one big map, one game mode... that's it. Despite this simplicity however the PvP experience is a fairly solid one and one which keeps people coming back. PvE I found the PvE really enjoyable. It has a good balance and therefore doesn't feel too easy, a problem which a lot of MMOs are effected with. This balance helps too make questing a lot more fun. Quests The quests are overall disappointing, they're no where near as good has they should have been. A lot of quests will tell you to go somewhere and complete an objective, you get back after doing the task and it will tell you to go back and complete another objective in the same place, it leaves me thinking why didn't you just give me both quests at the same time, it is this bad quest design which really holds with game back. Another problem with quest is the large amount of group quests, these occur normally at the end of a story line, now there are a number of problems with this, 1. Not everyone has friends to play with all the time and not all zones have enough people playing to group up with someone else, 2. Due to the fact you can't complete the quest you're missing out on the end of the quest line and therefore the story, 3. these quests are also meant to take players to new quest hubs but because you can't complete them it leaves player lost wondering what to do next. Lore/ world design This is Tolkien's world and this is Tolkien's lore, and Turbine have done a good good at recreating it within an MMO. Combat Combat is a bit clucky but overall it is fairly descent just not as good as some other MMOs. Crafting The crafting system is below par for me, it's dull and just overall boring to engage with. Optimization It's very good considering the look of the game, this is one of the games strongest points. Graphics The landscapes are very good, the art style is nice however, the human architecture is just awful and you can also tell that the Turbine team were sticking to a budget.. This is a very fun game with hours of time. The quests are really well written and it has good graphics. It is also a great representation of Middle Earth. The only thing that I would change is for the world to be less static ie. the monsters attack camps etc. If you like loot, this game is for you. If you played D2, this game is for you. If you like unique builds, this game is for you. Truly F2P, truly amazing. Best game of the last 10 years for me.. **** MMO set in Tolkien's world. Loved exploring the Shire, the Old Forest, Bree, Rivendell. Great music. Fantastic sights and sounds. The darkness of Angmar was great. The RIFT raid was epic. At the start, the 'housing neighborhoods' were wonderful (sadly, Turbine did nothing to update this aspect of the game in later years). Exceptional work and something I'd highly recommend for any gamer who liked reading or watching The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings.. I really liked this game, well maybe i didn't like some mechanics but it was super fun overall. I think it's an mmo a lot of people can play without being completely devoted to it.. I would have given Lord of the Rings online an 8 or 9 back in 2007 at launch or up to 2 years after it. But time has changed as did Lord of the Rings online, so I will comment on how the game is now. Lord of the Rings online is almost a MUST PLAY for every Tolkien fan. The developer always works close with the Middle-Earth Enterprise (the license holder of Tolkiens legacy) to make sure that the game is very close to the lore. A lore that's one of the most richest ones in the whole Fantasy genre. The game world is very well done and gives you a very good feeling of how Tolkien meant Middle-Earth to be. Weather you visit Bree to take a drink at the Prancing Pony, take a stroll across Rivendell or walk through the Mines of Moria, the world feels quite real. One of the best features of Lord of the Rings online is the epic story. At the start of the game your character is about 3 months behind the Fellowship. While playing through the 'original' game (the one that was released in 2007), you'll stay behind the Fellowship, only to catch up with them in Rivendell at some time. The epic story does not tell the story of the Fellowship or your character though. Instead it tells a story of what's happening all around Middle-Earth and reveals things that are not written in the book. Game play though is an other thing (and why I'm giving it a 7 now). For a MMORPG there's very little player interaction in the lower levels. Mainly the last 2 expansions (Riders of Rohan and Helm's Deep as of this writing) are the places where you need to party to get your progress in the epic story. In the 'older' expansions the game has been modified so that you can actually play the old party content all alone, which I think is a sad thing. In all, I think Lord of the Rings online is still a very good MMORPG for it's age and I hope that Turbine will be able to extend it's license (about to expire in 2014 and no word about it so far) so that we can play the game for an other 5 years.. I like this game a lot, not too easy, not too hard. The zones are reproduced very accurately and the class's feel good to me. Overall I like this game.. This game looks amazing, the sound is excellent and despite the oh so WOW safe and proven formula, it isnt a WOW copy and theres enough differences to notice it. And Radagast is awesome.. This definitely has the potential to surpass WoW! I love the game-play, though I do have to say travel time (even on horses) is a problem. But what's a problem like that next to how good this COMPLETELY FREE game is?!. BEST MMO IN HISTORY. WoW is very, very good. Rift is also very good. GW1 and GW2 both very good. Everquest 1 and 2 are pretty good and so on and on. LOTRO on the other hand is exceptional. It has a certain quality that ALL the others lack. For me, it is by far the most immersive MMO I've experienced which just keeps growing. The sound, graphic style, the mounts, the lore, the environments are as good as it gets. It's hard to find fault with LOTRO and why I feel it deserves a perfect 10. From a gaming perspective, I can't see how they could improve it??? Even with all the big guns of our modern times (TOR and GW2), they should have used LOTRO as a template and bettered it. Instead, they created a fancier graphics, poor mans replacement. Tut tut for all that money wasted. Oh, LOTRO is FREE TO PLAY!!! Go download now and enjoy. Bye.. Lord of the Rings Online is a basically a World of Warcraft clone. I'm sorry to say this, It makes my tongue dripping with bile, but I can only draw this conclusion. Unless you have a job and can purchase the other 90% and more of the actual gaming content, you won't have a great time. To be honest, this game doesn't have much different from other MMOs. The only thing that stands out is that it takes place in Middle-Earth. If you're a Lord of the Rings Nerd like me, you would keep playing because the game will give you several nerdgasms and force you to geek all over the floor. This is probably why the game is still healthy. Most of the player-base are huge Lord of the Rings fans since the 20th century and are adults by now. Meaning they enjoy this game, because they can support the content. For a casual gamer who has never heard of Lord of the Rings. This is going to be a waste of time or a nice trip that takes up a month of your time in the F2P zone, depending on how you interpret it. The highest I got to is my level 32 Human Captain. Afterwards, I was just bored because sure you can do the main storyline quests. However, I keep dying because my Captain is under-leveled and sometimes the LOTR community is a bunch of elitist **** who hate younger players. So after level 30 or so, it's just a bother to continue playing. I'd like to give this game an seven because of how beautiful the game's story is laid out. However, what matters is the gameplay. Did I have fun? Kind of. Will the majority of the gamers have fun? Probably not. So take this if you have random spasms of nostalgia, if not, probably should get into Lord of the Rings first.. The game is only free to play until level 25 then you must pay for almost everything you want to do, monthly fee plus expansions make this game quite expensive in the long run. You are ""allowed"" to pursue your epic story line with the only ""reward"" being you are allowed to view more of the storyline. I've read the books and seen the movies so nothing new in pursuing the epic story line.. Extreme good and bad points. Very good graphics, very good gameplay, very unimaginative quests making the game tedious, very annoying intrusive way of trying to get you to spend real money all the time to speed up progress which is very slow. It reminds me of Guild Wars but somehow doesn't give quite the same feeling of really being there, it's more **** and less emotionally engaging.. On initial play, I gave this a 9/10 (having bought the Steam starter pack, which includes a horse and 3 quest packs). For $15 (on sale then), it was such great value for money. Loads of fun time played, hours and hours in fact, and made it to about level 40+ easy enough. At this stage, I've no problem with the need to buy new quest packs, nothing is entirely free, but it is also at this stage I begin to pull pack from the high rating. First, the pros, some areas are really great (Evendim especially, and I hear Lothlorien is but not been there yet), lovely music, lovely storyline, helpful community, and if you get into a good kin, that's very good. But cons do appear later on, some areas are not interesting at all but you need to play them to level up (-1), there gets a stage where it really turns into a grind (repetitive tasks) to level up so as to continue the story (-1), and Turbine could be more generous with swift-travel (instant A-to-B travel), without which you're less inclined to try new areas(-1). This is the only MMO I've played, so I cannot compare, but for me, so far worth the money, but will probably only ever be a casual game (10 hours a month play), and will probably buy quest packs to continue on in that casual sense. I'd recommend it for those also looking for the more casual, friendly, and storyline MMO's, not to be taken too seriously, but definitely fun. (as an aside, it would be interesting in seeing a single-player game that lives in the same world, can run through epic quests directly one after the other, can chat with others but no fellowships required, and is pure storyline based. I say this because at times I do really like spending time inside the world, but having to wait to get fellowship help from kins or friends can be annoying when playing at off/quiet server times).. I am really not sure where that Thradar fellow is getting his information, but Lord of the Rings Online has been constantly updating, especially since Siege of Mirkwood, and I'm not talking tweaking what's already there. Since SoM, there's been Enedwaith, Rise of Isengard and the Great River as major areas, as well as the aformentioned tweaking. They've updated a lot of the art and presentation, giving a more immersive experience to the areas. Dunland feels like Dunland, which feels just a little different than Enedwaith, even though they're technically the same area on the map of Middle-Earth. They've added several instances, across the board, as well as for end-game experiences. And they're the only game experience I've had so far where I'm still unfolding an epic storyline at level cap! Come Septenmber 5th: mounted combat and the Riders of Rohan expansion! Hope to see you there!. A generally average game overall. Through years 2007-2009 the game saw expert expansions and care for the player base. When the game went free-to-play and were acquired by Warner Brothers, Turbine began to care less about the player base. It is now a free game, but if you want to really play this game easily without spending any money, it will take a very long time.. I've played this game recently and lets first say that it is mega addictive and there is always something to do and look forward to each level you gain. The graphics are pretty great, very wide variety of options and the maps are outstanding. Like 'The Shire' in LOTRO is amazing and just looks extraordinary. The game play is also quite great, the combat is slow yet you can't expect a whole lot of fast paced action in Lord of the rings can you? However, there is one downside to the game that after lvl 30-35 you dont get free to play maps anymore. And you must either pay real cash or gain lots of TP (Turbine Points) (In-game store) to keep on playing. Which is a little expensive but really its worth it. + Great crafting system and the community is always willing to help newbies etc. Definitely something to check out. This game is 50% there. The good parts come first. Lets start with the gameplay. The items are okay, the armor looks really nice. Its nice to meet up with aragorn and a few other characters. I started to have second thoughts about this after a few long quests. Its fun, but pretty boring. A real RPG nerd would love this though. Bad parts are the fact that they act like they need 1,0000000 dollars a year so everywhere, there is ads for their items. You get ads by turbine on all loading screens, every time you go to a shop and pretty much everywhere else. The shop has everything and about 500 expansions that cost real money. They have 100 dollar booster packs that have expansions and about everything else. The expansions do look fun, and I may add to this review if I ever buy one.. The game was fun at launch, many years ago. Now its outdated and I just don't feel like grinding for 200 hours to max level. This is one of the worse MMOs for grinding out quests to gain levels. I love middle earth as much as the next guy but turbine didn't do middle earth or the lore of the rings series complete justice with this game. It lacks solid PVP, it lacks end game, its just a game dedicated for those few that love middle earth, and those that love grinding out quests in groups.. I wish I could give it a 93; because if I could, I would. The game has very good graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and an awesome world to explore. However, it loses 1 point due to occasional bugs, and an annoying pay-for-everything online store that I feel makes the point of playing the game much less rewarding. I, being of a long MMO fan (runescape, etc), feel as though it is still a very-good MMO. It receives constant updates and never feels ""boring."". Really fun and great game for it's time, but later during development it seems like the game developers are more focused on adding new content then fixing the existing problems. But, at least its free to play now.. A solid MMORPG with great graphics, excellent quest system, and a solid UI. Free to play is great along with the other subscription models to chose from. The lore from Lord of the Rings is an extra bonus.. LOTRO is probably one of the best MMORPGs out there that I have played, you CAN pay but if you don't you can still get the meat of the game. Imagine World of Warcraft but free, the community is MUCH better, storyline that ties into the books/movies, and the classes are more flushed out then in WoW. However with that said the game is not perfect. I have had many glitches where the music would stop and all I would hear are the ambient noises. The roleplaying community is really nice (if you are interested) and the game is very much alive. I went in to LOTRO not planning on spending ANY money on it and so far I've put over 60$ on the game (including the new expansion about to come out). 2007-2009 this game was a solid 8-9 rating. Great RPG, great story telling, really good Middle Earth lore, frequent updates and expansion. Then they converted the game to a free to play model. Sure they may be making more money but...very little content since Siege of Mirkwood. No expansion for 2 years. Every activity in the game now funnels you in to their micro transaction store. This mmo WAS a great gamers game, not it's a cash cow for Turbine and is no longer a gamers game (if that makes any sense to you gamers out there).. You could sum this all up why saying, Yes this does the the content/community/design to **** beat WoW. Complete with Beautiful environments, and it sticks to the lore. Zones feel more like actual worlds to explore and adventure in, rather than something to swing by in to get a explorer achievment. My only complaint is that it is a tad lacking on PvP, or PvMP as it is called. Other than that...whats not to like?. Lotro has the potential to surpass World of Warcraft in popularity, 'cause it's now free to play. When comes to quality, Lotro just barely misses WoW. I have to say, I am hooked.However, I would like to criticize travel time. I keep finding myself annoyed by having to go here and there to get this and that, train this or that, or kill this and that. Then again, aren't they all like that?","despite the game being old, it is still playable . there are alot of quests to do and that can be one of the downsides of the game . LOTRO has some of the best quest writing I've ever seen is this kind of games ."
994.Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love it! The characters are cool and funny especially lance (even tho he’s an idiot) the fact that u can take off a property and turn it in to a drug, robbery esc is amazing and ahead of its time. Although the game is pretty consistent in terms of previous titles gameplay, the writing and character development in this title seems to be unmatched compared to its predecessors. The Journey you will find yourself on feels sort of Fresh and adds a new element of Story enhancement as I feel rockstar for some reason really went above and beyond in this PSP Classic! The Story is told beautifully and the characters are very memorable. Action, Humor, Tension, Drama, and the classic feel **** game is all here. A truly great installment that deserves way more respect than it gets !. Virtually identical to the PS2 version and just as good, which is a real technical achievement for a hand held console. One of the very best games on the PSP.. Hard, but not frustrating, this game is f*****g amazing, if you own a psp then this is a must play.. Very nice game - it was a masterpiece for the PSP console. Even without second along stick it was enjoyable to play in that game. Starts out better than LCS, but ultimately gets into tedious territory. Preparing for missions is actually worse than LCS because if you've done even one empire mission (kind of like the gang wars from SA), you'll get hounded almost non-stop by bikers or the other rival gang that all bring the assault rifles after you, draining your health and armor within a second. It **** because you can't even alleviate this problem by taking over all of the territories - the goons still pop up and your properties still get attacked! I'm guessing it was game padding, but it really detracts from the main missions by the middle of the game. Overall, though, it's a fun game and impressive for the PSP handheld. It just feels like it needed some more polish to make it a best in class entry.. This is the best PSP game ever and the most underrated GTA game. The characters are fun, the missions are very replayable, the Vice City aesthetic looks even better here than in the original Vice City and the soundtrack might be the best ever. I just love this game overall. I had a blast every-time I played Vice City on PSP. The plot, the soundtrack, the fun I had playing this game makes me want to go back in time !. If Liberty City Stories was a standalone expansion for GTA 3, then Vice City Stories is a standalone expansion for GTA: Vice City. Yeah, it's not ambitious like San Andreas. But then again, this came out on the PSP originally.. what a pieace of **** what a disgrace to the original vice city. lcs is 100times better than this piece of **** Prisoners should play this for punishment, please stay away from this abomination. The best/worst GTA game imo. GTA Vice City Stories is a game that really upgrades the classic 3d formula with a lot of new aspects, like for example the autoaim now has target priority making it much less annoying, having the possibility of recover your weapons, arguably the best multiplayer on the entire series, the best graphics, new vehicles, etc. The mission design is also more varied and interesting than Liberty City Stories and the gang system (despite its flaws that i would cover it later), it manages to make the gameplay even more addictive than it already is................................. but................. It also makes the same mistakes as the previous 3d GTA..... again..... for the fifth time this is a joke, although most of the flaws are because of the engine, but why they still made the same clunky shooting mechanics that were barely acceptable in the 90s, let alone in 2006, with the same autoaim (although a bit fixed), same outdated driving and recycled elements? There also new flaws as well, exclusive to this game, like for example, this is probably the most broken GTA game ever made. First of all, the money system, is way too unbalanced, even more than in GTA 3 and VC. The new gang system makes you win ridiculous amounts of money even when only capture like 5 or 6 territories, so you would obtain thousands and thousands of dollars in a short time and being able to buy everything with max ammo so easily. Not helped by the bribery option, since it only cost you always 2000; that is nothing. While i praised this option, the price should scale with the amount of weapons you had or i dont know, SOMETHING! Not matter what people said about LCS, it was a way better balanced game, that makes you think on spending your money or not. The gang battles also becomes a bit annoying towards the end of the game, and the gangs tends you to make ambush on the street way too much, like, even when you leave the hospital a 4x4 can appear and kill you instantly for the second time. Also, we can talk about how glitchy this game is? Sometimes the car you have to destroy to begin a war doesnt appear and you have to save and load the game to fix it, or the framerate problems that are way more common than in LCS. The story is also probably one of the worst in the series, since, while it starts a bit interesting, it later becomes a festival of bad jokes and uninteresting dialogue. LCS had way better story thanks to the relationship of Leone and Salvatore. Overall, while i enjoyed VCS and i can understand why some people saw VCS as the best GTA game, it is one of the most flawed games on the series due of its unbalanced nature that makes the gameplay broken as hell and the missions dont have the most balanced difficult curve of all. Although i still think is a pretty good game, since it introduces some of the best features of the series and like LCS is so impressive for the PSP, i still think LCS is an objectively way better made game, as much as that statement can make some people angry.. My favorite GTA of all time. Even though SA and 5 are better. This game still has the best story, soundtrack, characters, and setting of the franchise. Masterpiece!. I love so much this part GTA's .As for PSP this game is just gorgeous! And generally I believe this game is the best game on PSP! Because it's full edged GTA on gadget for porting! Of course it's sad that this GTA didn't come on Android and IOS ,but now already there are emulators for PSP .So it isn't scared.. Same as the Libery City Stories, it's great addition to the ""3D era"" of GTA games.. Great game. One of my favorite parts of gta. It needs a remake or remastered. But that's never going to happen.. One of The most cancer game i ever played. Missions are made just for make you cancer. I played the ps2 version and ive seen the psp version i think both versions are a masterpiece buty it now. Story: 8.5/10 The Way story is given: 17.5/20 Gameplay: 22/30 Visual quality: 8.5/10 Feelings left after playing: 18/20 Playability: 9.5/10 AVARAGE: 84/100 This game is beneficial for the ones who want to learn more about GTA universe. We see the Lance's brother and his adventures.. A great prequel to Vice City. Cearly a handheld game, in top3 of 3D universe GTA games for me.. Welcome back to Vice City this time set in the early 1980’s where Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories started the GTA 3D Era timeline and it’s the best prequel ever since Vice City was introduced. A beautiful short piece of novella and revelation that this game tried to tell and the activities will keep busy as you hit the ranks where Vic Vance feels financially stable.. I will keep this short. If you have a PSP you should give this one a try. It's cheap and easy to find, just plain fun and crazy. Could hook you for dozens of hours on the go. Not the greatest GTA title, but still a pretty good GTA game.. Story - 8/10 Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics - 7/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Levels - 9/10 Replay value - 9/10. Great game that is clearly no worse than other Gta (and something better). The same VC, the same atmosphere of the 80s and it has no equal. The best thing about the game is the radio. And the characters who returned from Gta VC. The hero himself is also quite good, Yu, and he differs from other characters in the Gta series in that he has just begun his criminal life, unlike the others.. A impressive Grand Theft Auto spinoff. All the problems I mentioned for the PS2 version applies to this as well. This version also suffers from bad frame rate and so much pop-up. It still is a really fun game.. A step up from Liberty City stories, Vice City stories is a slightly different take on the classic GTA style but is every bit as enjoyable. A must buy for the PSP.. Compared to ""Liberty City Stories"" this GTA title feels like a full packed GTA, in the style of ""GTA San Andreas"". For a portable game, the world has a great design and exploring it is really entertaining, because you can use machines like cars, trucks, motorbikes, bmx, helicopters, jetskis, motorboats, golf carts etc. and in GTA VCS you have the ability to swim. All of this is very important to get that in-game feeling of total freedom, which makes GTA titles great (besides Rockstar's dark humor and missions). I think GTA VCS' physics are better than in GTA LCS, which is also very important, since you'll drive a lot (often fast and crazy). The story is way more interesting than in LCS and the ending was satisfying. The radio stations offer a well picked selection of 80s songs. Overall you always got something to do, without being annoyed by it.. This game is a must have for the PSP. Vice city stories add a plethora of new features for a more complete GTA experience. Helicopters are now flyable.. This game has got amazing storyline , but graphics as in Vice City , but Vice City was born in 2003 and Vice City Stories in 2006 . In this game must play for niger which the betrayed main hero in Vice City . This game deserves 7/10 because this game very interesting and very awesome and amazing for PSP , but on PSP there are very many games which the better than Vice City Stories and I think Vice City Stories eve better than Liberty City Stories and I think Vice City Stories on PSP better than on PS2 . 7/10. Considering the fact that the PSP is not a high-performance console the game is pretty good. In my opinion it's the best game for this console. Great soundtrack & many missions - just a normal GTA. Of course it isn't as big as San Andreas but the atmosphere and the setting is very nice. If there are still people who play on PSP: Buy this game! I can absolutely recommend this game.. The Vice City & Vice City Stories have the best feeling & climate in all of the GTA history, sure they never have that much features that have San Andreas but I liked this games !. A decent if somewhat slightly bland PSP game. This essentially follows on similar interactivity like GTA LCS and is actually pretty fun to play. There is quite a bit of extra side missions and rampages to do and the size of the city is not really much of an issue here. The new characters in here are quite memorable in their own right and the plot of this game pretty much sets the scene for the events of GTA Vice City, set in 1986. The only slight downside to this game is that there really aren't that many story missions when taken into consideration, and the layout of the game is a little slow to load when travelling, especially when going at fast speeds.They could have had extra features such as being able to buy food from places such as King Knuts and make those areas accessible, or at least make buying health possible like they did in GTA Vice City. Although probably my favourite thing about this game is the mix between obvious and rather not so obvious humour in the game, I would just say it is a bit of a shame that there aren't more story missions for you to do. Controls of the game are decent and aren't confusing or inconvenient in any way and the amount of weapons available to the player is pretty good. It's always pretty fun to play this game and just storm around destroying everything because in this game it's pretty easy to do with the easy to manage controls. Rampges, red balloons and side missions offer some reasonable challenges however some such as the paramedic mission are inevitably boring as it takes so long to complete. Not only that, but the glitch that lets you get to the second island before unlocking it is also kept meaning you can go and do all the rampages and collect all the balloons and unique stunts in advance, making the game missions easier with all the weapons available to you. My only pet peeve in this game is that there probably aren't enough missions where you battle the Vice City gangs, however the fact that your businesses can pull in loads of revenue dauily without you having to do anything is an added bonus. I just would have liked it if the Cholos had got a bit more of a look in in the game, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be. All in all, this is a decent and worthy game to add to your collection and it is actually pretty fun to go through and complete this game in different ways each time. Give it a play and see for yourself.. I am writing this for the psVita. This game is a must have for your ps vita collection! It looks fantastic, better than the ps2 classic san andreas on the psn. This game plays very stable and has hardly and frame rate drops. Good controls that work well for the vita. The story for this game is great and stacks up to thd gta greats! If you have a vita and want an amazing gta portable experience get this game!. Still the best portable GTA game out there, even the iOS versions of GTA III and GTA VC. +Great graphics for a PSP game and surpasses the iOS GTA games' graphics as well +Awesome 1980s setting +Tons of things to do +Addicting empire building missions Controls aren't that great, but at least they're not touch controls like the iOS GTAs. -Frame rate **** -Story **** -Draw distance ****. i would not recommend this... the missions are very **** graphics are really bland and it was really poor attempt at open world, the city is very **** game mechanics are dull. i would not recommend this... the missions are very **** graphics are really bland and it was really poor attempt at open world, the city is very **** game mechanics are dull. This is the best game you can but on the psp im still thinking how in the world did Rockstar squeeze this much juice ino the psp to make GTA look this good on what is already ageing hardware overall stop reading this review and get this game you wont be disappointed. This Grand Theft Auto Vice can't inch up to the original which was a thrill, But Vice City Stories can't make a perfection. In Vice the missions are easy and hard and has a leveled difficulty. However, Vice City Stories has it mixed up. On the half part of the game it is easy a part of the start is easy and a part of the start is hard and some time after Mission 37 its hard but at mission 45 its easy. The graphics are good but the sunset bugs when in a mission because the light heads to you. Its generally kind of a equal but mostly a game that needs a few tweaks.. Overall, it is a nice game. It is really to return to Vice City. I missed this city alot. Characters model look more real than previous GTA titles. Gameplay is similar to previous titles, but it is still an awesome game. This is a must-buy.. One of my most played PSP games! It takes you back to Vice City, it has the vibe, it has the music, the better water and, most important, the swimming! It falls short on other areas, though. The main character doesn't really convince, the city feels depopulated too often and, unlike San Andreas, initially you can't swim to the other half of the city until you unlock it, since an invisible wall prevents that. And also initially, swimming for too long causes you to drown, untill you gain ""unlimited swimming"" after playing a mini-game on the second part of the city. But putting these aside, there is a lot of game to be played, more side missions than the original Vice City and the music simply doesn't get boring! And speaking of music, Phil Collins is a nice surprise not to be missed, especially because it is artfully integrated in the story (which actually saves it a bit). All in all, an almost average story, probably the lowest of all GTA 3 era games, but rich gameplay. You might not start the game over, but you'll return to your saved one to continue the fun.. 100% PS2 games were ported to PSP and it was same as **** did do impossible thing for PSP and it was brutally fun and definitely worth money than you could.. This is one of the best games on the PSP because it has so much to do. The missions are so great that you'll want to replay the missions more than once. The open world is also large and fun to explore.. Considering that it's on PSP, this has to be the best game for portable consoles. There's a lot of content for a handheld title, and despite the game seeming cheap and not as good as the original vice city, VC Stories still delivers a great GTA experience that's fun.. This is quite possibly the best game availible on the PSP. It offers a PS2 level experience that surpasses that of the original GTA Vice City. To start, the game takes pace in the same Vice City seen on PS2 but with several improvements. The story of this game is long and good. The main character, Vic Vance, is a more sympathetic and likeable hero who falls into bad times with zany and unique characters. The game takes the same amount of hard work and time to finish as a regular GTA game and offers all of the same fun a player could want. The gameplay is standard GTA, which isn't a bad thing. Controls are good with a nice auto aim system which is in conjunction with the free-aim feature. Some great additions to the game not seen in the original Vice City or Liberty City Stories include swimming and the ability to fly several differing aerial vehicles such as helicopters and planes. Once you finish the main story there is a ton of fun to be had in free-roam. Hours and days can be spent winning street races, finding popable red balloons and easter eggs, completing rampages, expanding your empire, and just running around Vice City blowing stuff up. If you have friends with this game you can play Ad Hoc multiplayer, but a lack of Infrastructure does disappoint. Overall this is a gaming experience which can last a limitless amount of time and please any fan of the series as well as newcomers.","the story is told beautifully and the characters are very memorable . Starts out better than LCS, but ultimately gets into tedious territory . preparing for missions is actually worse than gang wars from SA ."
995.Desperados III,"Amazing game. Feels a lot like classic Commandos. I enjoyed it a lot. A must-play if you are craving games like the old Commandos. Super fun to play, and the mechanics give a lot of freedom in how you want to solve every level. The stars system gives a lot of replayability.. Loved Commandos when I was little so this just made me so happy. Really enjoyed it.. Good game story is the best part gameplay is not so change but still good .. very unusual for me and a new genre that I was wary of trying but didn’t regret a second, very high quality game and so far 8 (I think shadow gambit will be much better). Loved every second of it shame the company stopped for a **** much heart and effort put in to this such clever game design must play on hard to really experience the game normal is shocking how boring and easy it is.....thank you for this game .. Desperados 3 is a masterpiece of real-time strategy games for me. I believe everyone will enjoy it, whether they like the genre or not. That’s why I think it should definitely be experienced. I finish story because I don’t want to praise the game too much and make it unattractive in your eyes. For full review: ****/@shelyshelly20/desperados-3-ddb2f5b3c1ff. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. At first i want to say that i didn't played Desperados 1 and 2, so i might miss some things. But i played Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, and i think it is a solid 7.5/10. The gameplay is similar to Shadow Tacitcs, some might even say to much , but i'd say it changes a lot of characthers , making them more fun to play, since they are now easier to control, less cluncky than previous game which is a big plus and made me fall in love with the game. The graphics are good. They are well optimized, i never experienced any fps drops, even on my old pc, and they look really stylish, again , similar to Shadow Tactics. The story is , a tool. A tool for devs to put you in an unexpected or interesting situation. I don't really wanna spoil, let's just say that it is similar in structure to (again!) Shadow Tactics. So after reading all that, you might ask, why would I choose Desperados III, looks like it's really similar to Shadow Tactics, why choose this over another. Well, you see, Desperados III is just a big improvent over Shadow Tacitcs. If you like it , you will love Desperados. Though , it costs really much, so you might wanna wait for sale.. The best game of 2020. Reminds me of commandos. This is even better than those games just wish they add more missions.. A solid Real Time Tactics entry Desperados 3 is a Real Time Tactics game developed by the same group that did Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, so if you've played that you'll feel right at home with Desperados 3. The first thing I'd like to highlight, is despite Desperados 3 being the ""Third"" main entry into the series, the game is actually a prequel/soft reboot. You do not need to play any of the other older Desperados games in order to understand the story, this game is rather self-contained and doesn't require any prior knowledge of the other games; thus making it easier to get into. The game itself is very Trial and Error, you will be using Quick Save and Quick Load a lot, which isn't as bad as it sounds, to complete missions and have everything run smoothly. For those who have played Shadow Tactics you will notice that a lot of the abilities from that game carry over to this one. The cast themselves are all interesting characters in my opinion, to your standard Cowboy main character archetype, to the seductress all the way to the voodoo woman, utilising their abilities and having everything connect together to complete missions, is nothing short of satisfying; especially after you pull off all five people doing something at once using Showdown Mode. The story isn't anything to write home about but this is one of those games where the story merely serves as an excuse for the enjoyable and interested gameplay, it's unlikely you'll care about what's going on in the story but you'll be more interested in the set-pieces and enemy locations as to rack your brain to figure out the best solution forward. There are dozens of ways to complete any given mission, different routes, who to use, what abilities to prioritise, this for me is what makes the game enjoyable; you can play the same mission twice but you probably won't accomplish it the same way twice. Of course in games like this there are challenge modes, DLC missions and what not which are also enjoyable, I only just completed the main story when writing this review but I know some of them are effectively; ""Do this mission with only these characters, instead of the original ones."" And some are just brand new missions entirely, which means you can get a lot of time and content out of this game for what you pay for it. To complete the main story it'll take around 15-25 hours at best, since there will be times where you're just staring at the screen, watching guard patterns and thinking. ""This is bloody impossible."" Only for something to click, an ability you rarely use becomes feasible and then you've got it. Overall, this game has my recommendation, although I did prefer Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun (Purely because I prefer the Japanese Sengoku Era aesthetic) This is a fantastic game and a great entry into the Real Time Tactics Genre and a must have for any stealth game enthusiasts out there. 7/10, fantastic gameplay, lacklustre story.. What a hidden gem. This game is phenomenal! Every aspect of it is well polished. And even though it's not popular to admit it, I really appreciate the availability of an ""easy"" difficulty level. The large number of mechanics and capabilities, the blend of real time tactics with ""pause and plan"" elements, it's all a blend of gameplay that I haven't quite seen before. Add the lovingly crafted and superbly presented western setting and I'm in love with this game.. An excellent tactical game - or should I say SANDBOX CHESS? :) Mimimi games respectfully took everything that was great about the old Commandos/Desperados/JaggedAlliance and improved that had holes or that the new generation of games demanded. I thought their Shadow Tactics was top, but of course the authors outdid themselves. In the game, we have a team of specialists who complement each other perfectly, and thanks to this, many tactical combos can be created. One distracts, the other runs over, the third attacks. Whoever wants can plan accidents, whoever wants can run the map unseen, whoever wants can make a tasklist and dispatch everyone on the map (e.g. me :), simply because.. you can. And did haters say that there is little action in the game? Try to plan at least one shadow kill (give orders to different characters and execute them at the same time) and you will tell yourself that it is a more satisfying action than watching John Wick :). Fantastic missions, fantastic challenges, fantastic characters. Desperados 3 is a slam dunk in its genre. Its a modern Commandos/Desperados Wanted Dead or Alive with tons of improvement. Works perfectly on console, but the controller scheme and optimisation. I found desperados 3 a bit too complex for the fun it offers. I mean it's alright but hardly excites me enough to want to finish it. How you can leave a big bear trap in a house, kills someone and then watch the guards search for you whilst you are in a Bush or cupboard and then sneak out collect the trap, hide the body and then place it back in the same place is amateurish to say the least. Rinse and repeat. It's a bit silly and boring. Why is everyone giving their friends terrible games 10 out of 10? It's far from perfect. I wouldn't even say mediocre. Glad I didn't pay for it :D. I recommend these elements to people who like them 1. Intrusion play that sneaks in 2. The taste of assassination that makes you feel the taste of the thief's hands vicariously 3. A strategy that makes you think about how to solve it 4. I want to experience the extreme of the challenge. I accidentally found the game on release day and now I have the platinum trophy. One of the gems from the past that continues to shine bright in a sequel. Titles like this should be at the top to represent gaming, instead of a bunch of soulless P2W garbage.. Wow, it blows my mind how this game get better reviews then the original game that started it all. This game is nowhere near what Desperados DoA was. This game is just a waste of time and also you get a witch in the game who can kill other enemies without touching them (you link together 2 enemies and they both die if you kill one). Developers are lazy, that's why you should never give a project like this to money grabbing game studios.. Such a great revival of an old genre. Great story telling by ingame cutscnes that reminds me of Warcraft 3.. The game is a wonder, the first one being already a classic was an incredible high bar, but here was surpassed with class. First the characters are lovely, Kate, John, Hector, etc, you may have your favourite but all serve a purpose narratively and in play, they exude charisma. Second the scenarios are awesome. Ironically the cities are the lamest, although the 3d feeling it gaves you gives you the vibe on being on something big. Which also serves to feed that sensation that all your characters are superheroes. The AI is good. Probably on the genre the bar its quite high, but on my casual perspective i can say. The game is hard, the guards react decently fast, and you will take hours figuring out the puzzle. That its another thing, this game gives so much freedom you will feel betraying yourself if you go for a guide. Ultimately the decisive factor was how much love they put onto this, DESPERADOS 3 WAS created with so much love it inspires me to write them a positive review.. A great RTT game, like a Commandos western. Hope we will see more of Mimimi in the future.. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. Desperado's 3, a Real-time isometric strategy, tactical game. The game takes places in the late of 1800's America. Story is not special at all. Just a classical father's revenge story. I played game few hours, and had a chance to play 3 different characters. Each character had their at least one unique ability. Level design provides you to play with your own way. There are too many way to passing through chapters. Game's visuality is satisfying enough. except resolution quality and wonderful colour scheme, i really loved the animation's quality on cut scene's. I'm bored the game and didn't finish. But for the people who likes Real-time isometric strategy games and Western atmosphere, it might be the best game ever.. I think this game is great and deserves a lot more praise than it is given with the scores I see here. There's love in every detail, the story is good, in some points great and certainly well written enough to enjoy the pixel perfect mechanics. Good job!. Fantastic game. There's been a huge lack of stealth RTS games in recent years, and this has rejuvinated the genre. It obviously has parralels to the Commandos series of games and they've been a heavy influence, but it's also more accessible and open than they were. Contrary to a couple of bad reviews. This title is a 6/6.5 at best. Generic Old West. The characters are pretty much genre archetypes and predictable. The over-saturated color palette clashes with the darker tones of the game, which is a shame because the models actually look really nice. I prefer the camera in Fallout 1 to this one. I'm completely unsure what they were going for with the control scheme. Through this all, the pieces feel like they are there. Try it out if you get it for free.. Desper-Shogun 3 Unfortunatly, it is not desperados game; - it is Shadow Tactics 2 in texture pack desperados The original game was clon of commandos? but it was very atmospheri clon whith their rules. each location was fundamentally different from each other. day and night, nps - all worked for creabillity. Desperados 3 - it is empty decoration. You have only 2 enemies - simple and ""samurai"". Simple have one healf, one IQ - only visual is different. In original you have many variants of nps IF you like shadow tactics - Buy it, If you want desperados - pass by. This game is one of the best RTS out there right now. Fortunately the game is not short, the story is about 20+ hours, and there are the challenges, and the DLCs. There was time when I was angry for the game, but I was the wrong. :D Sometimes it can be hard, but this is why this game is good, it won't be easy. If you like strategy games this is a must have game for you. If you didn't play the previous games, it won't be a problem, I didn't play it, and it was fully enjoyable. After this I will plan to play the previous games.. It's my first game in tactics genre. And i'm glad that this game was first. It was so difficult, all tasks were difficult. But I do this. I passed this game. Cinematics were so good, voices heroes too good. Graphics and pictures genre 10/10. Game cost yourself.. Mimimi Games made another great Real-time tactic game just like Shadow Tactics. great level design, enjoyable characters, and challenging missions make Desperados 3 a perfect RTT game. I wish this game had some RPG elements like character customization and loots.. ""There is nothing wrong if you fire your guns"" this stupid game advertises BUT: Eris, Make Make and Haumea revolve 2 times around the Sun until he's loading his stupid revolvers, because, you know, reasons If he's detected, the whole goddamn Poncho army, la Guardia Nacional and all Bandidos gangs are upon him, because, you know, the same reasons To guard a villa with 3 maids, 5 civilians, 2 workers and 1 friggin' Mayor it takes the same entire Poncho army, la Guardia Nacional and all Bandidos gangs because of the same reasons Killing a goddamn Thug/Bandido/Poncho by throwing the knife creates some sort of a sonic boom which alerts the same whole Poncho army, la Guardia Nacional and all Bandidos gangs because of same reasons A Bandido killed by the same thrown knife, gurgles, gasps, chokes, coughs, grasps his own neck with both hands alerting (again!) the same entire Poncho army, la Guardia Nacional and all Bandidos gangs up to Sedna's orbit If he's in the visual range of some Bandido/Poncho/Thug, his crouching speed (lesser than of a snail anyways!) is *suddenly* slowing down to that of a pregnant cow wearing buckets over its hooves Stupid game mechanics along with all sorts keys + mouse combinations (CTRL+click to pick up, ALT to rotate the map, etc., which makes you scratching your left ear with the right toe - so to speak) make a horrible gameplay experience I wouldn't have published my opinion if His Illustrious Shining Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal and Doctor, VC, DSO, MC, METACRITIC, Lord of All Reviews of the Earth and Constrictor and Conqueror of the Free Speech in Gaming in General and Movies in Particular"" had NOT Graciously and Humbly deleted the most of the negative reviews for this game (and not only!!!). SOO MUCH for the most basic of the basics RIGHTS of the mankind, the FREE SPEECH and THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION, even if it is CONTRARY to yours. Yin and Yang, Like and Dislike, Day and Night, Sun and Moon, Love and Hate, Black and White, Ego and Alter Ego they *all* have the *same* rights to express their opinions. Metacritic... *Sigh* PS1: Its real mark is *not* zero, that's for sure, it's around 3 -> 4 which makes this game a real ""no-go"". Don't waste your precious time (far more precious than money!) on this, play something else. And *that* is my opinion, like it or not. PS2: A, B, C, D, E, F, ETC., used are CAPITAL letters, believe it or *not*. PS3: PS1, PS2, PS3 means post-scriptum 1 2 3 and *not* some antiquated piece of trashware. And last but not least I graciously, humbly, overly submissive and compliant, spiritless, tamed and in great fear and love thank Metacritic for removing > 6000 negative reviews (review bombing, my axe...) for such a piece of art, never ever seen, heard, felt and played, shining upon Orion's Arm constellations, the illustrious Death Stranding.. Great story and good characters (especially Hector). However, the stealth is kinda borked in this game at times. Sight cone is crazy accurate and after awhile gets tedious. Even if things go down, you pretty much just wait for the AI to reset and continue on. What broke me was a glitch i hit at the very end, where no matter what i did i would auto fail an encounter.. Another masterpiece from mimimi. I consider this one of the two masterpieces in 2020 along with Hades. I was on the fence about the game. It was no Shadow Tactics, the Old West might be my least favorite era. The pathing sort of **** and the game sometimes has trouble following orders. But the real kicker for me was loading it up and having my quick saves marked as deprecated. I might have only lost about an hour but what kind of developer has the nerve to deprecate saves post launch? It's unreal. Date Completed: 2020-12-12 Playtime: 19h Enjoyment: 6/10 Recommendation: Only if you enjoy this type of game or dusters.. Amazing tactical stealth game. The setting is nice and the game holds true to the previous entries in the series, but with a modern touch in all the game mechanics. The only downside is that it can get mentally exhausting and I needed to take frequent breaks, but that is just part of this game genre. And the upside of that is the amazing feeling you get when you execute a flawless plan!. Great improvement since Blade of Shogun. Not just the video quality and graphic details, but also the interaction and I see some small glitches in the former game were fixed. They were probably building this game on top of the former game, however, it is an obvious improvement and you can tell the developers are really working on what impacts the gamers. Great game and great studio. I hope they continue to bring us surprises.. everything is perfect, great performance, great graphics and above all a lot of fun. The implementation is great! Quite a lot of variability in the passage. Interesting story. Replay value, hidden achievements. All this is good! And apparently it is still far from the end. But still, the price tag is too high. RUR 1500 would be acceptable.. Great strategy game...miss a good game like this for a long time! The first Desperados was great back then but this one is Superb! Great job!. Amazing game, really great example how modern Commandos-style game should look in this time.. As great as shadow tactics. Very clever, every mission is a new challenge. I thought that the witch will look weird in western, bud every mission was so great, that I didn't even though about magic.... I love this game. It's a masterpiece and really fun. The gameplay, balanced difficulty, beautiful graphics, perfect level design, storyline, characters, dynamic music, humor, it was so fun to play for many hours. Just buy it and play. It kept me focused just on this game for the whole week.. Played on PS4 , great, epic game , awesome characters and skills, the graphics are really good for a strategy game. I leave ten very seldom because I feel during recent years, the games are dull, not exciting, the stories are oversimplified. Pros.: - Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive was super cool. I wanted to play the third game. - The concept of Commando in the Wild West environment is potentially good. - Improved graphics look cool. - The story. - The team and their abilities. - The game provides you with the KILL EM ALL stealth, options, challenges, achievements. - You may change the style of the game and even difficulty. - No bugs at all. Cons.: - I don't see any. Maybe the only one is that at some point you feel the story is quite predictable. In total, the game is worth buying. Guys did a really GREAT JOB.. One of the best strategy games in recent years and easily the best western themed game from my opinion (even compared to red dead).. ""Great game, very atmospheric, love of detail, fun game mechanics, some funny dialogues, lovable characters and great replay value, if you appreciate challenges. Gotta say tho, that the price is a bit steep considering the length, so one point off for that. Still a very, very good and captivating game - I wish there was more like that."" -Turtolia123321. Basically a re-skinned shadow tactics, but that's good. Very fun and engaging game.. A game that makes you think out of the box in every way imaginable by, well, hammering the playstyle into your head. At first this is a bit irritating because you're only taught the basics for each character and then Desperados 3 just throws overcomplicated tactical problems at you, but then you realize you're actually a tactical genius and cruise through the final 30% of the game cleverly and elegantly, sometimes even improvizing on the spot.. i get it that y'all love your cowboy shootouts and cool guy attitude with sleazy guitar background music, and in terms of atmosphere, desperados 3 is quite a stunner. but that's about it - a stunner for those critics who just have a short look onto the surface and play into the game for a mere 20 minutes. after that, it becomes all but fun: it's repetitive, uninspiring, the verbal jokes become lame, the killing of hordes of pretty dumb enemies turns out to be a soulless office job and most of all, the handling of your heroes, their moves, their actions is annoying as f*ck. seriously, ALT+mouse move for screen rotation? CTRL click for action? S, A, W, D keys used for pre-selecting an action? are you trying to reinvent the wheel of well established PC keyboard layouts? other then that, really, grow up guys. two people mixing up a town's gang of 30 plus baddies while not upsetting the civil bystanders?? and that's just an early example of the - unfortunately, continuous - story line. i appreciate the tactical variety, i do like the elements of surprise and there is serious planning in this strategy sneaker and shooter - but i can't be bothered to play the same screens over and over again just because the jerky key bindings are unintuitive. this whole think looks to me like its been engineered by rocket scientists and then thrown into the marketing department with a couple of cool screen shots, all to make a handful of dollars before sundown. sadly, not gripping me at all.. Mimimi have done it again! Another brilliant title under the niche real-time tactics genre that appeared to be gone and forgotten only a few years ago. Mimimi had found the right formula for Shadow Tactics and have only improved upon that with Desperados III! This game has it all – interesting storyline, great level design, challenges that can be approached in a number of ways, memorable characters with diverse skills which allow for a myriad of combinations. Difficulty options make it accessible for newcomers to the genre. And while that’s not really my cup of tea, there’s a great potential for doing speedruns or trying to take on one of the challenges that get unlocked only after you complete a mission for the first time. One thing Desperados III really stands out for is that it came out as a fully completed and very well polished game. From day one, there were no non-negligible bugs/issues and having already completed it, it never felt like it would need to get DLC-ed before you can really enjoy it. While that used to be the standard some 15-20 years ago, all that is very rare nowadays so kudos to Mimimi for taking the time and effort to polish it that much before releasing it. Following the free content update released a few days ago, I’ve now invested 40+ hours in it. And that’s before the DLC’s that I’m eligible to receive having pre-ordered the game! While I’m certainly a completionist type of player, that’s definitely impressive for a single playthrough, i.e. no level re-runs, taking on challenges, etc. Overall, the game is very much worth the price. Can we have more of the same, please? It’s already perfect as is!. it's a good tactical game. but after finishing it felt it was a bit repetitive to me. once all characters was available, i was just doing the same stuff, clearing an area and continue to the next one until the end point.. The game was pretty solid. Numerous characters with plenty of abilities. Just couldn't find myself becoming addicted with the game. Perhaps, this genre just isn't my style which is not a knock on the game developers or the game itself.. I think it is a great game. I enjoy all the level. Easier game than Shadow Tactics because a few character have very overpowered skills.. It brings back sweet memories of times when I played Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive. That game was great and this game is remarkable.. Great gameplay and an overall awesome experience! I'm especially impressed how some of the problems of the older games (like the free view in Commandos 2, which often hindered clarity and hid important objects) have been solved. And to top it of even the story is enganging and keeps me thinking. I'm probably 15 hours in and have finished probably 3/4 of the frist run. If you like puzzle, real time strategy (Also you can pause everytime on normal), western or gopod games in general: Buy this! :). I am writing this review right after finishing the game on hard difficulty in 31 hours. I did not expect the missions in total would take me this amount of time but I have had great amount of fun playing them, feeling satisfaction when a showdown (simultaneous action from all characters) executed perfectly or felt frustrated when it did not. Being a big big big fan of the Commandos games playing games like Desperados really bring me back. This game was definitely worth the wait and is definitely worth your money if you enjoy RTT-games.. The best examples of Real Time Tactics Stealth games. Every RTT fan must have play this.. Outstanding! Mimimi managed to improve upon all aspects of Shadow Tactics: Blades of The Shogun, and also differentiate the style of and characters from it.. The best example of a Real Time Tactics game I have played since the original Commandos franchise which began in the late 90's. The developer Mimimi games have created a RTT gem. Their first RTT game was Shadow Tactics which was a great homage to Commandos series though a little rough around the edges but they have taken Shadows Tactics DNA and refined it to create Desperados 3. The game play is so addictive it's a game you don't want to put down. It's challenging especially on the hardest difficult ""Desperado"" but the sense of achievement when you crack a difficult mission or scenario is fantastic. I can only compare it to the feeling you get when you defeat a tough boss in Dark Souls, you feel so good about yourself like you're a genius. The game controls are very intuitive and the levels are super detailed, really high end visuals for a RTT. it's a very accessible game easy to learn but a brilliant challenge to master. The game is well worth it's triple A price tag due to having 50 hours plus of content especially on Desperado difficulty which I played it on and for it's high quality production. The game works perfectly I haven't experienced any bugs on PC and the game is extremely well optimised, my I9-9900K/RTX 2080TI machine can run the game at a rock solid 120 FPS at 4K resolution. I am now tackling the bonus challenges which are still keeping me in game even after spending 55 hours on the campaign missions. The story is good if nothing exciting but works for the narrative. There are only 4 different enemy types including guard dogs, I would have liked to see more variety. The voice acting is excellent with some funny one liners from enemies. The sound effects are high quality and the music is catchy I would usually turn it off to concentrate in Commandos for example but this soundtrack is worth listening to. Shadow Tactics came close to taking the Commandos crown as the king of RTT's but with all due respect to the 90's classic, Desperados 3 is the new king.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Desperados III Guarded Fun Desperados 3 is a story driven real time tactical stealth game set in the wild west where you play as a variety of characters all with their own unique abilities to help you obtain a goal whether that’s gaining dynamite or killing targets… Desperados III in a way is a top down assassins creed meets hitman, youre set in one large open map per level, each map taking anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours to complete depending on your trial and error… so there is potential for easily 20 hours of gameplay here, especially if you set out to complete each mission challenges. At the beginning of each level youre given the goal and then the game lets you lose, figure it out… you have your characters, you have their abilities, use their abilities to accomplish the goal… At first desperados 3 feels overwhelming, constant tutorials, new mechanics to learn, but once I got the hang of it, I really started to enjoy this game.. im a huge fan of assassins creed so I love to dabble in stealth games from time to time.. distracting guards and setting up kills, hiding in bushes and executing ambushes.. quicksaving anytimei felt I made hefty progress or just incase I mess up a set up… and theres a new mechanic called showdown where you can pause the game and indivually input camands to your characters and with the press of a button execute the plan.. Desperados 3 has everything going for it to be one of the best and most fun stealth games ever.. the variety of characters, all having great personalities, great level design and world building.. interactive items in the world like hitman that you wait for just the right moment to pull off… BUT Desperados 3 desperately tries to challenge you in an annoying way rather than an enjoyable way.. this is another instance of hard for the sake of being.. this is annoying hard not challenging hard My biggest gripe with desperados 3 is that it gives you so much to have fun with but it doesn’t want you having fun at all… it advertises itself as go in quiet or loud, good luck… the moment youre spotted youre swarmed like a piece of cake on an ant hill, being spotted is a sure death sentence on any difficulty… which is fine I respect force stealth.. if its fair.. the stealth in desperados 3 however is not fair.. its unrealistic and annoying.. every guard has 2 eyes on them and those 2 eyes have another 4 eyes on them and those 4 eyes have 6 eyes on them, its constant cones on all directions, making a game about picking bodies off one by one - about getting lucky, getting in a ranged kill and running and hiding until the heat is off.. its ridiculously unfair how many enemies are thrown at you on these maps, and to make it worse when guards are alarmed it isn’t enough for enemies from the map to come check things out, the game spawn even more onto the map for that area, I didn’t feel as though I was completing levels with skill, I felt I was getting through with luck… how is there a sniper watching a sniper… this is there simply because the player sees an opportunity to sneak to a sniper and use an environmental kill.. but you have a sniper watching the sniper just incase that sniper gets taken out? Hes just there to be annoying, no reason other than that.. and this is how the game feels from start to finish.. sneaking up behind someone to take them out, only for someone at a different angle to be warking towards you while the other 2 characters guarding that angle is leaving… again urning this into a game of luck rather than a bunch of dumb stealth fun… Desperados 3 has potential… it has so much good going for it.. but the insistence on challenging the player rather than creating an enjoyable puzzle to solve squand","desperados 3 is a masterpiece of real-time strategy games for me . i believe everyone will enjoy it, whether they like the genre or not . i finished story because i don’t want to praise the game too much and make it unattractive in your eyes ."
"996.Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War","New to the warhammer universe and this game is a great introduction. Had alot of fun doesn't offer much gameplay wise there are a really limited amount of units but still its more than enough for its 15 hour story campagin.. I like Warhammer, I don't particularly like RTS games (even though I have played way too many). This hits a solid middle for me. It's basically just Age of Empires.. The game is really not in good shape right now. Even though Dawn of War came out 3-4 years after Warcraft 3, it has a lot of shortcomings compared to it. The game can't go full screen in 1080p. You can't even change the controls. Even though the game has sold close to 10 million copies and is still selling, the developers can't even be bothered to make a simple update that would allow us to change the in-game controls and make the game run in full screen at 1080p. If you're still selling the game, at least show some respect for your players and make these simple QoL updates.. Absolutely masterpiece , all what I want now is definitive version of this ga...... , What do u mean by relic abounded the game. Very solid RTS. The genre improves with new units and mechanics from the warhammer universe, A lot of factions and options to choose. A lot of fun for a while, i remember being surprised by all the options available.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. One of the best (if not the best) game I ever played. Got clever design features which make the game really nervous at all stage, where numerous RTS you might stay in your base until you have a big army. Best translation of Warhammer ever. Epic animations who make want to watch replays on and on. 9 factions in total with the extensions. Great in multiplayer or in Skirmish vs IA (especially… Expand. Blood for the blood god. Skulls for the skull throne .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily takes a spot as one of the best RTS games made. Top notch setting and game-play. Do yourself a favour and just play it.. MEh ...very cheesy ...and annoying dialogue. But playable and fun, finished it.. 16 years after release I finally got round to playing this... The in-game graphics have held up in a surprisingly okay way, although textures are of a low quality compared with today (as to be expected). The graphics in the cut scenes is very 2004 :) The sound and voice acting are good throughout, although some of the voices are a bit over-egged (still quite enjoyable). I only played the single player campaign and enjoyed it, it was about the right length and there was a nice twist at the end. It took about 11 hours to complete on hard. I say it's about the right length as the missions can all be done in a very similar way - play defensive for a while, build up the strongest army you can and you're then unstoppable. Overall I found it fun and will play the expansion packs at some point.. I still remember how amazed I was when I played Dawn of War for the first time. Crucial game for the evolution of the RTS genre. It lacks variety found in later add-ons but it is still an awesome introduction to the world of Warhammer 40 000.. Good RTS of a tactical level. Features an interesting campaign with great voice acting.. Guess my love with warhammer 40000 universe started with this game. Really good RTS game.. the first part of the series ""Dawn of war"" and in my opinion the best, this part was for me the first of the series 40K. For Players unfamiliar with the books or the desktop version of the game, showed something really interesting and powerful, the game is not just delayed for a good 30 hours of passing the company and online battles, but also gave impetus to dive into the lore of the universe Warhammer 40k. Biggest RTS game of this year, epic game!!! a lot of fun if you are going to play this game with your friends. Such a good comeback to this dark, bloody and gore world. FOR THE EMPERORRRR!!!. Fantastic game and campaign story ingame, make video game warhammer 40 000 with cards for pc, that will be cool... Dawn of War Warhammer 40 000 is best game ever for me all expansions and patches are great. Solid and balanced game play. Great campaign. Tons of 40k flavour. Only four races though so not a lot of options for multiplayer unless you buy the expansions. It also would've been nice to see a branch of the campaign focus on something other that space marines.. Absolutely a Warhammer fan. I've always loved the style of Warhammer Fantasy, painting Wood Elves, High Elves, and other races... So when I got this game, I didn't really know what to expect. Eventually it became the game I played for hours and hours on, including all expansions. Playing Single Player campaign, Skirmish and multiplayer skirmishes with friends! Creating many, many army skins. Story The story was really fun to play, it uses the great lore Games Workshop created around the Space Marines. Playing with the Blood Raven chapter -I had never seen this chapter in the store- was a delight. For the time the cinematics where great and the battle against Chaos was immersive and tense. Graphics As I noted in the paragraph above, the cinematic graphics where great for that time! So where the ingame graphics and animations. I truly loved the little animations added to combat, that Space Marine sticking it's chainsaw up into an Orcs face and ripping it appart. The Bloodseeker bashing enemies with it's great axe and cast them aside if it's nothing, etc. Gameplay This is a squad based RTS, which makes it easy to command your troops and keep a great overview of your army. Furthermore I loved the unique resource gain, capturing points and needing to hold them. There always was that tense moment when you have a relic and need to keep it! Another plus is the easy design on the user interface, very clear and consistent throughout the game and it's expansions. Conclusion I have played this game for so many hours, with and without friends. Playing all races, creating army skins and fighting against every possible threat with that army. It was so much fun, for me this is one of the best games ever. 10/10!. Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a good strategy game, but you can't choose many civilizations and I miss the Imperial Army - my favourite civilization.. This is the 2nd BEST rts game i´ve ever played( Company Of Heroes being my favorite). The whole game feels balanced and i have never seen a single bug in the time i´ve been playing it. The story is great, the skirmish is fantastic and with the other expansion packs you will never want to leave it. As it is an old game it is very cheap and easy to get hold of for less than 10 pounds. i am really recommending this for anyone how have played or like rts games.. As a fun of table Warhammer 40K i am really happy that Warhammer finally god great PC game. This is one of the best RTS games for sure. Esp. in multiplayer or Skirmish.. There have been several attempts at making Warhammer 40.000 games. Some of them were a failure, others were ok. This one was perfect, both in setting and in gameplay.. I can't use any words that will do justice to this game. Great combat animations, great unit control, unique but balanced races (and a whole bunch of them with the expansions), epic battles, great maps, and overall a good story. Buy this one, and stay away from that piece of crap sequel.. Nice graphics with some decent gameplay, but lacks the replayability value and variety that seperates an average game from a legendary one. It's a shame, because the franchise has so much potential and a lot of effort has gone into making the game look good. One outstanding thing is there's some decent customisation options you can do to your squads and vehicles to tailor them to the roles you want, which is a very nice touch. On the downside, only the Necrons have a ""unique"" feel to playing them compared to the other races, with all the other factions being essentially the same race with different skins. The Tao are fairly unique, but only because they lack many of the features the Imp/Marines/Chaos/Eldar/DEldar/SoB uni-race has. Maybe ""unique"" is the wrong word... ""Special"". Yeah that's the word.. One of the best (if not the best) game I ever played. Got clever design features which make the game really nervous at all stage, where numerous RTS you might stay in your base until you have a big army. Best translation of Warhammer ever. Epic animations who make want to watch replays on and on. 9 factions in total with the extensions. Great in multiplayer or in Skirmish vs IA (especially with Dawn of Skirmish Mod). Best RTS game ever.. This is an excellent strategy game. The units are varied and fairly well balanced between factions, the maps are enjoyable and action packed, and the campaign is deep and fulfilling (aside from the cliffhanger). All units are customizable which adds a huge level of depth and strategic planning and the placement of strategic points prevents the game from being a defensive stand-off. The AI is challenging and the multiplayer is still active after 7 years which guarantees playability once you have mastered the AI. This is a must play both for strategy fans and table-top Warhammer enthusiasts.. If you're a fan of the Warhammer 40k franchise, you'll enjoy this series of games by THQ. Dawn of War brings the tabletop miniatures game to life in 3D RTS with explosive action and gore.",new to the warhammer universe and this game is a great introduction . had alot of fun doesn't offer much gameplay wise there are a really limited amount of units . the game is really not in good shape right now .
997.Pony Island,"This game is just good, it’s short but fun, interesting and original, I recommend it a lot, plus is very cheap. It's a magical game about ponys you can play in one sitting. It goes on sale for a dollar often so I would definitely recommend it for that price.. This game is very very short and yet still manages to get repetitive and dull. The subversions here hardly work because the game immediately blows its own load before you even played for five minutes. It's not terrible but there's no reason to play this instead of Daniel Mullians other games.. Pony Island is a video game developed and published by Canadian indie developer Daniel Mullins. As a metafictional game, the game has the player interact with what appears to be an old arcade cabinet game called ""Pony Island"". The player soon discovers the game is corrupted by Lucifer himself, who is trying to claim the player's soul for itself. The player is aided by the soul of a previous player who helps the player access Pony Island's internal programming to get around the traps left by Lucifer and save not only their soul, but the many tormented souls that are trapped within the game's code.. I wanted to give 9/10, but I started to think about the drawbacks... and I've found none. One could not simply make this game better, it excels all its ambitions. Must play for computer games lovers (this title will become classic like Portal or Stanley Parable).. Interesting concept but gets boring and repetitious pretty fast because best part of the game is not really the main time spending part (side scrolling and puzzles).. A very short and very sweet metagame. I can't actually say anymore without spoiling it so just go and play... You won't regret it. Afterwards go and learn your fractions with Frog Fractions.. The sheer shock of moving from one wild idea to another makes Pony Island one of the most surprising and engaging recent indie titles. Daniel Mullins knows how to break the fourth wall in increasingly entertaining and somewhat deranged ways and the soundtrack and visuals really help sell the entire experience. The final four or so of the game could have benefited from a little more care but overall this is one of the best game and meta experiences of 2016.. Very frustrating puzzles! I couldn't bear it! I could play only 20min on record!. An enjoyable 2 hour experience. A lot of love went into this game. It definitely had the potential to fullfil its main ambition (to break the 4th wall) but it doesn't do it. Worth buying, but it's not a 10. 6.5/10. The game is extremely well done and is unique to every other game I've played. The fourth wall is broken multiple times and there are quite a few characters other than just ponies. The easter eggs were hard but fun to find. It manages to keep the game creepy and scares you without the need of jumpscares. I love the 'Show don't tell' with the puzzles and just the puzzles overall. The only problem I have with this game is near the end where it's shown that it was obviously made for Windows 7 and definitely needs an update so it can change depending on what OS you're using.. If you have more hair gel than hair, wear long sleeved button-up shirts in the summer, you're favorite pass-time is sipping chai lattes, and your boyfriends name is Chuck... you'll love this game. For us Folgers drinking working fathers of the world the appeal of this game lasts just slightly longer than the install time. It tries very hard to be funny, but just ends up being juvenile. Unfun gameplay and ""stylistic"" (stylistic is just another word for lazy folks) artwork can not be made up for by the ""OMG 4th wall WTF less me tweet about this"" crap. Ok? I It's a bad game that seems to have fooled a lot of folks into thinking they are somehow witty for finding it ""cool."" It's bad in the same way Starbucks made billions off selling terrible coffee. Ok? 3/10 It runs. What more can you say.. Simplistic game, but creative and interesting to play to the end. I would recommend it.. It's an unusual puzzle game where you attempt to escape from a bugged arcade machine with a stupid endless runner game which has an evil AI and won't let you leave. It's a unique experience, and basically every next puzzle is unlike those you've seen previously, so the game keeps asking you to think out-of-the-box all the time. Good: - nice retro feel from the late 80s - early 90s, achieved with graphics and sounds - unusual puzzles which don't repeat themselves - the humor of it all: you stumble in the dark trying to figure out what's happening and what this game is actually about. I suppose the author also puts a question here what makes a game a game, or what a game is? Since the game itself (Pony Island endless runner) is boring as hell, and fiddling around with hacks, bugs and options is the real game. So-so: - it's a puzzle, so, no replay value. And often you are stuck and just move around the screens doing random things, trying to guess what the author wanted from you this time. And since it all mostly doesn't make sense, it can get frustrating. But that's just what puzzles are about. If you aren't really into puzzles, you may drop it in the middle. Bad: - nothing really. Pony island has very engaging mechanics when it comes to emulating buggy devil-possessed OS and puzzles are mostly nice. Arcade parts are not very fun, but short and easy, so you won't spent too much time doing them.. This is a super clever game that goes about its satire of other video games in a way that is very over the top and ridiculous but also well thought out. I really enjoyed it and have played through it 3 times now.. Super unexpected, funny and old school gaming - the best is how it makes you play simple games and make you alert to whatever oddball might be coming at you next wish it was bigger, more complex, varied and a little deeper (:. Definitely worth a look. Interesting concept of playing a game in a game which is corrupted. It's not a overly long game, maybe 2-3 hours out of it. At the right place it is worth a look as it's a quite different to the norm.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. It is rarely that after finishing a game I rush to metacritic page to review it with a perfect score. It is also rare for me to finish even short games - and Pony Island definitely qualifies as such - in just one sitting. This game is an adventure unlike any other that made me feel as if indeed I was trapped inside some insidious machine that wouldn't let me out - not without a fight. It is also the best game I've ever played featuring satan as the main antagonist, and simply one of the best games I've ever played. It will make you think, it will make you laugh, it will make you ask ""what is a video game?"", and it does not overstay its welcome. So what is Pony Island? It is a favour that you owe to yourself. Get it and enjoy, you will be pleased (if you have at least half a brain that is).. There is a point where I said out loud ""This game is freaking genius!"". My brother can vouch for that. It is very clever. I have to be honest, the segments where you play the endless runner portion are sometimes a bit too challenging for my tastes, but I would just knuckle under and get through them because the rest of it is really rather clever. I won't spoil it by telling you why, but chances are you've already seen a ton of spoilers. If you haven't then don't read any more reviews and just play the game. It's better that way.. A very strange puzzle game. The narrative is a meta-game: the player plays the hacking of a videogame machine in order to escape it (!). The difficulty of the puzzles is low, but not trivial. It is very fascinating though. It will take only a few hours to complete, so it's definitely worth trying it.. To be honest it’s hard to know where to begin when describing Pony Island but, suffice to say, it’s very clever and unlike anything else you’ll have ever played. In gameplay terms it largely consists of endless runner style segments and abstract puzzles but you really have to just try it for yourself to even you’re going to have any understanding of exactly how it works.. Pony Island is one of those very meta games. You appear to be playing a game on an old arcade machine, but as the game progresses, it quickly becomes clear that the arcade may not be what it seems, and the game itself is not what it seems. Satan seems to want your soul, and you, quite obviously, aren’t going to give it to him. Played via a virtual CRT monitor, the game quickly breaks down. The core game of Pony Island, where you play a pony jumping over a series of barriers, is broken up with puzzles involving redirecting keys to hack the game, as well as desktop sections where you communicate with another person trapped in the game, as well as constant mockery from Lucifer himself, who tries to convince you to give him your soul to unlock (intentionally terrible) gameplay, and who complains as you keep breaking his games (he worked so hard on them!). Over the course of the game, you confront three demons in three different battles of wits and solve a number of fairly simple puzzles, all while the game holds up a very thin sheen of not being some sort of demonic thing that might cost you your soul. Unfortunately, while the game itself is a neat concept, all in all it isn’t terribly fun to *play*. The actual gameplay is intentionally simple and samey, and unfortunately, hanging a lampshade on that fact doesn’t make it any more fun. The puzzles are okay but generally nothing to write home about, and while the sheer variability of the thing is interesting at times, at other times you are spending very long stretches doing the same thing over and over again, which just isn’t very much fun. The core game of Pony Island is deliberately bad and unfortunately, deliberately bad is still bad. All in all, I can’t really recommend this. It is a neat idea, but it just doesn’t really end up feeling like it has enough payoff to be worthwhile. It lacks the feeling of profundity you got from games like The Talos Principle; instead, it is just very simplistic and while it presents itself as what it is, ultimately what it is is nothing all that special. After you understand what it is, there’s little left for you here, and while it is only about two and a half hours long (maybe less), it still wore thin by the end. The moments of cleverness simply aren’t worth the time investment.. Narrative awesome, gameplay.... nyah. You are trapped in a video game that you need to escape out of. The storytelling here is really fun and awkward. Gameplay dumbs down to clicking around menus to find a backdoor, then you hack it. That however is pretty much only 3 things: 1 - sidescroll a unicorn firing lasers evading obstacles and fighting some enemies. (The sort of sidescroller that automoves) 2 - you need to get a key into a hole. For this you have several columns and redirect functions to get the key in there 3 - variant of 2 just that ponies fall down Game time: 3-4 hours. Amazing game, the game has a very dark story behind, this game broke completely the four wall, and the puzles are so simple and funny at the same moment. The complete review here: ****/analisis-pony-island/ (only in spanish). The concept of this game is awesome, but look at something like watchdogs, great concept less than amazing execution. So how did this turn out...... absolutely fantastic. It starts slowly luring you into this creepy arcade world and then transforming into a chaotic self aware story with some of the best and most surprising moments I've had this generation. The one problem with this game is how YOU NEED TO GO IN BLIND knowing little to nothing about the story to have the best experience which can be very difficult nowadays. P.S. Long Live Beelzebub. A very cool concept not that well executed and boring at times (the pony parts & puzzles unfortunately get old). However the third core boss battle was pure genius! Tricked me several times! (very slight spoiler on character names ahead) I think if the whole game had been running around that concept ( if satan rather than asmodeus was the one doing these kind of tricks through the game) it would have been much stronger and immersive. Pretty cool chiptune soundtrack too.. I give the game a score of 2 for the few (very few) successful attempts on being funny, as it seems like is the only goal in the game. Overall it was a poor experience with very short, dark and loud/noisy game-play. The story is boring, the dialog, which is an essential part **** like this, doesn't feel completed and sounds hurt my ears even when it was on very low volume. Normally I like games with a little touch of puzzle and humor, but this game just seemed like a waste of time.. I think this game is very creative and original. If you are looking for something that will keep you entertained for 2-3 hours, this game is a good option. The ""battle"" vs the last boss is the best one I have ever seen, and the game is really cheap. Some parts of the game are not that interesting (mainly tha part when you move the pony), but overall, it´s a great game, and great value for the money. Best game what i'am playing,and best gameplay! OST too best. Very much puzzles, and best storyline! Please this is game by god! (and by satana XD) play this pls. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PONIES! Pony Island is one of the most clever indie games i've played in a long time, however runs thin after awhile. It starts out as an innocent endless runner, but later on, it becomes dark. You're trying to fight against the video game by completing different variations of one puzzle, and it tries to break the 4th wall... a bit too hard. 4th wall breaking in games has already been done, so this game really isn't anything new. The game had a lot of potential to be balls-to-the-wall insane with it's 4th wall, but it just pokes it. It's not a bad game, but it really should've been something more. Pony Island gets a 7/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the best creative game I have ever seen An incredible experience.funny and puzzling best indie game of the year worth $5 on steam and 1-4 hours of your life. this game isn't that great, it's fun at parts first time through but it doesn't leave much of a lasting impression and the pony levels are really, really boring. although the fourth wall breaking aspects of it are very unique especially with **** which was by far the best aspect of the game and really shocked me, the pony levels and the first two thirds of act 3 leave a lot to be desired. The two final bosses also are not anything special. take it or leave it as you will. Hi, fourth wall. Sorry, we're gonna have to break you. A lot. Nah, seriously, Pony Island's a pretty clever game and well worth the asking price of 5€. I don't really want to say anything else about it, because it's best experienced without knowing anything beforehand.. Incredibly simple gameplay and visuals, it's something you'd expect from a browser game from 00's. The high scores it's getting is because it's ""breaking the 4th wall"". Thing is, you need to establish the 4th wall before breaking it, and Pony Island breaks it withing 5 minutes and then keeps repeating the same tricks until the end. Gets really boring and predictable very fast. Nothing smart about shouting ""Look at me, I'm a game and I'm aware of it"". Comparing it to Undertale and The Stanley Parable is a joke, those games are in a different league.. Pony Island is such a hard game to make. It breaks the 4th wall repeatedly and its just such a weird feeling to the game i couldn't think straight after playing it ...... oh and PS:the trailer music is AWESOME DEFINITELY worth $5 on steam and 1-4 hours of your life. This game is amazing. It's disturbing engrossing and overall enjoyable. As long as you can get past the title, the rest of the game is a blast to play and **** you right into the world with its weird characters.. In Pony Island you're trying to escape from an evil videogame by completing puzzles (really just variations of one puzzle). Although the game had the premise and potential to go off the rails and be awesome... it kinda just points to the 4th wall and pokes it... and keeps poking it in case you didn't get it the first time. In fact if you've seen the trailer on its Steam page then you've pretty much experienced 80% of this game. At the time of my review this game is getting critical praise and I have no idea why. The idea of playing with the 4th wall has been done before in gaming, and one of the most interesting things that occurs in the game hearkens back to 1998's Metal Gear Solid (see Psycho Mantis). I guess videogame critics love games that they can complete and review in a 2 hour period while pretending that they've engaged in something ""intelligent"". In fact look at me I'm writing a critique of the critics (that's ""unexpected!"") and by acknowledging this I've broken the 4th wall (how ""intelligent""!). I'm giving it a 6 because it isn't bad... but don't believe the hype.. This game is a fantastic experience. Genuinely hilarious and charming, it takes you on an adventure through an arcade machine created by devil himself. Throughout the journey accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, you uncover quite an interesting story that is both funny and terrifying. It's humorous, it's tense - and more than anything - it's clever. My only problem is that some of the puzzles are a bit too difficult, which felt a little annoying. Outside of that , Pony Island is a brilliant adventure to go through, boasting what I think is one heck of a climactic finale that will lodge in your memory for quite some time.. Pony Island is a hard game to describe without spoiling. It’s an “experience” game, one that simply must be experienced. It follows in the footsteps of games like The Stanley Parable, Her Story, and Undertale. At it's core Pony Island is a simple endless runner with hacking puzzles thrown in, but where the gameplay falls lackluster the story and atmosphere make up tenfold. Even with sometimes repetitive gameplay the game can still really surprise you. If you have a soul to spare and like ponies give this game a shot. 8.5/10. An indie game that's intelligent, atmospheric, immersive, and breaks the fourth wall. You have to be tolerant to some light puzzle solving and look past its visuals to get the best experience. It's around 4 hours long but it's littered with secrets for you to revisit and find. Keep playing until you get 100% achievement if you want to see all the content. It's only $5 on steam, totally worth it if you are up for some mindfuggery.. An incredible experience. Funny, creepy, baffling, and engrossing, Pony Island is an experience that everyone should have. I don't want to spoil everything, but at $5 on Steam, this is a steal. Give it a try, and give the Devil his due.","the game has the player interact with what appears to be an old arcade cabinet game called ""Pony Island"" the player soon discovers the game is corrupted by Lucifer himself, who is trying to claim the player's soul for itself . the player is aided by the soul of a previous player who helps the player access Pony Island's internal programming ."
998.MLB The Show 19,"This game was my first encounter with the baseball. I did not have any clue about rules of this sport but after some time I used to really like it.. I really wish Sony never got there hands on the MLB license................... It's more irritating to play than anything, I'm not getting The Show 20. If you're the type to leave honest reviews, they have access to your game and can make your game play experience unfavorable. This company is no different than EA.. Any pre-May reviews don't include the worst patch a game has ever had, please disregard them. The game started strong this year, then they introduced the first patch. I'm writing this in mid-June and the game has gotten little attention, hitting is mediocre at best as it has been since '17 (though '19 was an improvement) and there disaster of a hitting engine that was introduced. Add in this year pitching is horrible, it is beyond RNG and there is no point in user input, this is the first year I've felt that I have no impact on the outcome of my pitches. Fielding also has went into the dumpster, last year there were some issues with no agency of outfielders getting to the ball, we have that this year AND players not responding to balls. I had a game yesterday where a gold fielder (second only to a diamond fielder) let a routine infield fly ball hit him in the face. This franchise has taken a HUGE step backwards from what '19 gave us; the content improved a bit but the gameplay is a giant dumpster fire from last year. At this point this franchise's devs have already moved on to '21 and they dgaf about this year. At best this is worth a $20 purchase. This game is utter garbage. It’s a real shame the MLB The Show series would stoop this horrendously low, when for the most part, they’ve usually put out good games. MLB the show 19 is an atrocity. From the gameplay, to the countless bugs, to the garbage controls, this game is everything a baseball game shouldn’t be. It’s clunky, boring, and after a max of around 3 weeks the desire to play it ever again will most likely be completely diminished. If MLB The Show 20 is anything like this one, we’re in for another trash game.. I'm not a big baseball fan but hey, this game is fun as hell and not so difficult as it seems. Love it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is garbage. it tried to make it to where less homeruns were hit and that didn’t work because no matter where the ball is thrown you hit out and a guy could have 0 power and hit one out. GARBAGE. Always a hard one to review. From a non-baseballing country for the 2nd time I've given this franchise a try and for the second time I've ended up perplexed. I find myself putting many, many hours into Road To The Show and effectively getting nowhere. I managed to get drafted into a MLB team but from there its grind, grind and grind some more. I put so much time into RTTS I don't really get to touch any of the other game modes and when I do, its more grind, grind, grind. Its a shame, if the experience was more streamlined I'd say the game would have a bigger audience, instead its really targeted at at baseball purists only.. Ill be quick with this review, basically its biggest problem is the amount of luck based game play. This **** to because the game is very fun content wise, there is always something to do, and the best part is you don't have to spend a penny, my team is 92 overall and I haven't spent a single dollar.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Boy am I glad I got this installment for free. I've played every incarnation of The Show and I'm done with this series. Diamond Dynasty is pay-to-win, if you're willing to shell out the cash you can field a team of 99 rated players and even with mediocre skill that's a huge advantage. The game would be balanced (and more interesting) if you could only make trades in the card market. You could propose trades with other players, like trading cards in real life. That way the only way to amass an amazing diamond-level team would be by playing a lot and doing well. Another huge irritant is that when the AI wants something to happen, it's going to happen. You can be closing out a game and throw a pitch two feet outside the plate and the Ai will clobber a game-winning homer. I don't mind the fluke errors in situations that make sense, but in this game it just seems lazy. I do like the Moments feature, it's fun to play through iconic moments and use legendary players, however success in this mode is entirely random. You may be tasked with getting X amount of hits in a game, then the AI pitcher beans you and walks you twice. I found that by simply replaying the moment over and over you will eventually just get a fat pitch to hit. One last issue- after a game or challenge ends, it shows you the menu screen, then cuts to an award screen showing your progress, which you have to exit from, then goes back to the menu. It drives me nuts. Just show the reward screen before the menu screen! As a huge baseball fan this is a realistic baseball experience overall but I'm sick of playing my butt off just to keep going up against people who spent a ton of money on the game. Imagine playing Call of Duty and there were players who were using soldiers much faster than you, with better guns, just because they shelled out money for the game. Same thing going on here.. It's pretty average and similar to the old games. It gets a 7 instead of a 5 because Madden, NBA 2K and FIfa are all garbage.. I'm not a person who buys baseball every year, so I don't have the complaint of it being similar to last year's game or anything. However, I love this game. Unlike other sports titles, the game pretty much plays out exactly how the games will play out in real life. You have the option to play through it fast, or play it slow and watch the games. It's an overall great time if you love baseball.. MLB The Show has the franchise on the best baseball game on console. For those that have never played this franchise, this is easily a 9 or 10. However, for those of us that have been playing this franchise for the past couple years, it is disappointing. Road to the Show is my personal preference. I got excited when they spoke about an interactive personality responses to shape your player. It is such a half effort attempt to improve the game which is my feeling about the past couple years. You pick a response that has NO impact on anything except filling another bar to fill for additional attributes. You couldn't think deeper in that certain responses could effect you view from fans, teammates, coaches, etc. Nope, just a response that gets some generic response back to fill a bar and really means nothing. This part of the game needs interactions, and not the same repetitive ones. It does not matter how you respond to any of these interactions, it has no long term effects. Now for the gameplay. Again, if you have never played The Show, is remarkable, but after a couple years you see the flaws. The throwing mechanics on a ground ball are just confusing. You get the same meter and the same amount of time whether its a bunt leaving you little time or a hard grounder right at you leaving you all day to make the throw. Just a repetitive mis-utilized idea. Getting a trend at this point. The fielding mechanics are random, with some player momentum carrying them a couple steps while others being able to stop on a dime a throw right away in a very mechanical non realistic play. Lets not include that the game has requested me to steal with my 30 speed numerous times which would never occur in the game. Hit and run would make sense but that has been completely removed. I have played in games with Stanton and other power hitters bunt making for an easy out. Finally, I can't tell you how many times AI players have struck out swinging early on fastballs. It has been happening for years now and just takes away from such an attempt of a realistic baseball game. Overall, another year of half effort attempts to make the game more creative. This seems to be a trend though with most EA sports games. Its like a movie with insane special effects but overall just lacks any story line. They continue to tweak the game to appear more realistic without making the game any better or fun for those looking for something different.. FYI, I only played Road to the Show (Rtts) , and March to October. Good New Rtts Progression system for perks Situational challenges in rtts Maintaining teammate and rival relationships in rtts Rtts still fun despite feeling similar to last years March to October is a great, fun, and quick new mode Different ways to play the game, whether its button timing or using analog sticks for pitching, batting, and fielding Bad Can’t leave after simulating to next appearance in rtts. Have to start next game at least then save and quit Multiple game challenges are negated or effect you negatively when you’re benched or pinch hit and you miss your one hit in rtts Rtts Feels like last year’s, or last few years’, game with the same animations, menus, awards system, and cutscenes So far in rtts, no stats and attributes can be improved during all star games Some Rtts mini games can have terrible timing and calibration Some Rtts don’t work like they should per their description (ex: Fog of War perk). Once again I don't get how critics of this game overlook the flaws that make this overall an average baseball sim with limited enjoyment time. First of all, Road to the Show is laughably poor. The ""archetype"" system is meaningless and the dialogue cut scenes repetitive and terrible for a AAA game. Put that with the fact that you can't ever call your agent, you have to spend the same amount of time in the minors regardless of your stats, you'll inexplicably ride the bench when performing well and it's a laughably poor and boring simulation. The training scenes and attribute upgrades and very boring and repetitive, and overall this mode is horrible. Franchise mode was slightly better this year, but once again features trades that make no sense (CPU will often sign a FA and trade them in same offseason) and the prospect system needs a complete overhaul. Player you draft are just arbitrary and have no personality and after a while no high player ratings (once all ""real"" players retire, there is just a bunch CPU generated players with 75-85 ratings and no elite players) Also the draft is a meaningless crapshoot where scouting does you no good. The mode is horrible frankly and offers no simulation into actually running a franchise. But hey, you get to pick if you want Nike or New Balance displays in your stadium! Also, the game pushes ultimate team crap at every possibly opportunity. If you have interest in this mode, I guess that's good. Now here's the good- the game looks amazing. Defense is a bit better. You can actually bunt. Hitting feels a bit better. That's it. Everything else with this game is just wonky trash. I would only buy it if you like the Ultimate team mode, since they are focusing on that and only that. Otherwise keep last year's version. Or the one before that.. Whoever updates the roster needs to quit rn...these are the worst updates I have ever seen in anygame... They take way too long to update as it is Then they only updates a very select **** the obvious ones like domingo German from the yankees have not been updated once even tho he is 9-1 wit a 3.43 era...trash updates. If I was rating this game purely on its cover athlete, it would get an F--. I'm not gonna patty cake around it, I'm a pretty steady fanboy of The Show. I love baseball and even at its worst, this game does, what I feel is a better job than most other sports games, capture the spirit of the game. This year's installment feels more natural than ever before. As an avid RTTS player, I love the way they have implemented personality. The only nitpicky things I have that don't even add up to that much is that I would like to see rain delays/doubleheaders in RTTS. Also, I'd LOVE the option to argue calls and get rung up, thus impacting my players clubhouse role.. I would say I have mixed feelings on this because I always square up the ball and exit velo 50 but when I’m late it’s like exit velo 90+ the rating matchups are trash I’m in wild card with a gold lineup and 4 diamonds but I feel like I always get matched up with 90+ overall teams etc i would give it a thumbs up but I would also say just fix the fielding already. Baseball is part of my life, and I play The Show almost every year. The Show 19 is the best baseball game on the last years, but maybe not the best of all time. New animations, defensive skills, physics... Everything is better than before. Maybe, one of the things that could improve in The Show is the Franchise Mode. Still far from Diamond, but it is a common evil in the last sports games.. The game itself is fine, but it had no improvements from the previous game, The Show 18 and added some annoying features. On my favorite mode RTTS, some small missions keep on appearing, even in the middle of the game. It stops before you get to bat or pitch and makes you select absurd accomplishments like, ""Hit a homerun in this at-bat"" It stops your game play and makes you keep thinking about that random mission. This ruins what I liked the most about The Show 18's game play, realness. Also errors are continuously happening on My Franchise mode, and although I think that is isn't a common issue, I blew up my save file that I worked on for 4 hours and totally quit this and went back to The Show 18. Most important of all, I can't see much of a difference in the game's graphics or mechanics and things just got **** Just go buy 18 instead. I don't play Diamond something, so you can consider that.. Not remotely close to being on par with EA Sports (FIFA/Madden/NHL). The 'Road to the Show' mode is not enjoyable in the least. Very, very repetitive with no backing story (or any voice overs). The UI/UX is quite bad as well. Have played for 12+ hours, and the flame of amusement has just burnt out. Seems pretty low-budget relative to it's sport counterparts. Will now buy again a game in this series again.. Absolutely love the show and I will always play every new season that comes in the future. There are some major bugs that annoy me in the gameplay that will be fixed with updates in the near future but again, great job guys!. This is the best baseball game I have ever played! The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are so realistic, the multiplayer is awsome, I just can't stop playing this, totally recommend this to baseball fans.. I love baseball and have been a gamer since pong and asteroids. I enjoyed 18 but 19 has so many flaws I am not having fun with it. Defense is so bad and not just bad fielders, Mays has issues on fly balls. Just had a new one to me and my final straw to write a bad review. Line drive to the wall, batter runs to second base but walks last 20' to second. Center fielder throws ball in and gets him out because he walked. Way too many line drives caught. For me that was it. Will try again in 20, maybe.. There has been no advancement in this game since I started playing in 2014. It has become lazy and an absolute grind with no real road map on how to build your player collection. Buying packs is ridiculous as the drop rate for anything worthwhile is roughly nil. Shame on the critics for rubber stamping reviews of this franchise. 86 Metascore at time of writing, meanwhile the player base has been loudly complaining about the lack of development and the atrocity that are moments. This is the last one I'm buying, because that is literally the only thing that will make San Diego Studios get off of their ass and actually spend some time developing this series.. Have played MLB The Show since it first came out in 2007. Always great graphics, fairly good animations (some still pretty hokey, as in this year's double play fielding animations at second base- a veritable hot-dog show of behind-the-back flips, etc, that you will never see in a real MLB game, etc), stale, repetitive announcing (again), outstanding editability for all players, gameplay sliders, and fairly complete rosters out of the box. but: the biggest problem with this game, again, since about 2007 in my opinion, is the amount of cpu scripting/control in any game you play vs: the cpu, where gameplay results are simply taken out of the human players hands for a period of time, and nothing you do with your baseball smart decisions, or how well you execute with your game controller, will affect the outcome of the gameplay. All sports videogames have this, and The Show 2019 still does too, and just enough to make it only worth 7/10, in my veteran Show gamer opinion.. The game is much improved this year and is actually playable. Yes, there is some tuning that must occur, but the structure or foundation is strong. Contact hitters aren't completely useless and there are many different hit outcomes compared to last year.. this game is getting worse every year, this year the only improve a few things, few gameplay fixes and dynasty diamond, franchise have been 3 years without adding a main feature, just small things, actually this year the franchise is worse cause they add real contract without touch the money engine so makes the budges go crazy, in gameplay the CPU still have some basic mistakes, plus CPU logic during game is a joke. this game used to be the best sports sim sport, right now has been pass by the awful madden 19 and an ok nba2k19, sport games developers are getting lazy they make ton of money every year with the game and microtransactions and the game quality is not worth the price rockstar release every 4 years and the game still cost 70$. San Diego studios continues to focus on on diamond dynasty to make even more money while laying waste to franchise mode. Their big improvements has season to franchise? 3 extra blades of grass, a side line reporter and stadium music. Not fixing the fact that you could have an MVP season with 50 homers, 160 RBI bat .330 while winning the gold glove and silver slugger yet having your player drop 20pts in every gatagory in the offseason because he isn't 28. Not fixing the fact that your team can win 100 games and the World Series yet every player drops 15pts overall in the offseason. That's where they need to focus all of their energy and efforts. Not on diamond dynasty to make millions of dollars more. Not on a stupid side line reporter or music. This series is trash. Just like Madden. All they care about is making millions upon millions of dollars AFTER release, not the actual crappy game play or how crappy franchise runs. Don't get the game. Wait 5 years... maybe they will get the hint.. Still remains the best baseball experience since EA's MVP Baseball series. It's hard to give any sports game much higher than an 8 to be honest. If you look at the trend it seems that every year they hold off on adding features to specific game modes every year only to do it the next year. That is the scam of the every year sporting game. This year Road to the Show has a ton of new features and then they added March to October, with franchise mode completely unchanged. Next year, franchise mode will get an overhaul and RTTS will be unchanged. It's just the way it goes with every sports game fix this leave that for next year to sell the new product. There isn't enough competition with-in the markets because they are dominated by the few. EA owns the NFL and NHL, 2K has NBA and Playstation has got the show. Anyways, i love RTTS so i was happy with the changes. It's legit an RPG for sports fans.. *Agree or not, I've probably played over 300+ online games each iteration of this series over the past 5 years, so more than likely I know more about this series than you* (also note im mostly reviewing the online). Ah.. the casualization of this series continues, year 2. You play a online game then expect a lot of bloop hits, a lot of hits with late timing, the nerfing of offspeed pitch to the ground, the increased ""rng"" of pitching now, I've never seen so many hangers and pitches down the middle in my life playing this game. You play against anyone who is half decent expect a 10-9 game. The outfielding play is weird this year also, they're stiff and the automated animations sometimes screw up, (a lazy fly and the of jogs and sticks his gloves up casually only to miss and have the ball roll all the way back for a triple). Literally the only online improvement they made was getting rid of the base running exploits and stuff. I don't like the way this series is going. Hey sony san diego! go back to when getting perfect timing=hits and line drives, ala mlb 17.. This game looks stunning, no doubt. But this game turns into a pay to win franchise. People with money can buy stubs and with these stubs they can buy packs and filling their DD team full of diamond players. Players with no money are in disadvantage. No chance to compete online against players who can afford money and building a strong team with all diamond players. This is totaly unfair. I love this game, but it looks like SDS only cares about money. They should make 2 modes online... One for the players buying stubs and one without. Here rest my case.. Much better than the last installment, but still lacking in many areas. Toning down the home runs, while a great thing, makes it impossible to hit. ShowTime has been taken away, and though it's kind of unrealistic, as a pitcher, there's no better feeling than perfectly hitting your spot. Overall, this game blows The Show 18 out of the water, but doesn't quite reach the heights of MLB 15 The Show.. They nailed it with this year's edition... all previous versions are utterly obsolete in comparison. New player animations makes defense look completely authentic. Errors now look like errors. They also found an excellent way to represent the true capabilities of the players defensive skills, adding in bad jumps for outfielders, as well as far more accurate physics off the walls. All of the worst online exploits are gone, thankfully. No more scoring a runner from second on a ground ball because an infielder couldn't get the throw off in time. No more quick turn-around from a dead run on a stolen base attempt, the runner slips every time. If the runner tries to get back to 1st after stopping mid-steal, they are cut down consistently as in the real game. Bunting has been revised, the physics remodeled, and the act itself made more difficult, as it is in the real game. The squeeze exploit is now gone. If you are good at controlling the running game using a combination of the slide step, pick off attempts and pitch outs, and you have a halfway decent catcher arm and accuracy, you can regularly cut down most players other than the very fastest, making the steal attempt the poor decision it actually is in most circumstances in the real game. Many online players will just run themselves right out of games as they attempt to steal far too often and with players who don't have the proper attributes. When that success rate is less than 73-74%, players are just giving away outs. Hitting is also much improved, as they have made the game more realistic and greatly reduced the players dependency on home runs to mash their way to wins. It doesn't work like that any more, as pitchers have been given a HR/9 stat which is the equalizer. Picking up the pitch out of the pitchers hand is also easier, as is the quickness in which you can differentiate between balls and strikes. All hitters, even the ones with poor attributes, are now legitimate threats at getting a hit in any given AB, as I felt the '18 game really made lesser players as well as contact hitters seem truly inept and didn't give them nearly enough hit power when putting the ball in play. This is a huge fix. I only use the Dynasty mode, not a fan of the Road to the Show mode. The new March to October mode seems alright, although I really don't care for the RTTS defensive moments. Conquest is still tedious and unnecessarily time consuming, having to burn a lot of time clearing hundreds of honeycombs. The only other thing I think the game should do is dynamically determine the appropriate skill level for every single player which is then applied to all challenges, all modes. Also not a fan of the pay-to-win set up, where anyone can easily buy their way to unlocking any 2 of 99 Mays, 99 Pudge or 99 Hornsby just by buying up all the players and then forfeiting the right to resell any of them. But, fortunately, the ranking system ensures that all those who build stacked teams will only play others with relatively equally stacked teams. But, all in all, this game is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Without a doubt the greatest baseball sim ever made, tremendous improvements to the game play make it undoubtedly the best version of the long-running Show series. If you are a fan of the series, ditch your 18 game and pony up the $60... you'll be very happy you did.. The game play is stellar with balanced pitching, and fair hitting with the pci, not to mention little to know bugs. Also, they added two great game-modes that will last the whole year. Lastly, road to the show got some great updates to improve longevity, and diamond dynaasty has great new updates to conquest.. I love this years edition. This is the first year where the career mode really feels like it has the RPG elements they have been aiming for. Diamond dynasty has all the online multi-player modes as before but has added some solo stuff as well if you just want a challenge or game. Haven't gotten into franchise mode yet but it was always the mode I played the least.. Gets a little (stress little) better every year: uniforms are better, gameplay is better, graphics in general are better. I love the franchise and video game baseball so that's good and enough for me to buy it every year. If you have The Show 18 it's probably not necessary to buy this unless you are a devoted VG baseball player.. While MLB the Show 19 is an overall great game -- the lack of innovation around two of the games 3 main modes leave users wishing they had more. I've been a long-time fan of the series and have always purchased a copy. That said the two modes I play the most are Road to the Show and Franchise. Franchise has had almost no upgrades at all -- only minorly tweaking how contracts work for players. RTTS received some minor upgrades, but they're far from great. They re-used literally all the dialogue from last year's game and merely added 'personality' traits assigned to the choices. Simply, it's incredibly boring to anyone who played RTTS 18 and I'm furious that reviewers have not cited them for this lazy choice. That said, the ways they refined gameplay has been nice and their small visual upgrades have been noticed. I'm super disappointed this year but I have hope the developers will figure out their way in the future.. The game is simply unplayable. If you have absolutely no priorities and want to spend hours on an individual moments challenge then this is the game for you. Its not enjoyable in the slightest.. I play the Show every year. If you have never played the Show And you love baseball, I suggest you play it and for first timers I would give this game a 9. But for people who are expecting a much improved game from last year, you are better off saving your 60 bucks and continue to play Show 18 because nothing besides a few camera angles has changed. The graphics look exactly the same. Its basically just a roster update.. Everything has improved in MLB The Show 19! In MLB The Show 18 power hitters were over-powered, and contact hitters were under-whelming. The developers finally got the balance right this year as contact hitters are highly effective in the game! Better fielding, hundreds of new animations, and some new game modes such as March To October are also nice additions to the series this year. If you love Major League Baseball I highly recommend MLB The Show 19!. The Show never disappoints. I consider the release date for the game a holiday every year. Absolutely a fantastic game.","this franchise has taken a HUGE step backwards from what '19 gave us; the content improved a bit but the gameplay is a giant dumpster fire from last year . at this point this franchise's devs have already moved on to '21 and they dgaf about this year . from the gameplay, to the countless bugs, to the garbage controls, this game is everything a baseball game shouldn’t be ."
999.Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2,"Ghost baby! GRAW 2 was so much fun back in the day. This series is one of my favorites next to Splinter Cell and Rainbow 6. Ghost Recon for the win.. G.R.A.W 2 is a smart game for all the right reasons. It makes you feel intelligent and it rewards you for playing well. The one thing I have to commend most is the feeling of simply playing it. It has an exceptional Gulf War feel, something that video games have yet to explore. Not only that but the HUD displays just enough information to make you feel like you are playing a tactical game without cluttering the screen. The presentation is well done, but what of the graphics. It's great while not really pushing the standards. Environments are bland but models and particle effects are noteworthy. The story is not much of the main focus, but if you have been following Tom Clancy for a while now, there are some throwbacks here. Other than that, expect the usual espionage tale. The campaign runs a good length of 7-8 hours but what I enjoyed most out of that was the gameplay. Your character is no super soldier, so you have to take a slower methodical pace. Utilizing your squad and drones to the fullest potential will ensure victory. Close quarter combat should never be an option though. There is a good layer of strategy and it is pretty easy to die if you do not play smart. One drawback would be the pacing. It doesn't do too much outside of the usual turret sequence so it doesn't feel too special. The multiplayer is great, but uninspired for the most part. Overall, I enjoyed G.R.A.W 2. It feels better to play than the original (though the controls take some time getting used to) and it delivers a better punch in presentation. It represents what good sequels should do, and I commend it for that.. Lovely graphics and immersive gameplay compensate for a somewhat ordinary story in ""Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2,"" yet another worthy addition to the Tom Clancy gaming empire.. After having Future soldier for some time I decided to play GRAW 2 again just to bring back past memories. The game has a great since of motion to it's controls for a game back in the day. AI lacks, but I bet it was the best it could do in it's day. But the game makes up for gameplay. As you get ambushed by enemies that make you think twice, loosing teammates makes for a good panic and change in firefights. This something you rarely see today.. Pretty good when you get used to it, but until then, it is torture trying to get going. The game is worth a few hours of enjoyment, but I would recommend getting it from the clearance bin if you can.. After purchasing GRFS and feeling hugely disappointed and well cheated out of my £40 I couldn't help but feel nostalgic about the countless hours, days and alas years my friends and I spent at the helm of the ghost recon franchise. The days when you could actually speak to most people playing and issue warnings of a looming sniper or vocalise strategy's, when a game actually felt realistic almost like you were there. I remember sprawling in the thick undergrowth actually raising my head for real, in a vane attempt to look over the grass. The game throughout the franchise had a real community spirit and with so many configurable options and a ridiculous amount of amazingly atmospheric diverse maps you were never far away from the next great online battle . You were also part of a team and you treated the maps strategically as such and that atmosphere and team spirit is what's missing from the modern shooters. Have you noticed how all the new breed of so called strategy shooters, advertise the fact you should play as a team ? But how many games do you jump into where people actually do? GRecon was the kind of game that didnt need to try and coax you into such. Well I played Graw 2 again the other day after selling GRFS and you know what? it still hasn't lost that original charm, after all those years it still feels fresh compared to all the modern shooters, GRFS included. The community might be a lot smaller but you can generally always find a a decent game where people still talk and have a laugh with one another. After playing this again, I realised that GRFS would have been far more successful, just updating on the previous formula. Instead what we got was a game selling its soul and providing us with yet another COD clone, albeit a 3rd person view and a Gears of war cover system tagged on. What a shame!!. I never played the first Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1 and now I really want to. This game has a very good campaign, good multiplayer , fun Co op campaign and it's better then most of games now a days. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 8.4/10. With all the fun I am having with the fantastic Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, I decided to revisit GRAW2 and it's still that great game, with great graphics and tons of content (including two FREE map packs with 7 maps in each pack) that I remember. It almost seems like this game is underrated, even, with all the cool stuff you can do with it. The campaign is awesome, the co-op, the MP, it's all so great that, to me, this is one of the best shooters to ever grace the Xbox 360. That's high praise, but it's just that good.. I'm just going to start off by saying this is more of an expansion to the original warfighter game. Graphics still stand up and the game is alot of fun to play. Every aspect of the game is identical to graw. It seems like more effort could have been put into this sequel.","presentation is well done, but what of the graphics . pacing doesn't do too much outside of the usual turret sequence so it doesn't feel special . multiplayer is great, but uninspired for the most part ."
