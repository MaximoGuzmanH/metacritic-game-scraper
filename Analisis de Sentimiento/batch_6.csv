2.SoulCalibur,"This is probably the best fighting game I've played except for maybe smash ultimate. All of the controls are fluid and there is a good cast of fighters to choose from. The first time i played i beat the arcade mode then immediately played 70+ rounds in vs mode with a freind until he had to leave. Highly recommend this game to anybody with a dreamcast.. Good on it for starting a classic fighting game but the 99/100 scores are ridiculous.. The fighting holds up and is super fun. i love the music and artwork and level of detail in the background of each map plus the fluent controls. LOVE ROUNDHOUSE KICKING THEM IN THE FACE *POW* not a must play but if you love fighting game definitely check it out.. 6tergrthgrt. This game was a head of it's Time. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Easily the best fighting game available at the time, Soulcalibur was one of the biggest selling points for Sega's ultimately doomed console. It still looks great today and was surpassed only by its own sequel Soulcalibur II on the Xbox and PS2.. This game was the peak of fighting games back then this game is amazing like its console it is just amazing both aesthetically both game wise, bc i was a ps1 owner and the internet didn't existed back then i was playing tekken 3 and street figther 2 in arcades (top 3 fighting games with soulcalibur) a friend of mine had bought a dreamcast and the only games he had was soulcalibur and sonic adventure which was single player and we had to play soulcalibur, i remember staying with him all night playing this game, a true experience and it still in 2023 it is amazing. Didn't understand the mechanics but I still found it a great game to play I played this on DC emulator. Aha. According to the Metacritic ranking, Soul Calibur is the best fighting game of all time. First of all, this should show the low degree to which lists created with spongy ""indices"" serve as a criterion for judging the quality of computers or video games. Secondly, Soul Calibur is of course not a bad game, but in single player terms - like almost all DC beat em ups - it is completely irrelevant and boring after 2 hours. The sequels do a much better job of balancing the strengths and weaknesses of the characters. Don't be blinded by the ranking!. Me and my brother had a Dreamcast and Soul Calibur and this really really was special. I can understand the reviews as it was something unique and amazing learning these characters and the arenas at the time. The gimmick here was it was a fighting game with weapons. I used Seung Mina a pretty girl with halberd spear that excelled at range. By completing her story I unlocked a lot of her art and she definitely became ‘my’ character in the way people like Ryu of street fighter etc. I remember slick presentation, music, graphics, gameplay was state of the art. Hair would blow in the wind, voices were good, thematically was great etc. However over time and with subsequent entries and competition and things it’s not the same now. Unlike games like Mario and Zelda which are somewhat timeless, fighting games really evolved from this point. There’s no world where you should pick this up ahead of something else in 2022 unless you’re looking at history of fighting games or getting a Dreamcast for nostalgia purposes. But that first game on that console in that time, it was something special like I say. Hard to score on that basis, went with a 9 as that’s what it was when I played it, a 9 or a 10 even.. As a fighting game it's really good, but not for me. Just not enough meat on the bones.. Spanish: Juego bastante adelantado a su época con una gran fluidez en el combate. 9.7/100 English: Game well ahead of its time with great fluency in combat. 97/100. This was a great game, I really enjoyed it. I hope they come up with a sequel. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ASTAROTH IS THE KING. Nothing else to say. One the best fighting game ever made.. This game was amazing, but it was really only a sign of things to come. Technically, this game is a marvel, and is a must-play for anyone interested in the history of fighting games.. This the Best Fighting game ever To date. They will never be a well balance fighter game. This game deserve the no. Fighter spot..Also it right where its supposed to be in the top 10. Sega Dreamaast was an awesome system.. The Dreamcast port of ""Soul Calibur"" is arcade perfect and one of best fighting games of all time. Graphically, it is truly amazing. The animation is fluid and the framerate never slows. SC II features a great selection of fighters, smooth controls, top notch sound effects and amazing music. It's easily a 10 out of 10.. [Originally Written in 2017] After playing tons of games i have finally gotten around to playing the 2nd highest rated game of all time SoulCalibur, i thought to myself it couldn't possibly live up to the hype surrounding it, especially since it game out nearly 2 decades ago but i was wrong. Gameplay Have you ever had a feeling when you're playing a game and the controller almost becomes an extension of your hand? Soul Calibur did that for me. You have three main buttons: Horizontal attack, Vertical attack, and kick. There is also a button for guarding and a pseudo powerup known as a ''Soul Charge'' Obviously, depending on the combination of buttons you press, you will perform certain things-that is the basis of fighting games. What sets Soul Calibur apart is that everything just seems to flow unlike any other fighting game before it. With the 8-Way Run feature (a feature in which you can move around the ring in 8 different directions) the fluidity is unmatched, as no game has been able to duplicate the smoothness of the 8-Way Run. The lack of mobility has always been a complaint of mine since I became a fighting game fan, but Soul Calibur changes all of that. Once you've learned the control basics-it's time to get into the game modes. The mode you will spend the most time is most likely Mission Mode-in which you go along playing different missions earning points in order to buy Art. The art you purchase will lead to the unlocking of most of the games extras-and there are quite a few extras to unlock. Mission mode will take most gamers a few hours to complete, and while it gets difficult in some missions-it is not impossible to beat. Of course, there are the normal modes as well. Arcade mode-this is the mode that simulates the arcade experience, and it is also the medium that you will use to unlock the extra characters. Survival, time attack, and team battle are also included. Versus mode will keep you busy as well, especially if you have rivalries with friends. You can sit down and play 50 matches, and not even think twice about it-it is extremely fun to play. Our good friends at Namco have also deemed to have a ''Museum'' section of the game. Now contained within this museum section is something never done in a fighting game before-and that is exhibition mode. Now exhibition mode allows you to watch each character do a demonstration with their weapon, and it is a sight to behold. Another unlockable feature is the ability to edit the opening movie of the game-and yes you can get some hilarious combinations. Graphics The graphics are flawless in this game. It plays smooth, and it looks smooth. I have encountered no slow down at all, and the load times are very good as well. Even after playing Persona 5 on the PS4 for a while I went back to Soul Calibur and I did not really notice much of a difference. For being a launch title, Soul Calibur set the graphical bar extremely high. Each arena is wonderfully detailed and each has a unique feel to them. The characters are just amazing. When performing moves, clipping is non-existent, and the wardrobes of the characters move with the environment. If it is windy, your character's hair will blow in the wind-it is that detailed. Sound The Soul Calibur series contains some of my favorite game music, and for good reason. Soul Calibur contains a very well orchestrated soundtrack-almost epic in magnitude, and it really makes you feel like you are at war with your opponent. The sound effects are awesome as well. Each ding and clang of the weapons can be heard, and you can almost feel a hit when a certain move is performed and you hear that snap or crunch of the unlucky character getting broken. The voices (in Japanese) are extremely amazing as well. Basically, this is how every fighting game should sound. Replay Value Let's see...I've logged in over 40 hours into this game just this Week alone, and I am still not tired of it, I guess that speaks for itself. But in all actuality, this game will keep you busy for a very long time. It is very easy to pick up and learn the basics, but to get very good and to the point of mastery takes a very long time, and depending on the character or characters you chose to play as, it may take a very long time (i.e. Ivy, Cervantes). With all of the extras to unlock, the massive mission mode, and setting records on the other game modes-this is the epitome of replayability. This game is a 10/10 in every meaning of the word, simply perfection, i am now deeming this game the standard by which all other fighting games should be measured. I urge all of you play this **** masterpiece. ""Transcending history, in a world, a tale of souls and swords eternally retold"" THE best Dreamcast game ever. This was the defining weapon based fighting game which gathered a massive following and is still played to this day. I love the graphics. They are so beautiful. They are a huge improvement over the arcade version. I love the soundtrack and the series would continue to have fantastic soundtracks. The gameplay is why the game is so beloved and immersive in the fighting game genre. I love the Soul Charge and Guard Impact mechanics. The characters are amazing. They have so much depth, likability and would continue to get even better as the series continued. The stage design is amazing. The game is notable for its story, lore and its great. It was stupendous. There is so much to unlock from Weapon Master mode which gave the game so much replay ability. This game is a must have.. This game is very beatifull,nice graphics,nice characters and best game from dreamcast. This sequel to Soul Blade improves upon it's game-play and easily the best graphics for a fighting game. With smooth looking character models, beautiful backgrounds, impressive stages plus the fluid animations made the game semi-realistic. Voice acting is brief but gives the characters a little bit of personality while talking to the opponent before and after the fight. But it ends up repetitive like many fighting games still do today shockingly. The actual sound effects of blades clashing, jumping, hitting and the screams are very well done. The game-play is both fast and strategic thanks to the, ""eight way run"" feature. Dodging, guard, impact guard, or just avoiding the enemy to hit you is very cool and necessary for a fighting game. The game consist of attacking your opponent for a knockout or ring out. The content is great especially back in the day with various modes like time attack, versus, team battle, arcade, mission, and even more. I do notice that the game might be too easy even in harder difficulty but the mission mode is excellent in this regard while the story is told on a second person perspective with the many always saying, ""You"" almost all the time. In the arcade mode is in third person because is all about each fighter but sadly barely an intro unless you look at the manual of course but the endings don't reflect what truly happen. Overall is not the best story nor the best difficulty and yet is still an amazing game.. Awesome game! Many characters with different weapons. I had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends when I was a kid. Great graphics too! DreamCast was great at that time!. Soulcalibur represents hours of fun, alone or with friends. The gameplay is extremely fun, the graphics still look good today, and the controls work very well. This is my favourite game on the dreamcast.. The dreamcast had so many amazing fighting games, but the arcade port of Soulcalibur, is definitely the best. You fight in an arena (unlike Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat) and the characters are great. if you have a dreamcast and haven't tried this game, you are missing out.. SoulCalibur is no doubt, one of the best fighting games i ever played, if not the best. Fresh gameplay, awesome sense of movement and a perfect cast of characters, this game deserves all what it has.. Without a doubt one of the best fighting games on the Sega Dreamcast. Don't miss this game if you still have your Dreamcast with you because this game is unmissable for everyone who has a Sega Dreamcast.. SoulCalibur isn't only a pretty important mark for the gaming industry, but a masterpiece fighting game, with unbelievable physics for the time, nice and challenging combos and great weapons, as well as a superb story for a fighting game, SoulCalibur is an 11/10 game.. Quite simply the best fighting game ever made. Extremely well-balanced, fast-paced with great visuals and a diverse range of characters. Addictive gameplay.. Although the series took a little dive in recent releases, we all know how great it made it's stay. The graphics at the time we're amazing, the gameplay is better then some games today, and this is the golden era of fighting games, along with Battle Arena Toshinden, which is an underrated rival.. Absolutely perfect. Outstanding graphics, addictive gameplay, awesome rewards, magnificent storylines. This game is the true standard of a masterpiece. Period.. It is one of my favorite fighting games of all time. Who doesn't love this game? It had incredible graphics back in 1999. you gotta love the fluidity moves and attacks of each character. the mission is battle is awesome that you can play various minigames like tournaments, fighting lizard men, training with edgemaster, poison modes, etc. the soundtrack makes this game more epic and has great atmosphere. this game is never wounded and its soul never burns in my book.. The best fighting game on the DC and one of the best fighting games to date. Pros: It practically invented 3-D fighting movement in fighting games; stunning graphics; lovable characters; striking combos. Cons: Easy; annoying soundtrack.. This fighting game is a treat: beautiful graphics, unique characters, and several modes. However, the majority of the playable characters are clones of other fighters on the roster, and SoulCalibur features some of the most impossible-to-execute combos ever made.. The first real 3-D fighting game -- Soulcalibur is one of the most valuable titles on the DC. Pros: Beautiful graphics; great audio; variety of characters, weapons, and level designs; near-perfect controls. Cons: It's on the Dreamcast, one of the most forgotten video game consoles.. This has to be one of the best fighting games of all times. At least in the top 5, easily. It was the main reason I got myself a Dreamcast, even though I was ""waiting"" for the PS2. Great game that you can never forget.","soulcalibur was one of the biggest selling points for Sega's ultimately doomed console . it was surpassed only by its own sequel Soulcalibur II on the Xbox and PS2 . according to the Metacritic ranking, Soul Calibur is the best fighting game of all time ."
20.Resident Evil 4 (2005),"its just perfect best game just buy This game this game its for sigma and giga chad. A GameCube masterpiece. It's been ported to almost every console since and inspired many imitators. The game is scary, intense and goofy. It's survival horror that also happens to be a challenging action game. A must play not just for both fans and non-fans. Overall, this is a 10 out of 10.. Wow, yeah baby! It was perfect, PERFECT! Everything down to the last minute details!. resident evil 4 is one of those games you can't forget. it is very well done has very good gameplay and keep in mind it was release in 2005 which now has many ports from the gamecube to the oculus(vr) you can tell by the ports that it is a masterpiece the story,the gunplay,the charecters EVERYTHING in this game was handle with care. it maybe be scary but its worthy you give the game a try even if you aren't into horror game.. ""Story of my life."" Even though the remake is even better, this one created or at the very least reinvented a whole genre. Each and every one of us gamers should put their hands on that game sooner or later.. I've bought this game in almost every console I've had, I play it at least once a year, I know the lines, the paths, the secrets, all of it. This is the most replayable game in my eyes, The best resident evil ever made, the best ""horror"" game ever made, the best ""action"" game ever made. If i had to choose only one game to play for the rest of my life it'll be this one with not a doubt on my mind. The true goat, VIVA LAS PLAGAS. 10/10. Childhood classic grew up playing Resident Evil 4 love every second of this game. One of the best games I've ever played, Its ambient and camera angles are incredible, this game is a masterpiece and a must play in any of its multiple versions.. It's the best Resident Evil game ever made, period. Everything a horror survival game should be.. One of the best games of all time. Even though it was released all the way back in 2005 the gameplay still holds up. It's stiff, sure, you control the movements with tank controls but it works. It never feels like it gets in the way. The world is incredible, the atmosphere is amazing, the gameplay is peak, the humour is fantastic and doesn't get in the way of the atmosphere and the story is very servicable. The one negative is that you have to protect the president's daughter (who is the one you're trying to save in the story) which isn't difficult but she yells a lot which can be annoying, but it's not enough to lessen the feel for the game. Best Resident Evil and one of the best games ever made.. Special agent Leon Kennedy is sent on a mission to rescue the US president's daughter that was kidnapped by a religious **** game takes a campy approach compared to the previous games in the series and that is for the **** abandons most of it's franchise's storyline about viruses created by evil corporations that are evil just for the sake of being evil and turn people into zombies and instead focuses on it's biggest strength which is the protagonist, Leon.Every one liner thrown at or by him is chuckle worthy.Makes you question if Leon is a big fan of 80's comedies.There is a little ugly evil guy that resembles Napoleon and the interactions between him and Leon are **** game does great to keep up it's attitude and identity by having the villains video call Leon and exchange threats with him.This is a game about a special agent that does backflips out of windows even though he doesn't have **** is filled to the brim with style, charm and character that make this one of the greatest games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has annoying dialogs bad voice acting. And its really bad because you can kick people which ruins the combat and you have a rocket launcher. Then you have castles like its a fairly medieval game like seriously this game was not scary and could not be taken seriously weak bosses that dies instantly if you use rocket launcher.. I did not play this version of the game, but since I know the game is perfect, because I played the remastered, this review can count, right?. For me, this is the example of a perfect mix between story and an arcade game. Of course, you want to see where the story goes and it is well written, but kind of a cliche. But what really shines is the replayability. I must have finished this game more times than any other game. The likable characters, storyline, combat, memorable bosses. Everything is great.. I played the meta quest version of this and it was peak gaming. Re4 is easily the best of the action shooters in the franchise. 9/10. Definetely a Must-Play on the GameCube. Astonishing graphics for the time, revolutionery gameplay, a catchy story line.... The best resident evil game I've played in my life so far, thank you so much Shinji Mikami for making this masterpiece.. A nostalgic memory for og gamers. It is a pure game. It has zero flaws considering it's time. This game was just amazing and I really got into it. Every single boss is fun and the game itself was just way ahead of its time. 95%. I love this game, my favorite game ever. The gameplay is amazing, the enemies are excellent.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best horror game ever made need I say anymore about this great game it is a masterpiece. Resident evil 4 is the most influential action horror title in the gaming industry by cementing a camera style that would be utilized for generations to come. What Resident evil 4 gets right is the design and pacing of the games shooting mechanics and the creative, unique combat encounters. Due to the game's excellent dynamic difficulty and the gunplay feeling panicky and desperate Re4 always manages to maintain tension during every combat sequence.. Resident Evil 4: A Genre-Defining Masterpiece. Resident Evil 4, released in 2005, stands as a crowning achievement not only for the Resident Evil series but for the entire gaming industry. With its revolutionary gameplay mechanics, gripping narrative, and technical prowess, Resident Evil 4 earns its place as one of the best games ever created.. This is where it all went wrong, at least for true original Resident Evil 'survival horror' fans. This game was responsible for spawning; not just the complete abolishment of a unique and innovative gameplay genre of survival horror with fixed camera angles, not just the dire dull and uninspired comedic 'horror' shooter on rails - RE5 and the clown show known as Resident Evil 6, but what we have now with the complete over-saturation of Over-The-Shoulder 3rd person view shooty shooty ‘hey why's that camera so far up my butt’ games. It worked with Dead Space, wonderful game, and DS 2. But even Dead Space couldn't avoid the shallow carrot on a stick chase the popular action money route but crap on any horror aspect we originally had that made our IP so great in the first place with DS3. Gears of War also managed to not only take from RE4 and improve it, but innovate and master the cover shooting gameplay mechanic that has yet to be beaten. Now is RE4 the worst game all time? No (that honour belongs to E.T on the Atari). It’s not a terrible game, it does have its charms, and yes, it was innovative with its use of 3rd person OTS view for its time, but those controls... ugh, tank controls do not translate to OTS shooter style games when you are surrounded by a plethora of wannabe pretend zombies. It's charms lie in the weapon upgrade system, the carry case inventory system, the shooting range tasks (not the main game itself... which lets face it, is basically a giant shooting range on rails), and the treasure hunting and monetary rewards with the ridiculously delightful ""WHADDYA BOUYIN'!?!?!?... WHADDYA SELLIN'????"" Merchant. These were like mini-games within the main game and really helped dissolve the monotony of shooty shooty run shooty shooty again for another 6 hours, to imo make this game sustainably playable.. But, in terms of longevity and legacy, they don't redeem this game. The monotony pervades every revamped play-through, and it gets frustrating, tiresome and boring very quickly, that not even a fully pimped out Beerstein Jug adorned with cats eye gems, and a chirpy mock cockney, ""Ahhhhhhh, I'll buy it at a high price!"" can subdue the dismal overall gameplay, nor the schlock drab awful tones of brown and grey that pervade every single environmental background cheaply programmed in a seeming rush to get RE4 finished, nor can those charms save this game from its shallow use of QTE’s in an attempt to make cutscenes and terrain traversals ‘exciting’, more like eye-rolling annoyances. This game does not deserve the high status hyperbolic praise it receives from many easy-to-please action oriented gamers. Truly overrated.. While the humor is awesome and missing in the remake. The controls limited by the Gamecube system does not age well and the other other good port is the Wii. Overrated imo. Overrated trash and ruins the saga, fails as horror game, fails as action game, because you can kick the enemies and can buy the rocket Launcher. Also, Ashley is a useless. I Will like this game never exist. Bang, bang, bang. Yep, this game is incredibly fun. The goofy dialogue, scary enemies, and great soundtrack make this a really excellent and good time.. Of course full evaluation. We're talking about one of the masterpieces of video games. Made by the GOD OF GAMES. One of the best games of its generation and one of the most influential games of all time, Resident Evil 4 is the blueprint for how to properly reinvent a classic franchise that is beginning to go through the motions. RE4 features some of the most thrilling and intense enemy encounters and set pieces in the franchise, and its wonderfully campy tone adds some much needed levity to the overall package.. Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 World: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall 10/10. I'm a Resident Evil fan, I played and loved the remakes of Resident Evil that Capcom recently released. I'm especially a big fan of Resident Evil 2 Remake. When Resident Evil 4's remake was announced, I was very happy. I had played a little bit of Resident Evil 4 and thought it being remade would be great, but when the remake actually came out, it was too expensive for me to buy so I decided to play the original which I already owned. I played it on my PS4 and really enjoyed it! First of all, Resident Evil 4 differs from the previous entries in that it goes into a more action focused direction. This is a very risky thing to do for long-running game franchises but Resident Evil 4 still manages to be creepy. The horror of Resident Evil 4 comes from it's action oriented gameplay. Enemies take a pretty long time to kill with early weapons and ammo for better weapons are rare. Being in moments when you have to think outside the box to survive a tough encounter is thrilling and scary. The weapons of the game are very fun to use. Throughout the game, you upgrade and get better versions of weapons which provides that satisfying feeling of progress. The enemies are also very well designed. When you start the game, the first enemies you encounter are pretty tough but aren't too hard to deal with, but they can easily overwhelm you with their numbers if you aren't careful. Enemies get harder and harder as the game progresses, with some enemies having special phases you have to deal with. This adds both variety and challenge to the game which makes playing through it a satisfying experience. The story feels like it exists to drive the gameplay along and I'm totally fine with that for this game. I think it works well as a thing you keep in the back of your mind while you play through the game. The settings you move through in the story are very pleasing to look at. I always felt like exploring around to find any valuables or supplies. There are documents you can read to get an idea of what's going on but they're not as engaging as the previous games which featured interesting little stories and expanded upon the lore. The characters are very humorous in my opinion. I love them to bits. I love how silly they are. I enjoyed every character interaction, which isn't common. Overall, Resident Evil 4 is a great game and definitely deserved the remake but the original still holds up to this day, even after the remake's release.. RE4.. A good brainless shooter, which gave me a lot of fun when it was released. I had absolutely nothing to do with the former titles of the franchise, so i was very annoyed by it for a while. But, at some point, i just forced myself to forget about its name and played it by what it actually is: a good brainless shooter.. The game was totally magnificent I played it 13 times !!! The event was extremely fast at what happened in it The game play was really good the mechanics of it Is really nice like when you aim you can't move is perfect the merchant and bag that you put the guns in it is one of the things that you're gonna spend time on in a positive way. Hard for me to review this and say its a masterpiece compared to 2 or Remake, but i believe because of its influence and over the shoulder third person setting i think it would be a great game, not a masterpiece, but a great game.. Redefined 3rd person shooters, focused on action but still with a creepy atmosphere. Super fun to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible game that revitalized the genre and series. Got a GameCube for my 3th birthday specifically for this game.. 9.8/10. Resident Evil 4 is pretty much as good as gaming gets. It is the pinnacle of action-horror. It was an absolute revolution for 3rd person shooters, action games and gaming in general. The gameplay is near perfect. The controls are excellent because the whole game is designed around them. The over the shoulder camera keeps the action at the perfect distance. The weapons using laser sights and having so much punch to them. Fast, accurate aiming with just enough weapon sway, inaccuracy and enemy threat to keep you on your toes and trying to hit your shots. The way enemies consistently react to getting shot and the incredibly satisfying head shots. Following up with a kick or suplex. The game just constantly rewards you for playing well. Taking on enemies with just a knife whether it's for fun or to save ammo or to slash projectiles out the air. Watching enemies fall off edges after being shot. Pushing the ladders while enemies try to climb it. Shooting through doors. kicking doors open to damage enemies on the other side. Getting enemies to group together and throwing an incendiary grenade into them. Leaping out windows. The set pieces and bosses. Crowd control. Repositioning when needed and not knowing exactly what's behind you while doing so. Using the environment to your advantage. Getting your head taken off in one horrific hit. The enemy variety. The weapon variety. They somehow made you not hate escorting another character. The list goes on and on and god damn it's all so good. The pacing is so well done as well with the game constantly throwing cool new things at you but also knowing when to slow things down a bit. The developers didn't even stop after creating a brilliant, lengthy, highly re-playable main story, they went and did more. The Mercenaries mode is really addictive. Then there's Assignment Ada and unlockables too. The story, characters, dialogue and cut scenes are ridiculously entertaining and well directed. It's so goofy and fun. God damn it's all so fun, remember FUN. It's like the only questions asked when making this game were - Is it fun? Is it entertaining? Does it play well? Does it fit in? If Yes then put it in the game. It's like they had no fear of risks and were just totally confident in what they were making, which is surprising if you know the story of this games development. The tone and atmosphere is handled perfectly. Seriously how did they do this. The game can be silly and/or over the top one minute and then have no problem being more serious the next. It also can be genuinely creepy at times. Or surreal or bleak. It definitely delivers on the body horror and gore too. The game looks and sounds top notch as well. It was one of the best looking games available when it came out. The art direction is fantastic. The village is cold, bleak, isolated and hostile with something gruesome around every turn. The castle is surreal, sinister and uncomfortable. It's so opulent and ornate but something is very off about it and there are traps everywhere. It kind of reminds me of the mansion from the RE 1 remake. The Island is grimy, dirty and industrial and does have some great creepy sections but it's visually more generic and forgettable unfortunately. They nailed the character and enemy designs too. The voice acting is exactly what was needed. The enemies sound harsh and scary. The guns hit hard and all the gross noises are spot on. The soundtrack is superb and so are the ambient sounds. However no game is perfect and Resident Evil 4 is no exception. The worst thing about this game is that it wasn't survival horror and it put an end to Resident Evil being a survival horror franchise as they went down the action-horror path from here on wards. The puzzles are also not the best but I guess really good puzzles would have bogged down this games action focus and pace. The Island is also not as good as the first two locations. I think this is mostly due to the first two areas setting such a high bar, the industrial setting feeling more generic and maybe being a little too action heavy at times. Looking back at the game now I think it did overuse the quick time events as well. As cool and well done as they are it gets a bit much, especially when your on like the 20th play through. If you have never played it before do yourself a favour and play it now. I highly, highly recommend Resident Evil 4. I still remember buying my collector's just after launch, which is still on my shelf, and playing it all day. Then I bought the Wii version and played it to death again. Then the PS3 and then the PS4. I think I am going to be playing this once every five years or so until I die. Some people try to dismiss this game's high praise with statements like ""It's just nostalgia"" or ""You just think old good, new bad."" But they are wrong Resident Evil 4 really is just that good. This is what lightning in a bottle looks like. 9.8/10. Amazing game, didn't even like Resident Evil until i played this game. So glad i gave this a chance. Where should I even begin? This game is just pure fun from start to finish. My rating for RE4 OG is 9.5. Resident evil 4 understand what kind of game it wants to be and that's to be the most entertaining game it could possibly hoped for. Everyone knows this game. Although RE4's scary days are far behind us, its replay value still holds up incredibly well today.. An influential masterpiece. In 2005, this was a revolutionary entry in the series. It was survival horror redefined as an action game. Nothing like previous entries, it was RE for a new generation. Only RE 7 was as radical in terms of change in game design. It's still a great game on the GameCube. I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. The last legendary RE game. The series went downhill afterwards. The fact that this game is vastly superior to the RE 4 Remake is a testament to its sheer perfection. Stunning visuals, campy and fun plot, awesome characters, epic music, and incredible gameplay. The powerful weapons, the awesome gore effects, the brutal roundhouse kicks and bone crunching suplexes. The extra modes. I have beaten this game 12 times and unlocked every bonus weapon. I am currently forcing myself to beat the Remake because I spent over $100 on it. Stick to the original.. Really a great game for it's time, but not really a great Resident Evil game. What a fun game it's just fun Leon is just cool the bosses are fun the zombies are inteligent and threatning its spooky but also incredibly funny and gameplay is one of the best action games ever very influential a great game overral. Best GameCube game ever released! Arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Easy 10/10. The GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Greatest game of all time, bar none. So many people like to riff on this game because its more of a tactical 3rd person shooter than a survival horror game but I think that's what makes it better than the other Resident Evil games, it doesn't need to follow the conventions of past games because its just that good. The combat is by far the biggest improvement the RE series has ever seen. No longer do you just sit in a corner and fire away, you can target individual body parts for different reactions like kneecapping in order to stun for a roundhouse kick or an extremely satisfying suplex. Because of these mechanics the weapons are not only satisfying to use but they are also multitools in function as you can use them to shoot locks, deflect enemy projectiles, and hit stun to escape being surrounded. The sound design in particular is phenomenal, the weapon and reload sound effects are the best in the entire series for how punchy they sound. There is also a very clear effort put into making every enemy attack and movement obvious to the player, you will always hear an enemy before you see them so nothing feels like its cheap or catches you off guard even in the games most intense moments. The replay value is insane even without seperate ways RE4 still has a very replayable campaign thanks in part to its new game plus mode which lets you carry over weapons of a past playthrough and its addicting upgrade/currency system. Over the course of the game you collect treasures and sell them to purchase weapon and storage upgrades which can all be converted to the in game currency, its a very addicting way of handling an in game shop and I'm surprised more games don't do it this way. And then there's mercenaries, the time based survival mode where you can unlock other characters from past resi games. The other characters are incredibly fun to play as, especially agent hunk who can neck snap any stunned enemy, its something you really need to play to understand how cool this is. Bottom line RE4 is an amazingly fun experience that only gets better the more you play and understand the depth of its mechanics and level design. Its truly one of the most awe inspiring video games, grand in spectacle, doesn't take itself seriously and is better for it, prioritizes gameplay above all else. One the greats. Also anyone who dislikes this game needs to have their testicles surgically removed.. Legendary game, and best ever game in my life, i love it so crazy game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever made. That's it, that's the review, I dont know what else I can add to the game's reputation at this point.. This game is so cool. The plot is good enough, and fits into the Resident Evil line. The only disadvantage for me is its inconvenient aiming. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. completed this game on dolphin emulator and i can say looks good on nintendo gamecube(i say about graphic). It developed ideas that we have not seen in any other game and won several awards and took the game of the year and one of the best games in history, but it lost the most important element, which is the horror that was not focused on and this indicates that it lost its basic identity, but it is beautiful, but it does not represent Resident Evil.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has aged better than any other classic game I've played. The gameplay is still perfect.. Perfect game. Some of the most fun I've had while playing a video game. One of the best games ever created.. This was the point of the franchises downfall. resident evil 4 is the second worst game of the franchise, followed by 8.. this game will ruin other games for you, replayed it almost 10 times, I will still do it again capcom struck gold with this one knocked out of the planet this game earns the legendary status. Best Resident Evil game ever. Best Resident Evil 4 Version Ever! Must play the game because it is the best. I can't explain exactly what makes this game so, so special. It has great everything, some of the best voice acting I've ever heard, the most satisfying gameplay I've seen in years, a great story, amazing characters, good controls once you get used to them. Not nearly as scary as I thought it would be, but this isn't a horror - action game, this is an action/adventure game. Insanely good postgame for no extra cost. Good graphics even today (tbf, I'm playing the HD version). I still can't put my finger on what makes this game so special, but it truly is. The second best game of the 2000s imo.. a good game with story plot a bit violent with chainsaws and i played this game on pc not gamecube , its shows good render and visual areas , progess for resident evil 4 is harder than most other games. If the first third of the game would be the whole game, I would rate it 10 out of 10. In the first third this game makes all right what it can do make right at all and this in a perfect way for that time. However the price is, that this game lost its momentum that longer it gets. The atmosphere is the best at the beginning and suffers the most over the playtime. The castle, second third of the game, is more a tribute for the first resident evil and this disturbs the modern resident evil in its room to develope an own unique atmosphere here. The last third is my least favourite and only the fight against the Los Regenerados create the unique and special atmosphere that have filled the beginning of the game. The other parts on the millitary island are plaining action parts. The El Gigante, a huge big and intense fight at first is later simply overused and annoying. The last boss is ridiculous designed and weak in comparison with Krauser or the fight against ""It"". The variety of Weapons and the diffrent ways how you can play this game, give it a high replay value. Furthermore the objects you can interact with and use for your advantage give the gameplay the finishing touch. Ashley is a specail case here. Yes it is true that she is not so horrible as other reviewers say. But it is undoubtatly so, that the game would be better, if Ashley wasn't part of the gameplay. All in all could this a masterpiece be if the game would not run out of breath at the end.. Good game but possibly not my cup of tea The gameplay is excellent and more action oriented which is a drawback IMO. RE should not be an action **** they managed to pull it off in a balanced way, so I can applaud their honest effort. However, the story was really weak... I found myself enjoying the atmosphere and the creepiness and the oldschool gaming vibe.. Historically this is a 10 / 10. I think it must have blown everyones minds back then. Today its still very good. The latter half of the game is weaker and the puzzles are kinda weak for RE. Otherwise very solid. Play it on an emulator and scale it up. Looks pretty good.. It’s not debatable, it’s the best Resident Evil of the saga. It could also be considered among the best games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This started a new direction for Resident Evil. One of the best Gamecube games. First and foremost, it's enormously fun to play so in this regard alone it's merited to be considered one of the best. Add to that a 10/10 presentation and meticulous attention to detail, great action and (campy) storytelling, a lengthy campaign and you've got a winner on your hand. This is the crown Jewel of the Capcom 5 (which turned out to be 4 later on). It's not really scary though, which might be a minus for some hardcore RE fans.. bby far the best re game i ve replayed it 2 times and it s reaaaaaallllyy good. My favourite resident evil game and one of my favourite games in general, every part of this game is just iconic. Best game ever made Best action game ever made Best resident evil game ever made Best of the best. It's fun its action-packed it's scary its everything you'd want in a game like this. Zombies and zombies... And zombies again. This is not interesting at least for me.. Complete with a scary atmosphere, disturbing enemies, a memorable story, and unforgettable characters, Resident Evil 4 sparks a revolution that no other game has ever done, even to this day!. Resident Evil 4 combined the survival horror of the previous games with new and exciting action to make a unique and endlessly fun game that completely changed the franchise.. RE4 has changed the gaming landscape forever. It was a such a blast to go through. I finished this game so many times than I can count. I love the change it brought to the series even tho it's a departure from the much beloved RE formula. But it was a revolution that was bigger than the RE franchise itself and I appreciate it for it. Shinji Mikami rules!. After playing this game in this time I get what are we missing Love in making games Not in term of money This game has what it takes to be one of the best game of all time I dont get why some people hates the game Is it because of The action in it ? No tank controls? No zombies? I get the point that the series was going reaaally down after tgis game But can you imagine if the game was yet another fixed camera with fixed camera and tank controls? This takes ten from me And im gonna tell you Ther will be no game like RE4 Everr. Everything involving the gameplay is outstanding and timeless. However some might think the inventory pause breaks immersions but I don’t think it does. In DOOM Eternal with its break neck speed; slows down time when the weapon wheel is open. This let’s you think over whatever situation your in. The only Flaw with Resident Evil 4 is that the story isn’t all that original with lots of cheesey dialogue. A masterpiece of game history................................................ It was one of the first games I've got after the GameCube purchase, but it took me a while to play it. The game starts really weird, compared to its predecessors, mainly for the reduced horror feeling. It's still there though, but the game focuses more in the action sections. For the franchise, it was the beginning of a distortion in the franchise (which paved the way to RE6). At least, if one try not to look at the whole franchise, this game is really impressive, with tight controls, good difficult growth and great level design. To this date, it's still my favorite RE game. Maybe this can be changed later.. RE4 is rightfully called one of the best games of all time - it's simply stunning to witness. It's excellent pacing, enemy and weapon design and music are incredible, and sometimes it's hard to believe that this level of polish was even possible over 15 years ago, with how Resident Evil 4 tramps even a lot of modern third-person shooters and horrors. It's rarely than you can just say - this is perfect. And this is one of those opportunities. A masterpiece with a unique essence, without a doubt the best Resident Evil and one of the best games in history .... Simply one of the most fun action games (yes it feels like an action game haha) I ever played, very addictive and replayable, looked very good on the gamecube. most addicting game I have ever played in my entire life. I absolutely LOVE this game, and I really hope one day they remaster it. I would love to play it on PS5. Best game of all time imo. Hands down the best resident evil game. It's thrilling, it has good puzzles and the atmosphere is great. The controls are not the best, but it is an older game.. The best video game experience of all time, has great game play, and a great story, the best game of all time.. Everything about this game wa","the game is scary, intense and goofy. it's survival horror that also happens to be a challenging action game . resident evil 4 is one of those games you can't forget . i've bought this game in almost every console i've had, i play it at least once a year ."
200.Myth: The Fallen Lords,"One of first strategies in ""3D"". I remember playing it as a kid. It was tough for me that times - needed to learn how to play strategy games.. I like them till now :) Waiting for remake!. I remember getting my mom to buy me a 3dfx Voodoo graphics card to play this game. Ahhh the days when they sold cards that ONLY accelerated 3D, and left 2D to a different card.. Great gameplay, I still replay the game from time to time, The narration between the missions adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game. Generally speaking, this game provides one of the best RTS gameplay ever.. Myth: The Fallen Lords is a classic fantasy real-time tactics game from Bungie, the studio that brought the world Halo. Set during a dark and bleak time, an army known as the Legion is all that stands in the way of the Fallen Lords. These Lords are sorcerer-generals that lead armies of undead and monsters to undo the World of Men. It will take every small victory and brilliant strategy on the Legion's part to make a difference, and even so, the chances of winning the war hang by a thread. The player has various units at their disposal for combat tactics to determine either victory and defeat. My top three favorite in-game units are the Dwarf, Forest Giant, and the Warrior. The dwarf is especially useful for how he can use Molotov **** to take out whole scores of enemies. You can even control the dwarf to set up satchel traps! The Forest Giant is similar to the Ents from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and it is a big melee unit that can take a lot of damage and crush enemies into dust. Finally, I love the Warriors because they have a good design for them. They are the most basic melee units for the Light. Naturally, they are inferior to the Berserks, who move faster and deal more significant damage. However, it is just the look of the warriors alone that win me over, for they appear like authentic medieval European soldiers. The musical score is one of two very defining aspects of Myth: The Fallen Lords. Composer Martin O'Donnell is an extremely talented musician, and he is right up there with Oscar-winner Howard Shore. Every track is a masterpiece that sets up the tone for the next level. Many Halo fans will recognize the tune of The Siege of Madrigal, hidden as an Easter egg throughout the original trilogy. The second aspect is the narration done by voice actor Jeffrey Charlton-Perrin. He does a magnificent job of voicing the unknown Narrator in the Legion, describing the Great War's grim details. All while making the story sound more personal and human by the way he conveys his voice alone. Charlton-Perrin doesn't just describe a mythical world but pulls the player into it. For this reason alone, Charlton-Perrin is more than enough to top the likes of Morgan Freeman and Ron Perlman in terms of narration. Finally, one overlooked detail about this game is the animation of the cinematics. The animation can be described as bright and colorful, which may contrast the game's grim and bleak tone. However, this is compensated by how the animators finely detail the animation. It's almost like a fantasy 80s cartoon, but much better. And not at all cheesy! While Myth has become an obscure title, I am genuinely grateful to have preserved my copy over the past two decades. I am amazed by how well this game still holds up after all of that time. If you are fortunate to play a copy of this game, consider yourself very lucky. Myth: The Fallen Lords is a gaming experience that all gamers should enjoy!. Old Bungie Masterpiece, before Halo 4/Destiny. Everything they did back then was pure gold, and this game is no exception. From atmosphere, top notch gameplay, great graphics to one of the best ai i've encountered in games - and im writing this in 2017.... Myth The Fallen Lords 1 and 2 needs to be REMASTERED AND Released again! Most fun game ever! For those that played it you know what I'm talking about! Best of times KOTH!. this game was awesome, I cant believe no one has matched it since the dark ages of PC gaming when it came out. its like starcraft but without the sim city waste of time ""who can hit more keys faster"" trash. the point system and actually caring if your troops die was great. need more like this.. I can't believe how good this game is. Even if very old and hard, you will have a great time playing it. Simple, easy to learn, (very) hard to master.",myth: the Fallen Lords is a classic fantasy real-time tactics game from Bungie . the player has various units at their disposal for combat tactics to determine either victory or defeat . the musical score is one of two very defining aspects of myth: the Fallen Lords .
201.Medal of Honor: Allied Assault,"If you fan of ww2 games you should try this. Despite its age, this game still has its charm and unique appeal. It does a great job of handling the uber-difficulty of D-Day, but most of the game is about a one-man-army dude destroying Germans. The gameplay is fun, except for the muzzle jitter when you take damage.. Many hours playing rifle only back in the day and one of the best menu music of any game ever. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The beginning of the computer era of Medal of Honor. Surprisingly, very enthusiastic feelings from playing this game. The plot and situations in the game are just excellent. And the final mission would have shut up any military shooter of that time.. I am ok with playing old games and imo judging them for todays standarts is not good. Bul game is so hard to the point its not enjoyable to me, Its not terrible its good but not good for me, frustration that i got isn't near equal to the enjoymet i got.. The best Medal of Honor in my opinion (I like to say it is more like Call of Duty 0). Really loved to play it, and I cannot recommend it enough for those who enjoy early 2000s FPS.. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, released in 2002, was a defining entry in the first-person shooter genre, capturing the essence of World War II with its immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and gripping narrative. As players stepped into the boots of Lieutenant Mike Powell, they embarked on a thrilling journey through historically inspired missions, delivering an unforgettable gaming experience. One of the standout features of Allied Assault was its ability to transport players back to the chaotic and perilous battlefields of World War II. The game's attention to detail was evident in its meticulously crafted environments, from the war-torn cities of Europe to the treacherous landscapes of North Africa. The authenticity of the settings, combined with the atmospheric sound design, immersed players in the heart of the conflict, creating a sense of urgency and immersion rarely seen in games of that era. The gameplay mechanics of Allied Assault struck a delicate balance between realism and accessibility. The controls were intuitive, allowing players to quickly adapt and engage in intense firefights against enemy soldiers. The variety of weapons and equipment available, ranging from rifles and machine guns to grenades and bazookas, added depth and strategy to the gameplay. Additionally, the inclusion of vehicles, such as tanks and jeeps, further expanded the gameplay possibilities, providing exhilarating moments of armored warfare. The single-player campaign of Allied Assault was a masterclass in storytelling, as it took players on a series of thrilling missions that spanned across various theaters of war. From infiltrating enemy bases to engaging in daring rescue operations, the missions were varied and well-paced, keeping players engaged and invested in the narrative. The game's cinematic presentation, including cutscenes and scripted events, added to the immersive storytelling experience, drawing players deeper into the harrowing world of World War II. In addition to its compelling single-player campaign, Allied Assault featured a robust multiplayer mode that allowed players to engage in intense online battles. With a variety of maps, game modes, and customization options, the multiplayer component offered hours of competitive gameplay and fostered a vibrant community of players. Graphically, Allied Assault was visually stunning for its time. The character models, environments, and weapon details were rendered with impressive attention to detail, creating a visually immersive experience. The game's soundtrack, composed by Michael Giacchino, added an extra layer of intensity and emotion, complementing the gameplay and enhancing the overall atmosphere. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was a timeless classic that captured the essence of World War II and delivered an unforgettable gaming experience. Its immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and engaging narrative made it a must-play for fans of the first-person shooter genre and history enthusiasts alike. While newer titles have since built upon its foundation, Allied Assault remains a testament to the impact it had on the genre and stands as a defining entry in the Medal of Honor franchise.. Was much better in my childhood. The first part of the game seems to be fine, maybe even good, but farther you go - worse it gets. Enemies seeing you through obstacles, shooting you directly and instantly from big distances, some levels contains enemies who is merging with background and can be barely seen. AI is pretty dumb and unpredictable or fully predictable from time to time.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. The thing i like about this game is it`s mission design. All of the levels are so unique and unforgetable. The AI is better than most of the modern games and actually takes cover and kills people you didn`t even see. The only problem is resoultion. You need to edit **** if your resoulition is higher than game supports.. Predecessor to COD1 and built on the same idTech3 engine, this game was the best WW2 game alongwith RTCW when it was released back in 2002. A truly remarkable game that set several gaming standards for the other FPS games that followed.. Very good game. the gameplay, soundtrack, and atmosphere is what makes this game soo enjoyable. 10/10. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (along with Medal of Honor: Frontline) is the best FPS ever. Not the best Medal of Honor, not the best WWII FPS... the BEST first person shooter EVER! Unforgettable scenes like Omaha Beach, Scuttling the U-529 and Fort Schmerzen. With the bright mind of Steven Spielberg and a legendary soundtrack composed by Michael Giacchino. Definitely gets a 10/10. Masterpiece.. I disagree with the current reviews. This game was too difficult. I found in many later missions that I got stuck multiple times on the medium difficulty. Some maps I simply could not play - even on easy diffuclty. That is weird because I consider myself an excellent FPS gamer: been playing them for years. I was doing well and then, suddenly, I was stuck for like an hour in the same thing fight, die, respawn and do it again. The graphics are not suitable for this game, as it is undoubtedly an older game from the early 2000's (I write this review much later in 2022). On a sour note, I bought the game and found that the multiplayer was discontinued for this video game. Also, this game has D-day, but it is way too hard. I mean, I get it that D-day was a hard thing for our troops to do, but I died too many times on that beach. The game developers needed to make it at least passable for me on the medium difficulty level. Even easy difficulty was way too hard to make it up that beach ultimately. Once I breached the beach sand walls, I gave up because I could not get past some **** sharpshooters. I have played FPS since I was 13, so it is not excusable to make a game too complicated - it makes me think they didn't properly test it. The mechanisms were suitable in the game, and the action of shooting and aiming were 10/10. It had a good storyline and made me want to complete missions. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was engaging. I had to look and see where the enemy was during night missions. It was exciting too, sometimes enemy would come out of nowhere, and it was full of surprises. The video game is really good that it had a single player, because I live in Hawaii, and we have high ping numbers out here. So, the loss of a multiplayer was not such a big deal.. Saving Private ""Medal of Honor"". The game that turned the market on their side, and for a good reason: the game is excellent. The theme suits so much. I can recall some iconic cutscenes even now.. By far the best game I've ever played. The atmosphere is so dense, it engrosses you completely into the midst of the war. Get's my vote over ""Max Payne"" and ""Half-Life."". Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is a classic game which is every cultured and experienced players should taste. If you are planning to finish this game in present-day with a hard difficulty, think about it twice if you didn't finish an old FPS. Because I barely finished this game even in easy mode and I'm not planning finish it again. This game has same hard difficulty as early 2000's FPS games. This game deserves like 7/10 score because this game was aiming to give a realistic WWII ambience for its time. Playability for present-day is up to you. The game has a decent gameplay. If you care a lot to graphics for a game, I don't reccomend it. If you are used to play old games which has old graphics, I reccomend this game. Some levels of the game may annoy you with its difficulty even you are playing on easy or normal mode, especially the last levels of the game is more challenging than others. The ambience and variety of the levels are the best part of the game, play it for this reason if you are going to, not for fun. The overall of the game is 7/10.. The best ww2 fps game to date and my favorite game of all time with great gameplay brilliant level design and a satisfying gunplay and a great soundtrack composed by Michael Giaccino. I rarely give games a 10/10 rating, but MOHAA is a masterpiece. This goes beyond a video game into cinematic territory. No, not 30FPS motion blurred garbage - REAL cinematic territory. Hollywood-quality scores and music, diverse levels with twists and turns, authentic environmental effects, believable enemies... it's just glorious. How a small team of developers pulled this off in 2001 baffles me. Modern games still struggle to reach this level of believably and immersion, and this game was designed to run on a PENTIUM 3. Absolute must play. Especially if you're a WW2 buff.. After Call of duty it is my favourite fist-person shooter at the time. I still remember the Omaha beach mission.. So I remember my father playing this when I was younger and I played it a lot through the years but I recently replayed it and I'd like to review it with my recent experience in mind. I'm not gonna talk about the graphics because they are obviously dated. The game came out 18 years ago, cmon. What I will talk about is gameplay, since in regards to the story, there isn't much to tell. You are a soldier and are fighting through different operations during the war that take you from Norway to Normandy and Germany etc. The shooting feels good even by today's standards. You can't aim down sights, besides a sniper rifle, but there is a crosshair that helps you aim. The whole game feels very cinematic and the music plays a big role in that. Michael Giacchino did an excellent job with this one, making the score iconic. What bothered me a lot was that when you got hit the aim went all over the place especially if you got shot multiple times and it felt like you couldn't fight back or had to try a lot to make that shot count. Other than that the weapons feel and sound realistic and the sound effects are really good. Also those animations are pretty amazing and hilarious at times. My game crashed twice all in all and there weren't many glitches or bugs other than that. Many times though an NPC that would follow me would block the entrance and I had to push him out of the way to get through and it was annoying if I was into a fight. Also Sniper Town didn't feel as hard since I took a photo of the locations of the snipers as to not get annoyed again. Those f*ckers can shoot you even before you can see them and the AI's accuracy were 95% perfect. I would recommend it to anyone newcomer or returning veteran to the series. It's a must play.... I equally loved so much this and Call of Duty... That was the Golden Era of WWII games.... Before Battlefield and Call Of Duty became the top player, there was Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault. Intense war game with heart breaking moments. Until today one of the best games with the WWII setting.. MoH is one of the classics of egoshooter, the best one was Allies Assault and Pacific Assault. I wanted to play the older one first, and it really worked on my win7 system :) : The KI is very unrealistic, sometimes very stupid and sometimes they shoot unrealistically well, even through bushes. For example there is a sniper mission which is very frustrating. The most missions are very linear, only the last mission is a bit free. Look at Far Cry, this is how it shall be done. The near fog is annoying, especially if you could see further with your sniper. The last point is about grenades: It could be better to have just one hotkey to throw a grenade, in this game you need to change weapon and you have a break between it. So in the time maybe you dont want to throw them anymore. In addition the detonation is very weak. So I didnt use it often. The good side? The missions are very different. Only the stealth mission was weak, because you could kill everything too. I appreciate, that all the missions were real operations from the 2nd world war. It is very interesting to search for more informations about the operations in real life. The atmosphere is top too, no one will every forget the Normandy mission. I like it, when you dont need to invest a lot of time to get to know all of the game, in this case 6-8 hours, maybe a bit too few, but better then 15 hours and the gameplay is repetitive. Result: Surely a top shooter at the release date. But nowadays there are some outdated gameplay mechanisms.. Best game ever i love this sooo much get this game as its cheap graphic are kinda old but i dont blame it because this is the best game!!!!. TOP 100 Games for Low END PC (64 MB / 128 MB / 256 MB VRAM) This list includes the best low spec PC games from different genres such as FPS, Open World, Fighting, Racing and many more that you can play on your old PC & Laptop NOTE: It's a listing from 1 to 100 in no particular order. Yes, great ww2 fps, had its challenges, but it is a classic that was very enjoyable. t first, it start as a casual fps, but further you go, worse it will go. Enemies see your movements through walls and sometimes they will start even shooting at you before you are at drawing distance. Later part of the game will really ruin your day, but the difficulty level was pretty norm. When game come out it brakes to third wall :) Everything was mind blowing - from visuals to story. Hope some day they will make a remake of this game :). I logged tons of hours online on this game. We had lots of added content and maps. My favorite addition was a modified damage scale, all rifles were made to where a torso or headshot was one shot kills. The sniping on this game was incredible esp online. I havent played it in over a decade but the memories remain, only halo 3 has been as good for me.. I was 11 years old when I first played this game. I am 27 now and it still brings good memories.. -Excellent graphics for the time -Very good sound design (especially gun-sounds) -Unique game-play -Great soundtracks This game is hell of a legend.. Back in 2002 Medal of Honor Allied Assault was the best thing since, well the previous Medal of Honor game. We’re talking 9/10 across Metacritic, IGN and GameSpot. Well in 2018 it's a different story. I'm not talking graphics and sound, although they have aged badly I'm talking gameplay. Terrible signposting, flighty, weightless shooting and men you can empty a full clip into and only knock off their hat. This game is bloody terrible. Wobbling when you got shot is realistic, kinda but on a level full of crack shot snipers it just means you never get a shot in. Line it up, oh I got shot wait for the camera to reset, oh I got shot again, now I’m dead. Some people lament the days before Call of Duty but man are we treated today.. The first Medal of Honor for the PC. No longer being held back by the limitations of the PS1, EA was able to make a fully authentic WWII experience. I can see why this was loved back in the day. Much of what you see in Call of Duty can be found here. If there was no MOH, there would be no COD. But...this game shows its age in all aspects. It has been overshawdowed by its rival, COD, just a year later. There's no aiming down sights or even a zoom feature. Your crosshairs don't change when moving, and you can't swap weapons. That's not to say that no fun can be had from this game even today, just make sure you aren't expecting what you saw in more modern WWII games, or even from the first COD. One thing to note is that I underestimated this game's difficulty. I thought I could breeze through the game on the Medium difficulty. Boy was I a fool. I should have known that ""Easy"" was the normal back then. The game was quite frustrating as a result, and one particular level was just hell. There were also times you had to memorize where each enemy would spawn to get through. Please, do yourself a favor and play this game on Easy, even if you think you're an FPS veteran. If you can look past the graphics and the fact that Call of Duty made every aspect better, then a play-through is worth it.. So what we have here is a game that's had almost entirely positive feedback, but from the get-go, I found myself frustrated and slightly disappointed, and continued to be throughout the campaign. What this game does do well, however, as nearly all classic Medal of Honor titles do, is create stunning settings and depicts the battlefields of the war with great detail. Storming Omaha Beach while seeing men around you die like they're nothing more than squishy flesh (because that's exactly what they are) really helps put you in the mindset of what such a thing was like. Sure, the game is old and graphically outdated, but it doesn't change anything with how well-done the presentation is. Also along with the territory of Medal of Honor comes its fantastically fitting soundtrack, which enhances the whole experience of playing. Gunplay is fairly well-done. Using the Springfield to snipe is incredibly powerful and satisfying. The gunshot sounds and animations are also crafted nicely. However, where I feel this game is the most disappointing, if not just outright frustrating is its difficulty. I'm all for challenging games that make the player think and practice, believe me, but when the difficulty is nothing more than pure jank or unrealistic, it gets tiring and infuriating. I have two main problems with the way this game handles difficulty; the most consistent one being enemy spawns. It's not enemy placement, no. It's spawns. An area that is completely clear one second can, and will be infested with enemy soldiers as soon as you move up, even if you've already cleared it out, and there are NO entrances into the spot except through the front. In the very first mission, I was clearing out a room while looking for my objective (to destroy some equipment, etc). I had cleared every other room out prior, and this was my last one. As soon as I destroyed them, turned around to leave and was standing in the doorway, waiting for the inevitable enemies to approach me as I was hearing footsteps, I get shot from... behind?? Wait, what? As a long-time fan of Medal of Honor, I've come to expect a bit of jank here and there, since I grew up playing Frontline and even Rising Sun many times, but I don't recall this much nonsense occurring, or at least not as consistently as it is here. My second issue regarding difficulty is that the enemy just.. either seems to know where the player is at all times, OR doesn't have any clue of what's going on. I either get shot as I walk through a doorway before seeing an enemy, or I kill a soldier, and the one walking by somehow doesn't even notice. There is no in-between. This issue is compounded by the level design. it feels like it's set up so that the player will get shot, all the time, no matter what, and with enemies that always know you and your squad's position. There are few flank routes, and the ones that do exist are made nearly irrelevant by enemies that turn and snap to you as soon as you get around them, so you might as well have just not tried to get behind them in the first place. Bringing up the player's squad, however, Allied Assault does a fantastic job at making sure your NPC followers actually assist in fighting. The player is not the only one getting kills, and this was massively refreshing for me to find in this game. A small caveat about the allies that accompany the player is, well, it's pretty easy to get blocked by one of them when trying to get to cover, since they're completely solid and are impossible for the player to pass through. Minor issue, of course. I can't say that I inherently recommend this title to anyone other than die-hard Medal of Honor fans or WWII shooter fans. Thankfuily, the good parts of the game are enjoyable enough to push many of the players through its campaign, and if we include the additional expansions that came out for the game (included in the War Chest edition of the game), there's quite a bit of content for players to go through, which is a nice and hefty plus.. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is one of those games that should be recognised as genre defining. Bear in mind that this was 2002, before Battlefield 1942 and COD. Only a few months behind the likes of Halo. With a story contributed to by Steven Spielberg this game works out as the Saving Private Ryan movie tie in most of us dreamed of. By far the most iconic mission on offer is the Omaha Beach level. An almost direct recreation of the scene in Saving Private Ryan and here its pulled off well. The player struggling to navigate past machine gun fire and tank traps, over hearing conversations of other soldiers struggling to survive. Aside from this, the submarine pen mission also stands out. As an officer of the OSS, you must infiltrate a submarine base, get a disguise and sabotage some equipment. You have to show your papers to guards and avoid other officers who might recognise you. Whilst the graphics are a bit dated most of the sound effects are very well done. This games Thompson submachine gun has this great bassy punch to it that will forever keep it near the top of my most favoured video game weapons. Alongside this most of the voice acting is great and soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is superb. Naturally for a game so old there are still many flaws. Here we still have healthbars, which aren't inherently bad but also make some of the level design harder. Several times I'd get checkpointed with exceptionally low health meaning I'd go into my next firefight and repeatedly die in one shot. Some might say this makes it gritty and realistic but to be honest its just more frustrating. This was particularly noticeable on one level where you are sneaking through a ruined town and need to counter-snipe several enemies. However, because of the draw distance and some of the foliage it was impossible to work out where some enemies were until they shot you. If you had lost too much health prior to this section you would have to memorise the location all the snipers and perfectly take them out. Otherwise you'd have to constantly quicksave after doing a section perfectly. Both killed the immersion for me. Interestingly the enemies skill increases as you go through the game, early enemies often bumping into you and needing to **** their weapons whilst later you will face hyper accurate stormtroopers. Sadly the difficulty was only really altered through increased accuracy, reaction time and damage. Most of the missions, particularly the bunker missions gave no opportunity for enemies to demonstrate any flanking manoeuvres. There is no multiplayer available but from what I remember it was moderately fun. On another minor issue note, playing through origin every second attempt at starting the game up it would crash. Very weird. Overall, I think that this game still warrants playing (if you can get it working) for some of the level design and sound effects in particular. Naturally CoD and Battlefield have gone on the dominate in the War shooter arena but there are still a few things that MoH can teach the grand children in terms of story telling.. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was an authentic, gritty World War 2 shooter that actually still holds up to this day. Mostly. A lot of the developers who created this game later went on to make the original Call of Duty, and it shows, because this game, like COD Classic, does an excellent job of putting the player firmly in the boots of the soldier during WWII's toughest events. The only lagging issue I have with this game is that the graphics and gameplay have not held up very well to today's standards. But aside from that, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is a gritty, realistic representation of WWII, and is worth playing if you are a fan of the original Call of Duties.. It's a fantastic games in almost every aspect I really enjoy it everytime when I replay the story and after so many years It is still my favourite war game.I can recommend it to every player and It's a MUST GAME for every FPS game lover :) !. Amazing military game, all graphics game play story are wonderful, the story occurs in WWII era, The game's levels are often compared to Steven Spielberg's 1998 film Saving Private Ryan, Single-player missions include assaulting German bases in Algiers and Norway, storming Omaha Beach on D-Day, and rescuing comrades behind enemy lines in occupied France. This is the first video game i played on my pc when i was a kid. After years of it's release i still have the CD collection and playing sometimes. The game is awesome! but it's difficulty was excessive even in easy.. The overall experience is immersive mainly thanks to the well-staged set of scenarios, tasteful texture work and a great soundtrack. The pacing of the game is quite good and the action is well distributed across a well-designed and intuitive set of levels. This would be a straight up good game if it was not for the excessive amount of ultra-cheap death this game had me deal with. I guess it's also part of its charm, and the challenging aspect of the game, when not excessively unfair is quite welcome and reinforces the reward you feel after beating a difficult section. If you love FPS, this is an easy one to recommend.. Metal Of Honor is a classic first person shooter that gives the player an enjoyable time while making them scream over the spawns or is that call of duty lol.. Fantastic Game. My Favourite FPS Game. The game that revolutionized forever the FPS Games. Environment and atmosphere are Great for it's time of release even now playing it with all details at maximum and all visual effects on it is a delight to watch and play. All Single Play campaign is very realistic and cinematographic. The Sounds are 10/10 really and the ****...Powerful, Intense, Dramatic, and so well written it put us right in the middle of the war. In Multiplayer Mode This game is 10/10. With the best movements i ever saw on a FPS, and those leans are really handy ;). Fast drop of weapons, quick draws of pistol, fast opening/closing doors **** possible to save ourselves. And it has so many Great mods to play. Free-For-All; Team-Match; Objective-Match; Freeze-Tag; Countdown; Capture-The-Flag; Base Assault;Escort-The-Tank; Liberation; **** so many more. This is a Game that is STILL ALIVE and it is recommended to all FPS game lovers. Even after Gamespy shutdown and EA stop developing more Medal Of Honor Series there is still Big Communities Doing all their best to Keep this game alive, by providing Master Server's List; Improvement Patches and Anti-Cheats. There are alot of server's and players online. Check out this link : ****/ Good Shooting ;). Still great game ! Great story in single player, excelent sound and music which was awarded. Game worth reminder. Too bad, multiplayer doesn't work now.. That's where it all started bros. The great downfall of FPS into Modern Military Shooters for dumb masses. That's it. If you want to know why does nowadays shooters mostly **** and go by one model of dragging player along a path - launch AA and dive into the sea... No, a sewer canal of bad ideas that ruined shooters forever. It's all here. Compass, abysmall level design, and dragging you by your hand. There are medpacks and it's not too easy (but it ain't hard, by no means), sure; but they were quickly eradicated to make shooters compelling to 8 years olds, who forced their parents to buy crappy modern military shooters. That was the moment shooters went downhill pretty fast.. the gameplay is bad the graphics horible same enemies same missions and its so hard and to me its horrible just horrible electronic arts why oh just why did you make this. This deserves more respect in the history of video games than it generally gets recognised for. The single player was fantastic for its time, its treatment of DDay was better than any game had done before it, but it's online that this game shone far beyond anything else at the time, for me at any rate. The multiplayer maps are extremely well designed and as far as I know it was one of the earlier games to incorporate lean in multiplayer. The weapons are well balanced, with a strong emphasis on skill. Sure, go the SMG, spray your heart away, you'll get some lucky kills, but nothing feels better than nailing someone across the map, leaning out of cover, with a sightless Kurz. More than any other multiplayer FPS I have played it came down to how fast and how accurate you were. I pumped more hours in to this game online over a five to ten year period than I probably did all others combined. An amazing game. I only wish there were still active servers!. Still the best of the series in my opinion. Great graphics. Long missions/game, but not tedious, and not unrealistically difficult. Not the type of game making you wish you had the quick save feature either. The D-Day mission made me feel like I was there, and that's a rarity for me. It's just that well done. Linear game, but not a game that feels like it needs a sandbox feature. Still it was exceedingly linear, and there was the occasional ridiculous AI bug, so it's not a perfect score. I still think the series is trying to recapture the magic that this game exhibits.. At first, it start as a casual fps, but further you go, worse it will go. Enemies see your movements through walls and sometimes they will start even shooting at you before you are at drawing distance. Later part of the game will really ruin your day, but the difficulty level was pretty normal for it's time. But if you are used to play modern fps, don't expect fun and easy moments, but quick loading and saving every other second. There is some other annoying things: jump is useless, it will make player much slower at game doesn't even exploit it much. Second is that you can't switch your weapon during reloading and this will make you very vulnerable. Other than that, this game delivers variety much and ambience is awesome. Especially winter missions and those dogs barking.... Rox game Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 10/10 Controls 10/10 Story 9/10 Characters 7/10 Level design 9/10 Weapons 10/10 AI 8/10 Multiplayer 10/10 Presentation 10/10 User Interface 10/10 Sounds 8/10 Music 10/10. This is my favorite FPS of all time, nothing beats this for me, the ambience, the sound, so well done, you should try it out, it is on Good Old Game for 9 bucks (optimized for high resolution and comes with the expansions). This is a 10/10 for me. Literally one of the best games of my life (others being the other medal of honor games). This game is a must. It is just amazing. I literally have no words for it, thats it, No Words.. Fantastic shooting game that for some reason I first played it a few years ago. I have 1 criticism for the game, some levels can be annoying because the enemy ","despite its age, this game still has its charm and unique appeal . the gameplay is fun, except for the muzzle jitter when you take damage . the final mission would have shut up any military shooter of that time ."
202.LittleBigPlanet 2,"Many improvements compared to the first game of the series. They kept the positive things and tried to remove the mistakes from the first game.. The first video game I ever played! This one brings back so many memories and it is such a great experience for all players! If you are looking for a platforming game to get a child into gaming, this is the one.. Is one of the only games in my entire life I can truly say I've had no hatred against: no frustrating moments, no confused moments in the story or gameplay, literally nothing was bad. All the characters were unique, interesting and funny. The levels were, yet again, made in the upgraded Create Mode allowing one to dream of how they could make their own levels on top of allowing one to easily think up solutions to problems given they're bound by the game's natural laws. Bosses are unique and creative, The Negativitron despite being simple was a very amazing character when I finally revisited the series, music was great as always with Sleepy Head being a classic. Sad that the servers are down now, but the story mode and DLCs are literally so good that they're enough for me to enjoy the game.. This is easily the best PS3 game of all time, there are many great PS3 games out there. but this, This is different, highly Recommend Playing Easy 10/10 game. genuinely feel bad for anyone who didn't grow up with this game.. My god, this game took everything the first one did well and made it 1000000x better, especially in terms of graphics.. the artstyle isnt quite as strong as LBP but the amount of stuff added more than makes up for it, you can basically make anything you want in this game. this game is my comfort food. again sad to see this games servers gone but you can connect it to private servers thankfully. Little Big Planet 2’s new additions to the LBP universe give even more to learn, play, and create with alongside more polish than the original could’ve ever provided. But in the long run, Little Big Planet is what you make of it, and requires a lot of time to really get to the meat of it all, but if you’re looking at just the story it’s still a fun little experience.. This is by far the best game for the PS3. Its levels are great, the Createinator is well-made, and the Create mode has many features! The only problem is the servers being down, but I don't blame Media Molecule. This game is amazing!. The second part is the first part brought to perfection. Very fun and varied. The only problem is the short plot part.. I think the best game from the LBP series. I liked the fact that the gameplay was extended in comparison to the first game.. This is ana amzing game, I love so muhc. One of my favorite games of all time.. Tons of fun and an improvement in variety over the previous installment. Same great platforming with couch co-op. A must play of the PS3.. Many improvements compared to the first game of the series. They kept the positive things and tried to remove the mistakes from the first game.. (10/10) - The best of the three LittleBigPlanet games, mostly due to a super entertaining story and a great online experience.. this game changed my life people i would've never met i met on this game and i still talk to some of those people to this day R.I.P the online and community. Media Molecule impresses with its amazing sense of creativity. Even if you refuse to create any levels and merely play, there is much this game has to offer you.. I used play this at my grandparent’s house all the time when I was younger. I finished the game over and over again just to hear the end song. I also think that the graphics are really nice for a 2011 game. I had a lot of spare time so I made a load of custom levels as well. I think they shouldn't have made 3 how they did.. Greatest piece of fiction ever created to describe this game as ""peak fiction"" would be an understatement.. Leagues better then the first game, my most played game of all time. Recommend def!. I will never forget the joy of playing this game as a kid. It brought me endless joy, so much happiness and comfort, and created a whole world of fun for me. I'll always think of it so fondly.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 8 Music: 7 Story: 8 Total: 8.00. Pure impersonation of the community, especially the Mortal Kombat and Tsunami maps, top skins. LittleBigPlanet 2 had definitely lived up to the success of the original game; It took everything and cranked it up a notch.. The quality of the first little big planet is maintained and it is improved, good gameplay, creation tools. It is a game that you should not miss. Story: 8 Gameplay: 9 Music: 9 Visuals: 9 Personal Score: 9 JEWELL !!. It's fun, It's creative, It's awesome. The soundtracks and music choices are god-tier. And the community-created levels dial up the replay value to infinity.. Really creative game. Mario Maker before Mario Maker. Go try it if you can easily.. I played this game with my little brother and we had so much fun. If you want to play a family game this is a perfect choose.. Game a little bit improved than the first one, some new level design, new mechanics, little more plot, everything else is the same. Character moving is kind of too smooth, slow, after some time it's become annoying, for me.. LittleBigPlanet 2 is just like its predecessor a big show. Amusing for old and young, especially the multiplayer. It offers so much content and it lives from the imagination of the players. Unique!. The best platformer I have ever played. With sublime game-play, fantastic visuals and a diverse soundtrack. However it's more than just that, adding on from its original game, LittleBigPlanet 2 adds all sorts of new gadgets and gizmos to create levels never before possible. The unique charm of the LittleBigPlanet franchise is here in spades. As you hop, skip and swing from level to level you'll unlock all sorts of costumes adding onto the original inventory from the first game (which you are able to bring in from the first game into the second.). Excellent sequel to an excellent game. Tons of user generated levels, great gameplay, reasonable difficulty curve that let's all skill levels enjoy the game and still find fun and challenges.. The story mode is very fun. The co-op in this game is very good as well. The community maps on this game is amazing. They were able to do some truly unique stuff with creator mode. The amount of fun community content on this game makes it a must play.. HOLY **** This game **** rocks! For starters, I would suggest playing it just for the story mode, It’s challenging yet an extremely fun romp all the way to the end! Go pick up a copy or download it if you want to experience a whimsical and childlike yet surprisingly dark adventure!. Little Big Planet 2 is a masterpiece and is one of the greatest sequels to ever hit the planet. It improves in everything the story mode somehow they made it even better with new power ups and features that changed Little Big Planet forever. Somehow the music is even better and not to mention the amount of charm and customization options this game has. They even listened and made the online so much better that it’s actually functional, not to mention how easier it is to make levels and the new tools are amazing. Little Big Planet 2 is a game every gamer should experience because its truly a magical and a creative masterpiece. (A Masterpiece 5/5) You Must Play It!. The original Littlebigplanet had captured my heart and endless amounts of hours in its cutesy and creative world, with brilliantly created story levels, and a powerful, yet accessible create mode. Media Molecule’s sequel does all of this, yet expands upon what made it great, and mostly fixed its flaws, making it, in my opinion, the best game of 2011. The premise of the story is simple. A big vacuum named the Negativatron is vacuuming anything in its path on a quest for total destruction, and its up to you, and an alliance of quirky characters to defeat him. The level design is just as brilliant as the first game, if not more, due to a larger toolbox for Media Molecule. While the story itself isn’t as strong as games like Bioshock, and The Last of Us, that’s not the purpose of this game. However, that doesn’t mean the story mode wouldn’t be solid on its own. Far from it. The biggest aspect in Littlebigplanet 2, however, is the much bigger create mode. With the addition of logic, and many, many more tools you can use to create whatever masterpiece you can think of. Thanks to this, you are able to create games that breaks the limits of the fact that LBP is a 2D puzzle-platformer. This is brilliant beyond practically any creation game at the time, which truly felt groundbreaking, similar to the feeling I had with the first games creation system. Sharing your masterpieces are easier than ever, and experiencing them are no different. Although the load times are seemingly longer than the first game, the payoff exceeds the price. Once you take a dive into some of the best levels LBP has to offer, you would often forget that you’re playing LBP, and you begin to believe that you are playing a different game. This feeling of creative power is rare among creation games, making this experience one that shouldn’t be missed. The multiplayer also works very well. Looking to play with friends? Simply invite them to your pod and play away! Looking for some friends? Fear not! Simply use the “Dive In” feature to find some random people to be grouped with. Who knows? You might make some really close friends. You are able to both play, and create levels with other people. This means that if you combine the creative power of 2-4 sack people, you can create something that is truly brilliant, and loved by the community. All in all, Littlebigplanet 2 builds so much on what was already made with the first game. Its fleshed out story mode, and expanded create mode, makes this game among my favorites of all time. All of these features makes this game an instant must-play.. So many memories, **** dude. If you for some reason have never played a littlebigplanet game, be sure to do before they go ****in extinct. And preferably this one.. Is a Very good game, i have a good momentos and every memory in this game with my friends. this......this is a masterpiece **** not only is it fun but it does not just feel like a **** feels like a social media. this game makes lbp1 and heck super smash bros look like crap (there not really crap by the way I do like both games) I love making levels, playing other's level, and looking at the latest drama. this is how a squeal is done. also, a random fact I was born one month before the 1st LBP game was released lol. anyway overall my (get this) favorite game of all time.. I will admit when this game was first announced, I didn't this game would be as good as the original. BUT BOY I WAS WRONG! The took everything the original did right and made it 1000 times better. There is literally no limit to creativity inn this game to the point you can make anything! Yeah the original had many possibilities but it had it's limits, but this game has no limits. The story is phenomenal in every possible way. Memorable and interesting characters (i'm talking to you Avalon), creative and challenging levels, amazing design and graphics in each level and great boss fights. These types of games are super rare in video games and littlebigplanet 2 is one of the best sequel and game ever created. A really good game, there are lots of cool things about it and it is a lot of fun to play.. The best LittleBigPlanet, period. So many fun times, and memories, i had with this game. Easily my favorite PS3 game (and PlayStation series) by far. You're bound to find some enjoyment from playing this game.. This is my favourite game of all time. Great levels, amazing story, the music is pretty great, the ability to create levels is almost limitless, the amount of amazingly designed levels online, 4 player multiplayer, I COULD JUST GO ON AND ON! The only problem I have with it is that I'm not good at creating levels... Screw it, I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE FLAW ABOUT THIS MASTERPIECE!. The story mode is a bit lackluster, but the multiplayer is absolutely superb. Tons of creative and fun maps and mini games to choose from.. A good sequel to an awesome game. Had pretty much as much fun as i had playing the first game.. Admittedly, this game does have share a few of the first game's issues, as getting all collectibles can be quite frustrating, I don't care nearly as much because it's worth it. First of all, the levels and characters are MUCH better in this game than the first. Each character is memorable and charming in their own way, and the levels are incredibly fun and creative for the most part. However, what truly makes this game is Create Mode and the community. While the first game's Create Mode hasn't aged well, this game's manages to stay incredibly fun, convenient, and useful even after the 3rd game. The amazing things you can do with it are impressive on their own, but what's even more amazing is what other players HAVE done with it. Being able to play other people's levels grants an infinite amount of fun to have playing this game, and I've had a lot in the 6 years I've owned this game. And I'm sure I will continue to have plenty more in the future.. This game took what the first game had, and added a whole lot more to it. New mechanics, new ways to make levels and all that stuff along with the older stuff. Now because it has new stuff to work with, it can get a little more complex to make a good level. But you don't have to make a very good looking level for the game to be good at all. Sometimes it's fun just to make what you could in LBP1 and just add a few things from LBP2 to it. This is a great sequel to a good game.. LittleBigPlanet 2 is a fun and vibrant game and definitely suit for the imaginative. The game best excels while playing with friends and family as good laughs are a certain.. Little Big Planet 2 is almost as great as the first but not as challenging so i give it an 8 but it's still really fun and lots of customization, now there's actual voice actors besides the narrator so it's a bit more funny, and really worth buying if you loved the previous one. You don't need to play the first to play this one but their both great games.. Great game to play with a girlfriend who doesn't know how to play games. Fun platforming and alot of customization options with great variety. Once you've beaten the story mode there's millions of user created content to choose from.. I didn't like this as much as the first one. Something was just off with this game. The feel wasn't the same. Maybe because they altered the gameplay and created all kinds of new gadgets. New things and upgrades are usually good, but that just took away the simplicity which made the first game so good. The story also was worse this time around and the pacing with the different gadgets you're using was bad. (I played this when it came out, I'm just now writing the review). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. when I first played I was hating this game for a while but ended up liking the game and awesome and fun much chance of creating game but the creation tool and yet difficult to master but is still a good game recommend. This is a must buy for any **** game is a big improvement over the **** has many more tools for **** story mode is ****'s super ****'s a little quirky and the camera still needs work but still this is an amazing game.Easily a must buy.. This seriously enhances the level editor from the first game with improvements on already existing tools, and many new ones added in. You can create whole games rather than just whole levels. Unfortunately, playing online with more than one player gets very laggy and a lot of the online tracking doesn't work. Still, if you enjoyed the first, you'll enjoy this.. I have to say this game was a major improvement from last when I mean major I mean MAJOR the game evolved to such a boring game to new game with may more things brought to to the table they've majorly improved creative mode a lot they also added little films now with voice actors that do story characters one more thing they added in creative mode is to make make your own music now I have to argue with this one you have to be a music professional to make this music and I don't know how people make this music but this game is great game and I recommend you buy this game.. LittleBigPlanet 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and with good reason. The game has an astounding amount of personality and it really pushes your creativity. The story levels are lots of fun to play and the design is pretty crazy. The best of all are the community levels and the creative mode. First off the community levels: it's amazing what people can come up with. From retro remakes, to puzzles, and platformers galore. They'll keep you busy. The creative mode!? I hear you cry. It's the best thing ever. Like I said about the community levels, you can create almost anything. It's all up to you.. I have enjoyed this game, and i liked it, but i think there are some boring levels on Littlebigplanet 2. The good part are the community levels, and you can customize own levels. I was not disappointed when i played this game. This is a good platform game for the PS3.. Like the original, but more refined. Adds more customization, better game-play and co-operative play, however the online is still as dumb as a bag of hammers. 8/10 - Ben Hazelden. This is what you expect from a sequel to one of the most creative and alluring platformers of all-time. Gameplay has improved slightly with the addition of new items to use, and the graphics are a bit sharper. Where it really excels, though, is in its array of new editor tools. There are more creative levels to play than the first LittleBigPlanet, and by a large margin.. Best Platformer Ever. Editor - It is a wonderful tool. Friendly community. Interesting levels of the community, for every taste. The plot is interesting. Exclusive to PS3 at level of Uncharted. Everyone will enjoy! :D. First LittleBigPlanet was funny, the second has more possibilities making it even better. Probably not so good in one player but it is perfect game for playing with somebody you know. What a pity the story is mishmash.. I don't care what anyone says, this is the best game on the PS3 and it will always have a special place in my heart, Little Big Planet is the only game that has ever made me emotional by re-watching the trailer, this is the best game I've ever played, 11/10 this game is a must buy!. While this game does have it's frustrating parts that made me replay it over and over again, most of the game is not a full on side scrolling shooter, but a puzzle combat based game. When I beat the last guy, I cheered through the roof knowing I defeated a frustrating round with two checkpoints. The level making setting allows for some very interesting game play and creative styles. One example I found was a Zombie Survival with destructible and rebuilding cover. Overall, you can make some awesome things with just your mind and instructions on how to use the stuff.. if wasn't LBP1 is the best you certainly gonna live with it. better gameplay,better music,more content that will want more than you play or afford, like an ferrari.. The campaign requires you to think, and is inventive itself.. not just a mindless platformer. The community levels are almost too varied, and leaning towards short multiplayer games. But it has plenty of long platformer levels by the community nonetheless. Creation tools are intuitive and simple, but manage to cover huge ground, and I feel overwhelmed by that part of the game. The campaign is still worth 20$ if you're intrigued, and it's fun to explore the creative capabilities of others (plenty of search options/filters to find some good levels). Examples of small multiplayer games: Basketball, tank war, minigolf, race, pool.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is probably one of the greatest games ever created. This charming puzzle platformer has sooo much going for it. It has great visuals, improved gameplay over the original, and there is just so much more to do. Perfect game.... 10/10. I'm not interested in the storyline of the LBP franchise (although it can be fun) but that the level creator has the tools for you to make just about anything you want with the ability to publish and create alongside 4 friends. It has a vast range of technology for you to get your head around giving you the opportunity to create what you desire and how you want it to function. If you do not feel you want to create there is always the huge range of community made levels. I do not know how many there are now, from what I know there was 3,000,000 just from the original LittleBig planet (not all of which are all good. Many have no effort or are just copies). These levels range from others creations, great storylines, survivals, top down view, racing, attempts at a 1st/3rd person perspective, short films and sometimes even a full well made movie. If you feel creative, this will definitely be the game for you.. The first LBP was the worst game on PS3, not much has changed in the second. In case you're wondering why I bought the second, I didn't, a friend did and I played to do him a favor. A huge favor it was and he will never be able to repay it.. Hello pkillerx again. And I'm here to tell about the strengths and flaws *pkillerx style* The flaws of this game is the most important thing to discuss *pkillerx style*! (Most **** MM/controller throwing/piss raged flaw) 1. MMs Updates: Seriously MM?! OMG! The latest update for LBP2, you guys let in a new, ultra fu**tastic glitch in your OWN game. You LBP2 invisible Hologram/ Sticker Panel+ Logic lovers know what I'm talking about. :3 No matter how many times you glue the damn Holographic/ Sticker Panel object together and then Copy it to the Goodies Bag, before you send it out and move it, 1-2 parts fu**ing detach from the rest of the damn object and when you send it out, the detached part is somehow STILL connected to the damn object! D:( Causes: 1) Usually if you place a Microchip onto the invisible object and put a lot of logic into the microchip. -_- 2) To many Holograms to make one weapon you dream of creating. 2. Game freezes WAAAAAY to often. ):( Causes: 1) Slice & Dice 2) Joining someone when they launch into a level... 3) Multiplying objects... 4) Failing to connect to players (another major flaw) 5) Mid. game freezes... 6) Sending out objects... 7) Taking photos... 8) Saving objects... 9) Join in-sessions... 10) Loading levels... AND MORE! 3. The Server: C'mon MM why do you have to give us a sh***y server that we can BARELY connect to?! Wth just wth man? -_- And that's all the flaws I find. Everything else is fantastic.. The game itself is not bad, but when it comes to online mode, this is awful. LBP2 has the worst community I've ever seen in my life. It's so painful to see how **** the immature users are. The community consists mainly of copiers, tryhard trolls, emos and Thus, most of the here players are social rejects, and all they do is play LBP day and night. Oh, yeah, and the moderation team is also disgusting. You can get banned for literally nothing. If you're going to play this game, I recommend you not getting in touch with the community at all costs. Thanks.. The haters are pretty much people who are only scratching the surface of this game. They pretty much just play the story mode, then have a little play with creative then spit out their hate on this game. One guy said the creative mode wasn't for kids! I have seen plenty of levels that were obviously made by kids. One was a film of sonic and his friends, and was pretty decent. Anyway, to the game itself. This game shows how absolutely random things explode, dissolve, or even melt into a chunky liquid, fly across the level in one second, remake a classic, and even ride a bee, that shoots blue circles, to say the least.. This game deserves an 11 for how great it is. The whole idea is amazing and they executed it perfectly. In the first LBP there was some pretty major flaws. MediaMolecule saw these flaws and fixed them, but not in an update, but in a new game. The new addition of Sackbots helped the idea of actual films in the game, which is the beauty of it. You can literally make a game in a game in a game. There have been even Sackified versions of critically acclaimed masterpieces such as Mortal Kombat inside this game. Renditions of Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Metal Gear Solid, Dead Space, Slender, all of these have been done and have been done greatly. You don't even need to question it, but LittleBigPlanet 2 is easily one of the best games created.. If you've ever liked to make or play simple video games (called 'levels) that do not necessarily have huge complexity, LittleBigPlanet 2 should be enough for every single gamer EXCEPT those demoniacally attached first-person shooter children. While 60% of the multiplayer portion of the game features complete uncreative content, you shouldn't be alarmed- there ARE things in there everyone should be willing to try.. I gave a 9 to LittleBigPlanet for the simple fact that it doesn't have the sackbots that LittleBigPlanet 2 has, but not just in that aspect LittleBigPlanet 2 beats LittleBigPlanet, it is more challenging, more possibilities, it is a real improvement of game. Perfect 10 because now you can really do everything in this game, including other sackboys.. I think I may have played this game more than any other. Its incredibly addicting, has a gargantuan amount of content, and, thanks to the internet, it has content for every age group. It actually makes you feel like a game designer.. The funniest part of this game is creating. I have made in total around 70 levels with almost 2 hours of gameplay on each one. You can create almost any kind of 2D level as you want and you can play on them online or offline with your friends up to 4 players or maby both of them together if you want. In total, the players created over 4 million levels together and every one of them are stored in the huge community available for you to play. The story are fun and sometimes hard. If you are an creative person or know one this is the ultimate game for you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the most enjoyable multiplayer games on the PlayStation console and you can play it with anyone, kids and non-gamers as well. Lots of improvements on the first game as well, many more game types.. It is what it is. A good game for what it is. I found it as a pretty good stress reliever because how cute it was. I did a little bit of everything main stories, created levels, multiplayer; so I got a pretty good feel for it, except for creating own levels I might do it in the future). However if you're used to blowing people's head off/sports game's/ competitive in general, than this game will get old on you quick. But this game represents what gaming should be, just play it for fun.. It's like modern Mario Bros. Seriously but with way better graphics, a hell of lot more time spent and most of all, gameplay that's for everyone. Even the most douchiest of aholes with play this game and enjoy it. The single player campaign in LBP2 is much improved over the past iteration's attempt. Offering new power ups and a solid narrative added on. The real meat of the game consists of the user created levels, which is also a vast improvement over the original LBP. Not only can you create platformers now, but side scrolling shooters, FPS or virtually anything else you can imagine. As a whole this is a game well worth the cost of admission, that will keep you coming back again and again.. The games creativity, humor, and voice acting make for a wonderful experience. If you aren't a big fan of the PS3, this game might change your mind about its line up. Shear brilliance!. Expands on what made the original great and, after you have finished with the main story, you have enough multiplayer content to last you the rest of your life. Its the adorable character, hilarious humor and overall outstanding polish that this game delivers that makes it the classic game it is. Also; develop your own video games on it!? Yes please.. For the second time, LittleBigPlanet has seemed to have been worth my money. They got it all from me. After my review on the first one, I looked back at the LittleBigPlanet 2 story when I played it, and I was tied to say which one was better. They were both amazing. I highly recommend this game for parents in want to get their kids a ""child-friendly"" game. This game is completely child-friendly, and user-friendly. It is not all that hard to learn the controls of the game, and it has a very fun story and mulitplayer mode for both a single player, two players, three players, four players! An entire family worth of fun! Take turns battling it out in ""tic-tac-toe"" with your kids, or with your parents. It is such a fun game to play. Highly recommended.. You just can't hate Sackboy! He is just so cute and adorable. We loved him in the first game, which brought a unique experience to the PlayStation 3, and LittleBigPlanet 2 does that even better by giving you the ability not just to create platformer games, but anything you can think of. The tools and stickers from the first game are all transferred here, which makes you feel like home when you return to the game again. With a buzzing community, with all types of different levels being published every day, it is impossible to say you are done with this game! There is something new to do everyday. The story mode is more developed this time around, but create mode can still be tricky to newcomers. The Move support is also appreciated as it can show that Sony's motion controller can be easily used in a game like this. If you liked the previous game or you want a unique experience on the PlayStation 3 that all the family can enjoy, then you should definitely try this one.. After having played the first one, which over-exceeded my expectations ten fold, I had a lot more expectations for this one. This improved significantly from the first game, having better pacing, greater level design, extremely fun coop with inventive mini games in between, and it had a more cinematic approach which was a pleasant surprise. All in LBP is a great platformer and great coop game. There are some control issues but you get used to it, especially if you've played the first one, which has the same controls. However, with the introduction of the jetpack it does tend to help out with this limitation. Another big issue for me was the length. It was a bit on the short side, but there are some awesome community levels worth checking out.. This is a ""create your own"" type of game that has an excellent storyline, improving greatly over the original title. You can also play online in other people's creations with tons of different people. This game definitely deserves a ten out of ten. An absolute delight to play that I regularly return to. LittleBigPlanet 2 keeps all the charm of the original game while adding a whole host of new creation tolls which really expand the scope of levels which can be created. The single-player is once again short but sweet, but the community content will keep you coming back for a long, long time.. This game is pretty much just like when Mario Bros 2 came out. It was still fun, but when people thought of Mario Bros, they would think about the first one. LBP 2 is mostly a huge DLC of LBP 1. The graphics are slightly improved, but to be honest I think they simply added more contrast and lighting and that's it. I believe this game is still revolutionary even though it is the second opus. The improved logic makes it possible to create almost any","if you are looking for a platforming game to get a child into gaming, this is the one . all the characters were unique, interesting and funny . the levels were, yet again, made in the upgraded Create Mode . sad that the servers are down now, but the story mode and DLCs are literally so good that they're enough for me to enjoy the game ."
203.Microsoft Flight Simulator,"This simulator is a perfect, 1:1 scale of the entire world as we know it. All airports, and even airstrips that aren't federally registered are included to the fullest, even being able to depart and embark to and from them. The engine scale is also accurate to real life. Not only are the plane speeds accurate, but there are even real-time weather events.. Looks good but my PC can't handle the game since it's very demanding. Overall pretty cool!. got bored mid flight so i crashed in the ocean. 10/10 game, also i think other people did not realize that you fly planes in a flight simulator game, and that flights take long times. did they not read the words ""Flight Simulator""?. Good game but I have no idea how it got a 91. It's fun, it's relaxing, that's really all you're going to get out of it. The planes are way too expensive, like seriously I can get the whole Hitman series for cheaper than yet another Boeing. Also, as someone who has experience wasting said money, don't buy ANYTHING from Mscenery, even if it looks good.. Ok, so let's start with things i like on it: 1. Graphics-the best grapics i have ever sawin a comp. game all Now what i don't like: 1. Comparing this to X-Plane 11 the physics are insanely bad 2. The autopilot is very unrealistic 3. The ATC wold rather make you crash than land 4. It has so many bugs (for example the sometimes it just puts your thrust in idle, turns off electrical systems or just puts full flaps when you don't wan't them) 5. You need to buy anoter like 100 addons and another 100 mods to make it at least a little realistic. 6. Three airliners without addons is a very poor choice 7. Addons are maybe realistic, but they are more expensive than the entire game 8. Airports don't even have the right parking stands So please, if you want this game, first of all try it at comp. of someone, who alredy has it. If you don't know anybody like that than trust me and go buy X-Plane.. I love this game, playing in a real size map! on the other hand you need a crappy PC to have a smooth experience, it's very regrettable and that's why I stopped playing.. Kinda Bad.. The sim is very good indeed but there is tons of bugs, deformated maps(Dissapearing taxiway markings at CDG). When i was at TO/GA phase the throttle itself reduced to IDLE automatically(Not Autothrottle) when i tried to put back to TO/GA, it didn't work(i can't even move throttle's) In conclusion, wasted money...... 4 hours in the game, still done nothing at all as nothing is possible. Bugs after bugs after bugs, and I was hoping to be spared of such such a poorly made game/sim after waiting 4 years. I honestly have encountered so much issues that i have not flown a plane yet in 4 hours of the game being launched. That also prevent me from returning it ( but that is mainly because of Microsoft predatory practices with the download like Final Fantasy Online.) I have no idea how good the sim actually is, there is so much bad UI and BAD menu and no good way to just select a strip or an airport or anything where you can take off and fly. So much more to say but I will stop here.. One of the best game of the world if you love planes or want to be a pilot this is the game for you can play it on pc or Xbox whit game pass so realistic one of the best game. It is a scam do not buy! They abanoned it illegally false marketing and buggy mess, not worth anything not a single penny!. Great flight sim. I enjoyed every flight lesson, but lost some interest after completing them. The top gun maverick activities were also fun.. I can't even get this game to install on the Series X. As far as I can tell, almost nobody can since one of the more recent updates, and nothing appears to be done about it. What's insane about this is the fact that this is a Microsoft product, developed by Microsoft, and released on Microsoft platforms with self contained Microsoft products, and they cannot manage to create an installer that works. People say great things about this game, but those are only the minority of people who can apparntly get the game to install. It's one thing for an installer to have problems on a PC, but for the Xbox Series X to be unable to install a Microsoft game is, I repeat again, absolutely insane. The fact that Microsoft isn't doing anything about this, apparently doesn't care at all, is even more baffling. How many people downloaded all 170GB of this game to their Xbox before they realized it's totally unplayable, and the closed system of the Xbox prevents them from interfering and manually forcing the game to install correctly? Apparently a lot, based on the tanking review scores. Absolutely pathetic, Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for this.. A MASTERPIECE AND A PERFECT 10 Make sure your PC meets the minimum requirements or get it on an Xbox. Also, make sure your internet is not performing like it's from the Paleolithic Era. It's simple really, don't complain about something you can control. Read some of those negative review bombs and ask yourself if they came from a place of sanity and rationalization. Best flight simulation on the market! Period!. I guess if I hadn't played DCS, this would have been amazing. But I have played DCS and it makes this Microsoft Flight ""Simulator"" feel like cheap plastic. I love certain elements of MSFS. I love the graphical wonders achieved, the realism and scope of the world we live in, and also the live weather system. But damn it the entire thing feels as clunky as can be. And to be honest, the live weather system and satellite mapping are novelties that aren't likely to keep you all that interested for long. I flew around my hometown of Seattle/Everett; that was cool. What do I do now? I went to a couple of places I wanted to see but that was that. What do I do now exactly? The entire experience is not even close to being optimized. DCS is made by a small developer, I give them a pass for the numerous issues they have. Microsoft, a mega corp, makes this flight sim and I just don't understand how it has so many little issues. I compare the camera system, the high fidelity controls, the actual flight simulation, and other things to DCS and MSFS just fails on everything. Again, it's super clunky. The only two things that MSFS beats DCS in are landscape visuals and the fact that you can fly airliners. Which, DCS could easily do and it would do it far better, but they are focused on military applications. Bottom line, if you want a flight sim, it's DCS. If you already have DCS, get this and you will get a bit of fun out of visiting places across the world. I didn't appreciate how truly special DCS is until I played MSFS. PS: There is maybe one white dude you can use as your avatar in MSFS. I'm not even sure if he is white to be honest. There are 20 avatars and us white devils can't even get one. So, it's just spitting in my face. I'm sorry that white men enjoy and are good at flying planes Microsoft. The commercial airlines are racially discriminating against white men in hiring for pilots.....that actually matters. Not sure what Microsoft is trying to accomplish with their crappy social engineering.. expectation: a realistic graphics with a beautiful views. real game: 10 minutes loading in city, 15 FPS on medium settings, issues with starting a game, worst graphics i've ever seen, can't find difference between flying above los angeles and russia lol. My pc isn't very powerful but that is a real **** There is no optimization at all. Mountains from trailers is very nice but in game at ultra settings it's just worser than games from 2004. P.S. This game bugged as f uck i just loaded a map try'd to fly and engine stops by itself. I hate this game. Microsoft Flight Simulator is just good especially if you use a yoke or a joystick. however, if you attempt to use an Xbox Controller then I recommend you to have a YOKE!. Within the first six hours, I already realized that this is the best loading simulator 10/10. We are not talking about a video game, but about real life. MFS is the game (it hurts me to call it a game) that got my passion for planes off the ground. One of the most beautiful games ever conceived that practically dragged the whole world into a video game, including unfortunately a few bugs, maybe even too many, but the game is too complete, and it is impossible not to give it a grade close to 10.. Microsoft Flight Simulator is a technological breakthrough. The graphics are incredible and this, combined with the ability to explore the entire world with incredible accuracy, makes Flight Simulator a true next-gen product.. Microsoft Flight Simulator is simply incredible. This game is a stunning example of what modern technology can accomplish in terms of creating realistic and immersive experiences. Firstly, the graphics are simply breathtaking. The level of detail in the world is truly astonishing, from the landscape to the cities and landmarks. Flying over cities like New York, Paris, or Tokyo is an experience like no other, as you can see every building, street, and park in stunning detail. The weather effects, from cloud formations to storms, are also incredibly realistic and add to the overall immersion. The range of planes available in the game is also impressive, from small single-engine planes to commercial airliners like the Airbus Flybywire or Fenix A320neo and PMDG Boeing 737-8. Each plane is modeled in precise detail, with authentic cockpit instruments and controls that make it feel like you're actually flying the real thing. But what really sets Microsoft Flight Simulator apart is the attention to detail in every aspect of the game. The game uses real-world data to create a virtual replica of the entire planet, including airports, navigation aids, and even the positions of the stars in the sky. This attention to detail means that you can plan and execute realistic flights, following real-world flight plans and procedures. Overall, Microsoft Flight Simulator is an incredible achievement that sets a new standard for realism and immersion in gaming. If you're a fan of flight simulators, or just looking for an amazing experience, this game is an absolute must-play.. I tought I would never give a game a 10 because that would suggest that a game is perfect and no game is perfect. Flight simulator is also not perfect. But i still give it a 10 because (especially the VR version) is a milestone and quantum leap in gaming design. With the entire real world recreated in virtual reality. With stunning visuals. The sound tracks are also amazing and really capture the dream of flight. There is support for a lot of controllers. They kept coming with free updates. With VR support and helicopters as the greatest extras. It toke a while till the VR version was playable at acceptable framerates. But reaching a new milestone in something that is never an easy process. Flight simulator recreated the entirew world into VR and thats a milestonre like the first flight of the Concorde or the first drive of the Bugatti Veyron. And they made it. Thats why I give it a 10. What annoyed me is that many free updates are mandatory updates that you are forced to do. Some are many gigabytes in size. So sometimes I wanted to play but had to downlaod an update over an hour long. After that hour I had to do something else so couldnt play at all. Like said by others I also experienced some problems with the servers during downloads. But that problem looks solved now.. If we look at it as a normal game, it could not be more than a simple boring game with no action, but the game delivers what it promises, it feels so good to fly freely in the sky.. Download loop forever on the worst download client ever! Didn't even play the game, couldn't play the game even. Buggy mess do not buy.. I loved this game a lot and had a lot of time enjoying it. The realism and graphics are amazing, even on low and medium. I loved doing long IFR flights in small and big planes. I also loved the realistic scale and the live weather feature. There is only a small problem because sometimes the game crashes, but this is not that much of a problem now as it was before. I love the updates and it keeps me interested, especially the 40th anniversary update. I really recommend this game to anyone who can buy it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. At E3 2018, an simulator of my favorite genre appeared before my eyes Microsoft flight simulator volume cloud, live weather, live map. it can be boring for some gamers . and its like 120 gb , you download launcher and then you download the actual game. MSFS 2020 is a must play for any aviation enjoyer. Althoght the system requierments are way too high Gameplay: 5/10: Exciting in the first 5 miniutes. Get a book during crusing altitude though. Visuals: 52/10: :O Price: Only if its on sale DLC?: Market place is okay Plane Selection: Okay. Would like some more jets System Requirements: Absurd. Don't waste your time on this game. Installing this piece of sh*** is a real nightmare. Thank god I did not buy it and just tried it as part of the game pass. For some bizarre reason devs decided to place only an 1 gb installer in the MS store. The installer downloads fine but once you start the game it demands another 150 GB download, which is ok by today's standards. but the problem is that it is hosted on some cheapass server that can't produce decent speeds outside of the US, so if you are in Europe or god forbid anywhere else in the rest of the world, you will get 10 Mbit ( yes megabit, not megabyte) download speed. and this crap is specific to MFS servers. the rest of the games from the MS store can be downloaded just fine. All the forums are full of such complaints form day 1 and developers are ignoring the problem.. This game and support is a joke. With my high end pc and 300mb internet downloading the game with 6 mbit max. Tried all the given solutions on internet but no succes. Its a shame ms and asobo don’t do anything about it. Bye bye gamepass.. 100 gb shovelware, the download reseting or something it were on 80% then i left it for an hour and then it become 50% after i come back thank microsoft for wasting half of my monthly bandwith for nothing. most overrated and most boring game of all time, game crashes every 15 min, the graphics aren't that great, it's overhyped by fanboys!. Ru / Russian Federation Good afternoon, This product was purchased at the end of 2021, at its full cost. Since 07.03.22, it has stopped running in my region. The question arises of the integrity of the fulfillment of Microsoft's obligations. This situation concerns thousands of buyers. It turns out that a global company openly steals funds from its own customers. I am not happy with this situation! On 08.03.22, Microsoft did not clarify the situation and the product is still unavailable for launch! Thank you, With warmest regards, Leonid Upd: The product is available for launch again. Article 1 The Sea Calls To Us All Everyone is welcome on the Sea of Thieves regardless of age, gender, male, sexuality, nationality or creed.. Guys, this is the warning about Microsoft policy. I'm living in Russia and I don't approved the war with Ukraine. However, I faced with locking of already buyed deluxe edition Microsoft Fligth Simulator in Steam. I want to warn you, that this may happen and with you if you born in wrong nation/race/gender. I never buy any Microsoft's product and I better pay to Sony or Nintendo. F*** you, Microsoft!. They lost me when after painfully long installation i discovered, that they didn't bother providing even basic profile for my Virpil hotas. Seriously, i wasn't even able to finish first tutorial because the game instructed me to use some button on a device which wasn't configured, and there was no walkaround for this problem.. Be warned that its a simulator and not a ""fun"" game. Do NOT get it on console as it lacks mod support compared to the PC version. definitely would of liked to see a campaign and being to be able to level up and buy different planes.. When you buy the game it doesn't say anything about a big download.. But then when you enter it you have to wait like a day for all of it to download. Then you have huge updates which take hours to download. I waited 31 hours! Waste of my time. an amazing game with really good graphics, so realistic and it really simulate a plane. Microsoft Flight Simulator is a technical showcase for what is the future of video games is gonna look like.. Not a fan of this series, a common man. Seems like a nice time killer to play like an arcade, nothing more. A huge lack of content (meaning tasks, cities, planes, etc.). The work on making a whole planet accessible for flights is great, but glitches and stubborn mechanics give you a mediocre experience.. Game just crashes and crashes. Installer has huge issues that prevent an enormous amount of people from playing. These two gamebreaking aspects come on top of a huge list of bugs that never seem to be fixed even though Asobo Studio keeps marking things as fixed. I would have given this game some hope if only Asobo Studio had acknowledged all the issues, but instead they have dismissed them as rare. Every patch released seems to break or degrade something, and things never seem to get any better. The game had potential, but due to the terrible development process we've seen the last year, I don't rate it very highly. If I could only play the game (which I can't due to CTDs), I would score it 5/10. Since I can't even play it, it gets ZERO.. Ya it ain't that good. Only fun is watching your house but thats pretty much it.... I love it how the developers are working on the Flight Sim. With the newest update it became better framerates so my 2080ti and 3800x can run with 60fps now on 1440p. The devs are implementing new things for free, the community builds more and more realistic airplanes or other stuff. Best words for this is - breathtaking beauty. Sure , you have to learn and play the tutorials before flying ""good"" but damn its worth every single cent of the money. i like to play it for the next few years! :3 :3 :3 thank you for this !. The game doesn't even work. For 70usd, you literally get nothing in return. It's fun when it's working. But the software is just too unstable. If you like donating money to a game developer or you like to buy vaporware, this is a game for you. Otherwise, don't buy it.. Absolutely breathtaking flight sim. There are some technical issues but I'm confident they will get fixed. It's a photorealistic world, especially for bush flying and GA. Have not had this much fun in a sim for ages. The weather system is great too. The flight model feels alive but does need some tuning to not be too jumpy.. LOL This game is so f***** **** bro. The most boring game ever, 90% of the players will fall asleep in the middle of the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As surprised as I am that this game can even run on a console. It most certainly is a beautiful game regardless of being at 30fps.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love this game. Lost myselt across the clouds is so good ! This game allowed me like the aviation. I'm newby on MFS 2020 and I can easily lift off a plane! All people can play MFS 2020 ! I have a Ryzen 5600X CPU and a RTX 2060 GPU with 32Gb ram and I can play in High and 30fps. I think I will buy a new configuration PC for play in Ultra 60fps ^^' I WANT MONEY :'(. I've got an actual Sport Pilot (entry-level pilot) license last year, now working towards my Private Pilot exam (next tier) and so I can compare playing this game with flying real single-engine light aircraft. This is first and foremost - a flight simulator, most useful for training/practice piloting real aircraft. It doesn't have typical ""game"" elements per se, and some might find it lacking in that regard. But that would be pretty absurd. I've used X-Plane for practicing flights before, but since MSFS-2020 was released - I believe it's the best realistic flight simulator for actual pilot practice/training to this day, one likely soon-to-be FAA-certified for official simulator pilot training at flight schools. Both the terrain, and aircraft modelling - is truly next-gen, orders above what the Global Scenery package of X-Plane-11 offers in terms of world fidelity! This simulator is so realistic that there are only a few things to nitpick about: Of course, in the dense city streets the auto-generated geometry is messy and ugly - so you might not be able to just land on the street because it's not as flat as one might think. Occasionally - a runway on one of the autogen airports would have a geo ""step"" right accross the middle of it (El Monte / KEMT is one such example) - making it impossible to use. Also - the way it's distributed - through the Microsoft Store - is a bit buggy, and it requires the latest Windows updates to run. I'm strongly suspecting this had to do with Microsoft's less-than-honest politics rather than true engineering requirement of this game. As a software engineer - I've never encountered a program which would outright require the latest OS update to run, nor can I understand how such a requirement might naturally arise. So that's Microsoft using every excuse to get users to update their OS. System requirements... well, let's just say that flying this simulator is cheaper than flying a real aircraft :-) It is a beast and it does require a might PC to run at acceptable performance. That said - the amount and fidelity of the terrain does justify every bit of it. You gotta realize it's streaming real-world data, not hand-optimized gameworld assets - and putting together the world dynamically as you fly around. And - at pretty damn good fidelity at that. Some less popular aircraft models have flaws, for instance the DA-40 versions lack a constant speed prop (the handle is there in the cockpit, but it's non interactable). End up being as slow as a 172 due to also reduced power. What else... seaplanes are a bit of an afterthought, and water landings are rather simplified, both graphically and by feel. What else... eh, there was a bug where some button in the weather planner became inactive, and needed to be fixed by alt-tabing out and back into the sim. Possibly fixed by now. I'd really give it a 10 but I'm a bit I don't wanna be seen as a fanboy and I do admit it has a typical Microsoft wrapper around the neat package, that kinda sours the overall experience a bit, and it's not 100% bug-free, but no major bugs that I've found so far.. if you're a die hard flight simulator, I guess you already own that game and saved up some money to boost your PC. I play on a Ryzen 5900X with an RTX3090 with 64 GB of RAM and a laser fast SSD NVME 5GB/S with a 10gbit/s Fiber connection and well, I can say the game is just incredible, it is both very accessible with the assists and both challenging technically close to a pro simulator. The Radio Traffic is bringing some much immersion and graphically in Ultra this game is a master piece. Some cockpit shines with ludicrous amount of details. Best Flight Sim ever and the map size is just the world so can't really complain. Well done Asobo. And they keep pourring in new content. Only issue is the installation setup is awkward and slow installing windows and office is faster than installing FS.. Dear Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft Flight Simulator Deluxe Bundle costs more than subsistence minimum in my country in 2021(Ukraine). 1 point because this game allows me to play this game. And another point because content in this game actually exists. What score did you expected from me? Am i angry? — Yes. Do i hope Xbox Game Studios will see this? — No.. EDIT: downgrade to 7/10 because there are missing certain features for hardcore simmers: - toolbar menu is gone when loading a saved flight...seriously??? - satellite map missing - only a vector map that does not even show the world - change plane during flight only possible via a ""developer menu"" ... seriously? - Slew Mode is horrible - change location during flight only only possible via a ""developer menu"" ... seriously? This simulator has GREAT potential but still has some childhood diseases. I would rate 10/10 if the above issues are solved. ----------------------------------- Since the Flight Simulator 4, back in the 90s, I have been waiting for something like this. And now this dream has become true. Incredible what they achieved here. This is a true ""next generation"" of flight simulation. - The whole world with all buildings - Incredible weather effects - Good frame rates - Realistc flight decks - Realistic sound - Real world air traffic - Road traffic - Thousands of trees on the ground - All airports of the world I am sure there will be plenty of professional aircraft coming out in 2021/22 so that we can fly the FSLabs A320 or the Aerosoft planes. Can't wait! The foundation is already made with this masterpiece of a flight sim!. A visionary, landmark release that's built with the long haul in mind. It will take a while for PC hardware to catch up with the game's potential, but despite some early technical turbulence the experience remains dazzling.. It is a great use of modern technology, but it is not without its flaws. I truly believe that the flaws will be fixed. It is a great use of your money and more importantly time.. This game is a buggy mess. Each update adds more and more issues and the game has been unplayable with sub-10fps for a majority of users (myself included) due to a bug that was included in the latest World/Sim update. Complaints about this bug are censored on their official forums, and the developers have hardly acknowledged it, mostly blaming the users configuration.. As someone that grew up playing & loving FSX, I've become increasingly angry & annoyed with MSFS since it's launch unfortunately. We all bought this game/sim, knowing it would be an improving product, knowing the core sim was (supposedly) in place with more content/features/improvements to be added in future. But 7 months after launching, barely any meaningful progress has occurred, few fixes have been implemented, future outlined progress is incredibly slow, constantly being pushed back & with each update the sim get's broken & downgraded in some way further delaying updates whilst they try to fix it. It's just not good enough.. ""Flight simulator"" is false advertising, it's actually Download simulator. First I downloaded the game from MS Store - fine. But then there is the in-game download centre which asks you to download additional 150 GiB... At 20 Mbit/s on average! So I wasted 2-3 days on that. Then comes lvl 3 - Content manager, through which you download the world updates at the same 20 Mbit/s. So 4 days later I could finally admire the world of the game in an 8-hour sightseeing flight, appreciate the fascinating vistas, true-to-life towns and landscapes and relax to the beauty of local nature, while experiencing the new vivid and believeable flight model, which is a real joy for your hands. Until they released a 55-GiB update when I was 1 hour away from my goal and ruined my evening. I couldn't possibly download it until I went to bed, so I continued in the morning and... The game required a COMPLETE re-download, and said there wasn't enough disk space (because all the packages were already there). And then, of course, came a world updates redownload, the 55 GiB didn't have the new world update within it. And then my Game Pass ran out.. It's a real masterpiece. Such a eye-catching graphic. Variety of airplanes. It's like an art. I haven't played the game. I'm only scoring it becouse of the bad review bombing this game has.. This game can't even get its download to work properly. When you forgot to remove community folder contents, the download would stuck in a loop forever.. A major turn off for me was the 2-3 minute long loading screens. Other than that It's enjoyable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. How is this game topping CK3 on The Game Awards? That's a disgrace that they are even in one category.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is the only one of its kind, and my god is it beautiful. soaring over landscapes you never thought possible is powerful. never before have i seen so many circle crop farms hidden between majestic mountains!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A well-designed map for viewing landscapes as well as an amazing study of aero liners and simulation of the game that makes this game a step higher than its predecessors) Thanks!. Truly amazing game. Going around the world via FS2020 during Covid-19 means a lot to many people. lots of bugs and the download method is a minus.. Better than it's predecessors designed to the last detail the world is fascinating for its real beauty even in the sky on large lines of flight. Graphics and controls are perfect for real simulators.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Please, FIX THIS GAME. The game is a masterpiece, it's absolutely amazing, the first next-gen game, but, it's totally unplayable. It crashes all the time, it closes alone and sometimes it doesn't even load. At least I paid only 1€ for the Game Pass.. I feel really pity for those who can't request a refund on Steam because the game already took the 2 hours only downloading itself.. I purchased this for $119 and am extremely disappointed. The aircraft are not maneuverable at all. Do not waste your money on FS2020. What a piece of garbage.. On the surface, this is an incredible achievement and a glorious experience. Graphically, an immense step up from previous simulators, using Bing Maps and Azure technology to stream in near-photo realistic surrounds in the game, with live weather, live aircraft, etc. Although the game takes quite a beefy rig to play, when you do find yourself in the thick of things you will be consistently taken aback by how beautiful the game can be. Your first flight and first few experiences will be breathtaking, whimsical, and exhilarating. Then, the honeymoon phase will wear off. The more you learn about the aircrafts provided in game, the more you learn the avionics systems and how to actually pilot these planes, the more frustrated you will become. Glitches are rampant. It can be from something annoying, like having to press a button 20 times in a row to get it to turn on, to something game breaking, like engine failures, autopilot crashing you to the ground, or autopilot not letting you follow your course. I haven't even scratched the surface, but the two main planes I personally enjoy flying are just disastrous. They hardly work in their current state and I think it would be fair that most people would deserve a full refund. That coupled with the fact that Asobo is knowingly and admittedly rushing out patches and continuing to break more and more things in the game with each patch, your frustration will just increase that much more. The phrase, ""one step forward, two steps back"" certainly applies here. When I find a workaround for a bug in game, I'm only met with another. I'm not a game developer, and while like most people I realize that modern-day publishers force developers to rush development, it's just not acceptable in the realm of reality to push broken patches and break the game in such a manner, especially when said company doesn't really do hotfixes. So while this is a technically impressive game, beautiful, serene at times when it works, I cannot give this a good score. I can't even give it a 5, a mediocre. I want to say it's fantastic, but it just doesn't **** work. That's a damn shame. I know they will eventually fix it, but given the way things are going, it's going to be a long time. I'd prefer to actually fly my planes properly on the product I purchased sooner than later. It would be unrealistic for a game of this complexity and sco","""flight simulator"" is a perfect, 1:1 scale of the entire world as we know it . all airports, and even airstrips that aren't federally registered are included . looks good but my PC can't handle the game since it's very demanding ."
204.Guitar Hero,"The one that started them all, the memories of this and the next titles are special to me. I appreciate the concept this game started but yeah, this one is pretty bare. The setlist is also one of the weakest in my opinion, though anytime I hear ""Smoke on the Water"" I get mad so it could be that.. Great game, an absolute innovator, spoiled by future games having slightly tighter controls, but still an overall enjoyable experience to go back to.. This game literally changed my life. I played this game so much when I was a teenager. It was the best part of my life. Guitar Hero, GTA VC, various PC games. What a lovely era to be alive.. Know what's cool? Playing actual guitar. Glad to see this fad has died off.. It doesn't have enough of the very popular rock, or metal, but it does have a handful of hidden gems to be discovered. I do respect this entry a lot, for it is the very first in the series, and creates a gameplay foundation so fun, challenging and iconic that still remains very influential these days. I wish, though, there was a way to make some extra cash with the bonus songs in the career mode, instead of repeating the base ones. I know, I know it's fun to repeat them, and eventually master them, but I'm just sayin' there's no reason to block income from bonus tracks. Having them pay us for playing them would actually encourage such attempts. The career mode is very simplistic, but functional and fun; it doesn't really feature any endings or cutscenes like future games, though. The unlockables are nothing special except for the bonus tracks you can unlock. Other than that, there are just cosmetics and new guitars and character, which is... nice. GUITAR HERO built something to be remembered, and eventually, upgraded into much better installments. I do recommend you give it a try; there are some fun songs to be ""rock n' roll'd"".. Very revolutionary game, never liked rhythm games before, but guitar hero with rock and metal concept made me fall in love, perfect gameplay, and cool songs. great concept, poor execution. this is great as a casual party game, with many iconic rock songs. but as a rhythm game, the engine leaves much to be desired. Great game with an awesome tracklist and in-game venues! Awesome controller as well however, it's not original a game in Japan developed this controller originally during generation 5. The patent had just ended for it around the time this game was developed.. Innovating for its time, but fun to play nowadays. This game simply revolutionized video game's story. Although having same mechanics and being very looking like its successor, GH2 would get better and expansive in playing mods and bringing more songs and more fun.. This game opened my mind to a lot of different rock music and was a very innovative game at the point of release. Well the game is fun, but the song list is kinda week. It could have been better, like the Rock Band one, that was way better. Still is a good game and I really enjoyed it.. This game is pretty good. I am reviewing this at a time where guitar hero has been bankrupted. The venues in this game are maybe the best ever. The music has great picks but then you have all covers where on Killer Queen its off key, Take Me Out the guy sounds creepy at times and Steller has a weird starting. This game is worth a buy.","the setlist is also one of the weakest in my opinion . this is great as a casual party game, with many iconic rock songs . but as a rhythm game this is great as a casual party game, with many iconic rock songs ."
205.Slay The Princess - The Pristine Cut,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game deserved a lot more attention - It's a charming game that has a really good story and message.. Even after its original release, Slay the Princess is still a 9/10. Getting a console port and free expansion content makes it worthwhile!. Slay The Princess The Pristine cut is awesome I could only watch the game when it first came out because I only have a ps5 and now that I finally got the chance to play it I love it 10/10",Getting a console port and free expansion content makes it worthwhile . i could only watch the game when it first came out because i only have a ps5 .
206.World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King,"Yes, I gave years of my life to this game—years I’ll never get back—but Wrath of the Lich King is still the best game I’ve ever played. I know that’s a personal opinion, but at the time, it was exactly what we needed to be happy as young gamers. It’s not quite the same anymore, even with the return to the classics—it just doesn’t capture the magic it had in its prime.World of Warcraft is a game that truly changed the world, much like Facebook or the Internet did, but in the realm of gaming. It deserves to be written in golden letters in the history of gaming.. Excellent expansion that gave WoW a very different, more mature, look and the most story-driven experience.. WotLK is the best one of all the WoW for me, the story, the PvP, PvE, bustling community, thank you for the best gaming youth experience :). Marked a high point for many players with its rich storytelling and content, despite the beginning signs of weariness for some.. World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (WoTLK) is an unparalleled expansion that takes the legendary MMO to new heights. With its captivating storyline, refined gameplay mechanics, breathtaking locales, and innovative features, WoTLK achieves a perfect rating of 10/10, solidifying its place as one of the greatest expansions in gaming history. At the core of WoTLK lies the enthralling narrative surrounding the Lich King, one of the most iconic villains in World of Warcraft lore. The expansion builds upon the rich history established in previous iterations, immersing players in the chilling story of Arthas Menethil and his dark journey into darkness. The emotionally charged quests, epic cinematic moments, and unforgettable encounters with both old and new characters create a gripping and emotionally resonant narrative experience. WoTLK introduces the stunning new continent of Northrend, a frigid and foreboding frozen wasteland that pushes the boundaries of atmospheric world design. From the majestic Icecrown Citadel to the serene beauty of Grizzly Hills, each zone is meticulously crafted and teeming with life. The sense of scale and attention to detail in Northrend is awe-inspiring, providing players with a truly immersive and visually striking experience. In terms of gameplay, WoTLK refines and expands upon the core mechanics of World of Warcraft, offering a seamless and balanced playing experience. The introduction of the Death Knight class, with its unique rune system and dark powers, adds a fresh and exciting dimension to character creation and opens up new strategic possibilities. The addition of new dungeons and raids, including the challenging Ulduar and the climactic Icecrown Citadel, provide an endless stream of engaging content for players. One of the most significant innovations in WoTLK is the introduction of the ""Achievement"" system, which rewards players for completing various in-game milestones. This feature adds a layer of depth and replayability, as players can strive to unlock rare and prestigious achievements, enhancing their overall gaming experience. Additionally, the ""LFG"" (Looking for Group) tool streamlines the process of finding groups for dungeons and raids, facilitating smoother multiplayer experiences. The musical score of WoTLK is stunning, with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that perfectly captures the essence of the expansion. Composed by Russell Brower, Derek Duke, and Glenn Stafford, the music enhances the emotional impact of the storytelling and creates an immersive atmosphere that stays with players long after they have logged off. With its meticulous attention to detail, immersive storytelling, refined gameplay mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and an unforgettable musical score, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King deserves a perfect rating of 10/10. This expansion is a testament to the immense vision and dedication of the development team, and it stands as a timeless masterpiece within the MMO genre. Prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey into the frozen realms of Northrend and experience the epitome of World of Warcraft at its very best.. Pure childlike bliss that resides now, sadly, only in nostalgia.. By far my favorite World of Warcraft expansion, blew vanilla and bc out of the water imo. Had a very strong story and was a great conclusion to Warcraft 3.. This was by far my favorite expansion for World of Warcraft, it was the most story driven expansion out of all of them, and a great finale to Warcraft 3. The following expansions after this were pretty terrible aside Dragonflight where it seems to have peaked again in quality. Beware this game is all consuming and will destroy your life if you want to be competitive.. The absolute GOAT of MMORPG gaming. World of Warcraft found the perfect balance between being an RPG and an MMO at this point in it's life. The storytelling was done correctly, the new continue of Northrend looked great and was also incredibly efficient from a leveling perspective compared to The Burning Crusade and ""Vanilla"" WoW. The continuation of Arthas Menethil's story into the Lich King from Warcraft III made this expansion special for many. It gave plenty to do for the casual and hardcore players alike.. WotLK butchered WoW. All the philosophies implemented in this expansion, is ultimately what lead WoW on it's slow but steady decline: - Bring the Player, Not the Class: A train of thought that ultimately just made the Enhancement Shaman completely obsolete, being replaced entirely by the Death Knight (Which was just better in every way, except for Bloodlust/Heroism). Giving BL/Heroism to Mages, and later Hunters, making Shamans more or less obsolete, in general. - Looking for Group, which lead to Looking for Raid - Making traveling around the world at max level obsolete, and forever forcing you in groups with bad players, that you can't kick for the first 30 mins... Which is the entire dungeon. - Hero Classes, which by their very design core, is supposed to be overpowered. - Retconning of the lore in many, many major ways (No, Arthas, your power doesn't come from Frostmourne... It was only a tool, used to tempt you, and corruption you....) - ""Additional Instances Cannot Be Launched. Please Try Again Later."" - Downright broken balance between all the classes in PvP, until 6-12 months into the expansion (Patch 3.2+). - Far from optimal PvE balance, between the classes. - I hope you like grey and turquise, A LOT. - Phasing: A mechanic isolating players from each other completely in zones, in a multiplayer game. - Laughable easy PvE-content the first year of the game. When Ulduar finally hit, it was a challenging - Then it got nerfed 14 days after it got launched, becoming moderately easy, as well. - Ugliest uncommon and rare gear in the game's entire 20+ year history. - Combined Spell Damage and Spell Healing, into Spell Power, making Healers overpowered in PvP. - Gave Tanks a ridiculous amount of damage, making them top-damage in dungeons while leveling, and overpowered in PvP, at level 80. - Copy/paste of pre-existing things: Trolls -> Undead Trolls, Tauren -> Taunka, Naxx (40) -> Naxx (10/25), Murlok -> Gorloc (I could keep going). - Copy/paste of Norse Mythology, pretending to be original, by slightly modifying the God's names. Imbalanced gameplay, build around just rushing, brain-dead mechanics, and an awful story that has NOTHING to do with WC3, nor The Frozen Throne. This expansion scared away the vast majority of the original player base, and brought in a whole new generation of younger players (That, for the most parts, hadn't played WC3). These are mainly the players, who like this expansion - The ones who hadn't seen WoW, before this point. Only positive things I can say about this iteration of WoW, is that inscription is a cool profession, that Glyphs add a cool mechanic to the game. And that, abilities like Thunderstorm, are pretty fun and satisfying to use.. This game ****, you die 50 times before ever reaching level 20, its too difficult, pvp is unbalanced, terrible combat, mechanics, everything is so bad about World of Warcraft it should stop existing from earth. Honestly the first time i played it i was 12 years old, i cried in front of the boar, it made me have breakdowns, i had a terrible childhood, this game didn't make it better, today im 27 i still cry while playing it, its so bad, it makes you want to end your life.. Only WoW expansion I've ever played, reached level 80 and enjoyed everything from Icecrown. Great expansion.. I should point out that I play most of the time in PVP. Immediately it is clear that the developers absolutely do not give a **** about the balance of 2x2. Play all the classes in the arena at the expense of high skill will not work - because it's a patch for melee heroes... Constant food abuzz in the arena, skills that are cast through the wall, the effect of ""fear"" disappears with a delay of 2-3 seconds that is extremely critical in 2x2, the constant bugs with summons and a lot of other things that do not give a good game I played LIch King as a kid and was really looking forward to this patch, after 3 months of playing I realized how much of a piece of crap it is. Pvp in the game is almost killed. There is no interest or incentive to play the field of battle with the idiots that go in and stand afk (and there are so many), 2x2 - too much imbalance of some classes and fight sometimes simply does not make sense. About pvp in the open world... It's just not there, the server starts lagging if there are more than 10 enemy characters in the open world. In short In 2022 Blizza did as they always did and didn't surprise anyone. I was hoping that after more than 10+ years the game would be better or left as it was. But unfortunately no, it just got worse. PVE content in Lich King is designed for kids 8-10 years old, maybe even easier. Blizzar should realize that the kids $ 15 a month subscription will not pay and I wish they at least sometimes listened to the older players.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. Wotlk is my favorite expansion with legion. Northernland atmosphere, death knight class, perfect raids and dungeons...Only with one word it was legend.... This game has changed my life it's a masterpiece in 2008 and now it's a source of nostalgia and fun i can't describe it thank blizzard for making this game World of Warcraft and shame that it made the other expansions ""some of them"" look bad and make the community vanish little by little i hope this game keeps on going so my children play it ... and now i m playing the pre-patch and can't wait for the release. 10/10 I started playing in BC, but i was only 12 years old back then, so WotlK gave me the first raiding experience. Awesome quests, lore, locations, Incredible raids especialy Ulduar and ICC. Btw i got the 2010 achiev for clearing it, i hella did it, and only 1.60% of all guilds at that moment were capable of doing so. Outstanding job Blizzard!. Best WOW expansion of all time. Mainly because the story was around my fav character Arthas Menethil - since WC3.. Probably the most iconic WoW expansion. The most 'honed' version of the 'classic era' WoW and also the peak of whole World of Warcraft universe, finishing the story of Arthas Menethil, the once idealistic young paladin and a prince of Lordaeron... now a Lich King. Review (in pros/cons format): Pros: + visually satisfying zones in the new continent of Northrend + leveling/quest experience (including keeping the old feel of leveling in vanilla zones) + the option of 2 starting zones in Northrend (Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord) + relatively balanced PvP class design: every class and lot of specs were viable (after DKs were nerfed a bit) + relatively balanced PvE class design: every class was viable and felt unique (every class could add some unique useful buffs/spells to the raid) + One of the most iconic raids of the game happened to be in this expansion: Ulduar and ICC + every patch was a build up and preparation to attack the Icecrown Citadel and face the final villain: Arthas... the Lich King himself. + Wintergrasp: massive 120v120 open world battleground where you fight over the control of the Vault of Archavon: raid in which the boss can drop current PvE/PvP tier items.. + very alt friendly expansion (thanks to emblem system too) + talent system which gave a player an option to tune the class to their playstyle and made possible to create some fun specs + glyphs and inscription profession + some zones were changing depending on your quest progress (for example: Shadow's Vault quest line) Neutral points: Dungeon finder: While it enabled you to do dungeons you normally wouldn't do (mainly in vanilla + tbc), it also made you to interact less with other players Cons: - Patch 3.0: >overpowered Death Knight class (mainly in PvP) >lack of challenging raid content (Naxxramas, EoE were too easy) - later patches: >Trial of the Crusade (mainly normal difficulty) raid was easier than its previous tier (Ulduar) and made Ulduar irrelevant as ToC had same or better loot quality (such a shame, one of the best raids in history of WoW) >lack of challenging heroic dungeons (only Halls of Reflections was quite challenging when not over geared) >content drought in 3.3 patch: 6 months of ICC, then release of a small raid in 3.3.5: Ruby of Sanctum and then another 6 months until new expansion. The one expansion where most, not all, of us agree that it was good, it had a theme, lore, story, BALANCED PVP (it is the ONLY expansion that has that).. This is the peak of WOW, and hopefully gets a classic treatment someday. Its the last of the classic era, before talent trees were gutted. And the game got simplified.. Really the last Amazing expansion they did. And it really shows that this was when they ran out of original content from the Strat games.. While TBC almost fixed the mess of ""unplayability"" of classes in combat that was Vanilla: WotLK perfected the main subsystems of the game. While Ulduar and other content were the best or almost the best ever the expansion did have weakness (for example the extreme ugliness of the TotC raid). Most people will tell you this is a 10/10 but don't take them seriously since that comes mainly from memories from people that were small children back then.. The most magical WoW expansion. Arthas is a great villain and Northrend is a beauty. Raids are quite fun. Maybe the ICC patch was a bit too extended, but overall enjoyed it to the max.. The best game, and also re-playable bc almost all classes are unique and interesting. Best best WoW expansion, best MMO state that has ever been. Has some good time in PvP and raids, even though it was a bit repetitive.. This Expansion was overall fantastic. Metacritic should ban all reviews from people coming here in 2019 or 2020 to give WotLK bad reviews only because they dislike Battle for Azeroth. Really, any review past 2010 should be removed.. Genuinely great truly miss WOTLk how far we have strayed from God :( no more raid finder. One of the best expansion with the best villians of all time Arthas The Lich King. All I have to say about World of Warcraft WOTLK is that Blizzard died with Arthas.. Here's a much deserved 10 for the greatest expansion in all of MMO RPG gaming. Vanilla through Wrath was so mesmerizing and addicting. The lore, music, gameplay, cutscenes......everything was on point. Can't believe how many haters there are on here that give the game a 0 because they can't stand MMO RPG's....what a joke. World of Warcraft is the greatest and most popular MMO RPG of all time for a reason! I have never seen so many idiots in my life on Metacritic for giving it 0's. This expansion was the greatest of all time in recorded history. This is why Metacritic is a problem; pure idiots.. Was a highly overated expac for it's time. Burning Crusade was much better in my opinion.. With this expansion, I started my adventure with World of Warcraft seriously. Pros: - Northrend: a new continent with a variety of lands - plot: the opportunity to defeat Lich King - Ulduar: one of the best designed raids in WoW - classes: the new Death Knight class and the balance of other classes - achievements: the ability to check how much of the world 'we have discovered' Cons: - RDF: a fact that destroyed people's conversations and opened the way to quickly defeat dungeons only for equipment In a nutshell: the best expansion ever made to World of Warcraft, which is visible after the number of subscribers.. IMHO, the last absolutely smashing expansion before Blizzard got ready to make made stupid ass nose dive into an absolute S#IT show it is today in 2019. Arthas's story arc was probably one of the better swansong endings to a fictional character for me across all forms of media. Following the Paladin's downfall from Prince of Light to the Lich King and the countless hours in the Lich King Expansion that need to be endured to finally face him is an exceptional experience, without instant 80's and paying for gear that is. I will always Treasure WOTLK in my heart as one of the last good MMORPG before gaming turned into a gigantic shark always out to devour every single drop of precious blood money they can from their players. Arthas You will Never be forgotten !!!. Wrath of the Lich King brought World of Warcraft to its Apex, building upon the excellent Burning Crusade expansion. From start to finish wotlk had an epic feeling and added more and more until its final patch. I have yet to experience a game as fun and probably never will.. My personal favourite expansion. Content was super engaging, class designs were amazing, raiding was incredible (and rewarding... no LFR), the zones were incredible. Introduction of the Death Knight classes felt like they really were a ""hero class"" unlike the introduction of the monk and DH which kind of feel under-done. This expansion had me engaged from release until Cata came out.. Since its inception, World of Warcraft has trended in generally the same direction. Earlier versions featured a 'realistic', unforgiving, community-centered gameplay, where a character's development focused on players' ability to organize and coordinate with their peers. Players who didn't take the game seriously generally didn't see Nefarian or Illidan, as even regular dungeons could be ordeals. As time goes on, the game trends toward more convenient, accessibility-centered gameplay, where Blizzard expects every player to be able to touch every piece of content. Every player jumps on the computer-simulated max dps rotation and spec, and can be paired with a group of anonymous players to cruise through dungeons and raids. Having played from The Burning Crusade to Legion, I find that this expansion was the optimal balance between the two spheres. As someone in the middle of the softcore to hardcore spectrum I was able to make it to Icecrown, but doing so felt like a huge honor and a huge accomplishment. Part of this was from the aforementioned balance, the other was a culmination of the story from Warcraft III through several great patches. It's been said before the the LFD tool was the beginning of the end for the old feeling of the game, as the tool changed dungeons from adventures to coin-operated gear machines. I don't disagree, but in the WotLK era it always seemed that the groups produced by LFD carried that feeling **** of adventurers instead of loosely-acquainted colleagues.. PvP choices were horrible during this xpac, but as far as story and raids go this was a massive step forward for the game. This probably was the height of WoW- for hardcore raiders in particular this was the top point, and for casuals it also marked the beginning of decisions that would make the game more accessible for all.. i feel like WOTLK started the death of warcraft, primarily by destroying it's balance, which got even worse by adding a hero class, crappy new zones, and for the most part awful dungeons. people started moving to private servers to enjoy the content that was actually good, and the more balanced PvP of burning crusade. every expansion has made the game worse. im not excited about the new level cap or the new grinding. there have to be better ways to add content to a game.. Dungeon finder optimized dungeon finding but it removed alot of the social immersion of exploring. The token system to get items was good. Didn't finish the expansion. Not really worth the $15 a month. PvP was still horrendously bad. World PvP was where it was at back in the day.. is part of me, part epic, part friendly, part madture, part creative, part artistic, part entertainment... Blizzard thanks for this product, thanks for your epics cinematics, raids, heroics... I always remeber as the best moment front me PC!. This is the best expansion the game had. They lowered the difficulty to appeal to more players and also left in a challenging version in PVE for the more experienced and hardcore players. Ulduar is one of the best raids in the entire game and is my personal favorite. It was great to play through back when it was brand new and the top tiered content. The story in this expansion was very linear and didn't stray from the story like they did in Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria. The focus was the Lich King from the beginning to the end and everything you did in Northrend had something to do with the Lich King and it felt like it all belonged there. The addition of the Death Knight class was also pretty spectacular. Although I am disappointed they never continued on with the line of hero classes, this one was a great addition. Northrend is beautiful and the music score is amazing. The boss fights are all very creative and unique. I hope Warlords of Draenor is more like this and the Burning Crusade than the most recent two expansions.. Very good expansion.Heroic difficulty for raids,Good story,cool dungeons,new map,new animations,perfect new **** conclude:Northrend and Death Knights!!!. Ok expansion, Vanilla 10 BC 8 Wrath 7 Cata 6 Panda 4 . Even if wrath had atmosphere, the lich king fight was amazing, this expansion was the beginning of casual play. they had dumb down every raid to let even the dumbest raiders to be able to do a given raid !!!. So there are several reasons why this expansion was, and still is, the greatest of all of the World of Warcraft expansions, including the original release. - Difficulty: While WotLK's content was quite difficult, it was not remorselessly so like in previous incarnations of the game. It still had room for the raiding elite to show off their swag whilst simultaneously allowing more of the broader audience of the game to access the end-game content they had previously been denied. - Plot: Wrath of the Lich King addressed a FANTASTIC villain and story in the form of Arthas Menethil, one of the greatest villains in video gaming history as well as approaching many other, brand-new plot elements such as the Nexus War against the Blue Dragonflight and the secrets of Ulduar. -Music: The soundtrack to Wrath of the Lich King managed to capture the perfect balance between epic orchestral scoring and subtle, ambience, something I personally feel has been lost in subsequent expansions. -Environments: Wrath of the Lich King introduced Northrend, which had a variety of fantastically emersive environments for us to explore.. World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King is another incredible expansion for World of Warcraft. Just like the previous expansion, this expansion's environment is absolutely stunning. The atmosphere here goes for a more snow covered, demonic like presence, which I like and the land is very wide and open. The new monsters are well designed and there are giant elites roaming in certain areas, which can make a person be cautious at times. The new class, Death Knight, is a very cool class and fun to play. This is a great expansion and you'll have a blast exploring the new land of Northrend.. The game starts with reused raid content, regardless of their reasoning, minus 1 point. The quality of life changes to the game are fantastic (crafting, materials, secondary skills) Ulduar is one of the best raids every made and VERY awesome looking. From here on the raids redeem the game's initial mistake if redone NAXX. People start dropping their subs and the influx of new, younger players begins to shift the mmo community into a toxic downwards spiral. =(. Many would say Wrath of the Lich King is and always will be the best expansion in the history of WoW. Personally it is my 2nd favorite. TBC gets first in my book. WotLK was without a doubt a great expansion. Had I had the time to be a full-time raider during this game's prime it might have taken my number 1 vote.. Since the standalone World of Warcraft release, I was hooked hard into the game and its expansions. Though I still remember the wonder and freshness of WoW and the level 60 cap that it started with, I think I really spent more time digging into the high level content in Burning Crusade. There is no denying it: World of Warcraft is the true blueprint to MMORPGs and is why games like The Old Republic and Guild Wars sit in its shadow instead of standing out both as critical and profitable successes. Wrath of the Lich King actually furthered WoW a bit in the quest department. Cool cutscene bits were introduced for larger quest story lines and the raid content began to get more varied and unique than the more standard approaches from previous end game content. The only real problem with Wrath was the inevitable simplification of classes and the nerfs that came along with it. Blizzard have had a nightmare trying to balance classes, but their answer to balancing was just to slowly strip away or consolidate class skills and advantages, dumbing down some of the mechanics and mastery required to be a great player. That doesn't ruin WoW, but it definitely took some of the pride out of PvP matches. That being said, Wrath definitely serves as a great WoW expansion.. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 8 out of 10, Fun: 9 out of 10, Controls: 8 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 7 out of 10, Length: 8 out of 10, Re-play: 5 out of 10, Value: 7 out of 10. That's the last expansion that had something to do with the original trilogy of Warcraft. The rest is a try to avoid unavoidable death that is near each passing day... That' s just too bad.... The expansion where things started to go worse, really worse with World of Warcraft. It still was a playable and rather fun game back then. Actually this was the expansion where my WoW addiction was most intense.. This game just keeps getting better and better. Although raids were vastly improved for the hardcore gamer, they were now more accessible for those who like to play WOW casually, and now it doesn't take as much to reach a nice position among your guild. This expansion also keeps that hardcore group intact by adding difficult battles and intricate raids that last a long time, and take a lot of effort and strategy to progress, and should you succeed, you will be heavily rewarded. To me that was the biggest feature. I was a raider, and this just made it that much better. ICC was also a blast, and probably the most fun I have ever had in a game.. I used to enjoy World of Warcraft. I played every single day, one hour on weekdays, two on weekends. This was the best expansion. I really want it back. There were very few bad things about this. The Death Knights were very fun to play, and Northrend looked very beautiful. If I wrote this a few years earlier, I probably would have given it a 10/10, as I thought WoW was ""the best game EVAR"" up until Cata, but looking back now, I probably won't enjoy it as much as I did back then. It was a good expansion, and I don't understand how it has such a bad user score. I really want to play this again, but Blizzard changed WoW so much, it's not the same as it was in WotLK.. The final arc in the Warcraft III story fails to disappoint, returning to see old characters and the final chapter in the tale of Arthas. Best expansion to date and adding many enjoyable new features.. For me, it was the best expansion of WoW, the problem with it, was that it was really easy to beat. Even a 12yo boy could kill the lich king with no problem at all. But at least WOTLK had an interesting story line with epic raids like Ulduar, ICC and Malygos. Though WOTLK gave us some fine additions such as Achievements that gave non-hardcore players an alternative way of enjoying the game, WOTLK was a mixed bag. It was the expansion that began to chip away the magic and wonder **** that I had previously loved. I didn't hate WOTLK - there were many things I really liked about it. However, many of the added races such as the Vrykul, Tuskarr, Taunka and Gorloc and Wolvar ranged from superfluous (like the Taunka) to out of place (the Vrykul) to ridiculous (the Tuskarr, the Gorloc and the Wolvar). The ridiculous races gave the game a puerile quality that eroded the dark tone that WOTLK was trying to set by introducing slapstick, childish humour with these new races. This created a sense of dissonance with the feelings of impending doom caused by the return of the Lich King and the accompanying scourge threat to the world. There were also zones in Northrend that seemed redundant (ie: Borean Tundra is the same zone level as Howling Fjord) and there was too much overlap in terms of zone levels, so players didn't get to experience Northrend in its entirety because they often had to choose between zones, whereas Burning Crusade had a more balanced approach in this way. Other zones such as Crystalsong Forest seemed to have little to no function or relevance at all except for housing the city of Dalaran. I also want to say that I wasn't fond of how they handled the Death Knight class, which are GOOD, but they're not great and are still seen as a bit of a joke among the core classes because they're somewhat redundant - they're not the best tank (unless the player is really skilled - and many I've played with too many who aren't), their DPS is sketchy (again, it depends on if they player really knows this class inside out, as DKs seem to be less forgiving of mediocrity than other classes) and they really haven't found a useful place among the base classes. I think they would have been more functional as a hybrid class (tank/DPS/heals), and they could have done something interesting with them as a healer, using weird demonic spells to heal (because lore-wise, I think makes sense that healers would have been converted to DKs). Among things I liked: Achievements, the expanded lore of the DKs and the fall of Arthas, the coupe attempt against the Undercity, the beautifully crafted city of Dalaran and easter eggs like Higher Learning that encouraged players to explore and rewarded them with pets, mounts or titles. I really loved that Blizzard brought back titles, something they seemed to briefly touch upon and abandoned without explanation in Vanilla WoW, as well as the addition of the Inscription profession, which felt far less painful than Jewelcrafting, a profession introduced in BC that I still hate with a passion for reasons I can't explain. I loved the addition of Wintergrasp and the use of siege vehicles. The introduction of BoA gear was an idea I was somewhat warm to at first, but as the game has progressed, BoAs have proven to be a scourge in low-level PvP BGs/zones. BoAs give players without it an unfair disadvantage and I feel it's broken the lower-level PvP aspect of the game as they've added BoAs in subsequent expansions. Though I don't hate WOTLK, I didn't like the precedent it set for later expansions with ridiculous races, a redundant new class, overlapping zone levels that prevented the player from fully experiencing the new content and the introduction of BoAs that later resulted in a broken low-level PvP experience for new players (or players who didn't ","world of warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (WoTLK) is an unparalleled expansion . it's an enthralling storyline, refined gameplay mechanics, breathtaking locales, and innovative features . it's one of the greatest expansions in gaming history, a perfect rating of 10/10 ."
207.Metroid Prime Trilogy,"best $20 I ever spent, prime 1 is 9/10, prime 2 is 10/10, prime 3 is 8/10, I love these games. 3 of the best games of all time combined into one package is one of the greatest values in gaming ever.. Three excellent games bundled together and improved with the new motion control scheme makes this compilation an incredible deal.. this series is great with level design and atmosphere. the gameplay in 1st person is so much fun with exploration and combat and puzzle solving.. Best value in gaming along with The Orange Box. Genuinely three of the greatest games ever made in one package.. One of the best video game collections. The games have aged almost perfectly, and are still some of the best games in their genre. Furthermore, for Wii/Gamecube-era games, their graphics surprisingly hold up.. This is quite honestly one of the best gameplay experiences I've ever had, the motion controls work very well with the first two games as well as the third, these games are truly masterpieces with very fun boss battles. These are some of the best games ever made, wrapped in one complete package. Every detail of the original game has been retained, down to the menus. For $20 on the Wii U eshop, you have no reason to not pick this up! Unless that is, if you're reading this past January 2022 when the eshop closes. the finest trilogy and gaming compilation ever made and for the price they're selling this is most definitely a steal one of these games is nearing perfect and the other two are still masterpieces if you haven't bought this what are you doing?. Probably the best shooters I have ever seen these games are amazing, while the controls aren't the best, I think they are better than the gcn controls.. Metroid Prime Trilogy is a collection of my three favorite Metroid games. It contains extra content such as multiplayer, artwork and music. These games are super underrated and deserve better so here's to an amazing Metroid Prime 4 (eventually) and beyond.. amazing how they resold the same games without even bothering to upgrade the graphics. Thank you fanboys for paying nintendo salaries, spoiler next pokemon will be same too, pick 3 pokemons, fight gyms fight elite 4 ending :D. Absolutely amazing I got this game earlier this week and i’ve only played the first one so far (I think i’m close to the end I just got the grapple beam) but I can already tell i’m gonna love the other 2 definitely pick it up it’s only $20 on the wii U which is an amazing deal. Far from criticizing the quality of this collection, whose three games are a must for any videogame fan. I have to give it a bad grade because of Nintendo's obligation to use the wii control type. These games with the option to play in a classic control scheme would be outstanding, no more. But its control through wii nickname, is uncomfortable, imprecise and forces the player to abandon the game out of sheer exhaustion. You can't keep your arm pointed at the screen for a continuous session of about 2 hours. If in the future this compilation is remastered and published in switch, I'm sure I'll buy it, for the time being its version of wii remains on my shelf for collection, because I don't think I'll ever play it again.. A phenomenal deal if you still have your Wii and if you come across this for a decent price. Three Metrioid Prime games with a new play control that works surprisingly well. If you need a shooter for your Wii, this is it.. The usual mindless invisible-walls-and-guess-what-we're-thinking design that you can expect from Nintendo. There's zero user agency. If you divert from the predefined track then say goodbye to your time while you try to find your way back on it, because you cannot accomplish anything until you read the mind of the designer and like a good robot do everything in the predefined order. That's how it is intended to be played, like an invisible instruction manual. Most of the game is about opening doors; weapons and abilities are nothing but glorified keys to unlock doors and reach a previously unreachable area, much like in shooters from the nineties. At least Doom and Quake were honest about it, unlike Metroid. Did you scan an enemy to get some useful info in preparation of a battle? Sorry, we exchanged that enemy with another identical looking one two seconds after you completed your scan. Don't complain about how that's unintuitive -- why didn't you simply read our minds? Oh, you died and lost a lot of progress as a result? Well, we don't really respect your time. If it's that important to you then you should have gone completely off-track and hiked half across the map to save your game. That's what we call ""flow"". And don't complain about combat. Don't you understand that all your weapons are useless unless you shoot the enemy in fifteen orifices in a specific order? You seem to be used to games where it's possible to accomplish something your own way. We don't have room for that kind of player. Either stop thinking and do exactly as we intended, or waste your effort and die. Developers are just lazy when they spit on players' time and effort by throwing it away as soon as their extremely convoluted, specific and predetermined way of killing enemies goes undiscovered. I hope another developer can raise the bar for this franchise. And for Zelda, and... right, they do this **** in every game.. That is probably the best recopilation in gaming history. Three of the best games in history in one game. In only one word: AWESOME.. These are three masterpieces, plain and simple. This has quickly become one of my favorite Wii games ever. The atmosphere is perfect and it's just soaking in gameplay. There's such a natural progression and it's obviously the best way to jump into the Metroid series if you have a Wii. Great compilation of great games, with it low price on wii u eshop you really should give it a try. Amazing visuals, atmosphere and gameplay still hold up to this day.. The best trilogy in videogames in one only disc. AWESOME. The Prime Trilogy is the best videogame collection ever,all the grandess of the originals in one game. I'll start by saying that I hate first-person shooters. There are lots of reasons for this. Metroid Prime Trilogy is not just the only first-person shooter I'd recommend to anyone to play, it's a game I'd highly recommend in general. Retro Studios did a fantastic job transferring the experience of the original Metroid games into an immersive 3D environment. The beginning introduces you to the basics of your controls -- press to shoot, do to scan, etc. -- in a natural way as you go through the intro area. It doesn't feel like gameplay is interrupted for instructions. And then it drops you into a fascinating, completely alien world with many of the abilities you had at the beginning disabled, and the only hints you have about where to go next are where you can reach, plus the occasional map marking from scan data. As you progress and defeat ever more difficult bosses, you gain more abilities that make you able to reach places you couldn't reach before. Just like it was in Super Metroid. No inter-character story pushing you forward, just a big and beautiful alien world that you can't wait to explore further.. 14 years later and Metroid Prime is as good as it was when I was a kid. Porting it to the Wii solved the only gripe I ever had about it - controls. It stills looks beautiful. When you're playing, you aren't thinking ""this looks good for 2002"", you're thinking ""this looks good in general"". It's amazing that they were able to pull off these graphics so long ago. Man. It plays so well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game. It makes you wonder why Nintendo took the #10 video game of all time and did nothing with the franchise. I hope they still will.. This trilogy consists of three amazing games. Metroid is a franchise like no other. The original Metroid started something completely different in the gaming world and the Metroid Prime games bring it successfully to the third dimension. Words cannot describe how amazing it is to play these three games. The controls are immersive and surprisingly easy to get used to. The gameplay is fabulous, and the graphics are beautiful for their time. If you have a Wii or Wii U, buy this trilogy, it is worth every penny and much more.. First, let me say that I had huge expectations for this game, given its metascore and the fact even now it's still pretty expensive on the market and I took it into account at the moment of choosing the grade. Let's start with the positives, the controls are near perfection, which is a true achievement when thinking that two of those games weren't made for the Wii, of course only the third entry have little extras taking advantage of the Wii motion controls, but the main gameplay is great for all 3 games. Secondly this trilogy truly has its own identity, the way the game has to mix puzzles, platforming and shooting, epic bosses is very natural and once again a true achievement from Retro Studios, they also capture the unique vibe of exploring an unknown world, however, there is not much change over the three games (a few gadgets change but with globally the same use) a good thing that they didn't make others episodes after Corruption. Now let's talk about why I'm not as enthusiast about those games as many others. First the lack of a true story really annoys me, in the first game there's 0 story, the second just a little more and finally the third is the only one with a true story (even if it is a classic one), in my opinion a game cannot be great without a great story, it lacks purpose, and this was even more important given the fact that there is so much backtracking into those games, I was really bored when I had to go through the same room for the tenth time. In conclusion there's no doubt those games are good, but in my opinion they're not classic (except Corruption maybe) and so I wouldn't advice them to everyone, especially if you're looking for a good story.. Metroid Prime is on my list of the three best games of all time, and Metroid Prime 2 is just about as good as the first and even improves on it in some ways. Metroid Prime 3 goes in some bad directions and not only includes much more character interaction but makes the dialogue infantile and stupid. I can see how 3 might be seen as paving the way for Other M. But it's still worth a play for Metroid fans.. Honestly, this game is the reason i didn't sell my Wii. My dad got me it for good grade and i was like ""what is a metroid?"" He told me that it was one of gaming biggest series. So, i played it. These 3 games made me love metroid. I played metroid prime for hours on end. Every time i got an upgrade or won a boss fight, i wanted jump up and scream like i had just won the superbowl. And i didn't have any wristpain from the controls. The motion control was great because it made you feel like you were samus giving Ridley some plasma charged death. Granted the graphics may not be the best, but the games need them. I felt that this game was more visually pleasing than things that had top of the line graphics. And sure for those of you who MP on the gamecube, it is the same game as it was. However, i played all 3 of these games 3 times over, from to finish. In closing, Metroid Prime Trilogy is top of the line, best Wii game ever.. Garbage. Same games with no graphics upgrade, but you get to pay for them again! But wait, that's not all, now we have MANDATORY MOTION CONTROLS. No controller support of any kind. Steer clear.. This package is one of the best deals in gaming history. Three of the absolute finest games ever created, and now the first two with the highly superior Wii controls. If you haven't experienced Prime 1 & 2 before, this is the definitive version to get. It's probably pretty hard to get a copy of the trilogy for a reasonable price now, as it was only available for a limited time, but if you see it, get it! It's definitely worth every penny it costs you, these games are really that amazing. I also have to mention the visuals, they are superb in these games. Retro Studios have used an incredibly clever art style, along with the best possible use of the Wii's technical capabilities. The graphics, at least for Prime 3: corruption, have not aged one bit. So basically, if you really like action/adventure games and have not yet experienced these three masterpieces, this package is worth almost anything you'll have to pay for it.. Absolutely the best game i think i have ever played. I enjoyed this game SO MUCH. The experience i had changed my view of video games vastly. The reason I liked this game so much was the following (main reasons): The soundtrack. Oh my god the soundtrack. The music and sound effects to this game were outstanding. The voice acting was also spectacular. Giving me an eerie feeling and making a strong impact on the story. The first game included: Metroid Prime. 10/10. best one of the 3 included. It was the best metroid experience I've ever had, and I've loved this game for about 3-4 years now, and of all the ones I've played this one was the best. The second game included: Metroid Prime 2, Echoes. Very fun. Included only a few suit upgrades, which i won't spoil here (because i don't want spoilers in my review) but the game was amazing. It started with some really great exploring, and delved deep into a (quite terrifying) story. The third (and easiest): Metroid prime 3: Corruption. Despite being very easy to complete, it was still really fun to experience. I loved the final boss fight. (also all the leviathan fights leading up to it!!) The game was great, especially with the new feature, which was being able to interact with your environments in ways like pressing numbers on a keypad to using your arm cannon to weld broken circuitry. Completed it 100%.. I never played the original Prime games because I just got into Metroid when I played Super back in 2009 or so. But I got the Trilogy for the following Christmas and absolutely loved it. If Super Metroid didn't make me a fan of the series, this game sure did. Amazing graphics, beautiful music, and excellent gameplay that handles flawlessly for Wii, I'd sorely recommend this game if you can find it; it's really rare these days.. It's the entire Metroid Prime trilogy and it's awesome. It's nice to have all 3 of the Metroid Prime's on one disc to save you trouble from switching out the discs every time you want to play something different. Only downside, playing all these in a row gets boring and that's usually what most people (that I know at least) do when they get an HD collection of something. Ik a lot of people don't, but I'm just nitpicking here. If you haven't played the Metroid Prime series or own it. Get the off the computer. Go to your local game store. Grab this game. Pay for it. And play the out of it!. this is the absolute best package in gaming, i mean a slick metal case with awesome artwork and shinny booklets with amazing art and story, the games in this collection are the 3 best first person shooters out there, altough you can say they are first person adventures because the exploration is the order of the day and not the shooting. What retro studios has managed to produce is astonishing, graphics, music, design and gameplay-wise. there are no better adventure games than this and a universe so fully realized. Metroid prime trilogy is the best compilation ever. period.. This is one of the best collections you can own if you have a nintendo wii and are a metroid fan specially; this games are legendary for their sensation wonder, mystery, exploration and discovery, it is remaked by critics and gamers to be some of the finest games ever made and makes one proud to play it. it's not action oriented like halo or war themed like killzone, but is a trilogy that conquers it's gamer with atmosphere and design. Im going to keep it short and simple. If they were to make us able to aim ""free"" without locking onto targets and somehow shorten the time used just to get from A to B it would be a 10/10. The lock on target thing is just not up to date. It makes the game to damn simple. Theres never really a challenge unless youre fighting bosses. It makes it boring as well, because it feels like youre just hammering the B-button without actually doing something to take the enemy down.. Metroid Prime Trilogy is easily the best $50 you will ever spend on anything related to video games ever. It contains three of the greatest titles of all time, along with a beautiful metal casing and some extras inside the case as well as all three Metroid Prime games on one disk. I think it's easily worth the purchase even if you have played all three Metroid Prime games before, because not only do you get the first two titles with Wii controls which, slight quibbles about lack of buttons aside, are far superior to the Gamecube version, but you also get many of the features that were designed for Metroid Prime 3 outside of Wii controls for the first two titles as well. The medal system from Corruption returns, allowing you to unlock a screenshot tool that works for all three games, the Fusion Suit for Prime(which was included in the GC version), as well as various concept art and soundtracks. Unfortunately, the medal system does feel a little lazy on as you only acquire medals for scanning things, defeating bosses, and accomplishing various other mandatory tasks in the game, such as acquiring Chozo Artifacts or Dark Temple Keys. I was somewhat hoping that medals could be earned for doing optional things, such as defeating an enemy in a specific way similar to the Icy Reptilicide or Stylish Kill medals in MP3, but these are rather small quibbles. Overall, if you've played all the Metroid Prime titles before, I would highly recommend this over nearly anything you can get, which are even more enjoyable with the new Wii controls, but if you didn't enjoy the games for a reason besides the control scheme, then Trilogy won't make you enjoy it any more than you did. If, however, you haven't played the Metroid Prime games, or enjoyed one or two but missed out on one or more of the titles down the road, then I can't recommend this highly enough. Not only will you get whichever games you've played before on a single disk(if you have played any), but you will also get the chance to play through some of the greatest titles in gaming history in their best form, with Wii controls. It's easily worth the $50. Overall, I can't give this compilation anything but my highest recommendation. Every single one of these games is a masterpiece, and the only complaints I have about the games are all small quibbles where I didn't enjoy something that I'm sure some other portion of the gaming community did. If you liked the Metroid Prime games, then get this. If you haven't played the Metroid Prime games, then there is no better time to try them out then now. If you had difficulty enjoying Prime 1 or 2 because of the Gamecube controls, then consider this a new opportunity to enjoy some great games with an excellent control scheme. The only person I wouldn't recommend these to is anyone who has played the Prime games in the past and didn't enjoy them for a reason besides control scheme. Everyone else, this is an excellent buy, and likely the greatest gaming trilogy of all time on one disk.. Easily the greatest compilation of games since Valve's ""The Orange Box"", Metroid Prime Trilogy brings one of the greatest trilogies of gaming ever created. Metroid Prime 3's Wii controls are implemented in the 2 previous titles, allowing for the absolute best first person experience on the Wii. Although the graphical textures and models from the first two were left virtually untouched, these games look amazing, the best you can find on the Wii today. Metroid Prime Trilogy offers an excellent opportunity for those who missed out on the titles the first time around. 9/10. The first thing i did was change some options to make the controls better. Change A to jump and B to fire and also set to pro mode as this allows you to lock on to a target and shoot something else and still shoot at the lock on target if you wish. This is also hardly a childish game and i'd never deprive anyone of experiencing such a great series.Fantastic sci-fi story.. Quite simply, this is the best of the best when it comes to modern game design. The design of the Metroid Prime series is impeccable, requiring the player fully invest both quick reflexes and brain power to solve puzzles as well as the scan and remember key areas all though out the game environment. It's impossible to describe with words, because no next-gen game is quite like the Metroid Prime series. The phenomenal mechanics work 100% of the time, and the trilogy is polished to perfection, presented flawlessly, and effortlessly executed. The set is an incredible value, even though most copies are quite pricey now. Regardless of price, this is ""required reading"" for all gamers.. You are getting three award-winning games in one! This is worth every penny. The best aspect of the Metroid Prime series for me is the feeling of isolation. You are playing the lone wolf for the entire time and you really feel you like a badass when you finish that boss fight with only your wits to thank. My only downside is the constant backtracking but other than that it is an awesome game!. The easiest review in the world! The original Metroid Prime is well worth a 10 as a stand-alone title, as it is one of the best adventure games ever made. So... score sorted then. If, however, you have played the first game to death and are more interested in the sequels, here are a few things you should mull over. Metroid Prime 2 is a mostly fantastic title. The light / dark world idea is really well done, and it develops that isolated atmosphere that defines the Metroid series even further. Unfortunately, MP2 is severely hamstrung by it's truly ball-breaking difficulty. If you're properly up for a challenge, though, it's all gold! Metroid Prime 3 has other, more pressing issues. The game suffers from a serious case of deja-vu. Almost everything in this game has been seen before, and it all just feels a bit under-inspired and workman like. So there you go; One all-time classic, one hard-as-nails slice of intensity and one solid-but-ultimately-dull clone. If, however, you have never played the original Metroid Prime, well... BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY!. I loved all three of these games when they came out, now they're all in one and the first two have Wii controls? What's not to love? The Wii controls made the first two play smoother and multiplayer mode was actually fun and competitive because of the new controls. I would have given all of the games separately high scores but all together with improved controls, this can be nothing short of a 10.. Anyone who likes first person shooter games with an adventure sense to it will most probably love all of these 3 games, the Metroid Prime collection is truly some of the best its genre has to offer. It has an overwhelming storyline and a very complete background story that even if it might not have much to do with the traditional Metroid trama, it brings an innovating, interesting and greatly developed plot that is evidence of a very well thought game. The characteristic dark atmosphere along with the breathtaking and massive landscapes introduce the gamer into a fantastic and new universe that will change your perspective of videogames and even movies, presenting very wild natural environments and simultaneously highly sophisticated technological spaceships. In addition, we can see an amazing variety of creatures and monsters to interact with during these games, all of them different and creative with a very cool design and appearance. A huge variety of weapons and ability upgrades also contribute to an entertaining experience, alongside with the admirable new Wii platform controls that provide a much more fun and intuitive way of shooting and exploring. These games all bring a marvelous original soundtrack that will give the gamer a whole new sensation when playing. This pack is simply perfect, very unique and well made, another instant classic.. Three already great games combined into a single disc trilogy.. Whats not to like about this? I just wish that Nintendo would show their other franchises the same love. Also i wish that they would make games that you download via the Wii Shop channel that you put on the SD card playable on the 3DS or DSiXL/Dsi.. That'd be awesome.. Metroid Prime Trilogy. Great game yes you get all 3 metroid prime games here 1 released on the wii and 2 that were released on the gamecube. this game is currently out of print which is means expect to pay mondo dollas for this title. So is the game worth it? Yes I had only had played the first one on the gamecube before this so both 2 and three are new to me. I do recognize though that this is a second release of these games so you may or may not have them in you collection already. The controls are good for the wii but I do feel it loses a point for not having the option of the classic controller come on nintendo the first two had it already so you should have left it as a option because not everyone is used to we controllers. The graphics a good for the wii and even though 2 of these are ports from the gamecube they look great even next 2 xbox360 and ps3 games. The story is a ten out of ten and the length on all these games is great. If you ask me spend 60 dollars on mw3 or 100 dollars on a copy on metroid trilogy I would say get metroid trilogy a better story and just a all around awesome package. So as for why is it a 8 instead one point for not leaving putting in classic controller support and another point for being a port of 2 titles you can pick up and play on the cube and metroid 3 was released during the dawn of the wii. If you own all three titles already skip this one if you don't spend your cash and buy this one now it is worth every penny.. Even tough some games are missing effects, and others are censored a small bit, those are minimal flaws that don't manage to harm one of gaming's best complitations of all time. 3 great games in a neat package, complete with upgraded graphics on older titles, new control schemes to make those same games better and widesceen support. Also featuring losts of extras; it will last you a very, very long time. Definitely recommended, grab it while it lasts.. the best 1st person games ever created for the price of one , not a shooter but a puzzle solving-plataforming adventure so inteligent and refined that will freak you out, the essence of true gaming just buy it, trust me you wont regret it pd: negative reviews were written by some chimps escaped from a zoo or something?wtf. This is no doubt the greatest compilation of games ever, and the one deal that every Wii owner should take advantage of. Three of the greatest FPS games ever in one remastered package. The absolute only element of this game that felt missing was online multiplayer for MP2: Echoes. Aside from that, this is the complete package, given an upgrade. This is the first time you'll see snow fall on Phendrana Drifts, or notice the texture of Ridley's armor. If you've passed up on the series until now, or feel like dusting your Wii off, be sure to pick this one up.. Just want to point out the only mixed or negative reviews for this game basically say. 1. I HAS ALREADY PLAYED THIS SO A RERELEASE OF THE BESTEST GAME EVER IS A 6 SOMEHOW and 2. THE WII HURTS MY WRIST SO I HATE THIS GAME THAT I SAY IS A REALLY GOOD GAME. ALSO I WANT TO EXPLAIN IN 800 WORDS HOW BLAH BLAH BLAH Can... can someone just delete those?. Three of the best games ever made all in one package. The Wii controls fit all the games fantastically. If you own a Wii this is a must have game. Also, to that negative review...really? You're giving it a zero rating because your wrist hurt? Why don't you actually review the game itself? Hey I had a stomach ache when I first played the Witcher 2. Guess I should give it a zero rating.. The best three games ever made recreated for the best system ever made. What more needs to be said? The only word I can think of to describe it is ""perfection"".. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Anyone who didn't give this a perfect score should either be arrested, charged for treason, or forced to give it the full 10/10 it so rightfully deserves. Retro Studios is one of the greatest game developers PERIOD.. This is the Wii's best collection of games. Metroid Prime was one of the stand-out games from the Gamecube, and both sequels live up to the first. If you've not played the Prime series before, this is the time to dive in. The motion controls improve the first two titles, both of which were phenomenal at the time of their release. There are few games that can get 50+ hours out of you, but this set will. There is never a dull moment, with detailed worlds and environments from the snowy Phendrana Drifts to the savage Pirate Homeworld. 5/5, something truly special.. Immersive, absorbing, exciting, haunting, vibrant and masterful exploration by the masters of first-person-adventuring, Retro Studios. Three of the greatest games ever made.. It's really too bad that they stopped production on this. Three of the best games ever in one package. what more can be **** that doesn't explain a thing. oh well, buy this if you can. Here's my Top 50 games of all time: The Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past Super Metroid The Legend of Zelda Metroid Prime (Trilogy) Banjo-Kazooie Resident Evil 4 Tetris DS Words with Friends (Scrabble) Super Mario Galaxy Mike Tysonâ. Metroid Prime Trilogy is the greatest compilation of games I have ever played. It almost seems like Nintendo made Metroid Prime 1 too **** the game was released for the Wii when the console came out you would have a huge bandwagon of people claiming that it it the greatest video game ever created. Trilogy is the standard to which every FPS on the Wii should be measured against. Also, JacobP is a huge sissy. This game will not destroy your wrists like this noob would like to claim. He bad.. The Metroid story is one that is close to many hearts. Any time you take something so beloved and mess with it, you are taking a HUGE risk. With the Prime trilogy, they are taking the side scrolling game, and putting it into a 3D FPS game. With the release of the Wii came the motion control, and with the re-release of Metroid Prime 1 & 2, along with 3, all in one package, all with the Prime 3 motion control. While each game was fun alone, the Trilogy package brings it all together, and makes one of the best games of any system. Even if you are not a fan of the Metroid story, this is still a game far worth picking up.. Though it may be a tad pricey to find this in good condition it is probably still worth it. These three games are excellent, with the superb Prime and Corruption and the mediocre Echoes all in one fancy package with uniform updated controls for all three games. The only down side (and this may sound funny) is that they fixed many of the bugs and glitches found in the Gamecube versions of Prime and Echoes. This removes most of the super fun sequence breaks and the games lose a little bit of replay value as a result.. Metroid Prime remains as stellar a Trilogy as any ever in gaming history. This is the first FPS game I have ever loved and still a joy to play. Retro Studios is a masterclass in recreating the feel of classic Metroid into a 3D world. The controls are PERFECT and the challenge is great. I was able to pick up this awesome package brand new but it is limited to find. Find it! The best FPS on Wii and any other sytstem in my humble opinion. Samus remains the most badass bounty hunter in gaming history. And this is the most perfect package and value I've ever seen.. The only FPS series that lives up to it's","three of the best games of all time combined into one package is one of the greatest values in gaming ever . for the $20 on the wii u eshop, you have no reason to not pick this up . Metroid Prime Trilogy is a collection of my three favorite Metroid games ."
208.I Was a Teenage Exocolonist,"It was good up until a point. I just didn't like how the characters turned out in their third phases, mostly about appearance.. The gameplay is perfectly passable but pretty basic and gets boring after a bit, but the writing is pretty good. The plot is unfolds fairly slowly (as it does in all games, because there's gameplay in-between plot points), but is a perfectly good plot. However, the writing is significantly hurt by the fact that the writers have a really messed up worldview in a variety of ways, including the view that it would be good for all humans to be killed because it would be better for ""nature"", and a vague overarching anti-heterosexual vibe. The writers actually took the time at the end of the game to tell me that they were disappointed in me for choosing an ending where humanity is allowed to thrive (this really actually happened), and there are various points were the writers include really messed up, sociopathic views as basic truths, it's really weird. Playing this game as a human feels like what it would be like for a woman to read a book written in the 1600s by a man who thinks all women are dumb and writes all women as inherently incompetent, as if that's just an objective truth.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game. Love it so much. Could not stop playing it during neither my first nor my 2nd playthrough. It’s all so well written and engaging, the art direction is fabulous,the main story and the cast of characters are brilliant… i’ll play a third and a fourth time no doubt. If you like storyrich games, with impactful choices, it’s definitely a must play. Its such a good experience for the weekend, once I actually sat and started playing the game, I had experienced all the range of Human Emotion, the writing is preety tight, the gameplay is alright, this is a VN/Interactive story game done right. This game makes you feel emotions you don't even know you have, and there's so much of the narrative to discover. Probably the best narrative game of 2022. The replayability via interesting late game mechanics make this an all time great!. lovely characters, lovely gameplay. very engaging. One of the most-slept on games of last year.. I really enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. Fun, thoughtful and engaging with great replay value. I did not find the card-based gameplay to be even remotely challenging as someone who likes TCGs a lot but the concept was great. Great little indie game that is truly worth your time.. A whirlwind of an narrative driven RPG that deals in emotional gut punches while leaving the player agency to develop the story according to their heart's content. Amazing and genuinely moving experience that will render you anything from joyous to ****. Northway hit a bullseye with this one. Couldn't recommend more.. I just finished my fifth playthrough, which is WAY more than I play most games - but with so many different possible endings, there's nothing to get bored of! Sure, past your first three plays or so, things may start to get a bit repetitive (it's the nature of the game; you're stuck in a timeloop and the game ACKNOWLEDGES this), but there's always so much to discover. Especially when you start getting to the truth about Vertumna and the life on it. I also very much appreciated the diversity in every aspect, especially when it comes to gender. You can be any gender, use custom pronouns, and choose what you look like in your later years (all of which can be changed at any time, for maximum realness)! There are different body types, monogamy vs polyamory preferences, you can romance any of the dateable characters no matter what gender you are, and so many people of color. I've had an incredible time playing this game, and it has even motivated me to try coding/writing visual novels. Go get this game. Do it.. Pros: -The Card system is fun and adictive. -Some characters and situations are engaging. -Decisions with real consequences. -Plot a bit wasted (IMHO it has potential for something more), but well written in general, like reading a young adult novel. Cons: -The romance. Underdeveloped, a bit forced, with more soap opera than genuine tenderness and sadness and fun. And it should has more relevance in the plot. And some routes only have bad endings, no matter what you do, which is annoying. -A bit repetitive sometimes. -There were some really tragic moments where i was like: ok, ok, whatever... and I consider myself a very emotional person, so.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games I have ever played. So good I can't even express it in a review. Don't expect this game to be a dating sim tho, it isn't a one.. This game is incredible and offers a unique and new experience that you must play to appreciate. A beautiful game that you will find yourself obsessed with and thinking about even when you’re not playing, it has been a completely unexpected joy since I picked it up shortly after release on a whim. The characters are incredible. If you’ve found yourself playing an RPG, gotten bored with repetitive gameplay elements that descend into tedium, and wished you could move on to getting to know well-developed characters and making story-impacting decisions, this is the game for you. Don’t let the “teenage” in the title fool you, this game has an emotional maturity games typically lack.","the writing is hurt by the fact that the writers have a really messed up worldview . playing as a human feels like what it would be like for a woman to read a book written in the 1600s by a man who thinks all women are dumb and writes all women as inherently incompetent . the art direction is fabulous,the main story and the cast of characters are brilliant ."
209.Overwatch,"Very well-optimized game. Balanced, and funny to play with............................. this game is pee and the community **** because blizzard makes sus things out of the characters. Late review: Pros: Better than overwatch 2 Cons: Overwatch 2 existing Nostalgia hits hard when goats were a thing before Brig and Moria. Overwatch? More like OverSCAM! Low value and generic loot boxes in exchange for real world money was so controversial that a Hawaiian congressman authored a bill banning loot boxes becauseit was considered gambling for kids. Still just a ripoff of the OG granddaddy of them all TF2 but with WoW style graphics andbalanced gameplay.. Great game that I still play, but the more they update this game the worst it gets. This game was great when it came out and thats why the score is high.. game of the generation. the last glory for the old generation of blizzard. there will never be another overwatch.. this was a really good game once upon a time but blizzard had to ruin it, a real shame. A colorful shooter in which everyone can find a character for themselves. I doubt that an online fps game equal to this game will ever be released in the future. Such a shame we can't play this game no more.. Loved the game but the farther it went on its life cycle the worse the game became due to the decisioning of new characters added and the nerfs/buffs, and especially lack of changes to fix hard metas like goats. The metagame switch counters also became too heavy. We didn't know it back then, but we had it good fellas... we had it good. Not only does this game no longer exist, but its evil **** twin, i.e the 'sequel' has the audacity to parade its lifeless corpse and rake in as much as cash as possible in the process. Disgusting stuff. Will there be one day 'Overwatch Classic' just like WoW Classic, where players can play the patch just before the 'sequel' **** everything? Unlikely, but possible. Thank you for the memories, dear game, you were one of a kind.. The game doesn't even exist anymore because of the hamfisted way Blizzard rolled out the ""sequel"". With the game I've been playing since the open test, the highs are really high when the game is going well, but the average fun is low due to the stress between team members. It's a game that gets tiring due to overwhelming skill differences that look like the enemy team is using illegal programs.... It's a game of love and hate, so much fun when it's on the high end, but so frustrating when you're not in sync with your teammates or when the game is lethargic. Shouldn't we go in the direction of more individualized carry?. a VERY strong contender for 'Most Overrated Game of All Time' and led to even worse clones. Geez, the game was nice especially the snowy maps and arcade events, good times #SaveSoil. Overrated piece of **** with very PG-safe character design and storytelling. I came initially for the lore but found pvp only, and I regret spending money for this.. Despite all the controversy surrounding it, Overwatch was definitely a blast to play, both literally and figuratively. My friends and I played upon hours upon hours on end. This game will surely make you feel like a hero.. Good shooter, but too confusing for me in terms of visuals. Overwatch is an Online FPS with a unique art style. It is fast paced, intense and reminds a bit of Team Fortress 2. In Overwatch, you can choose a trillion different heroes or characters to play as. You join one of the two teams and work together to complete a shared goal, while blasting away other players. It was actually a lot of fun, although I was (like many competitive shooters) not very good at the game. The maps are fairly large and the many buildings, alleys and small areas make for a real witch hunt between players. I always complain in some games, that graphics and art style are blend and could use a little more color, but Overwatch overdid it a bit in my humble opinion. There are more colors in one gun or character than in some entire games. This is not a bad thing normally, but in Overwatch, the many colors and different colored textures, made me not see enemy players very well. For me personally, they kind of blended in the surroundings sometime. I saw a street lantern with a bench in front of it, and emptied my gun, only to realize that I was seeing ghosts. In terms of sound, Overwatch is all right. Guns sound fine, effects and explosions are good enough. Overwatch controls very easily and smooth and the mechanics are easy to understand. I am a little disappointed that games today just close their servers in favor of the next installment, forcing you to play and making the old game inaccessible. Blizzard is the prime example for this, in case the hint was not clear. Nothing lasts forever, but when you have some kind of solid player base, you should not do this. After dying for the hundredth time, I was kind of done with Overwatch. It is not a bad game, but for me, it was just a little confusing, hard to read and overall, not that special. It also does not help that I just **** too hard for competitive online play. In the end, I would recommend this game, if the servers were still up for the first game.. So much fun just for the game to become one of the least updated games of all time.. Overwatch was one of the best game ever made for sure. Sad to see what thy did to it on the ''sequel''. no need to pay for skin and events and fun to play. This game alsa have great graphics and lots of great map in the game. The best team-based shooter to this day, probably. It's a varied, beautiful, recognizable, with great comic and dramatic characters and a very interesting background. And the animated short films and videos of the characters' stories are a completely unique art form.. I miss this **** so much coming back from school to play this game was absolutely peak, no game will surpass how awesome the 2016-2018 overwatch era was and it's a shame. this game has been completely ruined with the release of ow2, ""if it ain't broken don't fix it"". or just release it as a separate game like Splatoon 1,2 and 3. In my opinion Overwatch is the best fps multiplayer game of all time, no joke, the different heroes and how which one feels unique and different, the balanced multiplayer, plus the the story trough events and animated shorts that blizzard created just adds to this amazing game. its a shame that ended but i enjoyed every single moment.. Only multiplayer game I didn’t regret sinking thousands of hours into.. 2016 Overwatch is the single best multiplayer experience in all of video game history. Such ambition was too hard to keep up for Blizzard, as this game devolved into the heaping pile of trash it is today.. Was one of the best fps to play with friends, so long brother. Simply no other fps like it. Game of the year in 2016 for a reason.. Great Heroes with diverse playstyles designs (Charming like Disney/Pixar). Great map art designs (culturally beautiful and diverse game overall), some map layout are a bit poor with one choke point to attack/defend. Voice acting is top tier especially when heroes interact with each other. Seasonal events to spice up the gameplay yearly alongside seasonal cosmetics (tho all cosmetics are locked behind loot boxes which CAN be earned in game easily). There's also a workshop mode and arcade modes to add even more variety to gameplay and all the content added is free. Team Based game feels very unique for a shooter with roles like a MOBA (Tank, Damage, Support) which makes gameplay feel even more diverse (tho because there's two Tanks, fights tend to stagnate when both teams are shooting constantly at frontline with 2CP especially feeling like a race to see which Tanks break first. Lastly heroes have Ults and with it being a 6v6, some fights can end up being a ""spam every Ult = win fight"" situation.. What the hell was that review. This game is hot garbage. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Must play? Sure where is it? I remember I paid for this one. This is so sad.. RIP Overwatch 1, you we're legendary before Blizz put you through a content drought and replaced you with the literal downgrade that is OW2.. this is not really a review because you cannot buy the game anymore , it does not exist because activision killed it. The game dynamic with the enemies and the six team squared was always a fun one. I enjoyed it even if it first really become a real multiplayer game when you were forced to two two team up. Just playing all the arkade mode getting the boxes every week. It was just you know fun with your friends and so much do it. I enjoyed the box system. Just hey play some games get free 3 boxes every week. not to texting on the schedule. I do believe paying for the game helped the community a lot because you were a lot more invested in the game because you had to buy a new one if you got suspended, so that was way more better to play with the community and talk to them because now it just feels like a f****** hellhole overwatch 2. Was overwatch balanced no, but it was fun and us always a bit of happiness in seeing what weird ways the characters were gonna be buffed and deep off this time. It is sad that I never got to play The Amazing first version of symetra, It does feel so really saddening that you just get this game taking away. Just like hey we make number two now. We are just destroying number one. Bye. Bye. It is one of the most gummy move. I mean they didn't destroy Team Fortress one when Team Fortress 2 came out so I am just sitting here with the memories of the good times, but looking at that awful piece of s*** that name is overwatch 2.. Hacks, user trolling, and lazy moderation have ruined what could have been a great FPS. But Overwatch was a masterpiece that stood alone in a sea of FPS games.. Rest in peace is my favorite game of the last 6 years until October 2022. Even though she was mocked by her creators, she was alive and beautiful...until she was finally killed and cynically replaced with a pathetic and greedy clone with the number 2.. Worst game I ever played just a cash grab from the worst company in the world …. I don't consider it a true FPS on the level of UnrealTournament and Quake, but I can say that at least, in its medicore quality, it managed to entertain me and **** me up when I got bored. I'm not saying it's a deserving game, but I certainly prefer people on this game than on Valorant or Fortnite, for the rest, it remains a fun game to play with friends just to... Graphically it's well done, although like any modern game the ranked games are scripted.. ASS fkn game, the matchmaking is totally **** the heroes are nerfed back to world war 1, Blizzard cant seem to stop making more characters gay instead of improving the game and every new character is creations of satan. And dont even get me started on the game mechanics. Once again, ASS FKN GAME. Even the ranking system is totally off and must have been created by a heroin junkie. This game honestly makes you want to kill yourself. I wish blizzard headquarters get nuked, and i wish nothing more than for their families to burn in hell, my 2 year old son with cancer could make a better game than this. And lets not forget, my grandma died of a stroke by just playing this game for a minute ore two, her blood is on Blizzards hands. If you dont shut this game down i will personally see that Blizzard and its employes never sees the light of day again.. It was one of my most beloved games, now its gone and that ""not so good"" overwatch 2 is here.. yay i guess?. This game is better than what the users say that they put a 0. This is the best shooter game.. This game will be missed. Killed by Acti/blizz's greed. the last few years of development were wasted on a unnecessary sequel and cancelled PVE mode.. Tf2 rip off done worse, sweaty ass people, community is bland, boring and non existant at times, the characters are bland and boring too (I mean cmon mercy is ligit an angel who only wants to heal and help people and has never done anything wrong ever... Wow... Creative) the game has no personality, no theme other than it being a very non offensive fps, the game balance is **** and the stun mechanics are super annoying and boring to play against, ultimates can't be countered and are unfun to play against (All you do is press 1 or 2 buttons to kill at least one person which is still more than enough to be a bad trade off as the negative emotion of the guy who died purely because the enemy had their meter filled up and pressed a button isn't fun to play against) it feels like gunplay is quite minimal and the game focuses too heavily on abilities as some character don't even require aim... At all, just press a button in a 70 degree circle and the enemy is beginning to die, the game feels like an ability waiting sum and characters have next to no mechanical depth, annoying '1 2' combos to instakill enemies, things like roadhog shotgun hit pretty much being able to kill every hero and even if they don't die they still are left with next to no health which pretty much implies death and those combos take low amount of skill to pull off, overall the game has low skill floors to characters yet the mechanics are confusing and the abilities are overwhelming to learn and a low skill ceiling meaning you probably get bored of each character soon enough and plus there's only so few characters in the meta. Absolute garbage. What's the point of having 23 characters when the same broken OP ones get picked every game? And Blizzard couldn't design a matchmaker to save their lives. Between this, Starcraft 2 and their recent efforts in WoW, it's obvious they really don't belong in the business of making PVP games anymore.. At some point, it was my 2 or 3 favorite fps game ever. But man did they butcher this game. I cant give it above a 4. Miss ya Jeff!. It was a good shooter, not bad, not perfect, but good. It had a leveling system, etc. I can say a lot of good things about the game, but my review will be too long. The only problem I have is obviously the community. Overwatch 1 was a MUCH better game than Overwatch 2, unfortunately, it's not the same anymore. Rest in peace.. The most fun online game for me and the one I put most time and effort at. The gameplay, ults and abilities are Amazing and the characters too, its got a nice lore for the ones who care and look it up. The matchmaking and SR could be a bit better but overall deserved GOTY. Also think Blizzard could make a better job taking care of the really toxic and bad community, but its not the only PC game that suffers from that problem.. This game is Team Fortress 2 but bad. TF2 is objectively better than this game. Not just because Overwatch is dead.. It wasn't perfect but it was better than it's successor. ~ Your review must be at least 75 characters long ~. Before Blizzard turned an even worse version of Jastor Gallywix. The game and the idea behind it was over the top nice. As a fan of Blizzard games since Diablo 1 / Warcraft 3, it was awesome to be able to play a shooter with the same “core” attributes of the previous games, such as “Tank/Heal/DD”. Over time, Blizzard and thus Overwatch has f***ed itself, but the idea and further possibilities (which Blizzard not exhausted unlike our wallet today) still leave me fantasizing. However, it has been a shooter that has made me to this day with the most fun.. A great package: fun, accessible and extremely well-made. It's a shooter as much for those pledge their lives to online play, as those chiefly interested in the occasional fun foray. Purchased the game in 2017 and it was good for a while but the endless buffs and bad new hero abilities totally ruined the game. Its simply amazing how Blizzard can turn a great game into total trash. This was also my LAST purchase from Blizz.. Yet another TF2 clone. And all people who like this should just go and play it.. Trash game for trash gamers with trash taste. I don’t know how anyone over the age of 12 could like this corny cringe-fest. A very good game to play in team there is difrents level of comprehention, a various panel of heroes, you can combine the difrents ability to make cool things. I get many fun on this game.. Honestly just painfully dismal. Gameplay, maps, characters and all. Only useful as a source for fanmade porn.. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. One of the best multiplayer games I have ever played. Over the last few years, it was brutally neglected by Blizzard though.. Old Overwatch was best Overwatch and it won't be the same with 2. The game was just simply good and quirky fun. Rest in peace.. Overwatch 2 is way better then whatever stupid games are out there, it should be praised and worshipped for its sexy characters hnnnghh~~. Overwatch was my go-to game for years. Shame they stopped updating it and deleted it in favour for the greedy cash grab that is Overwatch 2. Blizzard no longer cares about its core player base and would rather just milk money from cosmetics. R.I.P Overwatch. You used to be something special.. the first part of me could not tighten, very fast gameplay, the game could not lure me, a couple of hours and I got tired of it. I miss overwatch 1, overwatch 2 is a piece of s*** I miss overwatch 1, overwatch 2 is a piece of s***. Press F for the good game. Curse on blizzard. Why are they taking one of my favorite games and turning it into a bad copy of itself? Now i just need to forget about it and find a new game to play... or cry.. I played a lot of Overwatch 1 before Blizzard broke their promise and ended the game in 2022. It was an amazing game. It had its flaws, but the release of Overwatch 2 only highlights how much of a stronger game Overwatch 1 was. I will definitely be playing Overwatch 1 Classic if it is released in the future.. A decent shooting game with mechanics and gameplay forcing you towards a more strategic play style.. 'Cause of Overwatch 2 I wanna to up rate of this game. Overwatch was really need in smth new, but F2P with Battle Pass isn't about what I was thinking.. Despite all the problems that happened in this game, the lack of content before the release of Overwatch 2, the influx of smurfs on free weekends, but only now I understand that this game was legendary. You saved us as much as you could. Rest in peace, Hero.. A truly amazing one-of-a-kind game. The only problem it ever had is the matchmaking system.. I bought this games before 4 years and I Still play! It is different from other fighting games because you have the option to be any character you want!. I love this game so much! I miss her after the release of the second part, which is just miserable. 600 hours of the most magnificent game on Anya forever in my memory! Everything is perfect in this game: animations, dialogues, interface, locations, peppy gameplay, chic music. I love whoever invented this game and hate Blizzard for destroying it. Just give me back overwatch 1. The game was removed from my library and completely shut down. No bot support. No private servers. No LAN. Can't even play the PVE missions. Disgusting but expected behaviour from Blizzard.. Overwatch was one of the best games in history, so sad thay Blizzard killed it.... Completely unplayable game. Blizzard have even deleted my Overwatch account. Overwatch is a scam.. Woke culture seeped into the gaming world. They suspended my account for defending my country but let others call it a **** lmao. You really can't make this stuff up. Rhe games repetitive and boring af anyways, it's always the same maps and players. Also, the player base is pretty horrible, people really don't know how to game these days.. It was a bait-and-switch. I bouth a game with cools guys, like a ninja and a cowboy, and with cute and sensual chicks, but then they started pumping political postergirls. And have you seed the new OW2 characters? It's getting worse. And if you ignore all that, it's still a mediocre game of deathball vs deathball in a chokepoint. I don't think people are relly watching its e-sports. I think this is just a money laundering scheme. I play for an hopur, and I'm done for 3 months. Boring.. What an absolute trash game with 0 thought put into any balance, netcode or even hero's functional design. Yeah they look cool, but that's it. Welcome to getting hit behind walls, abilities just simply not going off when you hit them or just getting steam rolled because god forbid you want to play something other than tank. It's an absolutely bs game, and the designers should be ashamed that they let such a half baked no salted game to be released. Fix your heroes, fix your netcode, and fix your bad employees.. Fix your matchmaking and i change rating to 9 Me being top all gold player every match yet my team is incredibly bad, matches with same players, 0 wins in 4 hours, thats not normal.. From the beginning Blizzard has had no intention other than to milk the playerbase, and over the years this has manifested in many ways, from the completely automated punishment system where the only thing that's bannable is getting reported, awful, slow balancing and reworks that no one asked for and are universally hated but will never be undone, only a handful of skins every few months from a company with billions in revenue (although they do release a couple at exhorbitant prices for their fanboys) and an esports league no one asked for that serves no purpose but for people who don't understand the jame to copy what they see on stream and be roxic when it doesn't work. It's good that people are starting to see this. There continues to be no reason to pick anything other than one-shots, which means they're constantly buffing everyone else like MJree leading to a situation where they're simultaneously broken and throw picks (against one-shots), further confusing the game's balance. They still haven't even fixed a major exploit that lets you queue for tank then pick Rog or ball, two S-tier DPSs who leave you with one less tank. There are many great reviews under ""Most helpful"" that touch on other important points, such as style over substance - the latest example of which is Sojourn, who is the most generic shooter character possible but with this trendy new crouch slide-jump just so you can make plays that look flashy on Twitch. And we haven't even got to the ""sequel"" which is more of the same but with one less hero because making tank fun again still eludes them. Overall, no potential here unless somehow a company that actually wants to make video james and not just money gets their hands on it.. Terrible Matchmaking, just horrible. More streaky than 10 year old underwear.. TL;DR You never get evened matches, it's either you win easily or get wiped easily, all depends on the awful matchmaking system that sometimes gets your normal teams and sometimes gets you the worst ones ever. I never hated a game so much and I'm only playing it because there's absolutely no other game to play at this time. 1. Role Queue Since it got released I never played dps because waiting 20 minutes for a queue is just a no no so I always play a healer and most times it's just dps moira, because I wanna dps 2. Placements Playing as a healer to get the best placement possible then on the 10th game someone from your team quits and you get a loss and it counts as a part of the placements and you get 2300 rank matchmaked with horrible noobs forever because the matchmaking system is the worst. 3. Worst matchmaking system Get an awesome cooperative team then get the worst team or the one player that sabotages the match. Means you can never really progress through the 3000 barrier even if you carry your team every game. If the game would'v evaluate the players better it could'v team up better and fair matches and this game could'v been perfect. But it's the opposite.. I have more then 1500h in this game and i can tell you, dont touch it! Wait for Overwatch 2. This Game is ruined.. The game was decent earlier on. Now it's dominated by smurfs and cheaters. If you're not top 5%, your experience will be miserable. Blizzard admitted to the smurf problem, and said they have no plans to do anything about it.. A dead game with a **** matchmaking. Prepare to wait for 25 minutes queue times only to play a 5 minutes game. Smurfs and cheaters are everywhere. You'll get an AFK almost once every 3 games. Character gameplay balancing is a joke that no one wants to play anything other than DPS.. Do yourself a favor and look for another game to play. Visual is this game amazing, but the gameplay just feels bad and clunky. And the worst part is is that it started as a great and fun game. It's the terrible balancing that caused an unfun gaming experience. Heck, the devs even openly admitted that they are biased and only want to see a select few strong. And currently are they working on a ""sequel"" that will automatically replace the current one, which shows their bias even stronger. Utility characters are stripped of their utility and massively nerfed despite then already underperforming, and strong damage dealers who has been meta since day 1 are even made more stronger with more buffs. It's absolutely mind boggling.. Before the release of the second part, they gave away ugly skins for such an event. The most common, inconspicuous badge. In the autumn they promise to show something else, but it will obviously be another crap. Another **** they want to make everyone eat. Incredibly fun game as long as you're not on competitive. The only big problem with this game to me is that there has been a drought of content.. Might as well remove the Blizzard name from their games. The great developers that were once there are all gone. A typical Activision game.. Still this date, it's my favorite FPS game on PC. The gameplay feels so smooth, and all the heroes are very unique.. how to fail ctrl+c ctrl+v team fortress2. right make overwatch **** be fun at beta but only in beta.. I liked the game back in the days when it was actually popular among twitch users, had its own e-sports and was actually not as toxic as nowadays.. Probably the single most overrated video game in human history. Bad game design, bad map design, bad graphics. An abhorrent development history involving countless major reworks. The release of the ""update"" second iteration cements this title as one of the most tragic flops in gaming history.. Best PvP game. But i dont like PvP or battle royale too much. A specially winning rate balance is not imrpoving arcade/ranked. No leavers penalty in arcade mode 15 seconds before match end. Little too dumb idea with reputation system. I think lot of things have simple solution, but i feel game has wrong game designers. Overwatch 2 - i dont thing is solution, just gives money for wrong designed skin system. At this moment game uninstalled im not waiting for Overwatch 2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favourite game of all time. One of the most fun multiplayer online shooters there it. And based on the amount of copy cats i would say its a great succes. With the launch of Overwatch 2 on the Horizon things look bright for the future.. Matchmaking in competitive mode is not very great and skill gap is literally obvious around matches. need matchmaking system or just drop the game you can literally have more great time to waste on other things. Good, some people are toxic, and it is fun lots to explore, characters, maps, game modes it is fun... only one **** point because if you have frineds to play it should be fun or if you playing gun game no cd. But as player since 2018 I can say: THE WORST MOBA GAME EVEN LEAGUE OF LEGNEDS ON RANKED MATCHES WAS MORE FUNNY. Blizzard is the worst company. 1. Toxic community as Chernobyl. Wow they should get prize for the most toxic game ever made even LoL is less toxic than this trash. I read too mutch on chat something like "" I **** your mom "" ""kill yourself"" in **** also I made so mutch reports and ONLY 2 was sucessfull. 2. We should get overwatch 2 beta and what we got? middle finger! we must wait for twitch drops from other streamers. 3. unbalanced heroes. Are you trying to play as your main hero? no just no **** way! they can't make good nerfs now brigitte is useless and genji is still overpowered. 4. the worst matchmaking I have smurf account on 25lvl and I getting 500lvl enemies what the ****? 5. and so mutch more problems... If you want to play only vs AI buy it if not DON'T BUY IT!. Overwatch is a highly stylized team-based shooter set on earth in the near future. Every match is an intense multiplayer showdown pitting a diverse cast of soldiers, mercenaries, scientists, adventurers, and oddities against each other in an epic, globe-spanning conflict.. Overwatch was left for dead by blizzard for two years just to rerelease the game with few changes in Overwatch 2. It's not worth buying at all. This game is spectacular, it was a fresh take on the Online Multiplayer First Person Shooter genre, and groundbreaking. Unfortunately I'm a little bit late to the party, so I missed most of the good things that came out from this game. Is it fun? Undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable First Person Shooter games I've ever played! The gameplay is fast paced, creative and diverse, the character design is phenomenal, most of the heroes look fantastic, the maps look gorgeous, so many hidden details everywhere, overall I can safely say that this is a fantastic game. But what doesn't make it a flawless game is the horrible matchmaking, and the lack of gamemodes, which is a shame because it really is a fun game overall. It's still a very enjoyable experience, and I'm glad I didn't miss out on it, one of my favorite Online Multiplayer games for sure. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. I need overwatch 2. Where is overwatch 2? Blizzard come back please im sad.. **** game for **** by the worst company ever existed, which even can not repear its **** broken launcher.. This game has been out for 6 years now, and it still has the same issues since its launch. Matchmaking is terrible, it's either your team gets stomped without a chance or vice versa. No fair battles, no close battles, if you're playing alone it's pretty much all depending on luck if you land in the good team or not. Smurfs are probably the biggest issue in this game, and Blizzard doesn't seem to care. They have been a major issue for the last 3 years and not a single step has been taken, probably cause Blizzard profits from people buying their game again. Don't get your hopes up too high for OW2 either, so far it looks like the problems will only get worse.. Blizzard does beautiful games, but also add competitively to the extreme, to the point of toxicity. Overwatch is no exception, pleasant the first few hours, and toxic not long after. If you value who you are, I will play a more respectful game to individuals.. **** block half of europe. I payed money for your games. Get back it . Good by blizzard .. This is my favorite game of all time. The lore is great but the multi-player is what you wanna focus on since there is no story mode. The game is great and the gun and sword and power play feels great. The characters are absolutely amazing and inclusive. 10/10 play this alot to this day. It's nice to play, and the characters seem to be colorful, but the gameplay gets boring and I couldn't play it for a long time. But this is a session game and it should lure for a long time, but this did not happen to me.. Probably on of the worst bullet registration ever,terrible matchmaking system-I have to wait 15 minutes to get players in the team whose ranks are much lower than mine.Broken POTG system.I hope Overwatch 2 will be better a lot than this.. competitive 0/10 worst thing ever, 1 you have to wait 10-15 minutes if you want to play dps","the more they update this game the worse it gets . this was a really good game once upon a time but blizzard had to ruin it, a real shame . i doubt that an online fps game equal to this game will ever be released in the future ."
21.Baldur's Gate 3,"Baldur's Gate 3 has exceeded my expectations. I didn't know Larian could even improve on what Bioware has left off... Deserved winner of GOTY. Choices matter, companions matter, skills and customization matter. Terrific writing and voice acting, compelling story. Vast amount of content. Replay ability. This game has it all. Top 15 game of all time for me.. 100 hours for leaving me with nothing Technically bad and at the end there is no free flow, you are forced to start a new game. This game is fantastic, its an all 10, 10 in graphics, 10 in music, 10 in gameplay, 10 in writing,characters and lore, just the perfect game. Terrible game, incredibly poor optimisation, graphics quality are sub-par, cutscenes are dull and boring. Characters have no depth, and gameplay is lacking massively.. I wish multiplayer was better, but other than that the game is pretty good and unique to play. It is much better to play singleplayer though sadly as multiplayer would ruin the experience. If you do play multiplayer, I really really suggest to only play it when all the players have finished their own single player campaign. I also wished there was a harder difficulty mode. Hard is too easy, and all the hardcore mode does is make boss fights have a bit more skills on them, but the base difficulty never changes. If they had a harder difficulty mode and better multiplayer design, I would've easily 10 starred even though I'm not the biggest fan of the story at all.. I never play turn based games but my first one really took the cake. Amazing RPG with so much variables, decisiones, styles, quests and maps that its almost overwhelming but in a good way. Definitely recommend this one for people like who generally do not play turn based games but like RPGs. Its new experience that will enhance your gaming life fully. Craziest thing is that more you play, the more fun it is. Great 9.5/10 game overall.. Old gamer here. BG 3 is simply the GOAT, no way around it. Congrats Larian for another amazing game (both divinity souls are awesome too). Please keep on making great games and please don´t become an EA or something like that. a true masterpiece and a game like no other in the rpg genre, every bit of it was near perfection and im so glad I was able to play it, such a special game. This was an amazing jorney! Coop jorney! Larian did the best D&D for me and thanks for that!. BG3 is a gem. All the praise is rightfully earned. Downsides: there is steep learning curve for the game controls on console, as well as the 5e DND mechanics (for those unfamiliar). It took me several hours to learn how to play. Furthermore, the turn-based combat is not for everyone. That said, this game is a masterpiece. The characters, story, music, and atmosphere are compelling and the level of depth regarding choice and player agency is unmatched.. While it's not perfect (stop running into visible traps, Lae'zel!) it is very entertaining and I didn't get tired of it before the end of the game. Date Completed: 2024-01-06 Playtime: 92h Enjoyment: 10/10 Recommended: Most definitely. A masterpiece in all its ways. Love and passion went into this game and it’s felt in every moment.. Any D&D fan would love this game. Shame only to level 12 but that is more than enough time spent. 150 hours plus and I wanted more.. I wish there would be more games like this one, where the devs actually seem to care for their players... unlike all the AAA studios at the moment. I love all the choices they give us in this game. The characters are solid and so is the music. 10/10. One of the best RPGs I've ever played, I can immerse myself in the story like in no other game.. This game is the greatest piece of art I have ever experienced, I am extremely grateful to have played it and I cannot express the deep appreciation I have for it.. There's sooo many things wrong with it that I could be writing something new every day. I'll just say that it is nowhere as good as promised and what the fans make it out to be. I went into it absolutely blind and excited as can be, only to realize that the game kept getting worse and worse down the line. I still stayed objective and only rated the game, but even then it's not more than a 7 or 8/10 if I'd be generous. Anyone making this out to be the best game eva!1!1!1 really need to lay off the skooma. It's absurd, and only makes sense if this is baby's first RPG for 99% of people and the ""professional"" reviews are just paid. All in all, worth a playthrough, but don't expect anything special. It's only held up because of the insane production budget.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Looks good, plays boring. Story is meh, characters are okayish. Larians combat starts to feel outdated, you‘re always outnumbered and have to cheese or use cookie cutter builds. Reloading because you started a conversation with the wrong character is annoying. Literally everything in the game gets resolved by skill check or killing someone. There is no planning ahead, no outsmarting your enemies. There are much better crpgs than this. Even Divinity Original Sin 2 is a considerably better game. The popularity of this game comes down to sex sells and its honestly great graphics and design.. This game is amazing. I wish the romance was better, but that's me being greedy. I was craving Dragon Age Origins, and some things reminded me so much of it... the camp conversations, the romance, combat options, engaging story, decisions affecting the world... anyway D&D stuff haha, I loved it so much and I'm still playing.. Apparently, I didn't review this after finishing my first playthrough. I don't quite recall why, but I suspect it would have something to do with having so much to say about it that I was promptly overwhelmed with no idea where to start. I'm going to have to take the easy way out and do most of this in bullet points, because there's genuinely such a broad ocean of Stuff here that it's impossible to address everything. I'm halfway through my second playthrough, a half-elf fighter Dark Urge, but my first completed playthrough was a tiefling bard. Positives: - The companions are well-developed, interesting, and likeable. I don't particularly dislike any of them; I wasn't sure what to think of Lae'zel at first, considering she pounced on my gay as hell tiefling man declaring she knew he wanted to taste her, which was more than a little off-putting for both of us, but I warmed up to her by the end. I'm probably most fond of Gale, Shadowheart, and Astarion (that first run's romance choice was Gale), but I suspect my feelings will vary the more I play and the more I focus on different companions. - The voice acting is broadly praised, and for good reason. I don't think I ever came across a character who was voiced badly or in a way that took me out of the experience. Astarion's is without a doubt the one most often brought up for this point, but I also really enjoyed Gale's. - The roleplay aspect was certainly satisfying to me. I don't recall a moment where I wished I could do something and wasn't given the option to, minus some obvious ones like wishing I could save someone who dies no matter what which I understand not being allowed to do, and the replayability is high enough that before I'd even finished my first playthrough I'd already come up with 20+ character ideas I want to try out sometime. - It's definitely made me more interested in D&D as a whole, as well as other CRPGs like this. I'd tried a D&D oneshot in the past, as well as a brief foray into Divinity Original Sin 2, but neither of them quite clicked with me at the time just because I was a little lost and had no clue what I was doing. Playing BG3 helped familiarise me with the rules and controls, so I now feel much more open to jump back into those. - I love that the companions are all romanceable regardless of your character's gender, etc. I know some dislike that, but it makes sense considering bi/pansexuality is canonically the norm in the Forgotten Realms lore, and I personally much prefer being able to romance whomever makes the most sense with my character rather than having options that would have fit them most being locked away. - The graphics are gorgeous; not the best I've seen in any game, in my personal opinion, but definitely great. - The music. I'd wager most players have gotten ""Down, down, down by the river..."" stuck in their heads before, and I loved Raphael's boss theme enough that I stopped fighting and just sat to listen to it all the way through first. Negatives: - When I first played, Act 3 was borderline unplayable. It was absolutely riddled with glitches and lag, to the point where it would take me a few seconds just to take a single step, let alone get anywhere. This was no fault of my PC, which can run absolutely every other high-requirement game I've ever tried no problem. I would have to exit the game and restart it to experience twenty minutes or so of no lag until it hit the point it started again. Hopefully this has been fixed since that first run; I guess I'll find out when I reach Act 3 again. - Pathfinding and AI can be unreliable. You'll likely find yourself going back and forth a lot trying to wrangle your companions into jumping over a gap, with them all jumping back over as soon as you switch to the next person. - The load times... they're so long... - Things can be a little confusing and unclear in the sense of the order of quests you're supposed to do or how many long rests you can safely take before certain things are locked off permanently. For the most part, you can tackle quests in any order you like, but once you hit Act 3 doing some quests too early and others too late will remove content or get characters killed, and in Act 1 too many long rests before completing questlines will result in you failing them. The latter is exacerbated by the fact that in later Acts you're encouraged to take a lot of long rests, so mixed messages. - The dice rolls can interfere with roleplay, e.g. if you have a character who would be able to charm their way out of anything but is instead constantly forced by the game to make a fool out of themselves by rolling low on charisma checks. - I wish there was more variety in the items you can find in barrels, bags, on corpses, etc. It's pretty much just endless rotten food or miscellaneous dishes and cutlery, which you can't use or even sell for gold, and it's eventually just not worth it to keep checking everything.. I finished the game even though it was difficult. 7 points because I liked the story very much. I wish the style of the game was different.. After get familiar with the combat the game becomes such a heavy hitter. The dialogue is ridiculously fun, the world and lore are fantastic & the various storylines all work really well. The game really **** you into it. Probably the best game I have played in the last 10 years. The pinnacle of RPG and the only shortcoming is the writing relative to its predecessors. A timeless masterpiece and easily one of the best games ever created.. It has been the best RPG, not only DnD but in general for a long time. Best fantasy experience of the decade.. I don't have much to say I generally dislike turn-based games but this one feels completely different. The Choices are really good the characters and story is top notch and after hearing what the dev Sven said in the game awards 2024 this game truly captures what gaming is about and the possibilities it has.. Larian Studios is getting more and more aspirational, and as a rare case their quality keeps up. This game has been praised loud and wide for its scope, world, characters, music and everything else and I will join the chorus on that. One of the best games of all time.. Work of pure art. RPG masterpiece for ages. There are not enough words yo describe. A must play.. The best game I’ve played in years. Have done multiple play throughs and I’m still finding new things in the game.. I am about 9 hours in and I have nothing but LOVE for this game. I remember talking to a friend and telling him it would be amazing if Divinity 2 had more DnD aspects to it then Larian Studios was like “hold my beer I gotchu fam” and here we are! Graphics are stunning, Cut scenes are awesome (a big buggy right now but most glitches are funny)Yes it has bugs, some are more annoying than others, and some are just down right hilarious fun, but again its early access. However I will remark that this is a more polished early access experience than Divinity 2 that is for SURE.Play with your friends, die with your friends, Make sure you don’t look that easy looking chest only to blow up a second later because it was booby-trapped! Save often and have lots of fun.. Simply the best game of the decade. Truly narrative choice without fluff. Amazing char creator. Beautiful sound track. Ending act that ties everything. I can go on and on. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You all should be review bombing **** games with microtransactions that thinks you are a product instead of a person. <3. Absolutely amazing game, so much room for player expression and shenanigans! My only critique is that the character creator was too limited in terms of faces you could pick. Just wanted something more conventionally pretty. I also wanted more cool outfit options for my character. Luckily there's mod support!. Very good depth--both tactically and story wise. My issue was that a lot of dialogue leads you down the path of violence regardless of what you want. I got the sense of being a ticking time bomb in populated areas. There needs to be more diplomatic options to a lot of situations. But it turns out smokepowder barrels are your best bargaining chips here.. The best RPG game with high freedom where you can think and do most of what you want.. The type of game that all game developers should aspire to make. Truly a masterpiece of the RPG genre. Highly recommended.. A masterpiece in the truest sense of the word. The best RPG game of all time. It was a quite joyful journey. I connected deeply with the characters and played the game like I was one of them.. Very well made, Larian Studios has my full respect with their track record so far. There is no way to sum up all the great things about this game. Since it is a year old already, I probably don't have to. I do want to show my support this way as well. Larian is a no, the, prime example of a company taking the player seriously and creating a perfect game above all else. Since the release they keep supporting it by means of major patches as well, without any form of fee. Maybe my only critique is that, compared to act 1, 2 and the first half of act 3, the end game itself felt a bit rushed, but I heard there are also some changes in the end game coming with some latest patches, so I'm going to check those out first. A must buy if you are into medieval fantasy rpg's. This game is a masterpiece in many respects, with its strengths shining brightly across multiple aspects of design and execution. First and foremost, it looks fantastic. The visuals are stunning, and the level of detail is genuinely impressive. The combat system is another highlight—it's not just functional but deeply satisfying, rewarding both strategy and creativity. The characters are all exceptionally well-written and intriguing, adding emotional depth and richness to the experience. The game’s sheer scope is mind-blowing; I doubt it’s possible to experience everything in a single playthrough, no matter how meticulous you are. The story is compelling and engaging, at least so far, and the dynamic nature of both gameplay and narrative ensures that you never feel constrained or railroaded into a single path. This flexibility enhances immersion and player agency, making every choice feel meaningful. The voice acting and sound effects are equally immaculate, adding polish and emotional resonance to every scene. On top of all this, the soundtrack is phenomenal, complementing the game’s atmosphere perfectly. However, the game is not without its flaws. One of the most frustrating issues is the inability to customize when the game auto-saves. Too often, I’d mess up, only to find that the nearest auto-save was 15-20 minutes old, which saps enthusiasm quickly. Additionally, the placement of the delete and load save buttons feels counterintuitive. On more than one occasion, I accidentally deleted a save instead of reloading it, a frustrating error that could have been avoided with better UI design. The camera can also be a hassle, particularly in multi-story environments where its positioning sometimes makes navigation unnecessarily tricky. Another annoyance is the lack of automatic weapon switching for party members during combat. It’s frustrating to click on an enemy, expecting a melee attack, only for the character to use a ranged weapon and miss, putting the entire party in jeopardy. Character customization, while solid in some areas, feels a bit lacking when it comes to the face options for the customizable protagonist. The absence of sliders for more precise adjustments makes creating a truly unique character more difficult than it should be. Romance mechanics are another sore spot. The game’s rigid approach means that if you don’t initiate a romance as soon as the option becomes available, you’re locked out for the rest of the playthrough. This design choice forced me to restart my first playthrough and felt unnecessarily punitive. Despite these shortcomings, the positives far outweigh the negatives. The love and care poured into this game by its developers is evident in every aspect of its design. Such dedication is rare in the modern AAA gaming landscape. While it’s neither fair nor realistic to expect every game to achieve the same level of scope and quality, this game undoubtedly raises the bar for big-budget studios, many of which have become notorious for releasing mediocre or buggy products. In a year as tumultuous as 2023 for gaming, this game stands tall as one of the year’s crowning achievements. For me, it’s not just the Game of the Year but also one of the greatest games of all time. If the future of gaming takes inspiration from the craftsmanship and ambition on display here, we’re in for something truly special.. A bit overpraised currently but I'd be lying if I say it isn't a super fun game. Massive amount of content and the details. The way they added all the cinematic cutscenes into the dialogue shows how much they respect video game as its unique medium. The story is half good and half bad, which makes it not a 10/10 in my opinion, because some companions such as Wyll and Halsin are handled terribly. The Emperor came out as an interesting character but they failed to write an interesting ending for its story. But at least you have the freedom to recruit or kill any companion you want except for that annoying squid.. Fun game I wish there is more face hair body type in character making because most of it I dont like. Im playing it for the stories. But the gameplay and turned based even not my muse, but i can still enjoy it. With many of strategic and planning ahead before entering the battle.. Baldur's Gate 3 comes remarkably close to being the ideal role-playing game. The game offers immense freedom to create and develop your character exactly as you envision, allowing for a highly personalized gaming experience. Whether you want to explore different classes, make impactful decisions, or build intricate backstories, the game provides the tools to do so. However, there is one aspect that stands out as a minor drawback. The character development system tends to polarize heroes into distinctly positive or negative archetypes, leading to corresponding endings. I was hoping to craft a more nuanced ""gray"" character—someone like a just and powerful dictator queen who balances strength with fairness. Unfortunately, the game currently limits outcomes to either wholly positive or negative, which can feel restrictive for those seeking more complex character arcs. Despite this limitation, Baldur's Gate 3 excels in many areas, including its rich storytelling, deep gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals. It stands as a near-perfect example of the role-playing genre, offering countless hours of immersive adventure.. Very solid game, AAA for sure, maybe a little similar to divinity (but better), I mostly appreciated baldur's gate 2, but times have changed and the atmosphere is far way different. unbelievable depth in plot gameplay dislogues everythin. Full immersion and freedom. Game that echoes a forgoten era of gaming. Spit in the face of 3A industry. Genuinely the greatest gameplay experience I have ever had while and after beating the game. Amazing single player and multiplayer gameplay along with the new patch 7 adding extremely easy modding for whole new gameplay experiences. The game really has something for most gamers and I am waiting eagerly for the future.. DNF I feel like a lot of video RPG's are just set up for failure because the RPG, sandbox formula is inherently incompatible with a moderately railroaded experience like a video game typically has to be. Let me explain. I recently tried Baldur's Gate 3. I made a character who I was going to play as like a lawful/neutral evil. Basically his schtick was that he was going to be manipulative, power hungry, and vengeful. I immediately ran into problems when most NPC's treat the custom player character like ****. There was no way to play the character as anything but a total pushover. And, the one time it seemed like some inconsequential NPC did it and I could like, kill them as revenge, the game gave me two obnoxious warnings from the narrator before throwing me into jail without even letting me kill the character and deal with the consequences. Another thing was that, early on, while exploring, I solved this puzzle to get into a semi-hidden area and was punished by being thrown into a difficult encounter I wasn't prepared for and never would win. So I was punished for exploring in an open-world role-playing game. These things have turned me off to the game heavily and I can't see myself playing it again.. Best roleplay game I've ever played since Dragon Age Origins. Hours of content and always makes me want more. Romance options was diverse but a little limited. Romance scenes were also tame unlike the speculations I heard. World building and maps were amazing.. this game is not for everyone. i tried to play it and after a few minutes i was already finding myself fighting big monsters much more powerful than me and died very fast. not eveyone will like the turn based combat also. i was a fan of baldurs gate dark alliance but this has nothing to do with it. i think this game is for the experienced players who are very good at this type of game. otherwise i dont suggest getting it. i think it is overrated some call this game a masterpiece but i would not say this. it does have ok graphics but nothing to get crazy about and the gameplay is not awesome and the difficulty is pretty hard for the casual players.. Baldur's gate is easily my favorite RPG of all time. The graphics are stunning and the combat is engaging. I bought this game twice for my PS5 and for my PC.. Nothing to add, nothing to take away. 150h on the first attempt, 300h on the second, and despite the fact that I thought I had been everywhere and seen everything. There is always something to be found, something that the creators have somehow interestingly hidden. This is how cRPG games should be made. Respect, Larian.Prześlij opinię. Huge, in-depth world, tonnes of characters and plots, and generally very enjoyable. Having played Divinity Original Sin 2, I think that the dev team really benefited from the D&D world, because this game avoided many of that game's flaws. However where it felt weaker was towards the end, wherein the world became closed, player choices became very limited, and it felt rushed. Almost to the point that it was anti-climatic (not as badly as with Witcher 3, though). The post-ending reunion was nice, though.. At all, I did not think that I would like this game. But I played it for hours. The variety of choices and very interesting quests are the strong point of this game. Baldur’s Gate 3 is nothing short of a masterpiece, and in my opinion, the second greatest game ever made right behind The Witcher 3. It’s everything an RPG should strive to be: immersive, deep, and packed with player-driven choices that make every playthrough feel **** storytelling is phenomenal. Every character, from your companions to random NPCs, feels alive and has a role to play in the world. The dialogue choices are meaningful, and the consequences of your actions ripple throughout the game. Larian Studios nailed the balance between freedom and narrative, making you feel like you’re crafting your own story while still experiencing a well-structured epic.Gameplay-wise, the turn-based combat is rich with strategy and options, and even if you’re not a D&D fan, it’s intuitive enough to keep you hooked. Exploring the world is a joy, with so much to discover that you’ll want to search every nook and cranny. And let’s talk about the visuals—this game is absolutely stunning, with environments that draw you in and make Faerûn feel real.While The Witcher 3 still holds the crown for me because of its emotional depth and world-building, Baldur's Gate 3 is an incredibly close second. It’s a game that respects the player’s intelligence, rewards creativity, and sets a new standard for the RPG genre. Absolutely love it arguably best game I’ve ever played great writing great characters almost unlimited freedom to approach combat in anyway only dissapointment is no DLC but can live without it. Unrivaled choice and freedom to play *exactly* how you want. You're never left feeling disappointed or wishing for another option. There is no game that comes close to the magic that Larian has put together here, and as a very long time gamer i can easily say that this is my personal favourite game of all time, and the new pinnacle of games as an art.. What more can be said about this game that hasn't already been said? Baldur's Gate 3 is a phenomenal experience, and the closest one might get to the feeling of playing Dungeons and Dragons without actually playing it. The game focuses mostly on characters and their motivation, needs, relationships, and more. And in this regard, it is absolutely incredibly written. Every party member is absolutely astonishing, and just when you think you might know everything about them, the game adds even more layers to them. The choices you make feel substantial. Every small character you save might return to be a huge part of a quest two acts and 50 hours later. And like-wise, every small character you kill or forget to save is gone forever. It is astounding how many seemingly small decisions in the game can lead to completely different resolutions of certain quests. It is a shame then that I feel the absolutely gargantuan size of the final act of this game serves as a detriment to the overall experience. It's not a bad act in any way; don't get me wrong. In fact, I would say most of it is absolutely incredible. But the game could actually use a more condensed and tightly paced final act. Mix that in with a few enemy encounters here and there that I don't really enjoy, general annoyances in some of the parkouring parts, a story that urges on you moving forward quickly, yet with the game's systems actually wanting the direct opposite from you, and quite a few bugs. And I can confidently say that, while mostly outstanding, I believe Larian can do even better than this.. Literally my favorite PC game of all time. It has captured me in a way that no game has since perhaps the original Mass Effect trilogy.. Best game for all times, i like her so much. Where big replaying with many choises. One of my favorite moments from the game after beating Ketheric Thorm, was jamming with Alfira and the other survivors in the keep as a bard. I often revisit :The Power"" from BG3's soundtrack.. A truly incredible adventure, where every choice matters. Easily my favorite game ever!. One of the best games of the last 10 years. Interesting plot, cool characters. Many options for plot development.. I think everything important has already been mentioned by others here. This game is simply overwhelmingly good and the first RPG where you truly feel involved as a player, because every decision you make influences the course of the story. Simply brilliant.. This will be my all time favorite game. I did not think anything would reach that again but this genuinely well made experience will stay forever engraved in my brain.. The most fulfilling and thrilling experience I ever had playing a video game quite honestly. It's simply amazing. I've never saw so many choices and such an amount of player freedom in any other game. The main npcs could be a little bit better, but it's still an amazing game.. The best game I've ever played, incredibly gripping with its details, story and gameplay, well done to those who made it. It's like everyone is new to DnD and is playing to express themselves. Nobody is taking anything seriously. Everyone thinks they're hilariously quirky. Everyone is performing and nobody is a good actor. It's insufferable. The gameplay is fine, but I don't want to play DnD with a bunch of horny shallow teenagers.. The most successful RPG game ever released. The story, gameplay, atmosphere and D&D rules are great. This game hit all the right notes! Character choice, beautifully written dialogue, AMAZING voice acting, engaging combat and fun fun fun! You can truly be anyone you want to be in this game, from a kind and gentle giant dragonborn who saves the entire world to an evil sadistic little gnome who utterly destroys it. If this had a next gen unreal engine 5 sort of graphics I would have died playing this game, you'd see my skeleton still trying to cast that romance Gale. I had this game since the early access and the dev support is the cherry on the top. This is one of the few games that I replay again and again and find something new every time. I'm currently at 400 hour + and this number will only increase. Thank you Larian Studios for showing the world how a true RPG should be made.. So I just finished Dragon Age Veilguard and ultimately survived the five stages of grief that accompanied playing it as a DA fan. BG3- you were there for me yet again. After playing nearly 1000 hours already, I turned it back on for an RPG palette cleanse. The second I heard “Down… down… down…” all was right in the world. Missed you guys so much. This game will have my heart forever. Thank you for all the excellent companions, dialogue, combat, romances, and story. Thank you Larian Studios for all the memories.. Oh boy, what a journey it has been with Baldur's Gate. Great story, great mechanics, great music, great characters, great replayability, great depth, great choices you can make changing the story dramatically! You might wonder: why not 10/10 then? Well, there were some bugs in the game, not gonna lie. Including some breaking the game in terms of balance. But Larian's been on top of it, patches were frequent and on point, even including some changes (and great Honour Mode!). If you're a fan of RPGs, it doesn't matter if you're reading this in 2024, 2025, or 2026, or whatever year, give it a try, you should not be disappointed. P.S. Quick mention on DEI in BG3 - it has been handled rather well, as the choice is yours. Are you a womanizing human who likes women with big boobs? Great, this game will let you go this way. Are you a gay halfling who prefers bearded wizards? You will get what you want. Are you a little perverse and would like to make love next to the bodies of slain foes? Say no more. Are you a female dwarf who wo","larian's baldur's gate 3 has exceeded my expectations . the game is an all 10, 10 in graphics, 10 in music, 10 in gameplay, 10 in writing,characters and lore . it is much better to play singleplayer though sadly as multiplayer would ruin the experience ."
210.Baldur's Gate,"Still holds up strong modern day. Was a fantastic experience and I love how it continues on to number 2 directly if you so wish. With a grate narrative and fun gameplay (or though a lot to think about) I really recommend this to any fan of this genre. It’s easy to see why people consider Baldur’s Gate a classic. The attention to detail is outstanding and shows an effort by the creators to present a world with history. You face almost every imaginable fantasy character, friend or foe, in your quest to find out who killed Gorion. It’s a fun game made even larger with the expansion pack. Ultimately it’s let down somewhat by the infuriating AI that will either obey your commands or refuse to. Contemporary reviews scored the game highly so critics were willing to overlook these faults yet today it’s more noticeable as something you have to deal with when playing, rather than something quaint or a quirky charm to embrace. Perhaps critics and the public were just so happy to have a fresh take on the Western RPG genre that mostly played well. It’s totally understandable as well since Baldur’s Gate successfully revitalised a genre in desperate need of being reinvented and that is no mean feat. We owe it to BioWare and Black Isle Studios that The Forgotten Realms was safe once again…. A beautiful classic **** if you can handle old graphics. I do not understand the critique about the story, sure it is nothing special but I liked it a lot. Interesting charakters, tense fights, likeable characters. The only thing that annoys me is to handle your 5 person party while being introduced to new companions on every corner.. The game is literally taking you to a new fantasy world ,where the opportunities to explore are endless and unreal. The fact how old but gold this game is is just mind blowing. The UI is so comforting that it makes you feel like being in some mad scientists or explorer's study room. The map is huge and the loading time isn't much. The story is alluring and the characters are well made. There are also PDF files for guidence. Baldur's Gate, released in 1998 by BioWare, is a classic RPG that laid the groundwork for its acclaimed successor, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. As a foundational title in the genre, Baldur's Gate offers a well-designed and enjoyable experience, though it may feel comparatively shorter and less ambitious when viewed through the lens of its **** game's story is a highlight, presenting a compelling narrative set in the richly detailed Forgotten Realms universe. Players assume the role of a ward of the wise sage Gorion, who becomes embroiled in a grand adventure after their home is attacked by mysterious assailants. The journey to uncover the truth behind this attack is engaging, featuring memorable characters and impactful choices. However, the storyline, while solid, may come across as somewhat predictable by modern standards, especially considering the advancements seen in later RPGs.From a gameplay perspective, Baldur's Gate excels with its strategic combat and character customization. Players assemble a party of diverse companions, each with unique abilities and personalities, and navigate through a series of tactical battles and quests. The game's isometric view and real-time combat, complemented by the ability to pause and issue commands, provide a satisfying and strategic gameplay experience.Where Baldur's Gate falls short compared to its successor, Baldur's Gate II, is in its scope and length. The game can feel relatively brief, especially when considering the epic scale and depth of storytelling achieved in Baldur's Gate II. This shorter length may leave some players craving more content and **** summary, Baldur's Gate is a well-crafted RPG that delivers an enjoyable experience with a solid story and engaging gameplay. While it may feel somewhat limited in comparison to its sequel, it remains a significant title in the genre's history. I would rate Baldur's Gate an 8 out of 10, acknowledging its strengths while recognizing the advancements made in subsequent RPGs. If you're a fan of classic RPGs or looking to explore the roots of the genre, Baldur's Gate is still well worth playing.. An absolute masterpiece, a huge milestone in cRPG and a game that even 24 years later is still thrilling and amazing to go back to!. The beginning is a bit sad. But the introduction of magic weapons and comrades really does a lot to the fantasy genre on pc. Before Baldur's Gate all I knew was gamebooks. First Fighting Fantasy than Dungeons and Dragons. Tight game with sick intros and stories.. Game really bad even for its time. Graphic and art style of this game pretty good. But gameplay is horrible. Its not nearly deep as its described, I even say opposite, gameplay is absurdly flat, simple and random. Only game where save scum is really OK. The first RPG game I have ever played, it provides a great gaming experience, an interesting story, and it important cornerstone for RGP Genre.. terrible graphics even for 1998 it's unplayable now better play the third part. Incredible story, the best of all cRPGs. The start for a mythic saga, only the comparative with the spectacular BG II impede the 10/10.. I have played this game numerous times during my life. I first played it as a young teen and this game left a very strong impression me. for me this is one of the fundamental games in the RPG genre. Personally, I don't mind the graphics as to me it still looks great. the visual style and how they chose to present the world is still great in modern times even if the game is not fully 3D. If you appreciate art and design there's a lot to like about the visuals of this game and it mostly holds up. overall sound design in this game was amazing for it's time and as with the graphics I think it holds up very well. I love the apparent freedom you have here, they did an excellent job in allowing you to explore and play how you want while creating a rather believable world and location which are entirely fantasy based and are mired by modern day speech and behavior like other titles that came after it. gameplay-wise they were very clever in how they implemented combat and other uses of your abilities, especially for the time this game came out. this game established the very handy feature of pause while allowing you to play in realtime. it also has auto-pause (amazing) for many situations, for example to prevent you from unintentionally stepping on a trap. it's a well thought out game with a surprising number of things to discover considering when it came out. truly one of the legendary games of the genre. this is a game I feel like any RP fan should play.. While I like almost all of Bioware's games, BG I & II are basically the standard by which all other RPGs are measured. They have a good balance of combat and dialogue, as well as a compelling story and characters.. One of the best and most immersive role playing games I've ever played. This got me to DnD.. Pros.: - Bioware. - The main quest and side quests are interesting. - A lot from D&D. - A lot of fun, humor, versatility of choices. - Music, sounds - all good for the game from the '90s. - Very close mechanics to Fallout 1 and 2. - An opportunity to enjoy the story without too much grinding. Cons.: - The characters are too slow. - It is absolutely stupid to force the player to wait for the whole company to move between the locations. - It is also absolutely stupid to force player to go towards exact side of the map to reveal a new location. - Higher res, faster hero movement WITH the team would have made it perfect. So, the game is awesome. But it is outdated. Also, if you don't like company-based games, you will find it boring. The game requires a lot of reading.. Being a huge fan of the 2nd installment of the series I cannot say I enjoyed as much the first one. However we cannot neglect that this is the game from which begun everything and so we owe so much to it.... Most games nowadays tries to impress you and you end up forgetting what you are fighting for, this isn't the case. The combat system is well build and so the plot of the story, the developers did an amazing use of every element in the world. Loved it!. Baldur's Gate is the best old RPG. The story is very good and you can control many unique character. The intercourse between them is funny and interesting. I enjoyed every minute spending on this game.. 'Legendary' is a term much bandied about these days but this game is one than genuinely deserves the adjective. Many people consider this game to have single handily have saved the single-player RPG genre on the PC just when it looked dead. It represents a definite tu. This is a MUST-PLAY for any real RPG fan. This game series is LEGENDARY in every epic sense of the word!!!! This is a classic, one of the greatest games (though the sequel is admittedly even better!). I grew up with this game and have sunk hundreds of hours into replaying it and its enhanced edition over the years. There's just so much earnest love that was put into this game. The story is great, the characters are enjoyable (though they both improve drastically in the second game). Play this and PLAY THE SEQUEL.. The character customization on the this game is unmatched, still almost 25 years late you can make an unique character to play with as far as fighting style is concerned.. It is „The little Hobbit“ to „The Lord of the Rings“. It is a good game and laying the foundation for the Baldurs Gate franchise (Baldurs Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal). Before you asked yes that is unfair to compare it to Baldurs Gate 2 but many of us started with Baldurs Gate 2 as even today it is considered as one of the best RPGs of all time and there were countless re-releases (=It was much easier to get). For itself it was the first RPG from BioWare and uses the second edition AD&D rules with some adaptations. It is set in the Forgotten Realms in Faerun. Your player character is an orphan who was adopted by Gorion. Gorion is a wizard, scholar and influential figure behind the curtains. The story starts when Gorion asked you to leaf their home of Candlekeep with him during the night. Before you get any answer you were ambushed and the attacker ask specifically for you. A fight started as Gorion wants to save you and while he succeed he dies. Luckily you are not alone as your childhood friend Imoen sneaked out and wanted to help you. So started your quest for answers and revenge. The main story is good with twist and revelations. There are tons of side-quest and a lot of areas to explore. One of the main strengths are the characters. Baldurs Gate crated so much great characters I still remember. Be it Minsc and Bo, Edwin (Edwina;-), Imoen and countless others. Gameplay wise it is solid D&D videogame style. Sadly you are limited in level (depends on character class) and have not as much choices in classes. It is the first part **** adventure. This will be my main (unfair) complain that Baldurs Gate 2 improved every aspect (I played it first). The graphics were good at its time but aged a bit badly. I don't remember the soundtrack so I wont judge it here. I think it has overall the same strengths as all Baldurs Gate games. An enjoyable story, immersive characters you are fully invested in and a world you like to explore. The final rating depends on what you expect. Later games improved the formula and I will say this decreased the rating. Hat I played this game before Baldurs Gate 2 I would have definitely given a 10/10. But others games made this unfairly look inferior. However it is the first RPG of BioWare and doing such a good job at the first try is remarkable. It was a long story of success before EA bought them. From there it was a downwards spiral. I give an 8/10 and a recommendation to play the games in order. I have heard there is a mod that lets you play all 3 games as one (Throne of Bhaal is here counted as part 3).. My rating: Sound 9/10 Graphic* 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Replay value 10/10 Story 10/10 Total 8/10** * Graphic rating has to be contextualized for the year of the release. ** Total is a weighted average rounded up where the weight for every element is: Sound 1 Graphic 2 Gameplay 3 Replay Value 1 Story 3. One of the best 2D Dungeons and Dragons RPGs ever made. If you like the genre and you think you can overlook the slightly outdated 2D graphics (Just look at some screenshots or videos) than you should really give it a try. Its simply brilliant.. Positives +Combat + Characters + Plot - Complexity Negatives - Long - Repetitive. The music is horrible. It sounds like it's from 1990 and there's not much of it. It really clashes with the other aspects of the game, too. It's like playing Mario Odyssey while listening to the music from NES Mario Bros. The game is very slow and repetitive otherwise. Skip it.. Best game in this world. this game is have verry realistic dialogs, creator team of this game must be think for every dialog.. This game is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. It has stood the test of time. The level of gameplay on this game is what has made so many great games. I believe that games like Fable were inspired by this.. Have to give this epic classic game the highest love. I remember when I was a little kid curiously exploring a thing called “game”. Kudos to this project and all the hard work of the developers. It was a masterpiece.. Definitely one of the best RPG's of all time. What makes it so special is the atmosphere of dusty dice-and-paper RPG with dungeons. The story is just another hero story but it works well as usual. It feels great to look back at the enemies you used to fight with at the beginning of the game and see how much powerful you became. Especially that the game story is aligned with this. The combat mechanics feels dated today with a lot of computation and dice rolls behind your back, but it still engaging enough.. Couldnt stop playing this game. Immersive, compelling ... a near perfect RPG. The follow-up being the perfect one.. I don't like Balder's gate series. story plot is not interesting, and battle is so loose and boring.. baldur's gate is terrible, even as a genre defining. proof is that the so called genre didnt age well and never developed beyond some lame-ass niche nostalgia fanbase. jrpgs **** on this trash. This original western RPG was a masterpiece and still provides more fun than AAA games today for those who prefer gameplay over graphics. This game was recently re-released by a new studio under the title of Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition (EE) which is 99% exactly the same as the original but with a bigger price tag. If you can get the EE version for the same price I would say to do so otherwise save your money and buy the original and install the trilogy mod which adds a lot more content than the official re-release and is much less buggy. This game along with Planescape Torment, Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale represented the peak of western RPG's in a time when gamers were being tortured by cheap and childish Japanese remakes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior. They offered a much enhanced RPG experience with choices that mattered and character building that changed the game significantly. In these ""infinity engine"" games, you had multitudes of classes and class combinations which allowed you to tailor your character any way you want. They mostly followed pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons rules which are very comprehensive. They also offered more interesting combat choices compared to the old and tired turn based system a plethora of magic abilities and special skills that brought shame to console counterparts. I would say that in terms of innovation, they pushed the entire gaming industry forward and spawned a whole lot of clones over time. Even today, we see games that have similar if not carbon copy features such as the Divinity and Dragon Age series of games. Other franchises also adopted many of the features including the FF and Dragon Warrior games. That said, the games are graphically dated so if you are a graphic loving person and cant live with anything but AAA quality 3D, then these games are not for you. But if you love strategy RPG's then this title is still very good and playable. In fact, I still replay the game every couple of years or so because it is indeed superior in many ways to even modern attempts at the strategy RPG genre. If you are a young gamer, be warned. The older games are not as forgiving as new games. Baldurs gate requires character planning and at times, strategy in encounters to survive or you will be obliterated 100x over. I've read a lot of funny comments by younger gamers on the Beamdog forums who claim that some battles are impossible when really, they just didnt bother to read spell and class descriptions to know how things works. There is a lot of complexity to the way DnD works and although there are ways to cheese the game, they are very beatable without guides and cheesing. We all beat them without both 20 years ago.. One of the best games of the genre RPG (and perhaps even the best), and every self-respecting player is obliged to meet her. Evil is here around every corner. Look under your feet, do not get into it!. Easily the best RPG I've played, with over 80 hours of my first ever playthrough and my first DnD RPG. I knew before that this game was amazing, but upon finishing this game I knew that this was my favourite RPG I've played in my entire life. Story/Characters- The main story is very well written and it's a mix of mystery, drama and action to keep you interested from start to finish. The Characters are well written and even though that their banter is limited in comparison to Baldur's Gate 2, their biography gives you an inside scoop of their opinions and a few of their small quests is honestly enough to let you know what kind of person they are. The side missions usually consists of fetch quests and the usual, kill this and get your reward kinda thing. But some fetch quests usually make it interesting by having some problem and you having to resolve the problem. Even though the side quests were repetitive in terms of its objective, the different plots, outcomes, twists and rewards make it more interesting than less of a chore. Gameplay- This is where the game peaks in my humble opinion. I spent about 1 hours just figuring out what to play and reading through all the details of each character. And too this day I haven't seen a more complex character creation than I have in BG1. The different races, alignment, classes and subclasses make it very interesting and adds so much replayability because of this. And throughout the game you meet many NPCs which can also add gameplay features by customizing their classes as well and also leaving/adding new party members which also makes it add more replay value due to the many NPCs you meet and can roll with and you can even solo the game on your own. The combat in the game is also very complex and takes some time getting used to when playing for the first time, the combat is based on Advanced DnD so it is quite challenging when playing with no knowledge of DnD. But with a few guides and reading the manual, I can assure you that you get better in due time and also the combat gets harder throughout the game so that the games does get challenging overtime which is good so that you don't breeze through enemies throughout the endgame, but it doesn't amp up the difficulty too much. So overall the combat is tedious at first but very well done in the end. Graphics & Music- Graphics are great at it's time, and the soundtrack is well composed and even in 2017 it still doesn't feel too dated. Sure for some it's off putting and quite static to look at, but with it's 2D graphics, it still shows a surprising amount of detail when compared to earlier 2D RPGs. So at it's time it was well done, but nowadays the graphics are quite decent but some may seem it is too dated. Soundtrack is well done and really makes atmosphere more interesting when walking in a dungeon or through the forests of cloakwood. Overall- 10/10 with no doubt, even with a few bugs here and there it really didn't seem to annoy me because how well crafted this game is. I never had so much fun and emotion in a game since I played Deus Ex 1. The gameplay and story quality was really well done and too this day it was the longest game I've played through and never in my playthrough I felt the need that the story was waning or the gameplay was repetitive, I had the same exciting from when I started the game all the way to the end. This game is good, despite the graphics feeling a tad dated... the gameplay makes up for it for sure. I have really high hopes for Baldur's Gate 2, and I've heard it's even better than Baldur's Gate 1 so I'm very excited to play through it.. I introduced my little 12yo sister to this game. Once I went into her room to see her play, asked ""whatcha doin'?"" - ""plundering houses"" she replied with clear satissfaction :D. This is one of the rare 10's, even though I would have to give a slight edge to the sequel. The story is really what sets it apart from other RPG's.. Before rate Pillars of Eternity, an obligatory tribute to this masterpiece, first of an entire RPG genre, the real time automatic combat with tactic pause, the golden age of Bioware till Dragon Age Origins. Intuitive combat system that aids to get in the deep plot, driving the party through beautiful handmade environments of forest, dungeons and cities, with the flavor of classic fantasy tales, with sublime music, sounds and dialogues, leaving the sensation of being part of a canvas.. a gold era of D&D rpg and gold era of Bioware It will never forgotten, In my Opinion every gamer should try at least this game, because this game is father of many games at modern times. The first of probably the best two rpg's of all time in my opinion. Baldurs Gate is a game that I have played since I was 12 and it definately left an impression. Todays rpg,s don't even compare. If you like good games and you like rpg's then you would be missing out big time if you didn't give Baldurs Gate a try because it is amazing in every respect.. Everything was better earlier...I dont like nostalgia, because I dont think that everything was better before. But there are Morrowind and Baldurs Gate 1 and 2, who dont fit in it, because they are still top and not outdated. The most genious element in BG1 are the many mods, that you can install very easily. With the Big World Seteup you can merge BG1 and 2 together to one world and play the first part with the engine of the second. In addition you get the AD&D rules of BG 2. Alltogether it makes the game more beautiful and more complex as BG 1 without the mods. The story is adult and a bit complex too, just like the great dialogs (except Imoen). I liked the addon legend of swordcoast, because you get content in a very dense manner. The background informations were very interesting and gives you a taste for BG 2. There is something important, that I need to mention and that I appreciate: You can play BG1 without any problems in Win 7 :) What is negative? The NPCs are a bit stupid to find their way. Many dungeons are tight and then the NPCs want to run detours. In addition the side quests and places are a bit boring.. Even in 2015, this game is still every single bit as good as it was when it was first released. I recently started another gameplay on a whim, after not touching the series for over a decade. Yes, the graphics are dated, yes, some mechanics are old. Yes, it has a learning cliff because few people today are familiar with the AD&D 2nd Edition rule set (and especially its spell books, which are very, very, very diverse and a result complex). But, still, this is one of the greatest games of all time and it has aged gracefully. There is an endless amount of mods to improve the already stellar adventure, and the Enhanced Edition is a quick (even if a pricier) way to sort out many bugs without installing fix packs. The replay value is still there, nearly two decades after this masterpiece came out. If you have not played this yet, it is a must-have game. It also runs of pretty much anything, so if you need a game to accompany you on a business trip long hours in airports and airplanes, this is it. So gather your party, and venture forth.. Game would be great, except in reality whether intended to or not they almost force you to play certain, forget about playing classes, like mage, bard, druid, even kensai, the lack of bard armor and the cost of mage armor makes it impossible, instead of fixing those flaws like BW did in BG2, they made a few changes and left it as is. Dialogue still ****, Jaheria's husband is still useless tool and the new characters are only good for cannon fodder, a monk with useless stats for a monk a wild mage is useless as a companion or kit.. A top notch game which was fantastic when it came out and which can still give you many many hours of entertainment today. Great characters, great story, great gameplay, great everything. And when you've explored the incredible replayabilty that this game offers there's always the sequel.... Traditional feel RPG, good system of classes, great strategical fights, nice story, majestic music, well done exploring. Negatives like path finding, chaotic journal and fetch quests were solved in sequel. For better resolution download resolution patch or buy some enhanced modern versions.. This game from 1998 still a reference for all RPG, since the character creation you feel that you are entering in the Dungeons & Dragons world by the right way. The game begins with a hurried trip that will end leaving us alone in the woods with few things and one friend, since that point you will learn how to survive by your way in an hostile and huge world, exploring, surviving, sleeping and using all your potions and arrows until you reach a safe location. Today we have mods that allows to play the complete saga in one installation with the Baldur's Gate 2 improved engine, so, is a must have for each worthy RPG gamer.. One of the best RPGs in the world. D&D system, storyline and excellent gameplay. 10/10 P.S Sorry for my English.. My favourite fantasy RPG of all time. This is the best transformation of AD&D into cRPG form. The world that has been created here to explore is just breathtaking, all beautifully hand-drawn visuals, vast forests with creatures, treasures, and other characters to meet, interesting quests to do, amazing story to read. All the little details, you can absolutely feel the love that went into creating this masterpiece. The music gets me every time. This was, and still is an incredible adventure and my all-time favourite in this genre. 10/10. The atmosphere is incredible. I can't think of many 2D RPG games that can touch Baldur's Gate. Fallout 1 & 2 perhaps, I dunno. Though slightly blinded by nostalgia, in my opinion this is either the chosen one or at least top 3.. Out of all the AD&D titles released as computer games Baldur`s Gate is probably the best of all of them. In addition to the good characters, nice story lines, clean interface and good game play you find in Fallout, Torment, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights as well as in the sequel to BG there is a great sense of exploration in this game. Even with repeat runs there is a powerful compulsion to fully reveal all the maps to make sure you haven`t missed anything, and above all most of the areas in the game are totally optional. This means that the game is almost completely non linear, letting you choose for yourself when to do what, something almost entirely lost in RPGs since the original Baldur`s Gate. On top of this the soundtrack is awesome and so are the sound effects and graphics, which really hold up pretty well even 16 years later. Special mention also needs to be made regarding the NPCs in Baldur`s Gate, which are almost all magnificent. Some are annoying, like the awful Branwen with her battle shout ""BY TEMPUS`SHIELD!"" which still drives me up the wall. Some are comical, like Xzar the insane mage or Minsc the addled berserker. Some of them have story connections, like Minsc, Dynaheir and Edwin and all of them have interesting stories to tell if you keep them in your group and to top it all off inter NPC banter depending on which of them you keep around, giving you endless reasons for replaying the game with different NPCs in the group. And during all this the voice acting is perfect in every way, and the entire system of NPC based groups gives you the best reason in the world to explore, if gear and being obsessive won`t do it for you,, since you might otherwise miss one of them. My personal favorite is Kagain, the depressed, mean dwarf fighter with a drinking problem who keeps saying ""I need an ale..."" when combat begins. Some people may want to make their entire group from scratch but this can be done by setting up a multiplayer session anyway so it shouldn`t be an issue. On the ""negative"" side the game is absolutely merciless, exactly like the AD&D franchise it was based on, with casters easily able to wipe out your entire group with a single cast of hold person, charm person or something similar, which you can`t deal with too well until about level 5. Similarly archers are a pain in the butt, and single ones will oneshot low level mages while a group of them will make you tear your hair out. Of course the only solution to this is exploration to make sure you find all the gear, potions and spells you can possibly get your hands on to be able to survive. Also some areas are very annoying to explore, and the Firewine Bridge and ruins in particular. The AI will cause you to cry in confined and laborious locations, and especially when there`s respawn. Of course all this frustration is authentic and a relic of the AD&D experience which is the setting where most nerds who were young in the 70s and 80s got punched in the nose for the first time after getting their best friend`s level 9 paladin killed by mistake, or causing the 29th level 2 dwarf warrior in a row to get killed by hobgoblins right outside town with all the other nerds mocking the victim. Ritual burning of character sheets ahoy! Sadly Baldur`s Gate has save games which break that good `ol nerd torture. Of course you`d never be able to finish the game without them, but real men play it without loading and saving. My personal record is level 5, at which point I was killed by gnolls, exploding in a shower or body parts.. the most epic of original the game stories. even time has eaten the visuals little its actually still beautiful easily enjoyable and u forget the time and irl troubles. A great game that at the time shaped my enthusiasm as a gamer, but would unfortunately ruin my appetite for the modern vein of rpgs that focus on form over substance.. My favourite game of all time. Better then any other D&D game to date because of the exploration. A really interesting world with engaging characters and side quests. Little touches of polish make the game, such as the sound effects in the woodlands, and gold and magic rings hidden in tree trunks. The environments are gorgeous and the graphics are good for the time. The combat is good, you pause with the space bar for semi-turned based combat, where you can give orders to your party members. Not as involving as Temple of Elemental Evil but still good fun and not completely hack and slash. Starting as a weak low level character makes the game much more interesting then BGII, which I found too boring to play. Well worth a play if you've not before, unless you can't get past dating graphics.. Much too hyped I think. It's an ok game for sure and back in the day I'm sure it was better, I just got to play this recently which is odd as I'm old for a gamer and have played D&D games since the 80s on computer. This has more or less a","with a grate narrative and fun gameplay (or though a lot to think about) you face almost every imaginable fantasy character, friend or foe, in your quest to find out who killed Gorion . the UI is so comforting that it makes you feel like being in some mad scientists or explorer's study room . the only thing that annoys me is to handle your 5 person party while being introduced to new companions on every"
211.Madden NFL 2001,"At this point and time football was the big one with Gameday and 2k being the biggest enemies to Madden. There existed other offshoots like Blitz but each one of those had something a little different from each other. The fidelity in this like seeing their eyes move and expressions when they get hit or score a touch down is a big jump from the previous gen. It's easy to say every Madden is the same, especially with later titles but in these still early""ish"" years they had fun. With not realistic teams like mummies, cowboys, and aliens as well as unlockables based on how you played it is a complete opposite of how the games are now. It's sad, as while this is more sim than other titles at the time, it's pretty arcadey compared to what exists now.. Madden NFL 2001 was one of North America's release titles for this console, utilizing the massive graphic changes from previous generation models. This game 3D models hold up and interactive to make for a fun experience for those who like this generation of play. The Madden Cards that were featured in the game was new at the time now seem just a added pleasure to those that like to collect. Only thing that doesn't hold up is the player skins that supposed to resemble the player is washed and feel lifeless. Overall this game is a good representation of peak time Madden and brings back memories of the best years of NFL Football.. THIS was the game that pulled me away from NFL Game day series, for good. This game handled & looked fantastically well. For the PS2, this was unstoppable.","fidelity in this game like seeing their eyes move and expressions when they get hit is a big jump from the previous gen . while this is more sim than other titles at the time, it's pretty arcadey compared to what exists now . overall this game is a good representation of peak time Madden and brings back memories of the best years of football ."
212.F1 Challenge '99-'02,"I like that this game transfers control, the character of the car is much better than codemasters and I like that this game has a whole THREE f1 seasons. This game is from the best era of electronic arts. This game has so many mods that there is even one about every season and every version of track in f1 history. Why on earth do they mention a bunch of famous drivers from those great years on F1 and not the one in the freaking cover xD that's just nuts. I'm talking about the game description in the summary. The game is just amazing. I love play this game. For me this game is amazing ! Nothing more to comment because this game is amazing ! And big plus for that you can add mods ! Totally worth classic ! I rate this 10/10. Still one of the best Formula 1 games. The physics are great, the sound effects are close to the real one. The controls are great and highly customizable, but it's recommended to play it with a good force feedback wheel. The graphics are nice for its age, but nowadays it looks outdated. But the gameplay compensate this. There are things that Geoff Crammonds Grand Prix 4 did better like weather simulation, but in overall both games are really great racing simulator. Both of them has pros and cons. Don't forget about the great modding ability. Hundreds of mod are freely available on the internet including different F1 seasons, none Formula series mods like WTCC, lot of tracks and other things. Image Space Incorporated did a fantastic job with the predecessor of rFactor and it's a great thing it comes with 4 complete Formula 1 seasons. Highly recommended for simulator lovers and even if you don't like this era of Formula 1, mods will make you love the game.. Fantastic Formula 1 Simulation, better than F1 games from Codemasters, very good physics, mods, car **** graphic? Its not about graphic, its about Formula 1 and this game doing it very well","this game is from the best era of electronic arts . it has so many mods that there is even one about every season and track in f1 history . the graphics are nice for its age, but nowadays it looks outdated ."
213.Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2, while attempting to recapture the magic of its predecessor, ultimately falls short in several key areas, making it the weakest entry in the series. Despite efforts to build upon the foundation laid by the original, Bayonetta 2's gameplay feels less refined and designed for noobs. The combat, while still flashy, lacks the tight responsiveness and depth that made the first game so engaging. This regression in gameplay quality is particularly noticeable for fans of the original, leaving a sense of disappointment. One of the game's most significant drawbacks is the introduction of Loki, Bayonetta's new sidekick. His presence often detracts from the main narrative, shifting focus away from Bayonetta's journey to rescue Jeanne and onto his own less compelling storyline. The enemy design in Bayonetta 2 is a mixed bag. While it manages to be more appealing than what we see in Bayonetta 3, it still doesn't quite reach the heights of the original game. The angels and demons provide some visual variety, but they lack the memorable impact of the first game's adversaries. The game's level design is inconsistent, with some areas suffering from poor structure. This leads to a less cohesive and satisfying progression through the game, impacting the overall flow of the adventure. Compared to the original Bayonetta, this sequel feels shallower in terms of narrative and character development. The attempt to echo the first game's story structure results in a less original and impactful experience, leaving players with a sense that something is missing.. My favourite in this now trilogy. Polished the visuals. Streamlined the story. Kept the camp and turned it up to eleven. Gameplay wise I'm aware it has it's flaws when compared to the first- but I still really enjoy this and would take it any day over the third instalment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yes get a Wii U, no its not coming to anything else, just get a damn Wii U. If one of the best gosh darn games cant change your **** opinion then quit being ****. ****...Anyway, Bayonetta 2 is easily better the original with more style, flair, and everything in between. With very few missteps like water physics and slight down time that only happen in small portions of the game it really equates to what games are defining to be. An experience worthy of playing by anyone it graces. While it certainly doesn't have the built up that the original had, it does have a constant boost of adrenaline throughout.. Amazing game. Pure perfection. A masterpiece. Bayonetta is one of the best & most underrated series in gaming PERIOD. Replaying this game in 2022 right before 3 comes out made me love it even more than I did all those years ago in my first (admittedly rough) playthrough. The Bayonetta games may have my favorite combat system in any game (rivaled by the new Spider-Man games & some others) And I may be in the minority, but I really enjoy the stories of both games! I prefer Bayo 1’s story to Bayo 2’s, but the combat of 2 >1. The story pacing is a bit wonky, but things always escalate out of control by the end, I truly love how ridiculous and campy these games get. Bayonetta herself is the icon, the legend & the moment.. The sequel to the original that improves the action, craziness, cinematics and combat so well its legit one of the best character action games of all time and worthy of best game of 2014. The Boss fights are amazing and intense. The story is solid and with a great throughline that supplements the action. The cutscenes are so fun and full of personality and life. Its just so consistent and great. The environments look really cool, the enemies are improved and lore with amazing demons better weapons and fights, just everything. Only issue would be umbran climax but only at high level, which really is so small. Its a 9.5/10 an action masterclass. Let's Dance BOYS!. A MIRACLE OF A SEQUEL. I thought the first game was alright, and I played this game not expecting much but was blown away by the vastly improved combat, dialogue, and overall story—a must-play for everyone.. What could it be said when a game is touch perfection. It's an ectasy of fabulous action gameplay. You've got no time to take a breath. It's always moving, fighting, dancing, shooting... just the best Hack and Slash of all time. The only thing to said in this platform is that has some minimal FPS issues.. One of the best hack'n'slash of all time! Simply wonderful! The pacing is really intense, great character design, a relly crazy story and an excellent combat system. If you are a fan of Bayo 1 or Devil May Cry, you gotta play this game!. BAYONETTA 2 is like BAYONETTA 1, but better. I prefer BAYONETTA 2 to BAYONETTA 1, which is saying a lot considering how much I enjoyed the previous game.. I just finished. I finished with the emulator. I did not even feel it was the emulator. It was very good. Another game I expected to the PC. I would buy it if it comes. But if it doesn't come, you can play it with the emulator. Legend is the game. Nier automata = Bayonetta 2> all games. Bayonette the best hack and slash game ever made, the action beat em up we deserved. very good game. Usually when I review something its really long and I try to highlight on both negative and positive aspects of the game. But Bayonetta 2, its so damn good that you literally have to force yourself to find something bad about it. If you have a Wii U, or don't, and you have ANY interest in the action genre, GET THIS GAME. Platinum went far and FAR beyond what they even needed to put in this game to make it good and just made it an absolutely unforgettable experience. The gameplay is incredibly solid, expanding on EVERYTHING the first game had to offer. The amount of weapons and characters and items that spice up the gameplay is so vast and incredible. Getting bored of your current combos and setup? That's alright, just switch it up and everything is fresh again. Most weapons just feel very differently rather than reskins of eachother. The combos flow so smoothly and once again Witch Time has proved itself to be one of the best mechanics to ever grace an action game, or video game in general. The amount of trial and error involved with the bosses and enemies creates for a fun and challenging experience, learning the visual cues to enemies attacks is a core feature in this game and is actually really enjoyable considering the enemies are ALWAYS being switched up. Every chapter is filled with so much carnage that I can't specifically pick out any one that I didn't enjoy. It was a ride the whole way through. Even afterwards I cannot stop playing, with all the extra costumes, weapons, bosses, challenges, equipment to unlock and even the new online TAG CLIMAX mode, where you compete for halos and combo scores. There's so much to do that I cannot even fathom myself becoming bored with this title. The story was a HUGE improvement over the first, and was also great, even though the gameplay is the main attraction. The new characters such as Loki were very well developed. No spoilers involved but this game took a really risky plot device (Time Travel) and really actually made it work. Its a split between a sequel and a prequel, as the events do follow after bayonetta 1 but they also do a great job to explain the events that transpired in Bayonetta 1.. This game surpassed the previous one, just awesome. A masterpiece !! Story :9 Gameplay :10 Music: 10 Visuals: 9 Personal score: 10. Amazing game so happy that has a sequel. Hope to get another episode I hope to be released soon. furiously tapping out insane combos while getting an erection. yeah i uh call it. Flawless, nothing else to say! While the first one is great, this one I believe should appeal to all kind of gamers, given it is a true masterpiece.. Easily my pick for game of the year (2014), Bayonetta 2 is insane hack and slash action at it's finest. With epic boss fights, gorgeous scenery, and an awesome soundtrack.. One of the best platinum games, although in my opinion slightly inferior to Nier Automata although superior to 1. Control is a delight. If you are a fan of hack and slash, this is for you.. Bayonetta 2 is CRAZY! The combat, story and characters are great and this game is VERY addicting. Bayonetta is very over-sexualised which is the biggest flaw with this game. Throughout the whole game, a good difficulty is maintained and the game does become less about the ""character design"" in the cutscenes and more about the epic story. Fantastic game, just not for the younger people.. Really good action game with over the top sexualized main character that may offend some or seem juvenile, but its a good game. I don't think it ever gets better than the first level where Bayonetta ends up fighting on top of a jet flying over a city where her shopping was interrupted, then fights a demon on the side of a ****. The game is good throughout, but climaxed in the first level? ;-). bayonetta is the best hack n slash ever made in game history, love it so much climax none stop. its very good made but the fights are often button mashing. the worlds look awesome and the enemies are very good designed. still button mashing ;). Bayonetta 2 is one of the greatest games of all time, its fill with fast and intense hack and slash action, really awesome graphics and boss fights that will blow your mind away and is must buy if you love game series like DMC, Ninja Gaiden and God of War.. This my 6th favoutite game! What an amazing hack n' slash they've maded! Beatiful graphics, giant and epic boss figth as each boss looks like a final boss in a regular game, well-done controls, best combat experience ever made. Bayonetta is a very solid character so as charismatic, and her movements and action are fluids, interesting and great. This one my favourite Wii-U games and I recommend it, if you have a Wii-U - play! - if you don't have one - play! I must confess that initially Bayonetta was a game with everything I don't like in a game but when I gave it a chance, I simply fell in love with it, and those things I initially (before palying) 'disliked' in it weren't the focus of the game and I simply didn't have to care with them, so if someone just like me could play it, everyone can play.. It's a great game, but it's exactly the same as the 1st, the story is really lame and you don't care about the characters.. Game: Bayonetta 2 Genre: Action Developer: Platinum Games Publisher: Nintendo System: WiiU (WiiU) Year of Release: 2014 Length of Playthrough: 9 Hours Total Score: 91/100 Value Score: 9.1/10 • Story: 9/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 10/10 • Graphics: 9/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 9/10 • Length: 5/10 • Replay Value: 10/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Fast paced full of action packed scenes and battles +Boss fights are much more intense and large scale than the previous game +OST is fantastic +Gallery mode after finishing main game allows you to look at 3D Models of characters, look at artwork, listen to music, etc +Multiple difficulty levels and the ability to play in different costumes +Multiple weapons and items to use and large variety of skills and abilities +More playable characters and costumes available Cons -Shorter than the first game. It is by no means a bad game, but it is not enough to make you go and buy a wii u (as i did), it doesn't really improve the original bayonetta gameplay it just makes it flashier, and being honest, it could look much better on another console. Given the announcement of bayonetta 3 i feell we will get the same sequel as this, so i really suggest to get it if you already have the console. As an extra comment, i think the freedom platinum had on nier automata is what make it great, they should keep doing what they did on that game instead of working lazily on a franchise forced to continue. I finally got around to playing Bayonetta 2 and man am I glad I did. This game is a masterpiece, I dont really have any critiques to make. Visually a beautiful game especially for the WIIU, FPS never dropped that I noticed. The story was entertaining and the music is good as the last game. Game play is smooth and responsive controls. The boss fights are epic and so many different ones. This game is a step up from the first one, I say a must pick up if you own a WIIU still. I hope they bring a 3rd one over to the switch! Please make Bayonetta with long hair again the short hair is not a good look, plus her powers use long hair to summon so having short hair doesnt make sense.. I've finally managed to play this through after buying it at launch. The game is just stunning! Bayonetta 2's fighting mechanics are hard to put down, it runs super smooth and looks awesome. I was very impressed with what the Wii U is capable of in the right hands. The game allows you to accomplish amazing combos and moves right off the bat and is literally throwing set pieces at you from the first level. Like it's predecessor, it's one of the purest and most fun video games out there. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves games of any kind. The only issue I have is that the absurd and campy tone of the narrative won't be to everyone's taste.. The pinnacle of it's genre that will probably only be surpassed by bayonetta 3. better graphics, weapons, better haircut, and more color than the first game and the music is just as good. only drawback is that it's easier.. I am fighting a Lumen Sage inside the stomach of a massive demon stingray named Insidious. Seems odd right? Wrong. This is the world that Bayonetta 2 cultivates. Non-stop action with over the top set-pieces. Inside this world of madness, Bayonetta 2 sets itself apart as one of the greatest action games of all time and the new gold, or should I say platinum, standard for hack and slash. Continue reading more at our website Gaming Tree House.. The gameplay was even better than in first game but the plot i couldn't care any less. The story was really boring and when you started to hope that it will rise to epic levels it was already over. The new look of bayonetta is ulgy. Older was better.. the best hack and slash of all times, it is Bayonetta 2. Frenetic gameplay, and it it smooth like silk at every moment, very recomended. if you have a WiiU, yo have to have this shinny jewel.. Bayonetta 2 is a masterpiece. This is the best slasher in the gaming industry. The game has no negative sides, it is beautiful in everything. Platinum Games are professionals in their field. They hold the whole genre on themselves.. Bayonetta 2 is one of the best hack and slash experiences that ever existed! Platinum games picked up almost everything we saw in the previous title and better every aspect. Its gameplay, soundtrack, storyline and art direction are worthy of a classic Unfortunately thanks to the power of the Wii U, we do not have the same quality standard of the current graphics but the game is not ugly. Jokes can be offensive to a particular audience. Pros and cons: + Gameplay + Soundtrack + Art Direction + Replay - Jokes can be offensive to some people - Non-current charts - reduced difficulty in relation to the first bayonetta. Bayonetta is back and she is more sultry and badass than ever. This game has the best graphics you are going to find on a Wii-U and easily the best combat. This game is the single best spectacle fighter I have ever played and Platinum Games killed it once again! Soundtrack is badass and the combat and controls are on point. I cannot recommend this game highly enough if you like games like Devil May Cry. This game literally blew my mind many times. You have to see it for yourself!. Graphics: 9.2 Sound: 8.5 Gameplay: 9.0 Fun/Story: 9.0 This is not my type of game, even so this game has brilliant moments, nice plot tracing, good graphics (colorful, 60 fps and absolutely great level design) and gameplay.. The best gameplay out of any game i have ever played, unmatched feeling. Stylish as ****, at times funny, super good boss fights, enemies never feel like a grind. and the gameplay in general never feels repetitive. You can beat up the enemies in a million ways. This is the best game ever created in the genre, i cannot recommend this game enough,i bought a WII U solely for this game, and i have not regretted it. It's perfection.. platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game platinums best game. Lets be clear up front, Bayonetta 2 is simply one of the best games on the WiiU. If you own a WiiU and love action games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. If you don't own a WiiU? This is one of the games to buy one for. Bayonetta 2 is one of the finest action games ever created. Its such a treat to behold the visual spectacle within the game as you string combos together and execute beautiful witch time torture attacks. Its made more special by the fact that this game may not have seen release if not for Nintendo funding it. Bayonetta 2's story is as nonsensical as the first. But the main attraction has always been the combat. Equipping different weapons allow you to mix and match and allow for greater experimentation. Want to put chainsaws on your high heels? Why not? You are also meticulously graded on your performance. It takes some real effort to get pure platinum. But it offers great replay value and motivation for fans to challenge themselves and become even better. Bayonetta 2 gives you some extra goodies in the form of Nintendo costumes each with their own playstyle. Beyond that Bayonetta 2 even comes with a copy of the first game for free. In a day where we are subjected to microtransactions and season passes trying to milk us for every last nickel and dime; its a rare treat to get such value. In a year where the WiiU got Smash, MK8 and Hyrule Warriors? It speaks volumes that I consider Bayonetta 2 to have been my GOTY in 2014.. This game is amazing, main hero this game is sexy teacher . Best in this game is Bayonetta (main character) . Graphics in this game is awesome that would be to see how much sexy Bayonetta))) and storyline is very good as and gameplay . This is very good bit am up game and this is good idea - Bit am up for sexy girl . I think Bayonetta one of the best girls in videogames, but Rouge from Sonic Series is much sexier . Bayonetta 2 is amazing bit am up game .. or my god one of the best movies of this console really if you have not played you commented in my opinion and my advice you should because you these perdion a great game with graphics that put your nintendo wii ua desmostrar its high qualities beautiful gameplay bosses, characters, weapons, soundtrack work with an incredible dedication It is a game that takes my breath hurts not come out for the ps3, should ajajajjjaa. As someone who find hack 'n slash games boring, I am pretty impressed on this title. The art is amazing, basically keeps as the best art direction on a WiiU game so far, beautiful colors, amazing enemies and memorable and epic bosses. The story can go weird sometimes, needing the player to play a chapter again to understand some stuff (the overuse of slang doesn't help up very much when it is not your mother tongue), but in the end, you find a very quick action-packed story and game, which won't give you time to get bored. The variety of weapons seems decent to get multiple playstyles, and combining them with Bayonetta's legs allow for a wider variety of styles, most of the secrets aren't very obvious but yet they aren't hidden in impossible ways either so, it really reinforces the exploration feeling. it is a very awesome game in which you can customize your playstyle with different combos (buying them) or getting items which allow to reinforce your playstyle (or compensate your weaknesses), but I must say none of these are cheap so, sometimes you will end up farming to get those precious artifacts to equip to Bayonetta, and the music is what you would expect from a game taking biblic elements in it (like a lot of epic choruses), which finally manage to maintain the atmosphere and make the battles more dramatic. In the end, this is another killer-app which WiiU owners must seriously consider to get, it is made for the beginners, and for the most hardcore players out there too so, there is no real reason to not get this game... either not owning a WiiU is a reason so, go and buy one for this!. Bayonetta returns better, with a perfect experience of hack and slash. The first Bayonetta´s game is already amazing, the second one more so. This great action game is one of the best games of WiiU console, like Mario Kart 8 or Xenoblade Chronicles X.. Keep more and more Bayonetta games coming! But don't make it a Wii U exclusive next time. And give her long hair like she had in the original. She look better that way.. Bayonetta 2 is an incredible game and one of the best (if not the best) game of 2014, topping up his predecessor in just about every way. STORY: The story once again is nothing incredible, for me is pretty enjoyable like the first game and it's certainly more fleshed out this time, but i'll admit is nothing amazing. PRESENTATION: The Presentation once again is pretty freaking good, the graphics, the art style, the music, and the great 60fps are all just superb and definitely one of the games better aspects GAMEPLAY: The gameplay this time is just as good as before, you can still do a ton and i do mean a TON of combos, some of which have been changed, you can still do witch time, which slows enemies down time and you can still do torture moves, but this time have an option, you either do the torture move or you enter climax state where all your attacks are powered up for a limited time. Once again the bosses are super fun to play against and for some are the best part about the game. There are also challenge rooms where you will need to complete a challenge like defiant all the enemies with which time or kill the enemies without getting touched, things like that, you do this to get a collectible to expand your health, magic, etc, this sections were also in bayonetta 1. There are some sections where the game takes a completely different gameplay style, becoming an on rail shooter, a race type game, etc. You also now have a hover ability which makes platforming around more easy and the game has some hidden sections to trigger optional battles, if you want a good ranking you will need to find all of them. Like the first game you can transform into different animals depending on the situation, tho some of them you need to buy them from rodin´s shop, where you can once again buy upgrades, new moves, objects, weapons and a lot of other things, that will make your journey a bit easier. Overall with great music, graphics, art style, variety, gameplay, combos, bosses, and just overall great EVERYTHING bayonetta 2 surpases the unsurpassable game, bayonetta 1 and gets without a doubt a 10/10.. Bayonetta 2 is a fantastic game, that should be in every Wii U owner's collection right now. The combat is even better than the original, runs at a buttery smooth 60 FPS, and keeps up with every fast button push you throw at it. The story, while not that interesting, is an absolute blast to play through, with amazing set pieces and boss battles. The playtime is 10-12 hours, so pretty solid. Another thing that boosts this game to even higher heights is that it comes with the original Bayonetta, except with a higher frame rate, and better graphics. The only reason that this game does not get a 10, is that it's a Wii U exclusive. Nintendo are being very greedy, funneling all the money that this game makes to them. Otherwise, any Wii U owner should pick up this game ASAP.. Bayonetta is in Smash 4 ... My feeble heart cannot take this ... I would have rated this game 11/10 but had to take away a point for almost killing me.. The first game is already amazing, the second one more so. And with this package, you get both for the price of one. It's an awesome deal from an awesome company like Platinum Games.. This game sold poorly cause it was only on the Wii U and the Wii U flopped in the market so that also factors into the low sale numbers. But I'm happy I brought a Wii U just to play this game.. An excellent game by Platinum and a must buy for Wii U owners. This game is not for the prudish or faint of heart. The graphics, and art style, and music combine together to made it one of 2014's greatest game.. Bayonetta 2 is an amazing game, and easily the best wii u game as of right now. The combat is fluid and everything just feels great. This game is a masterpiece and is a must own. Bayonetta 2 is a high-powered action hack n’ slash Wii U exclusive brought to you by Platinum Games. This review is coming from someone who has not played the first game in the series, so forgive me if I’m not caught up on the story. Needless to say, I was a little confused when things picked up in the beginning. You’re immediately thrust into the action and boy is it fun. This game prides itself on fun and action. The hack n’ slash formula is a well worn one, but Bayonetta 2 embraces it and offers some of the best in the genre. Endless combos and consecutive hits abound. The gameplay is the game’s focal point as it aims to keep players involved and engaged at all times. Kudos to Platinum Games for making this thing truly fun, something many games have forgotten how to do these days. The main character, Bayonetta, is rightly debatable to be a hyper-sexualized character and the game may even come off as sexist to some. This can be a major distraction if you let it. Through this controversy though, lies a confident and energetic action title. The boss fights are another one of the standouts, as many of them are satisfyingly gargantuan. They feel huge, much like the PS2 classic, Shadow of the Colossus. Don’t get me wrong, this game is awesome, but all of Bayonetta 2’s concepts are taken mostly from the first game. Luckily, it only improves upon those strengths. I can’t stress enough just how head-on and crazy this game is. That’s what makes it so good. It’s just random madness. Bayonetta 2 proves this formula can work, as long as you can have a solid foundation and mechanics. The story isn’t wonderful but it’s not bad either. The plot is an afterthought because it’s overshadowed by just how good everything else is. The dialogue can be chuckle worthy at times and the voice acting is great all around. The game’s visuals are not anything groundbreaking, but they are respectable. The environments are varied and diverse, as well as the characters and enemies. The soundtrack ranges anywhere from downright funny to all out awesome. This game is a blessing to the Wii U and Nintendo. Kudos to them for getting it as an exclusive. I say the more Wii U exclusives, the better. It’s become my favorite system this generation. Overall, Bayonetta 2 is heck **** time for any type of gamer. I think your reaction to the game will depend upon what it’s trying to say with the over sexualization of Bayonetta. Many say it’s just there to show she is confident and to empower other females. I just know this game was fun and I tried to ignore that aspect of it. There’s usually so much going on, you probably won’t care. Check it out if you want a solid action game that’s a wonderful time.. Bayonetta 2 is a good game, but I wouldn't call it great. It has epic boss fights, a nice atmosphere, appealing graphics, a cool soundtrack, and good voice acting, but little to no replay value. On top of that, Bayonetta 2 is pretty short, meaning that you will only get about 12 hours of enjoyment unless you want to collect everything.. Lets be clear up front, Bayonetta 2 is simply one of the best games on the WiiU. If you own a WiiU and love action games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. If you don't own a WiiU? This is one of the games to buy one for. Bayonetta 2 is one of the finest action games ever created. Its such a treat to behold the visual spectacle within the game as you string combos together and execute beautiful witch time torture attacks. Its made more special by the fact that this game may not have seen release if not for Nintendo funding it. Bayonetta 2's story is as nonsensical as the first. But the main attraction has always been the combat. Equipping different weapons allow you to mix and match and allow for greater experimentation. Want to put chainsaws on your high heels? Why not? You are also meticulously graded on your performance. It takes some real effort to get pure platinum. But it offers great replay value and motivation for fans to challenge themselves and become even better. Bayonetta 2 gives you some extra goodies in the form of Nintendo costumes each with their own playstyle. Beyond that Bayonetta 2 even comes with a copy of the first game for free. In a day where we are subjected to microtransactions and season passes trying to milk us for every last nickel and dime; its a rare treat to get such value. In a year where the WiiU got Smash, MK8 and Hyrule Warriors? It speaks volumes that I consider Bayonetta 2 to have been my GOTY in 2014.. This game is the best wii u game, better than smash and mario kart, i am not kidding. The gameplay is soooooooo damn amazing, its really smooth and the response could not be better. The main story isnt very long but a hard after game is there and the replay value is also (iv played this game 4 times). A must buy game.. Meh. Another Wii crapfest **** game. No new ingenuity just a copy **** game from a past generation and another console. Keep up the great work, looking at your fanbase they're rabid for those good old cheap games!. Simply one of the best action games I have ever played, and it is by far one of the best games on Wii U. Absolutely stellar. Unbelievable how good this game is!. Bayonetta 2 is a great collection of 2 superb games. Every Wii U owner should be thankful for something of a little more adult content to even hit the system. I skipped on the Xbox 360 version so I am getting my real first taste with this iteration. I have yet to play the 2nd game in the series so I will be focusing my review primarily on the first title until I have had sufficient time to experience it's successor. The graphics, though a little dated, are very polished. The frame rate is smooth 95% of the time. The music, sound effects, and voice acting are top notch as well. Overall it is a very fun experience. The controls are tight and responsive, and anyone who has played Devil May Cry will feel right at home. Now I will go over what I think hurts the game, though not entirely ruining it. As crazy as it is for me to say, I think the game tried a little too hard in terms of it's sexuality. Bayonetta's personality is the typical ""Nonchalant, nothing bothers me attitude"" that a lot of cool protagonist have had. She has a really cool back story, a cool costume, and a cool move set. What I found a little distracting was how often the game through her sexuality in your face. I mean even the way Bayonetta stands is primarily focused on a sexual pose while missing the fact that no human being would stand like that. Ever. I feel like the developers were worried the game wouldn't sell as well without the sexy side of the character but I think they were wrong. The game is damn good and doesn't need this ""flash"" to get people to want to play it. I think the only people who will find this amusing are teenage boys who will also miss the beautiful levels and art style. I think having sexiness in a game is fine, but I don't need it thrown in my face every five seconds. Through no fault of it's own I think most players will be using the Wii U Pro controller. This is where I found my first annoyance. Nintendo's button layout is completely backwards and I can't tell you the number of times I wanted to press the ""B"" button to accept or activate s","the combat, while still flashy, lacks the tight responsiveness and depth that made the first game so engaging . one of the game's most significant drawbacks is the introduction of Loki, Bayonetta's new sidekick . the enemy design in Bayonetta 2 is a mixed bag ."
214.Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil,"My favorite platformer of all time. The style and gameplay are excellent, full of that glorious early 2000's design. Fun bosses and a good story to boot. A PS2 must have. 9/10. One of the best platformer games ever made, and my personal favorite. The game has good graphics, good music and an outstanding soundtrack. The story is fine and the character designs are pretty cool. The difficulty of the game is not very elevated, but it can rise if you're going for completion.. This is fine. Platforming is fun, but the game(story-wise) is awfully slow.. Pretty 2.5D platformer that sits halfway between the original Sonic games and Super Mario Galaxy in terms of sophistication. It has obviously been superceded by truly 3D open world platformers since, but it's still an enjoyable addition to the genre if you like this type of thing.. Klonoa has always been that franchise that looks like it’s for children, but has a deeper, sadder message to deliver to it’s audience, and Klonoa 2 strikes hard with that thought. On top of that, the gameplay continues it’s puzzle solving in simple forms and platforming that doesn’t require a lot of effort apart from some speedy slide levels. While this game is not easy, it is trying to hit a child audience, and for that I appreciate it all the more for.Graphically speaking, Klonoa isn’t really all that impressive, but the art style more than makes up for it. From foreign like character designs to levels that feel like they could be apart of the same world yet not. Klonoa 2 does a great job of making you feel like you’re in a dream, and with the way some of these characters and enemies act, it feels like it.Action is just your standard jump and shooter gameplay, with the twist that you can only shoot enemies when you grab them, and will often use these enemies to reach higher places or unlock certain areas. The game does a great job of utilizing this mechanic to it’s fullest and while it never gets insanely difficult, by the end you may wonder how you pull off some of these jumps or solve certain puzzles. Thankfully the game has an amazing difficulty curve to it.Most of the story is at the end of Klonoa, with a lot of the previous bits just being you running around ringing bells for one reason or another. While the story doesn’t really advance till the end, the way it uses a lot of it’s cutscenes to help strength character bonds and interaction really helps the ending land even harder than it ought to. Klonoa is a slow burn kind of story teller, and while I think everything about Klonoa 2′s set up is wonderful, it really would be a disservice to spoil any of it. At the least, you should try to play this delightful game if you ever get the chance because it’s something that sticks out in my mind like a dream.. Best of all ps2 platformers. The game is full of creative ideas, well-tuned levels and a moving story to impress kids.. While the story might be its one weak point, with classic trope of ""save the world from darkness"", it is clearly not intended to be its focus, as storytelling is instead done through the vibrant environement and levels, with beautiful scenery, accentuated by gorgeous music scores that makes this a dream-like experience from start to finish. Also the fact that they bothered to create a language from scratch and then have it voiced, while arguably unnecessary just shows the love the people creating this game have put in it. Impressive in its own right.. the best of klonoa must-see it better graphic My favorite music is: stepping wind.. The game is a simple platformer with a interesting story and fun gameplay. I took a chance on this game and I really enjoyed it.. One of the best PS2 games I have ever played. This game has a very addictive and creative gameplay.. Following on from something as incredible as the first Klonoa game was always going to be a difficult task. For me, playing Klonoa 2 left me in a strange state of mind. While I don't believe that Klonoa 2 was able to surpass its PS1 predecessor, I think it would be incorrect to say that it was in any way a disappointing or unworthy sequel. Comparisons obviously arise between these two games, and for me it's the easiest way to express what I believe to be the successes and failures of Lunatea's Veil. In many ways, I feel that Klonoa 2 managed to be better than the first game at times, and worse than the first game at other times. The visuals in Klonoa 2 can sometimes be very atmospheric, though I believe they've sadly dated a little more than the first game, as I believe many characters were more charming in their PS1 2D sprite look. Levels in Klonoa 2 are sometimes very good, but at other points are slightly dull. The end of the game fortunately has a lot of great levels. One thing I feel I simply didn't find to be anywhere near as good in Klonoa 2 was the music, which simply didn't stick in my head the same way the music from the original Klonoa did. With all that said though, I think Klonoa 2 managed to incorporate a much better story, cast of characters, and message. For me, while this game may not be as good as the first Klonoa game, I still liked Klonoa 2 a lot. I only wish that Klonoa could get some love today with some remakes, as the games still manage to hold up for the most part, and with a little bit of attention here and there they could be really great.. Klonoa 2 have improvements in many areas , I think a story takes about half way through the game before it becomes interesting the first half kind of just running around doing stuff , is more character related stuff and DarkSide and sorrow becomes a part of the plot that I thought it become interesting. The gameplay heaven changed for the first one the only significant new edition is snowboarding which is fun so it's a good one. I would say it's cool enough sequel sadly the first is superior in every way but it's a good sequel and is fun I would recommend it. this game is truly a master piece its the sole reason i always pick ps2 over the camecube or xbox.. Got this game 2 months ago to relive my childhood and man this series did not get enough love. This is easily the best platformer on the ps2. It still holds up well graphically, it's fine its well balanced difficulty wise. Story is decent the music is fantastic and the levels are just fun to play. I wish they wpuld release another game or remakes. A classic! I remember getting this when I was a kid. I fell in love with it right away. This game was my childhood. Definitely recommend it to anyone!. Klonoa 2, first and foremost, understands the basics of game design and the art of a sequel more than almost any other game I've ever played. The controls are absolutely spot on, and the game never demands more than what they can offer. The levels do an perfect job fleshing out the mechanics, and they frequently throw a large pool of new and unique obstacles at the player, without it ever feeling overwhelming, while still fleshing out each and every one. Despite all this variety, the game never drags at all, keeping your eyes glued to the screen at all times. Another thing that keeps your eyes glued to the screen is the amazing visuals, blowing most games on the system out of the water, with a simple and clean presentation backed by some of the best character models on the system. The qualities of the presentation don't stop there, however, as the soundtrack is sublime, delivering infinitely atmospheric, memorable, and distinct music at all times. When you combine all that with one of the best stories in all of gaming, delivering memorable and relatable characters, engaging conflicts, a unique world, and an equally unique and heartfelt message that most games wouldn't even consider touching, and it's not hard to see why this game is as close to perfection as it gets.. It's hard to dislike a game this incredibly fun. Tight controls and a really clever set of mechanics makes a game like this really stand out. It's really unfortunate how unknown this series is. Frankly, this is my favorite platforming game, period.. This game was crazy underrated for its time and easily one of the most underrated franchises of all time. Not only is this game fantastic but the PS1 and Wii games are incredible as well. I played the first game on PS 1 and as a hormonal teenager found it to be too ""childish"" even though the levels were really fun. My friends and I were very disinterested in the PS2 sequel because it was basically a side-scrolling platformer (2.5D) during an era where most of us kids wanted the most advanced 3D games possible. I finally had a chance to give this game the treatment it deserves and good god it is amazing. The art style is magnificent and very Miyazaki-esque with a wide array of gameplay mechanics. The way they mix up the level design is a testament to their creativity. The first level alone has segments of platforming, flying, and auto-running. I really hope they decide to make another Klonoa title or at the very least remaster the old games because I think they would be far more popular the next time around.. The best platformer game ever made. The beauty,the level design,the characters,the soundtrack,the story,the boss fights. Everything is perfect and legendary. This is just a masterpiece back in the days. I really hope they make another sequel,cause I want to play games like this again.. This game was really something back in the day, although it only sold well because it was a launch title. Too bad the Klonoa franchise never really catch on with the more popular platform mascots.. Damn. Like, damn. This game is unbelievable. Without a doubt, one of the best platformers of all time. It just makes me look at all of Namco's recent failures with Pac-Man and think ""YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS THE WHOLE TIME?!"" A stunning art style, brilliant music, tight gameplay and a remarkable story. It has it all. Just go play it. Like now. Go on. I'll wait.. Knlonoa has it's next game and it doesn't have a big flop on it's face. This game is my 18th favorite game and it sure has great or even perfect gameplay!. Amazing 2D.5 platformer with some great 3d cel-shading and highly underrated. Some of the levels are tough, but you will embrace the challenge as it is rewarding once you master through them. The Maze of Memories music was so catchy I still can play that tune in my head. That level was crazy! In a good way of course!. Klonoa 2 is a near perfect platformer, it's only minor duds are its short length and little replay value, other than that, this is one of gaming's most underrated classics.. When I first heard about this game I had no **** clue what it was or whether or not it was any good. So I brought a second-hand copy off of Ebay, waited anxiously for the games arrival. And on the morning that the game was supposed to arrive I just HAD to see a review of this game so I had to see a review of it. I saw one from CJSZero01 and regreted the purchase. But then I played the game.... It was so awesome! It has the best gameplay that I have EVER seen in the platformer. The game is a 2.5D PUZZLE platformer. That's right, i consider this to be a part puzzle game. Most of the levels have you doing puzzles to advance. Some of these puzzles include, get this... throwing enemies into the background and foreground. You have to grab enemies and throw them to kill enemies and solve puzzles. You can also use them to have an extra jump. Oh btw if you hold down the jump button you can do a little flutter jump i guess you can say.... Now the game's art-style is shell-shading. I personally love this art-style. Mixing that in with 2.5D is genius. Some of the levels environments are really good and some's backgrounds are SO good that I think I'm playing a Wii game! the enemies look really nice and are very bright and colourful. The game can also be really cute for the first half of the game. The second half has a much darker and sinister tone to the first half. I'm really fond of this switch in tone. The music is... Well I don't know really. None of the music stuck with me! I like the sound FX I guess. The bosses are really easy but VERY creative. Easy is a good word to describe this game. the game JUST about touches on hard right at the end. Overall, Klonoa 2 is my favourite PS2 game and platformer of all time. I highly recommend you pick up a copy.. Very good gameplay and style, this platformer would be, perfect for children and the young at heart. Personally I found it too cute, never could get into it and ended up selling it. I think the only platform games I still own are Jak III and Ratched III (they feature guns, alright), oh and a Pac Man one, so I guess it's just not my favourite genre. It is a very good game though for what it is.. A fun, clever, and well made 2D platformer that exists in a 3D conscious universe. On top of its varied and solid use of platformer conventions, Klonoa 2 manages to intertwine the dimension of depth into not only its gameplay but also its engrossing environments. Between its gameplay, lively worlds, charming cast of characters, and music that just might have you humming along, The isn't a game any platformer fan should be without.. My very first game ever. I will never sell/trade or whatever this game for anything. It's beautiful. I don't want to get emotional so I'll stop know. 10/10 Masterpiece all the way.. I'm not a huge fan of platformer games. Klonoa 2 is one of the few I play. Gameplay is 2d.5, but all does visually in 3D. Klonoa 2 is one of the better looking PS2 titles even today. The game is charming at best. Worth a rating of 9 or 10. Its simple, but fun.","pretty 2.5D platformer that sits halfway between the original Sonic games and Super Mario Galaxy in terms of sophistication . the gameplay continues it’s puzzle solving in simple forms and platforming that doesn’t require a lot of effort apart from some speedy slide levels . while this game isn’t all that impressive, the art style more than makes up for it ."
215.Colony Wars,"This was my Favorite PS 1 game. Looking back, I've played an emulator, and decided to get out my PS 2 and the this game to play. Controls did well for the time. One button to switch between primary weapons' and another to select munitions' (missiles, torpedoes etc), with the other two to shoot them. Graphics were good for the time. The story was the typical ""down with the tyrant empire"" but put it in with Earth being evil. I really liked how the story had multiple branches. If you failed a mission, all was not lost. However, fail multiple missions in an Act, and you would be branched into the ""the worst case"" branch. However, winning the following Act could balance it out, depending on where you fail. AI is where the game was alright. Not the brightest, but not the dumbest. Sometimes while dogfighting, the enemy would just stay there while attempting to turn. It was somewhat funny. In spite of that, it still was my favorite game on PS, because I'm a Sci fi nerd, and this is a hidden gem.. I may be looking through rose tinted glasses when I watch footage of this game today, but I don't think so. It has to be the most underrated game, if not of the PS1 era, of all time. It hardly gets a look in, completely glossed over in most ""top 10"" lists and the like. I think that's part of it's charm though, being a relatively obscure, fantasticly made game with hands down the best music I have ever heard in a game, and really, a James Earl Jones sound-a-like narrator is the cherry on top. Onto the game, while it's fair to say the graphics haven't exactly aged well over the past 21 years, the gameplay, music composition and story certainly haven't budged a bit. I can't really say more than that, all that's needed now is a remaster (I stress ""remaster"", no need to change a perfect formula otherwise, oh, and get back CoLD SToRAGE for the compostion) *cough*.","this was my Favorite PS 1 game, if not of the era, of all time . it has to be the most underrated game, if not of the era, of all time . a James Earl Jones sound-a-like narrator is the cherry on top ."
216.FreeSpace 2,"I played this game over 20 years ago now, but still remember the story - some of the moments, especially in the later game, were that good!. Two decades later and still no one has made a better space combat flight sim. Certainly there are notable attempts, but this game has stood the test of time.. There are not many great and somewhat new space games out there and Freespace 2 is one of the classic great games. So every hardcore gamer should look into the game. First of all, this game is everything else than outdated because of the Source Code Project. This mod is very easy to install and improve the game extremely, especially the graphic looks well even today. Sound and Music are also good. So you can focus on the gameplay. The controlling of your ship is perfect: there are a lot of commands, maybe even too many. You need a joystick to enjoy it, but they are so cheap, so I bought one for 30€ and get a perfect one (Thrustmasters T Flight Stick X). It takes some time to learn the many functions in the game, but it is worth it. The problem is, the game is only about fighting in your vessel. The campaign is a series of missions, where you fight most of the time, so it is not diversified and maybe a bit outdated. I prefer the Freelancer style, where you could do much more than shooting all the time. There is another thing I didnt like in the campaign: You are already focused on fighting and the several hotkeys, but there is so much talking during the fights, that it is almost impossible to understand them. The story is deep, because it is based on the predecessor and the story was developed there already. So you will need some time to read the background informations. But most of the story is presented by text between the missions, so a bit boring. --> I prefer Freelancer, because you had more freedom there.. THE BEST SPACESIM game EVER. I kid you not. Back in 1999 it's visuals, sound and what's more important - gameplay and dark atmosphere were unparalleled. Since then I've beaten the game perhaps a 100+ times and it delivers fun every time. Sure now I play it using the FSO mods and updated visuals and even my kid was shocked how a 20 year old game can be awesome to play and enjoy!. The best game I've ever played. Which makes it the best until now is the story and gameplay; the graphics, of course already too obsolete for today. Ship design is also cool. I remember when every large ship fought each other with their beam cannon; when meeting with Sathanas for the first time; and when happy after destroying first Sathanas, there are still other Sathanas, and they are in the process of destroying a star!. It's a nice game, but there are better ones out there made near the same time. The controls are all over the place and there is very little polish in the look of everything. The gameplay got old fast and made me want to play better titles.. Definitively the best space-sim ever made. While it creates it's own universe instead of basing on Star Wars or Babylon 5, there is similar depth in the space of FreeSpace. The plot is linear (with a few exceptions), but extremely immersive. The game is fairly easy on normal difficulty, but ""hard"" and above can be really challenging. An open source port of FreeSpace (FreeSpace Open) enhances the graphics, fixes some bugs, even adds some new features. What's even more important are the free community made campaigns - some of which are just as good as the original one.. Never played a game with as much atmosphere and and this coming from a space based shooter! PLEASE play this with a force feedback joystick. Wrestling the juddering controls amid waves of flak or fighting the Flailing Joystick after a collision just made this game that much more engrossing :). it computer games one of the rarest things is when everything come together flawlessly. you know those incredible games with incredible gameplay but bad graphics, or the ones with incredible graphics but bad story, etc. etc. well, in freespace 2 everything just came together and you don't have to make a single sacrifice to enjoy it. flawless victory!. What an amazing space combat simulation! It wasn't a great innovative game back then, but it took all the things of the genre to the edge! Game-play, story(-telling), graphics, controls, (and big battleships ^^). All flawless in my opinion and up till now never reached by any other space combat sim. This great shining star gives you all, whats fighting in space would feel like, to bad, this genre was near to dead back at its release. Nowadays the kids don't know, what a joystick is, time has changed. Enough said, i'm going to reinstall and play it again. The best space shooter ever. It's absolutely incredible today, and it was released almost 15 years ago now. Volition?? Hellooo? I want my Freespace 3, 4, and 5, RIGHT NOW... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. FREESPACE 2: First of all, I'm not a good Space Sim gamer, but this is a pretty fun game for the newcomers of the genre. Here's Freespace 2. It's a beautiful game for a 1999 game. It feels like a 2004-5 game. This game was actually intended to be a spin-off for Descent, but right now it's more stand-alone on it's own. The gameplay was just your normal Space Sim. You lock on missiles and shoot your enemy's vehicle. The vehicle designs are not bad actually. You have your lock on target missiles and your normal infinite laser beam gun. The game is pretty challenging and it can be very intense too. If you are new to the genre like me, don't worry! As soon as you start the game, you'll greeted with a pretty good in-game tutorial. The single player campaign was great with an interesting storyline too. The voice acting is top-notch on this game. It feels like you're playing a Sci-Fi movie instead ****. I really liked the theme for the game. The space just feels really like a space. Though there are some problems I have no this game. It really takes practice your you to hit a target with your laser beam as you won't hit it perfectly. And If you have a netbook, this game works well, but the problem is that you don't have enough buttons on your keyboard. The game uses more than all the buttons on your keyboard. Most netbooks don't have keypads which was used on this game if you want to strafe your ship. If you want to, just use your joystick. OVERALL: FreeSpace 2 is a good game. I can't really rate it higher because I'm a noob on the genre. So I can't really enjoy the overall feel of the game. If you really liked Space Sim games, go ahead and pick Freespace 2. You will be very satisfied, and newcomers should check it out. [7/10] ""Good"". Epic, and yet one of the saddest games in history. We will never see a Freespace 3 and the world is a dimmer place for it! I will never learn why the Shivans want to kill us, or how far Lt. Snipes career will go now.. I still play this game, along with the original, at least once a year or two. Every time I play it, I still have genuine fun, which is more than I can say even new games these days. A true masterpiece in category, this game lives up the original and then some. Haven't played it? Play it.. Absolutely excellent game. It has an elegantly simple (but very compelling) plot, and excellent graphics. Although it involves enough controls to blur the line between 'simulator' and 'game,' this is actually a highlight--the control scheme is well-designed and unobtrusive. Ever 2-3 years I try it out again and find that I instinctively remember how to play and shortly thereafter why I liked it so much. Even better, the original Freespace 2 has been vastly improved since it's release (see the Freespace Source Code Project). My only regret while playing this was that I could never find anyone on the multiplayer servers, despite rumors of crazy tournament-based fun, etc.. It's a shame this game didn't get the attention it deserves, because it's a real masterpiece. I very rarely give a perfect score, but Freespace 2 deserves it. The graphics, although old, are still more spectacular than most games I've seen in the past few years. The sound effects and the soundtrack could not have been done better, the gameplay is amazing and the plot and storytelling are among the best I've seen. If you like space simulators, you need to buy this game.. A commercial product lovingly crafted with care and detail. A scifi story epic in scope and layered with mysteries. An instant classic with legions of diehard fans in a niche genre. Boy, they don't make em like this anymore. All these sentences describe Volition's much beloved FreeSpace 2. Not to be confused with the partitioning utility software, FS2 is a scifi space simulation which deals with an alien threat to humanity out among the stars. Sound cliched? Yes, it is. But combine the best aspects of space sims (Wing Commander/TIE Fighter) and polish it until it gleams with radiant storytelling and space environments, and you've got this treasured masterpiece. The first FreeSpace got everything pretty much right, but Volition outdid themselves on their second outing. Introducing dense nebulas to their already painterly regular space environs, the cosmic ether is a wonderful place to fight in. The pace of the game is leisurely at the beginning, but quickly ramps up to a deadly tempo as you fight to save humans and their Vasudan allies from the return of the Shivans, the antagonists of the first game. And boy, they return with a vengeance. Don't get comfortable now that mankind's built a huge new capital ship named the GTVA Colossus, the Shivans can more than match it. The twists and turns in the narrative are never anything less then captivating, and the entire game does everything to make you feel as if you're part of an epic struggle between spacefaring civilizations. In the end, questions will linger, which unfortunately must remain unanswered as it doesn't look like we'll ever get a Freespace 3 due to poor sales of FS2. One of the greatest injustices in gaming history.. FS2 is just one of the best space simulators you'll ever see, and with the new graphics system made by Hard-Light Productions you'll experience a flawless AI, epic sound, great storyline and much more: all in a perfect ""ooh! shiny!"" graphics, and there is even an online mode! To point some flaws, if you are into online communities, HLP won't be your average community: just missing a bunch of days can leave you way behind the discussion. Some guys told me that once there was a ""squadwar"" games, and you can see someone talking about that feauture on the other reviews below. This is only partially true: there is a multiplayer schedule, but the servers are almost deserted even during scheduled games, but when there is something up, fun is guaranteed!!. Greatest combat space sim ever made fullstop. Probably my favourite PC game ever and one of the last of dead breed of games the combat space sim. If you ever enjoyed Tie fighter/X-wing/rogue squadron then get yourself a joystick and grab this game and freespace source code project (the community upgrade) and prepare to fall in love.",two decades later and still no one has made a better space combat flight sim . this game is everything else than outdated because of the Source Code Project . the game is based on the predecessor and the story was developed there already .
217.Colony Wars,"This was my Favorite PS 1 game. Looking back, I've played an emulator, and decided to get out my PS 2 and the this game to play. Controls did well for the time. One button to switch between primary weapons' and another to select munitions' (missiles, torpedoes etc), with the other two to shoot them. Graphics were good for the time. The story was the typical ""down with the tyrant empire"" but put it in with Earth being evil. I really liked how the story had multiple branches. If you failed a mission, all was not lost. However, fail multiple missions in an Act, and you would be branched into the ""the worst case"" branch. However, winning the following Act could balance it out, depending on where you fail. AI is where the game was alright. Not the brightest, but not the dumbest. Sometimes while dogfighting, the enemy would just stay there while attempting to turn. It was somewhat funny. In spite of that, it still was my favorite game on PS, because I'm a Sci fi nerd, and this is a hidden gem.. I may be looking through rose tinted glasses when I watch footage of this game today, but I don't think so. It has to be the most underrated game, if not of the PS1 era, of all time. It hardly gets a look in, completely glossed over in most ""top 10"" lists and the like. I think that's part of it's charm though, being a relatively obscure, fantasticly made game with hands down the best music I have ever heard in a game, and really, a James Earl Jones sound-a-like narrator is the cherry on top. Onto the game, while it's fair to say the graphics haven't exactly aged well over the past 21 years, the gameplay, music composition and story certainly haven't budged a bit. I can't really say more than that, all that's needed now is a remaster (I stress ""remaster"", no need to change a perfect formula otherwise, oh, and get back CoLD SToRAGE for the compostion) *cough*.","this was my Favorite PS 1 game, if not of the era, of all time . it has to be the most underrated game, if not of the era, of all time . a James Earl Jones sound-a-like narrator is the cherry on top ."
218.FreeSpace 2,"I played this game over 20 years ago now, but still remember the story - some of the moments, especially in the later game, were that good!. Two decades later and still no one has made a better space combat flight sim. Certainly there are notable attempts, but this game has stood the test of time.. There are not many great and somewhat new space games out there and Freespace 2 is one of the classic great games. So every hardcore gamer should look into the game. First of all, this game is everything else than outdated because of the Source Code Project. This mod is very easy to install and improve the game extremely, especially the graphic looks well even today. Sound and Music are also good. So you can focus on the gameplay. The controlling of your ship is perfect: there are a lot of commands, maybe even too many. You need a joystick to enjoy it, but they are so cheap, so I bought one for 30€ and get a perfect one (Thrustmasters T Flight Stick X). It takes some time to learn the many functions in the game, but it is worth it. The problem is, the game is only about fighting in your vessel. The campaign is a series of missions, where you fight most of the time, so it is not diversified and maybe a bit outdated. I prefer the Freelancer style, where you could do much more than shooting all the time. There is another thing I didnt like in the campaign: You are already focused on fighting and the several hotkeys, but there is so much talking during the fights, that it is almost impossible to understand them. The story is deep, because it is based on the predecessor and the story was developed there already. So you will need some time to read the background informations. But most of the story is presented by text between the missions, so a bit boring. --> I prefer Freelancer, because you had more freedom there.. THE BEST SPACESIM game EVER. I kid you not. Back in 1999 it's visuals, sound and what's more important - gameplay and dark atmosphere were unparalleled. Since then I've beaten the game perhaps a 100+ times and it delivers fun every time. Sure now I play it using the FSO mods and updated visuals and even my kid was shocked how a 20 year old game can be awesome to play and enjoy!. The best game I've ever played. Which makes it the best until now is the story and gameplay; the graphics, of course already too obsolete for today. Ship design is also cool. I remember when every large ship fought each other with their beam cannon; when meeting with Sathanas for the first time; and when happy after destroying first Sathanas, there are still other Sathanas, and they are in the process of destroying a star!. It's a nice game, but there are better ones out there made near the same time. The controls are all over the place and there is very little polish in the look of everything. The gameplay got old fast and made me want to play better titles.. Definitively the best space-sim ever made. While it creates it's own universe instead of basing on Star Wars or Babylon 5, there is similar depth in the space of FreeSpace. The plot is linear (with a few exceptions), but extremely immersive. The game is fairly easy on normal difficulty, but ""hard"" and above can be really challenging. An open source port of FreeSpace (FreeSpace Open) enhances the graphics, fixes some bugs, even adds some new features. What's even more important are the free community made campaigns - some of which are just as good as the original one.. Never played a game with as much atmosphere and and this coming from a space based shooter! PLEASE play this with a force feedback joystick. Wrestling the juddering controls amid waves of flak or fighting the Flailing Joystick after a collision just made this game that much more engrossing :). it computer games one of the rarest things is when everything come together flawlessly. you know those incredible games with incredible gameplay but bad graphics, or the ones with incredible graphics but bad story, etc. etc. well, in freespace 2 everything just came together and you don't have to make a single sacrifice to enjoy it. flawless victory!. What an amazing space combat simulation! It wasn't a great innovative game back then, but it took all the things of the genre to the edge! Game-play, story(-telling), graphics, controls, (and big battleships ^^). All flawless in my opinion and up till now never reached by any other space combat sim. This great shining star gives you all, whats fighting in space would feel like, to bad, this genre was near to dead back at its release. Nowadays the kids don't know, what a joystick is, time has changed. Enough said, i'm going to reinstall and play it again. The best space shooter ever. It's absolutely incredible today, and it was released almost 15 years ago now. Volition?? Hellooo? I want my Freespace 3, 4, and 5, RIGHT NOW... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. FREESPACE 2: First of all, I'm not a good Space Sim gamer, but this is a pretty fun game for the newcomers of the genre. Here's Freespace 2. It's a beautiful game for a 1999 game. It feels like a 2004-5 game. This game was actually intended to be a spin-off for Descent, but right now it's more stand-alone on it's own. The gameplay was just your normal Space Sim. You lock on missiles and shoot your enemy's vehicle. The vehicle designs are not bad actually. You have your lock on target missiles and your normal infinite laser beam gun. The game is pretty challenging and it can be very intense too. If you are new to the genre like me, don't worry! As soon as you start the game, you'll greeted with a pretty good in-game tutorial. The single player campaign was great with an interesting storyline too. The voice acting is top-notch on this game. It feels like you're playing a Sci-Fi movie instead ****. I really liked the theme for the game. The space just feels really like a space. Though there are some problems I have no this game. It really takes practice your you to hit a target with your laser beam as you won't hit it perfectly. And If you have a netbook, this game works well, but the problem is that you don't have enough buttons on your keyboard. The game uses more than all the buttons on your keyboard. Most netbooks don't have keypads which was used on this game if you want to strafe your ship. If you want to, just use your joystick. OVERALL: FreeSpace 2 is a good game. I can't really rate it higher because I'm a noob on the genre. So I can't really enjoy the overall feel of the game. If you really liked Space Sim games, go ahead and pick Freespace 2. You will be very satisfied, and newcomers should check it out. [7/10] ""Good"". Epic, and yet one of the saddest games in history. We will never see a Freespace 3 and the world is a dimmer place for it! I will never learn why the Shivans want to kill us, or how far Lt. Snipes career will go now.. I still play this game, along with the original, at least once a year or two. Every time I play it, I still have genuine fun, which is more than I can say even new games these days. A true masterpiece in category, this game lives up the original and then some. Haven't played it? Play it.. Absolutely excellent game. It has an elegantly simple (but very compelling) plot, and excellent graphics. Although it involves enough controls to blur the line between 'simulator' and 'game,' this is actually a highlight--the control scheme is well-designed and unobtrusive. Ever 2-3 years I try it out again and find that I instinctively remember how to play and shortly thereafter why I liked it so much. Even better, the original Freespace 2 has been vastly improved since it's release (see the Freespace Source Code Project). My only regret while playing this was that I could never find anyone on the multiplayer servers, despite rumors of crazy tournament-based fun, etc.. It's a shame this game didn't get the attention it deserves, because it's a real masterpiece. I very rarely give a perfect score, but Freespace 2 deserves it. The graphics, although old, are still more spectacular than most games I've seen in the past few years. The sound effects and the soundtrack could not have been done better, the gameplay is amazing and the plot and storytelling are among the best I've seen. If you like space simulators, you need to buy this game.. A commercial product lovingly crafted with care and detail. A scifi story epic in scope and layered with mysteries. An instant classic with legions of diehard fans in a niche genre. Boy, they don't make em like this anymore. All these sentences describe Volition's much beloved FreeSpace 2.

219.Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal,"This builds upon what makes the previous games so good. I wasn't a fan of the enemy veriety, level design, or final boss.. Probably my favorite story and Villain in the series, the humor on this it's on point but gameplay wise it's a slight downgrade from the first two entries. The levels are more linear, lack of multi-paths, Lazy fight arenas instead of fully flesh levels, mediocre ost but it still in the top 5 of ratchet and clank game in my eyes. 8.5/10. man i love this game, ot add everything it still is alot of fun to this day!. Good game, but it falls short on many Ratchet staples. On the postive side it has: refined mechanics (jump height, vendor), a great villain and great jokes, great weapons (mostly from rac 2), a great soundtrack, qwark vid-comics. On the other hand we have: No grind rails, no races, no space combat. Then almost no multiple paths to choose from at the start of each planet. A very dull (brown or orange) colour palette for 80% of planets as well as the HUD. Several boring parts taken from multiplayer maps (Marcadia section 2, Rilgar, Aridia). The hacker Puzzle may not be bad in itself, but it's horrible for replayability. Justbeing forced to play that minigame for several minutes is a huge reason for me to not replay the game. Gameplay 7/10 (level design, weapons, combat, gadgets, paths, bonus areas, arenas, races, grindrails, spaceship combat, bosses, replayability, enemy diversity, etc.) Presentation, Mood and Character 10/10 (Graphics, soundtrack, lines, jokes, etc.) Story 11/10 (Plot, Heroes Villains, NPCs, character development, etc.). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Up Your Arsenal is, perhaps, the defining Ratchet & Clank game. It focuses far more on combat, weapons, and humor then any of the past games while still having enough platforming to spread it out and that’s what makes it better. With multiplayer to deal with and challenge mode being double the fun as the first run was, makes this great game greater.. This game is just a masterpiece what else can we say about it?. ""Up Your Arsenal"" expertly blends third-person shooting and platforming, offering a humor-infused yet compelling storyline, diverse gameplay, and flawless graphics.. peak RAC. Edgy, cool, adult humor, great all around. Gameplay on point, music is awesome.. Nostalgia aside, this game, nearly 20 years later still holds up better than the majority of today's games, That in itself is an insane feat. Pros: - The story is actually interesting. While clearly directed at a younger audience, there are still narratives included which older players can enjoy, none of the humour feels forced or out of place like it does in modern games. - The different weapons are fun to use. Being able to use a hoover to **** up smaller enemies to throw them out at bigger enemies is a nice little gimmick, to name one. - The arena is a nice little side area with some cool bosses and obstacle courses. - Doctor Nefarious is just an iconic villain and I'd say he's easily the best villain from the Ratchet and Clank series - The different planets as missions is quite a unique way of introducing new enemies and environments and it makes the player actually want to progress through the story to see new planets. Cons: - Although I didn't mind them, the Clank levels in which you control Giant Clank just don't hold the same value as just playing through the rest of the game. - Some of the hacking minigames can be a little frustrating and it brings you out of the action of the main game. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal stands proudly as the epitome of PS2 gaming excellence. Its exceptional gameplay, witty humor, and engaging storyline make it an unforgettable title. The game seamlessly blends action, platforming, and humor, creating an experience that's both captivating and thoroughly enjoyable. Up Your Arsenal's enduring appeal is a testament to its timeless design, offering an adventure that's as engaging today as it was upon its release. It's a must-play gem that showcases the best of what gaming has to offer, and it continues to hold a special place in the hearts of gamers everywhere.. An utterly engrossing single-player adventure-shooter hybrid that offers one of the greatest possible experiences available on the PS2. Up Your Arsenal represents Insomniac at their best - the plot, characters, graphics and gameplay in this game are all phenomenal, and none of these aspects ever falter in favour of another. The game is fast-paced, engaging and filled with personality. While the game may falter due to its age (as it is now almost 20 years old), this game represented the pinnacle of what was available at the time of this game's release, and I cannot find much, if anything, to critique about this game, especially when considering its release date. If you have any interest in a single-player shooter-adventure-collectathon hybrid with some of the most hilarious character interactions in any video game, I encourage you to play this game. Up Your Arsenal provides an amazing experience without any of the narrative pretence one might expect from a modern Insomniac video game, and simultaneously manages not to skimp on any other gameplay elements while doing so.. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal is a 2004 3D platform video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony.. My favorite ps2 game of all time. I had a save file where I completed the game 36 times. Couldn't get enough of it.. the game is cool it has a good gameplay but the lives are hard to find and when you die you go back a long way. Noticeably worse than its predecessor. Smaller gameplay variety, shorter campaign and less funny characters.. This game was groundbreaking when it came out. The shooting mechanics are very fun, many guns you can experiment with, and a good amount of action. The characters and the story are alright, but there are some actual funny moments and charming dialogue. As for the level design, it's creative and most areas look cool. You can visit and explore planets that are vastly different from each other, and you can participate in events, try out some game-modes or spend your time customizing your own ship. There are few mini games that can be frustrating but nothing to ruin your experience. And lastly, the multiplayer is nothing special but it's still enjoyable, you can even play split screen co-op with your friends and just goof around. This is my favorite Ratchet & Clank game, it didn't age very well in some ways but it's a solid game nonetheless. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. this is the best game ever....................................................................................... My favorite Ratchet and Clank game, I rank it among some of the best games ever made. I hated this game so much, but now I surely know, which things are bad in this game. 1). I think developers shouldn't return old planets, because they got their copies, which are much worse. 2). There could be fully new OST, but many tracks were just moved from R&C 1 and R&C 2 to R&C3. Some tracks got little remixes, but changes aren't so noticeable. Generally, it's good game, but it could be better if not those flaws.. Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal is the icing on the cake **** franchise.. Ok, so Up Your Arsenal is overrated. This was my first Ratchet and Clank game and i do still love it. Its just that there are many things the two games before did better. Story is fun enough, Dr. Nefarious is a funny and loveable villian, but Lawrence is also needed and him sometimes roasting Nefarious without the latter realising it is hillarious. In fact, this is one of the funniest RAC games of them all. Insomniac should return to the kind of raunchy, edgy humor of this game. The Galactic Rangers have so much fun banter. Gameplay is as good as ever. Lots of new and amazing weapons like the Plasma Whip, Shock Blaster and returning weapons like the Agents of Doom, who can now be leveld up! Arena combat has mostly been improved. The addition of obstacle courses was great and i wished it was implemented in future games. The arena announcer is kinda annoying and its a shame i can't explore the space station that holds the arena combat. Annihilation Nation is a fantastic name. The bosses in this game are very good and the final battle against Nefarious is fun and challenging, but the battle against the Biobliterator is just lame. Levels is where the game falters for me. They are not as detailed as before and are abit too linear for my taste. I only truly love Florana (mostly due to nostalgia since it was basically the first planet i played in the whole franchise), Qwark's hideout and Koros. All three have catchy soundtracks and are fun to traverse. Other planets are fine enough, but not very memorable. Returning levels gets its even worse. Aridia and Blackwater City are there in name only, Blackwater City has that wonderful tune, but could have been a whole different planet all togheter if the theme was not there. Kerwan is treated better, but looks nowhere near as good as in the first game and Veldin is allmost completely butchered. Collecathon also **** in this game. Its placed in claustrophobic tunnels, that can make me dizzy and is crawling those annoying ameboids. There is no flying, racing or grindrail sections and these things are integral to Ratchet and Clank of ya ask me, at least Flying and Grindrails. Music is still very good, though some tracks are reused. Up Your Arsenal is a great RAC game for sure, but both the first game and Going Commando are much better imo.. Personally This Is Not My Type Of Game, It Has Decent Mechanics But Its Something I Wont Play Again. The reason why i am glad i bought a PS2, even though PS3 was out and was too costly.. Would love to play again from the beginning... My favorite game in my favorite gameseries. If you like ratchet and clank and haven´t played this one it´s a must play.. Fantastic culmination of previous entries and a superb finale to the original trilogy.. this is whitout a doubt the best game of the franchise i love the arsenal, the planets,the arena i love everything about this game. Pretty much the same thing as the second game, in a good way. Silght improvements here and there.. The multiplayer mode in this game is a blast. Ratchet and Clank games are always so fun.. i love this game, i used to play it with my dad when i was younger, its amazing.. amazing game, my favorite on the PS2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. amazing game, my favorite on the PS2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Another completely ok RATCHET & CLANK game, Which is weird because I remember this being the best in the series but my childhood memories Has once again failed me , What what is it that makes it still ok I would say to their environment are kind of uninspiring if you compare it to the first game then it looks Bland. Ratchet and Clank is one of these Games that are so original, you can play them for hours and they never get boring because they offer so much different gameplay and an interesting World + Characters.. One of the best games ever!! Amazing story , amazing villain, its funny, gameplay is great, absolute masterpiece.. A Classic. The memories I have of playing through the original trilogy are ones that I will always cherish.. Really great platformer for the PS2 and arguably the best Ratchet and Clank game in the series. Groundbreaking when it came out yet still a great game nonetheless, very fun shooting mechanics, good sense of humor, interesting story, nice characters, decent side content and fun multiplayer.. Going Commando is an upgrade that’s worth all of your money, and now, Ratchet and Clank’s brand new and third adventure, Up Your Arsenal is what a called a bonafide masterpiece. Insomniac’s new follow up after the sequel paid off after incorporating a highly requested feature that fans demanded and it turned out to be the very best games ever made. Now that’s what I call an all-in-one complimentary package!. One of the best, and to many, THE best game in the R&C franchise, UYA is a great time for anyone of any age. The game has characters and events that are amusing and funny in a way that can appeal to all ages at once, with gameplay that makes it a great challenge for children, a nice way to casually game for adults, and is enjoyable for all. Weapon design, variety, balance, and the game's economy are improved from the 2nd entry, resolving its greatest flaw. However UYA suffers from its short development time, with a minor reduction in length to the game as well as the simplification of level and art design. Make no mistake, UYA lives up to its reputation and is a must play for anyone with a PS2 or 3.. Best Platformer game on PS2. On every planet something different game is not boring. Very good weapon upgrade system. NG+ and Multiplayer is also amazing. Ratchet and Clank perfected. Easily the best story and characters in the series, along with great replay value and some of the games best weapons.. This is the best ratchet and clank game without any doubt Best gameplay with best conversation and best multi-player of all time. Even more shooting and less platforming here, second game already went in that direction but here it gets just too much on a shooting side for my liking. Still a fun game with some neat ideas like your own big ship, 2d platofmer elements with Quark or even more complex gun progression system. But you are going to shoot an awful lot.. If you were to begin your craze for Ratchet & Clank, this third entry had a great story and innovative level design of the PS2 era. If you don't like platforms, you clearly haven't played Ratchet and Clank UYA yet. Graphics & Design 10; Audio 9; Controls & Gameplay 10 Total: 10 - Masterpiece. One of the quintessential ps2 platforms / adventure, slightly higher than its predecessors although, in my opinion, it still does not reach the level of those of the competition jak and daxter or jak 2.. 9.5 out of 10 - This game, along with Locked and Loaded, was my childhood. One of my favourite games ever made. Scoring Scale: 1 - (AWFUL) Among the worst games ever made. The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.. This game is an absolute gem of platformer/3rd person shooter genre! It's creative, witty, even dramatic. I mean, incredibly innovative story just can move you to tears, from laughter, from sadness, from excitement, from just greatness! I LOVE this game, just love it!. This game is an absolute gem! I love it! It's wonderfully cinematic (literally it has a 1,5 h film inside of it). It has a great story, it's witty, it's serious, it's moving. I love platform 3rd person games with adventure, so you can imagine that countless hours were spend on playing this game. It has super high replayability, which is mostly due to the fact that there are titanium bolts to collect, skill points to achieve and weapons to upgrade. Much of the time is required to complete this game, but boy every hour is a joy!. Best platformer/shooter on ps2! Graphics 9 Sound 9 Controls 10 Gameplay 10 Lifespan 9. This is best Ratchet & Clank game, this is the best game on the PS2, this is best game of 2004, this is best game of sixth gen, and it is best game of ALL time. This game has amazing 3rd-person combat, great graphics that still hold up, great plot, great dialogue and character dynamic, great weapon and gadget variety, interesting and varied enemies, excellent level design, fun run and gun 2D mode, good multiplayer, tons of nods to past games. The only major flaw is cut content that was removed from game's rushed development, which isn't even that major since a lot of it is still featured in the game (hint, get all the trophies to find out what I'm talking about). Do not pass up this game.. I like this game but have my problems. Most people think this is the best one. I personally like the second one better. The story is not as interesting as the first two and the game play not as refined. I still recommend check this one out.. An outstanding platformer game. Both graphics and gameplay are awesome. A must-have PS2 game.. Before I got the chance to play this game, I read a few (ok, a lot) reviews, and every single review couldn't tell a bad thing about the game. But still, I didn't think I will like the game so much. First of all, I noticed humor and its quality (believe me, you will laugh a lot). I also liked great mixture of platforming and shooting. Platforming, in fact, is not very hard, but it adds on game's overall score. Shooting, despite, is quite challenging, especially in the first playing through the game. If you remember your weaponry in Ratchet & Clank 2, where you were able to upgrade every weapon just ones, here's the difference: in Rathet & Clank 3 you can upgrade every weapon five times, and with more playing, even eight times. With almost each upgrade weapons gain new, more powerful abilities, which you'll definitely need in fight against evil Dr. Nefarious and his servants. Enemies are fun to shoot (and, of course, kill) and though they don't know any advanced maneuvers, a lot of them still aren't easy to kill. Bosses are quite interesting and challenging too and you will remember them for a long time. Even if this isn't the hardest, longest or most beautiful game, it's still my numero uno game of all time and I think, you will love it too.. Everything done bigger and better than the previous 2 and completes the trilogy as far as story.. Ratchet and Clank 3 is a great game that is not as good as good as the ones before it, The Multiplayer is great but the level design is a bit repetitive, returning planets are also not very good. This game is actually a lot of fun at parties.. ratchet and clank has and will always be one of my favorite games of all time. this game is so good just like Sly 2 both these games have so good story and the characters in the game are just a god damn 10/10 love Ratchet and Clank. Super innovative game that really takes upgrading weapons to a new level. It's a super solid platformer that feels really nice to play and really satisfying to grind through. My only real criticism is that the non-platforming game modes aren't that great.. Probably the best game from the original trilogy. It's basically Going Commando with awesome story and great weapons. Completed the challenge mode 3 times and don't regret it!. While I consider Going Commando better, Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal is quite fantastic and once again proves how such a short development and staying creative to the formula by refinement and improving can really make an experience better. UYA adds a mix of new and old guns, plays off the game's universe creatively like callbacks to previous characters and using the memory card system to rewards fans for their dedication to the series that is creative. Dr. Nefarious is a very goofy but far more intimidating villain and going back to some of the original RAC worlds like Rilgar and Kerwan with a better remix version of those themes were very wonderful. The Rangers are quirky and really play a parody on the modern military shooter. Coupled with the humor that the series had done since the first game and it stays consistent where it never feels old. Difficulty is better addressed in this over GC, but the power of the guns in later runs make it an absolute cakewalk. It also has the same feeling of GC, which isn't a bad thing but a common issue the series would start to face is franchise fatigue and not as compelling changes to the formula. That being said, you'd be hard pressed to find anything to fault UYA that some go back and forth on whether they like GC or this entry more.. One of the true great games that emerged from the PS2 era. It's story line offers enough flesh to to keep the game player stimulated and it's vast variety of weaponry and power ups make the game never exhaust it's surprise factor. But, most importantly, it's tons of fun.. For the longest time, my favorite game was this. Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal. I beat it over and over until I 100 percented the game, then continued to beat it over and over because I was on a complete power trip with the strongest armor, maxed health, and every weapon on max level, and decimating everything was pure unadulterated joy. But what exactly made Up Your Arsenal so perfect back then, and what keeps it so good now? I'm gonna take a look at that with this review. Up Your Arsenal does some things better than Going Commando, and it's also missing some things that Going Commando had that I wish it had kept. To start things off, it's feels a lot more polished than the previous two games in the original PS2 trilogy, and I tribute that to a higher level of detail, a perfected lighting engine, a slightly upgraded character models. Everything just looks better. The soundtrack this time around is really making an effort to get you pumped to blow things up, but it also has a little bit more of a dramatic feel to it, to reflect what feels like higher stakes. In reality, the stakes are about at the same level as the original, but you care more about what's happening to the galaxy around you because you get to connect to more of it through the characters, which Insomniac really seemed to put a lot of focus on in this game. In UYA, you have a hub world in the form of the Phoenix, where you get missions from, and can interact with your pals in the Q-Force. It is entirely composed of characters that you talked to like, once in the first game, and then never saw again. This game brings them back, and gives them a bigger role. Flawless writing and top tier voice acting makes each member memorable, and you come to feel like your an important part of a team of professionals and there's a sense of gratification in that. And it makes sense, seeing as this time around, Ratchet is at a higher value to his allies. He's saved two galaxies now, at this point, he and Clank have made names for themselves. Ratchet is now a sergeant in the galactic military and dating the president's daughter. And yes, this game is somewhat military themed. You will be fighting large scale battles with the galactic rangers. This game is a lot more combat heavy, and the RPG mechanics introduced in R&C2 have been fine tuned to fit it. Ratchet's nano-tech leveling system has been tweaked to function in percents now, so that damage reduction with armor can actually be measured in a way that makes sense. And the number of times our weapons can upgrade has been increased. You can now upgrade a weapon four times, the first three awarding you new mods, raising the power levels little by little, and then the fourth drastically increasing the power and destruction in an instant. And yes, mega weapons still exist. And they can also be upgraded multiple times now. As a result, in this game, your weapons have the potential to become far more deadly and destructive than the puny little pea shooters you had in Going Commando, the best of which return for free if you gave a GC save file btw, and have been given the new upgrade system treatment as well. You will become overpowered. And it will be amazing. Mowing down all enemies that cross your path with merciless devastation while the army you command and that of the enemy's fight around you in a glorious, chaotic battlefield. Also at your disposal are two vehicles: the Turbo Slider and Hovership. These sections are fun enough, and they don't overstay their welcome. There are optional things you can do to get more bolts as well. Including galactic ranger battles, and arena battles which make a return. I should also mention the Qwark vid comics that become optional on a challenge mode playthrough, but are mandatory on your first. In all honesty, they can be fun if you're in the mood, but most of the time they're just a roadblock when I just wanna get back to blowing stuff up as Ratchet. The comics themselves are 2D platforming segments where you play as Captain Qwark. They don't show up too often though, thankfully. Platforming does still exist for Ratchet too, so don't worry, it is still within the genre. Despite all the fast paced adrenaline pumped action, the game still has it's drawbacks that honestly make it fall below Going Commando in my eyes. You see, the game gives you the option to upgrade your ship, but all the changes are purely aesthetic, To me, the feature feels wasted because in GC, you could trick out your ride for epic space battles. But here, those battles are absent. And where in the last game the platinum bolts bought you mods for your weapons, since the upgrade system has mods taken care of, they now buy you... skins. I also wish the arena level was more fleshed out. These drawbacks aside, UYA is still a great game, from reclaiming your home planet from an alien invasion in the beginning, all the way to an epic final battle where armies clash at the end. UYA is BAD ASS. Oh. And Neffy. Ratchet and Clank:Up Your Arsenal refines the formula established by Going Commando and adds several new features including an online multiplayer mode. The new additions include a first person mode, mission-based ""Galactic Ranger"" sections, an Arena with both platforming and combat gauntlets. Speaking of combat, the weapon line up in this game is arguably the best in the series, with Re-designed weapons from the first and second game, as well as some of the best weapons from the second game (see Bouncer, Miniturret Glove, Shield Charger, Plasma Coil) and some interesting additions such as the Plasma Whip. There are also brand new ""Qwark Vid-comics"" which are miniature 2-D platforming challenges that detail both Qwarks backstory as well as justifying Dr. Nefarious' plan. Sticking with Dr. Nefarious, he, his butler Lawrence (and Captain Qwark) have great chemistry, backed up by solid writing and great voice work. The game doesnt take itself seriously, simply aiming to provide the player with great gameplay and a hilarious story, which the game achieves with flying colours. The soundtrack is a mix between the Techno Break-beat tunes of the first game and the more orchestral influence of the second game. Last but not least the gameplay offers excellent controls, fluid gameplay, great graphics and a rock-steady 60fps. An overall excellent single player campaign with a solid (although not entirely original by todays standards) multiplayer component featuring basic Deathmatch/Capture the Flag modes. An excellent game, and a PS2 classic.. My first ratchet and clank game and still my favourite ps2 game ever, the over the top weapons, humour, sick soundtrack, and many planets to explore, even a damn fun multiplayer. I spent hours on this amazing masterpiece which is the best Ratchet & Clank game of all time. The story is great and the controls are good. I love this game and you should play this amazing masterpiece as well.. this game is really good although it is a were the **** do i suppost to go this is the kind of game but its really fun in other words you should get this game is you are good at were the **** do i go games. Pretty hilarious, this game is one of the best ps2 releases to come, my favourite is tools of destruction though, good job insomniac. very good. This is the game that put the series of Ratchet and Clank truly on the map. More enemies, more planets, more weapons, more characters, more story, Ratchet and Clank 3 screams more. With an array of innovations, including multiplayer game modes, Ratchet and Clank 3 serves as the overwhelmingly perfect finale to the PS2 trilogy.. For what the game is mainly all about, (platforming), it excels at it and a whole lot more. From top to bottom, its a very humorous game to play for everyone. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ratchet and Clank, there is no game more fun than this. Up your Arsenal is one of the best from this saga. The story os good. The gamplay is perfect, the guns are awsome, the levels are perfect, simply one of the best ratchets and clank games.. Probably the best game of my childhood. Words cannot describe. Replayed this when the PS3 remastered version came out and it still was one of the best games ever made. 10/10. There is so much customization in this game! I love it! This was the only Ratchet and Clank game that I played on the PS2, but I had so much fun with it! I wish I still had my PS2 so I could relive playing this game.. Best game ever. It have great gameplay, graphics and audio. I complete it more than 10 times, and that's my first PS2 game. For Ratchet and Clank i buyed the PS3.. I bought this game at the age of four and it was one of the first games I completed. Over the years of playing this game I cannot find a game better than this Story-A Gameplay-A* Platforming-B Oh and you get a gun that turns enemies into ducks!. The very best game on the PS2. Absolute classic, good story, great weapons, and just amazing gameplay. You cannot ask for a better game. If you have a PS3, go on the PS store and buy the trilogy pack and play this diamond in the rough of gaming.. It's a Masterpiece, a must play, probably the best Ratchet & Clank for PS2. Now i have it for PS3 (because i have the Ratchet & Clank HD Trilogy) and still amazes me.. THE best ratchet and clank on Playstation 2. A mixture of excellent gameplay tweaks and new activities make the third one easily the strongest game in the series and one of the best games ever. Up your arsenal entertains you with great humor, gameplay, music, story.... Truly a masterpiece.. in many ways a good ratchet and clank game probably the best sharing it's place with a crack in time maybe even better. weapons are great no bad things to say about them. gadjets are okay armor sets are awesome as well game is long enough and the story is well worked out characters development is awesome this game changed the ratchet and clank series a lot captain qwuark becoming a friend of ratchet and clank made the series much better. there are a lot of different characters in this game with their own personality the most famous villian from the ratchet series is in this game doctor nefarious so in short a very good game that you must have i've you like platforms or the ratchet and clank series. Simply put, my favourite game of all time. Everything about it is amazing, the gameplay, the graphics, the writing is all superb. This game does not get old, I have beaten it 25 times and it is still enjoyable. GO AND BUY THIS GAME.. This game is an absolute gem. It's fun, and tells a great story with great humour. If you love platformers, action-adventure or 3rd person shooters, you owe it to yourself to play this game. While veterans of the series might find it a little less challenging than the second and first games, newcomers will find lots of challenge in the main story, with challenge mode further adding replay value. speaking of replay value, this game has a ton of it, with titaniu","good game, but it falls short on many Ratchet staples . a very dull (brown or orange) colour palette for 80% of planets . the hacker Puzzle may not be bad in itself, but it's horrible for replayability ."
22.The Orange Box,"Still one of the best combo deals in all of gaming. A perfect shooter, a perfect puzzler, and a perfect squad-based multiplayer all in one package. Endless hours of content, none of which falters or stumbles in any way.. I bought this just for team fortless 2, there is no other reason lol (i love other ones to but). really nice game related to the half life history which is one of my favourite games. These games are from a time when Valve was still a game development company and actually made games. Three great games in one box, all released simultaneously and entered the top ratings. The captivating Portal, the intriguing TF2, and the continuation of Freeman's story. Once upon a time, this was reality, and at one moment, so many games could be released that greatly influenced the entire industry. Not every game here is a 10, but getting all 5 games in one is just, way too good to not give a 10.. The Orange Box is a great package with three of the best games included in it. Once again I got this one at a Game X Change for $15, but I'm glad I did. Portal plays like a charm on this and sometimes when I went back to PC I had to re-adjust. Half-Life 2plays less good, but a great alternative for the PC version. And TF2 no longer has 360 support so I won't write about it here.. The Orange Box is an essential for the Xbox 360. It includes the best fps games on the planet. Sadly I got the german version, which is censored. But even that can't spoil these masterpieces. Overall rating: 9.5.. This may just be the greatest collection of video games ever released. Valves' finest works are on display in this incredible collection.. One of the best compilations ever made, contains most of the best games Valve has ever made.. Half Life 2 alone would've already gotten a 10, but mix in its two sequels, the best puzzle game ever made, and one of the most spectacular multiplayer shooters out there, and this simply is one of the best compilations in all of gaming.. Half Life 2 is second only to the Halo games in the FPS stakes and The Orange Box includes both that and the following two episodes, plus the rather unique first person puzzler Portal which is also a great game in its own right. Throw in multiplayer blaster Team Fortress 2 and you've got yourself a serious bargain.. the orange box is a pile of dog **** mixed with piss this game will give u a sore head after a few min boring game not fun. This is still one of the greatest deals in video game history. Getting Half Life 2 and it’s two episodes, Portal and Team Fortress 2 all for one whole price can never be unmatched than ever and because of this the Xbox 360 version of Half Life 2 makes it my fourth favorite game of all time.. Best collection of all time. I hope Valve will make The orange box 2 someday.. It has some of the best games that Valve has ever made! I think that's all need to say.. 3 Good Games In One Disk. So Cool. I Dont Really Think All This Games Are Masterpieces. So... 9/10. Looks like crap by today's standards. Don't play this on 360, get it for PC instead.. The whole Half-Life 2 experience, plus Team Fortress 2 and the introduction of Portal. That's it. Enough said right there.. Pretty solid amount of games for a company that just started with a game called Half-Life.... OVERALL - 95% Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 9/10 I bought this pre-owned back in the day.. 3 great games for £6.99... Not bad value at all.... This will go down in history as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Epic story, great blend of extremely dark setting with sprinkles of humor, insane graphics/voice acting/environments for its time, and great blend of puzzle solving and shootout arenas. While it lack any character development for Gordon Freeman, the world around still feels alive and real. It takes more of the Zelda approach, where the main character has no in game personality, because YOU are the personality. While this is not my favorite style, it was pretty standard for the time. And the character filled world, makes up for it.. So you're telling me that not only does the Orange Box include every Half-Life 2 installment, but also Portal and Team Fortress 2 on console?! What a great collection to show to someone who has never played a Valve game before.. The Orange Box contains 3 incredibly beloved games that every gamer has to try at one point. You get Half Life + Episode 1 & 2, Portal, and Tf2. While this collection has 3 amazing titles, loading times and framerate dips that occur every so often can be frustrating. In conclusion, the Orange Box is an amazing collection that almost every gamer should purchase. I wouldn't recommend it to people who already own the games presented on PC though, as they are slightly more polished experiences. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. This is by far the best deal in all of videogame history. Five of the greatest videogames of all time rolled into one perfect package.. Probably the best collection of games i got this at gamestop for 15 dollars would recommend comes with team fortress 2 half life 2 episode 1 and 2 portal 5 games in one disc. Five games of great quality at a stunningly low price. What else do I have to say? Half life 2 and episode one were great, episode 2 was perfect imho. Team fortress 2 was fun and portal was awesome. Half-life 2 was my favourite game of all time for the Xbox, so of course I wanted to get this for its expansions. The other two games were amazing as well, and even with Mark Laidlaw gone from Valve, Half-life 2 and its episodes will forever be The Video Game. A deeply impactful experience. Good gameplay, good engine, good story. What more can I say.. 5 excellent games in one shiny disc. What more could you ask for? Valve's Orange Box is practically bursting at the brim with content. It includes Half-Life 2, and It's two episodic sequels, a brilliantly original new IP called Portal, and a great multiplayer experience titled Team Fortress 2. it's an excellent deal worth every cent of it's 60$ purchase. And the game must be a lot cheaper by now, ten years later. Valve may have fallen from grace, (hard) but their games will always be great.. WHATS UP YOU AMAZING PEOPLE! This is my Review for The Orange box yes I am quite late but here me out. I loved both Portal and all half-life parts however i couldn't play Team fortress 2 (sad) Anyway Portal had fun mechanics just like portal 2 but more simplistic and fun to hear GlaDos again. Half-Life was also entertaining more for its action and story with the interesting but yet silent Mr Freeman. however like i said earlier i couldn't play team fortress which was sad. Anyway thanks for reading this review and check my other gaming reviews and also my new Movie reviews BBYYEE. The greatest video game bundle ever released. 5 amazing games for the price of one is a deal no gamer should ever refuse. Each game is great for a different crowd and will give you endless hours of fun.. This is truly a masterpiece , all these fantastic games in one box . This was is still the best buy in my collection . I loved every half life that ever hit the shelf . This is a must buy. I rarely give a 10/10 but this is just the best gaming bundle on one disc ever together with the Zelda:Collector's Edition. Half-Life 2 and its episodes is the best shooter I have ever played and Portal is one of the most clever games. I haven't even played TF2 as I don't really like playing online, but the single player games are just pure Valve-no-video game masterpieces. 9.6/10 for Half-Life and 9/10 for Portal. Together I'll round it up to a 10/10. this game is one of the greatest collections of all time 5 GREAT GAMES IN ONE DISC you got the be out of your mind if you say this masterpiece is even lower than a 8 its 5 great games in one. I got five words for you buddy: BEST. GAME . EVER. btw sorry but THE AWESOME LEVEL IS OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Been a ""gamer"" for probably 3 years now and I am always looking for great games to play. I'm through with all the current and several-year-old games that interest me and based on the awesome ratings, both old and relatively new, this game was next on my radar. The main game here is Half-life 2 and,while I definitely see why, in 2004 when this was released or even in 2007 when released on XBox, this game was so highly praised, it is clearly outdated today. The story itself is very, very slow starting and overall quite weak; which in itself isn't a dealbreaker for me as some of my favorite games have weak stories (Skyrim anyone), but add to this the game mechanics are very 2004 (actually they kind of remind me of the original King's Quest on PC) and you have a game that is neither interesting nor overly enjoyable. In 2014 buyer beware.. Wow, what a deal this puppy is. Being a console dude and having to listen to my PC elitist **** friends tell me about their new $700 graphics card they can run a game on max graphics that costs $3 today and how great the Half Life games are, I was a little skeptical going into playing Half-Life 2, especially years after it's initial release. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't put my finger on it, but this game is majestic. Still better than 90% of all the FPS put out today. Oh yeah, it also has the expansions and Portal. Best gaming decision I've ever begrudgingly made. 9.9 rounded down. No 10s.. Although the game is merely repackaged content, no one can deny that each and every game on the disc is brilliant and innovative in their own ways; whether it be the multiplayer warfare of TF2, the crowbar-strike and slash of Half Life 2 or the puzzles of Portal, all will enjoy this game.. To say that any fan of gaming needs to own this collection is an understatement. Unless you already own HL2 plus eps 1&2, and Portal and don't feel the need to buy the whole thing simply for Team Fortress, you can't really consider yourself a fan of quality video games without owning this usually budget price box. The value in here is like finding a still wrapped original pressing of the White Album in the $2 bin at your local charity store...with cake.. Great content. Half life 2 and portal would be worth buying on their own. The episodic content is less good and I couldn't get in to team fortress 2 at all. But I would still recommend this to anyone. Half Life 2 (and Valve in general), have earned a place in the hearts of gamers that play video games in the regular biases. It is strange to find someone that doesn't even know at the slightest what the whole Half Life universe it's about, even then it happens to be understandable. Half Life 2 starts where the first installment of the series, Half Life, left you. You begin to understand the overall thematic, and situation of the entire experience even if you never happened to touch the first game, or even know it's slightest about it, however, if what you're looking it's for a compelling story, that will somehow compensate, and go hand to hand with the gameplay, then you're looking at another game. Half Life has always have a very simplistic story (which is fine by me), it never truly fills you in into your outgoing objectives, and goals, rather than that the true essence that's going to impulse you to keep playing this incredible experience, it's going to be it's gameplay (which ironically tends to be the most important aspect of any game). The fluidity of the gameplay it's incredible, it never truly removes the control to the player, and even when it does, it still gives the player the freedom to do whatever he pleases to do. This mixture in between the linearity of the entire level design, accompanied with the pure sheer of beauty that it's the freedom, to give full control to the player. It is truly something that stands out, and even to this date some developers should take note on how to do so. There's several different key components that make the Half Life series so popular, for starters, it's the enigmatic moments in the game that truly share an extremely unique, and unforgettable experience, Ravenholm, the several different vehicle sections, the sudden stop of the experience to get the gravity gun, the game it's filled with moments that are extremely memorable, and even while i'm writing this im still getting flashbacks, on a couple of the splendorous moments, inside what is already, an splendorous moment. And that's the pure sheer, nor substance that makes this particular game to be so recognizable. The game does not only shares with you an already incredible experience, but it allows you to create your own experience.. The ability to be able to play Half-Life 2 on console earned the Orange Box a 9, the fact that Portal was thrown in there puts it above and beyond a 10 in terms of content within a disc. Team Fortress 2 is also a great game but doesn't really have the user base on the 360 that it does on Steam so is deemed pretty useless despite it being a solid game. To split them up Half-Life 2 is an absolute classic that is still talked about as one of gaming top achievements and I have to agree, the controls port from PC a little poorly but it doesn't detract from the essential experience of the game, the only other negative is that the graphics look a bit out dated. Portal is another great experience that deserves to be in the echelons of gaming history, only really worth playing through once but the level design, puzzle design, short length and general witty presentation of the game make it a must play for all gamers. All this in one box loses out on game of the year by being unlucky enough to have been released the same year as Bioshock.. Half Life 2 and its episodic additions set the bar for first person shooters almost a decade ago. Even today, that standard is almost unmatched by today's games. While many modern shooters are good, even great, none combine every conceivable facet of gaming and put it into a superb product. I still play this game every once in a while and it still amazes me how I can be entertained even 9 years later. The graphics still hold up with superior animation and physics engine. Half Life 2 is able to weave a story that is truly epic, but not so over the top so as to lose credibility. Overthrowing an evil alien regime has never been more fun. There is appropriate pacing, where it's not non stop pointless action like the COD series, yet moments where you can connect with the characters and gives purpose to your goal. The AI was terrific, reacting to grenades, seeking cover when hurt, using coordinated teamwork. Some games even today can't get the basics right when it comes to AI. There are varied environments and challenging, but not frustrating puzzles to overcome with your famed gravity gun. You're never just running down the same drab corridor again and again with endless respawning enemies due to lack of creativity. The best part is no playthrough is the same twice. You can always try new tactics, made possible by the sweet gravity gun. The other games include Portal 1 and Team Fortress, which is a physics based puzzle game and a team multiplayer game respectively. Both are well done and Portal is probably the most thought out physics game ever. Team Fortress is a little cartoonish, but the gameplay is solid fun. In short, it's hard to find a better deal than these five games rolled into one bundle. These games have really showed that graphics arent everything and that gameplay and story are the most important aspects for a gaming experience.. Contains the greatest (top 3?) game ever created, at least in my little world. The orange box is a no brainer, despite being fairly old now and oddly rare on the 360, the OB is a real piece of work. Half-Life 2 is ported 100% perfectly and in the most recent of patches (at the time of release). Even in the year. 2014, HL2 still looks quite good and is as fun as ever to play. The epic single player saga is as every bit amazing as it once was! Couple the fact you get Episodes 1 and 2 2 being the length of a full game and better than most and you have the best value out there! Oh and portal is fun too! But don't bother with this version of TF2, it has about 15-20% of the con-current PC version. Total valve fan service and the best boxed deal on planet earth...Outside of Stuffed Crust meat lovers... so Second best. one of the best games i ever bought. this is what introduced me to the half life franchise and pc gaming. I played tf2 for hours and played and replayed all the other games multiple times i seriously recommend getting this game if you dont want to pay much and want the most bang for your buck. Why spend $60 on a new game when you can spend only $30 on 5 games? The Orange Box is one of the best deals in gaming. It contains Half Life 2, Half Life 2: Episode 1, Half Life 2: Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. So, essentially you're getting one of the best FPS games, one of the best puzzle games, and one of the best multiplayer games all in one bundle. There really isn't much more to say. Just play it for yourself.. Graphics: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Enjoyment: 7/10 Value For Money: 10/10 8/10 This game is... Wow! If you have a gaming computer I would obviously recommend this on there. However here it is just a little bit worst... BUT STILL AMAZING!!!!!. I'd give it a 9.5 if it let me. This is simply an amazing deal. Obviously the graphics are a little dated by today's standards considering when this was released, but they hardly look bad by any regard either. Team Fortress 2 remains in it's original vanilla state, which is somewhat disappointing, but it still provides many hours of multiplayer enjoyment regardless. For the three of you who haven't played Portal yet, it provides an entertaining puzzle game with a interesting story to boot, and remains one of my top games of all time despite not being considerably long, and provides challenges to add to the replayability of it. Finally, the best part of it is Half Life 2 and it's two story expansions. Half Life 2 has a certain elegance about it where the music, gameplay, and story all combine to make one of the best game experiences in a long time. It's too hard to explain what about it exactly is so great, but just trust me when I say it's a must play that still holds up as an amazing experience to this day; sure beats most of the shovelware coming out these days anyways in almost every regard. 3 great games for the price of half a single game: what's not to love? The only complaints I have about this are that there were definitely a large number of loading screens, the ai often got in your way, and vehicle controls could have been better. Nothing gamebreaking, just minor complaints.. You've read the reasons this game is an easy 10. Let's be honest here. And although it feels dated in some ways by now (obviously), it still is just so great.. The value of this set is extraordinary, but hardly the most impressive thing about the Orange Box. This is quite possibly the best set of Valve games ever created. You are not a gamer until you have played and beaten all of these games. Half-Life on its own is one of the greatest games ever made! Portal is ingenious in its design, and my all-time favorite game. Team Fortress 2 is one of the most original or entertaining multiplayer games, I love it to death and have played countless hours. all in all...PERFECT.. Truly the best deal in gaming history! A rarity in gaming in that the characters are interesting. Game-play, graphics and story are all marvelous! Often disappointed by sequels but was so happy that this was good.. Not much replay value in this package. The Half-Life 2's and Portal are absolutely worth experiencing at least once. If you like first person shooters these are some of the best campaigns you could play.. I was excited when I got the Orange Box. I saw that there were basically 5 games on it and they were supposedly all good. Unfortunatley, I was dissapointed. Portal was fantastic and I loved playing it. However, I couldnt get into Half Life 2 and in the end I just gave up on trying to be entertained. Team fortress 2 is also good but i'm not a big multiplayer fan. So, The orange Box is good for some people and not so good for others.. All 5 games on this disc are winners. Half Life 2 is one of the best games of the decade and stands up even now roughly 7 years later. Portal is an original and interesting puzzle game that does not disappoint but sadly it's about 3 hrs on your first run through, I've gotten it down to about an hour and a half. Team Fortress 2 is very fun but I wish they'd bring the updates that it got on the PC to the Xbox. Half Life 2 and it's episodes are all amazing, my one complaint are the many loading screens, while short they can break up the action. Another gripe is that if you are going for all Gold Medals on Portal Challenges is that the challenge times and steps were not converted for the Xbox controller. The mouse and keyboard allow for much faster and accurate movement that a standard controller can not provide, making some challenges almost impossible without using cheat codes. So in conclusion: Fantastic games, highly recommend Dirt cheap now, you can't go wrong Some Portal Challenges haven't ported well to consoles No updates to TF2 This is a must buy and one of my favorite games of all time, the best DEAL in gaming history. Half Life 2 took me about 15 hrs my first time through. Both episodes are about 5-6 hrs each. Portal, about 3 hrs on your first play through. Team Fortress 2 has a lot of replay value but with about 6 maps it can get old. So if you beat all the single player games you'll sink in about 30 hrs + However long you spend on TF2. Not counting all 99 achievements for this game (I got all of them and it took me quite a while) this should keep you occupied for quite a while.. Eh?? Whilst Portal is most possibly THE best gimmick-game ever made, it is still just a gimmick game and if it lasts you 2 hours you'll be lucky. As for Half life 2 & it's expansion well they are horrible, dated, boring and weak games. P*ssing about with see-saws and other puzzles designed to show off a physics engine is just tedious and makes for a tiresome game. I really don't get what people see in this other than nostalgia and a cute little bonus puzzle game??. A masterpiece. One of gamings best offerings. A gaming experienced that will be remembered for a lifetime. Mind blowing. Superb. Revolutionary. Another all time fav. Of mine. Essentially Portal and Half-Life 2: Episode 2 + 3 games you probably already own, but it's forgivable, because they're truthfully three of the best games on the market. Half-Life 2 and its episodes are a beacon of intelligent game design and compelling narrative, while Team Fortress 2 is a well balanced shooter, but lacks enough content to enthral any fps fan for too long, and you'll find yourself being drawn back to much more populated games like Halo, Call of Duty and Battlefield. Portal...short, sweet, hilarious, intelligent and individual, a truly original piece of gaming that'll have you addicted from sublime start to perfect finish. Valve just really gets what it is that gamers want, you have to think to progress, these are games that involve the player, and that's what makes them so incredible. Portal is the best puzzle game I have played in some time. It is very original and enjoyable. Half-life is also my favorite first person shooter series, so I enjoyed that too.. When i bought this Box in 2007 i was mainly getting it for Half Life. I did not play it before and so i finally wanted to get my hands on it. It blew me away ... the game is absolutely amazing. The story is interesting, the characters memorable, the graphics are still great today and the gameplay is just spot-on. But before i even got to Half Life I tried out Portal because I was told it was pretty short... and so I played through it in 1 sitting. This is absolutely one of the best games ever created. The puzzles themselves are enough to sell the game even at full price. But what makes this game so outstanding is the dialogue and the humor. This game is touching and made me laugh out loud multiple times ... the end almost made me cry. This game is just brilliance. Team Fortress 2 was probably what I was least interested in ... but let me tell you something : I still play it. It has no single player and no real goal or anything, but just the incredibly fun gameplay is enough to keep you playing for years. Overall : This would be worth tripple the amount they charge you for ... or even more. I would happily buy this box for 100â. Great games. Great value. TF2 is kind of a useless add-on (for consoles that is). Otherwise if you haven't played any of HL2 and of course Portal, then get this!. You can pick up this game for around $10 now, which is probably the best game bargain out there. Even at it's original $50 price tag, it was more than worth it. You get 5 games, 5 FULL games. Each episode of Half-Life: 2 is easily a full game. Throw in Portal and Team Fortress 2 and you get the best compendium ever created. This game is impossible to rate at less than a 10; you won't get more for $10; Hell, you won't get more for $60 these days.. Not really a game, but a compilation of several, both new and old. There's the Half LIfe 2 which I know and love so well and its Episode 1, plus the all new Episode 2, Team Fortress 2 and Portal, and, man, they are all simply awesome. Episode 2 brings back that epic quality and feel of Half-Life 2 and expands it to new dimensions. Team Fortress 2 is a really good and quirky multiplayer which probably requires gamers with at least half a brain. And lastly, Portal is the surprise package of the package, packing an intriguing and charming story, combined with fun and fresh gameplay into a short game. The Orange Box is unconventional, but Valve shows their prowess once again. Always a pleasure.. An amazing package. Half Life 2 and its expansion packs may have aged a little with time, but is still eminently playable, and very engaging at that, which given its age is testament to quite what a game it was on release. Portal makes up the other marvelous aspect of this package. Creative, thoughtful, and often ingenious. Overall the Orange Box makes for some of the best gaming anywhere, let alone for the price you can get it for nowadays.. It's a must play. I would have given it a 9, but with the addition of ****'s an absolute 10. There's also a 20gig expansion pack you can download that ""freshens"" up Half-LIfe 2, and is amazing. Highly recommended. Enjoy.. This is the best thing ever created. Considering the Half-Life series was my favorite game series to begin with there wasn't a chance i was not going to like this. I recommend this to anyone who likes video games in general. Your getting three Half-Life games which have an amazing story and are very fun to play, then you have Portal which is an awesome and extremely well made puzzle game, and last you have Team Fortress 2 which is a fun cartoon multiplayer game.. Just buy this package, you will enjoy the games immensely, plenty on gameplay hours, and the greatest hits Valve has ever made. Valve is awesome once again.. It's games like this that show Valve is one of the only developing companies that demonstrate extraordinary consistency. The Half Life series seems to have most every quality of a single player shooter that people receive well; original, great pacing, interesting environments, fun weapons, etc. Not only does it have those qualities that are just generally talked about, but it also the small amounts of polish added to the game to make it that much more enjoyable, and make no mistake; the small things matter, gamers are way to OCD to ignore the small things. I'm talking about the way set pieces are placed to where it doesn't take away control of the character when it comes time to explain the story. I see this as a very good median between those who are interested and less interested in the story. If we look at past releases that were extremely successful (Bioshock, Oblivion), it is obvious that gamers love freedom. Half Life does have more linear elements to it than open elements, however I would go as far to say that Half Life 2 has the based pacing for any other linear single player game I have played that I can remember. Portal is one of those games where it's really hard to find something wrong with it. At least in Half Life you could probably FIND something to **** about, regardless of the fact it's a fantastic game. Portal has nothing against it; if it's your kind of game, you will LOVE it. I could not find one instance while playing through it where I found myself frustrated by things that were not necessarily dependent on my playing. So many games will have potential, but it will have crappy controls, or lack of polish, or it doesn't run smoothly enough, Portal is all good challenge. I suppose one could make the case that Portal is not original because it was based on a student made game called Narbacular Drop; my response to that is, which one did YOU play? (Exactly). There were other first person shooters before Doom and probably Wolfenstein, doesn't take away from those games one bit. It had no technical short comings, it was cleverly staged, amazingly creative in its puzzle and level design, it offered more of a challenge for more advanced players, and it had very decent humor (although I suppose that's subjective). I'm not sure I should review Team Fortress 2, because I **** at it. Yet, I can also put credit to the game for still being a blast despite my terrible performance. I do think that they should not stray away from having everyone on a level playing field, which is what I felt made it significantly more balanced than Call of Duty. I don't know if they have always had the store, but I think that was a little step away from an aspect I liked about the game. I also think they could have done a better job of gauging the speed a each class should move based on their primary weapon(s). If I had to guess what makes TF2 as popular as it is, is the obvious reason that every multiplayer game should emulate; it is a shooter that most can just jump right into. These games have all of the wow-factor and originality **** game, except no one can touch Valve when it comes to polish, for it takes out all of the annoying nuances **** game to turn it into a mediocre game. Stunning!. Graphics **** on Xbox but as a package it's extraordinary value. I picked it up for just Â£15 and it was worth every penny. I'd be happy to pay that just for Portal and TF2 alone. But Valve shoved in 3 classics too. So you're getting 2 new games and the HL2 series on top. In here you're bound to find some enjoyment. Can't go wrong with 5 games.. ive seen this game for the pc back in 2004 and it blew me away, i never played it till it hit the xbox, and lemme tell you, this is the best 1st person solo campaign i have evr witnessed. its jsut amazing, every aspect of the game is crazy. **** the whole package is a steal.... 5 games on a disk? come on now, thats too easy not to pass up... **** i dont think i should say more? **** buy this bih if you havent already. Let me start off by saying that I agree with those who are saying that The Orange Box is a deal - 5 games in a case. Yeah but these games are just terrible. Team Fortress 2 makes for one of the worst online FPS I've played. The gameplay reminds of Q3 arena but with no fun in it + it is impossible to play this game on a console(it is an okay PC game however) Then, there is Portal. It has 19 and the ending part(would be a spoiler), but all of these chambers are not challenging at all!!! The game takes around an hour to complete! Chambers are n","three great games in one box, all released simultaneously and entered the top ratings . Portal, TF2, and the continuation of freeman's story are included . sadly the german version is censored ."
220.Resident Evil (Remake),"This review is for the PS5 version of the game. RE1 kicked off one of the longest lasting videogame series in history and defined the survival horror genre back in 1996. Only for that you have to give this game a credit. This remake takes the original and makes it even better. Besides the visual upgrade, there have been several changes to gameplay and story, but all of them are welcome. That beeing said, the game doesn't do anything groundbreaking new. The formula of 1996 remains unchanged. That's a positive thing, if you like that formula. Or a negative thing, if you don't. Like most old school games of that time it is not very user-friendly and very unforgiving towards mistakes. You mostly end up in bad situations because of something you couldn't know, because the game didn't tell you. The biggest enemy of the game are the camera angels that don't let you see what's ahead of you. Or the inventory management, or deciding when to save and when not to. In general the game has nothing to do with skill, but with knowing where what is and making the right decisions at the right time. This makes the first walk through a frustrating experience. It's the replaying of the game, where the fun comes in. Trying to achieve the perfect run on even harder difficulties is the essential part of this game. The problem with this is, if you are used to modern games you will probably not have a good time with this game. As a remake I think there should be more options to make this more accessible to new players. As a matter effect I would call this a remaster rather than a remake. But I have to rate this as what it claims to be. And as a remake it lacks the innovation it needs to bring it to a new generation. But here is hoping for a ""real"" remake coming at some point down the line. I would still recommend this version over the original since it is better in every way. But you should see it as a simple improvement (remaster), not the reimagining (remake) it claims to be.. I still remember the time it wowed me back in the days. If they are going to remake this it will be hard to beat!. Still the best survival horror game in 2024. I would love if Capcom would go back to this style. After completing all Resident Evil games with tank controls, I can safely say that this is the one that should be enjoyable for everyone who likes adventure games even 20 years after its release. Just do not fall for the typical RE rumours. The inventory management adds no difficulty, the backtracking just eats up time. Use your ammo and kill the enemies you cannot avoid easily, there are plenty of clips around. The game still looks great, exploring the mansion and its surroundings is absolutely worth it. The only downside is probably the shallow 90's humour and the hackneyed protagonists. Season 2. Door opening simlulator. Wexler wore sunglasses in doors. Epic puzzles, cool atmosphere, suprisingly good.. this is the best survival horror game I’ve ever played and I can’t stop thinking about how great it was. This game will provide you with some of the scariest jump scares and scariest atmospheres in the genre of videogames period. This game also provides some of the most innovative and fun puzzles ever, with combat that still holds up to this day. Deserves nothing less than a 10. It is a masterpiece, it has action, psychological factor, amazing story, realistic graphics, good controls and mechanics, makes you think and solve. For me this is the ultimate survival horror game.. Just like ""Resident Evil 4"", this remake is a GameCube masterpiece. This RE 1 remake expanded and improved upon the original in every way. The graphics pushed the console to the limits and rivaled ""Splinter Cell"" on Xbox. Level design was updated with new areas, puzzles and bosses. CGI cutscenes were created and voice acting was completely re-done with new dialogue. Overall, this is the definitive version of ""Resident Evil"". I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10.. I would like to preface my review by saying I am not someone who generally enjoys horror games. Or at least I wasn't until I played this game, and discovered just how good horror can be when the focus isn't just on disgusting the player or suddenly putting a screaming demon in front of your screen. I actually had a tough time getting into the original trilogy, I started with Resident Evil 5 and then went to Resident Evil 4 which became one of my favorite games of all time. I tried to play the originals of 1-3 after that and I just didn't enjoy them. At that point I concluded that while I may enjoy games with aspects of horror in them, fully dedicated horror games just weren't for me. What I've come to discover, and this game was the beginning of that, is that the best horror doesn't just try to make you scream by surprising you. Rather, the best horror will slowly creep into your mind so that you're thinking about it even when you're not playing the game at all. A true masterpiece can stay with you even years after you're done with it, and that is how this game has affected me. The gameplay will mainly revolve around walking The Spencer Mansion avoiding or killing enemies, solving puzzles to progress, and discovering more about the story. Picking your fights is even more important in this game than in the others, if you try to kill every enemy you will be punished for it. I had to end my original playthrough because I tried to play that way. I'm not trying to spoil anything, but if you only played the original you're in for a surprise let me tell you! The puzzles and item management are made easier, since you can now see which general areas you're missing items in. The days of missing an item and having to search the entire mansion to figure out where it is are gone, and this is one of the main reasons why I was able to get myself through this game over the original. The story of this game is nothing short of phenomenal, I don't generally play Resident Evil games for the story but this one is the exception. It's really the only one that doesn't feel like they're continuing just because it has to continue, and that's probably because this was originally intended to be the only Resident Evil. The Remake even adds the most tragic character in the series, and it's a shame she doesn't exist in the original because she really drives in the tragedy of the Spencer Mansion. The voice acting and graphics are just amazing too, and they stand up even today. This is the best way to play Resident Evil in it's original style. And although I enjoy the new remakes, I'm glad that we got to see them flesh out that style fully. Resident Evil Remake is a masterpiece, and it made me learn to love horror.. Don't listen to Milosagaming, and all others complaining about controls and item management. These individuals have skill issues. We need games that are challenging and makes you think. Tank controls are the best. This game will always be a masterpiece and should never receive a 5, or anything lower.. Resident Evil 1, while undoubtedly influential in shaping the survival horror genre, Its outdated controls, laughable voice acting, frustrating resource management, and aged graphics make it a title that fails to live up to the exaggerated praise it often receives. While it may hold a special place in the hearts of those who experienced it in its heyday, modern gamers may find it difficult to see beyond the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.. This is one of the best remakes ever made. They perfected the original game so much that I don't think nobody should play the original over this. Very recommended. I recommend pick up one foHalloween and this game awesome story and lot action and graphic amazing and good day. One of the best video game remakes ever made, if not *the* best, Resident Evil for the GameCube surpasses its already brilliant original in every way. With a ton of meaningful extra content, this is more than just a visual polish; this is Shinji Mikami fully realizing his original vision -- one that he couldn't accomplish the first go around due to budget or technical limitations. If anything, this remake is so good that it practically makes playing the original completely obsolete.. One of the best games ever made. It shaped how a horror survival games should be. Story is excellent, the map is phenomenal in every Single aspect and the replay ability is crazy. 10/10 must buy!. Trash game, bad gameplay, story is confusing. mansion is also confusing, the hype for this game is stupid. It's not that good to be honest. I can see some qualities however it was prety much qualitites that were great in that timeline. It's overrated and don't listen to mindless fanboys for this game.. An excellent remake of an already great game. The atmosphere is fantastic and each shot is close to the work of art. The slow gameplay adds stress making the game more frightening than most modern productions. Resident Evil is a video game icon.. I am probably too late to the party, but this game did not age well at all. How on earth is this game the most high rated game among user scores? I don't get it. Gameplay feels not smooth at all, kind of clunky. Story is meh, but likeable characters atleast. The mansion is cool, however, it feels like a chore to backtrack often. The game is also very hard because there is hard to find ammo and healing items. Overall, it's safe to say that you probably have to prepare that this is a old game and don't expect anything great.. One of my all time favorite games. 10/10! I remember buying the Nintendo GameCube just for this game when I was in college. So many great memories. I actually went back and played it recently and the entire time I kept telling myself, ""wow, this is a well made game."" It's 2023 and I still feel the same way I did about this game as I did back in 2002.. Ok I need to say it. This is The greatest masterpiece of all time. my favorite genre!. A masterful remake of a classic. It stayed true to the original RE while adding new rooms, bosses, weapons, dialogue and voice acting. Graphically, it pushed the GameCube in the same way that Splinter Cell took advantage of the Xbox's capabilities. This is even better than the original PlayStation game from '96. I would rate this with a 9.3 out of 10.. 9.7/10 The pinnacle of survival horror and one of the greatest games ever made. It's been over 20 years and I still love it just as much if not more. Survival horror gameplay is so satisfying, especially in Resident Evil Remake. When you start out you feel like a mouse trapped in a violent maze. Then you start to learn the map, figure things out, get better and make your way through. Then the replays begin. You go from fumbling your way through to attempting things like harder difficulties, speed runs, no save runs, no hit runs, etc. It is so enjoyable, rewarding and fun. If there was any game I could forget and experience all over again it would probably be this. Every enemy encounter is meaningful because they don’t go down quickly and you have to consider the risk, limited resources, item management and backtracking. When you approach a zombie or hear one around the corner you need to stop and make a decision. Do I take it out or try to run past? Is there another way to go? How much health and/or ammo do I have? How much health and ammo is back in the item box? When am I going back to the item box? How often am I going to come back here? If I put it down will I come back and burn it so it doesn’t get back up? What do I do if I get hit? Do I have any self defence items? How much progress will I lose if I die? The game allows you to screw yourself and never holds your hand but this makes overcoming it so much sweeter. It is utterly fantastic. Then on top of this there is enjoyable exploration through creepy, atmospheric environments that you slowly unlock your way further into. With tense action against tough, scary enemies that forces you to stand your ground or run. The weapons hit hard and can produce graphic headshots and you can die just as horrifically. And the puzzles that are just right. Nasty traps, horror, gore and jump scares. This game recipe is f**king exquisite. The presentation is stellar. The fixed camera angles allow the developers to perfectly frame the whole game to increase the atmosphere, horror and player discomfort, and to highlight or hide things for the player. The visuals and art direction are excellent. The environments are gorgeous and detailed or dirty and gruesome when needed. The mansion is stunning and has so much atmosphere. It is my favourite video game location ever, it’s that good. The character and enemy models are great. The game is getting old now but still looks so good. Of course the audio is top notch too. The music, sound effects and ambient noises are so well done but they also knew when to have restraint and it’s all such a big part of the game's unnerving atmosphere. I love the characters, story, lore and dialogue too. The history of the mansion, Umbrella and the experiments is fun to dive into and all the notes/diaries/documents are worth reading. Jill, Chris, Barry, Rebecca, Wesker, even poor Richard, I love them all. The famous dialogue is a joy as is the B horror movie vibe. The only thing I can think of that is wrong is that I wish there was more of it and that we still got games like this regularly. A little bit longer, more options, more unlockables, more variety on further playthroughs. But I’m probably just being greedy, this game is near perfect. The only other issue is that the cave and laboratory areas are not as memorable as the mansion and residence for me. It improves on everything from the original while staying true to that vision. It doesn’t really throw anything away or remix stuff too much. It just makes it better and the new additions fit in so well it’s like they were always meant to be there. Go play this now if you've never tried it. I’m serious, I don’t care what your plans are. If you’ve never played Resident Evil Remake, fix that as soon as possible. I’m jealous that you get to experience this for the first time and wish I could again. Give it some time, you will get used to the older gameplay style and find it really works for this type of game. I hope as many people as possible enjoy this. Resident Evil Remake is how remakes should be done and how well games in general should be done. 9.7/10. One of Gamecube's best releases! And possibly the best Resident Evil title.. The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. an amazing remake for an amazing game resident evil 1 (1996) was already a good game but this remake is even better love the story, the effects and the atmosphere i dont have much more to talk cause you need to play to understand but it is really that good. everyone knows this is the mother of all survival horror games. ALSO funny how the kids cry because they don't have infinite ammo and don't understand the camera/controls, LOL. This is a remake, but honestly it improves so much from the original that I almost consider this to be the original. As a game RE1 is sensational. It's one of the first survival horror games, and it deserves high praise simply for kickstarting a genre like that. But not only was it one of the first, it is, to this day, one of the best. The survival elements in resident evil probably never exceeded how well they were done in this game. The level design also might be the best here. The plot is devoid of the convolution introduced later. Honestly, the only thing that steadily improved in the series was the combat. It is a bit clunky here.. There's just something so incredibly unnerving playing Resident Evil. In terms of atmosphere, it's one of the best horror games I've ever played, period.. The best survival horror game in history, directed by the godfather of horror Shinji Mikami himself. Userscore too high. They were at the top of Best user rated games of all time.. The remake of Resident Evil 1 is undoubtedly the greatest game of the entire Resident Evil franchise, and for me personally, it's my joint-favourite game of all time. This truly is the peak of horror gaming. Everything is seriously flawless, and so well thought out, and so exciting to play. The atmosphere of the game is absolutely haunting, and that makes it so incredibly memorable. Despite the game being old, it's so brilliant that I still want to replay the game over and over and over. I could rant all day about how perfect this game is, and how much I adore it, but the best way to find out its greatness is to play it yourself. Resident Evil 1 is truly a masterpiece, and truly a work of art.. Shinji Mikami was able to understand the concept of remake well, the camera is much better, new locations, new characters, new enemy type, everything is a masterpiece.. Though the game has been around for years I've never taken interest in Resident Evil until recently. I got the game for dirt cheap and was surprised how good it is. I saw my cousin play the old Playstation version years ago and was unimpressed but for the Gamecube the graphics have been re-rendered to absolute lifelike perfection. The shadows, the sound, the ambiance and those **** highly, highly realistic. Play this with your Gamecube hooked up to your home theatre. And like me, you'll totally jump out of your skin at the scary parts (many of them). My main hint is conserve your ammo. If you see a zombie, put it down right away (no funny stuff) and burn it. Take care of them one at a time. And if you don't burn them they will soon come back as Crimson Heads-faster, deadlier, scarier. Much like the Myst series, Resident Evil is one of those games where you have to keep your eyes and ears open. Clues and puzzle pieces are scattered all over the place and you need to pay attention. Don't be put off by the size of the mansion. After a short while it's easy to get your bearing and find your way through rather easily. Though I will be honest with the fact I did not understand most of the story. I have no idea what Trevor's diary from 1968 had to do with the plot and I really didn't get why Umbrella would create the T-Virus. I know there are various ways to finish and complete the game though. Especially seeing as how there are many clips during the end credits that did not happen in my game play (I did it in just over 8 hours). If you finish it in certain time frames the next one is always different somehow. I only managed to unlock a new outfit for Chris. Wow! My only gripe is about those boring 'door opening' cut scenes. They really got on my nerves. Still, it's a chilling game that will freak you out if you play alone in the dark. Well worth the time and money.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A little too obtuse on the puzzle front for me. Very much for the nostalgia grabbers.. This game is really perfect. It was based on the classic and nostalgic RE1 (1996) and knew how to do the improbable, that is, improve the original work even more - something that, in my opinion, the other Remakes did not succeed in successfully. The ambiance, dialogues, sound effects and soundtrack were incredibly improved, however, keeping the essence of the first work. With new characters to the story, further improving the plot, and new enemies, making the game even more challenging, Resident Evil Remake can be considered Capcom's purest masterpiece and Shinji Mikami's heyday in the series.. This is the best example of how a remake should be down and probably one of best the games human beings can create. Coming out way back in 2002, Capcom showed early what they were capable of when it came to remakes and showed the world how a true remake should be done. RE: Remake was, and still is, one of the best remakes ever made.. Third best Resident evil in the series. Keeping me on the edge at all times. This game **** ****. Controls are **** there is too little information for missions. Roaming around for hours. Too much zombies too limited ammo and too limited ink ribbon. SURPRISE (!) AWESOME SURVIVAL HORROR EXPERIENCE !!!!! You people are pathetic.. This game isnt for the new generations and ist getting old, the mecanic and the cam are so wrong. My goodness one of the best remakes a game has been ever given and honestly one of the best if not the best story in the whole series , truly a legendary start to a legendary franchise. The best Survival Horror game, period. This is how you remake a game. Not by cutting content or replacing it, but creating a 1:1 remake with addition story beats and lore. You really can’t call yourself a RE fan if you haven’t played this.. What can I say the best survival horror experience out there shame on u re 2 and 3 make. I'm glad that the remake of this game was as successful as its original masterpiece!. Easily one of the best video game remakes ever made. I wish the remakes for Resident Evil 2 and 3 had kept the fixed camera style of the originals like this one did.. No option for normal analog controls, immensely slow and unskippable door-opening cutscenes (used to mask the loading times on the PS1 version, but you can -hear the GameCube loading before the cutscene-, so they're useless now and only waste time), a laughably miniscule inventory if you don't want to be weaponless, but don't worry about not having weapons because you CAN'T DROP ITEMS- how on EARTH does anyone defend this at all, let alone praise it to this extent?! This is absolute trash, especially by GameCube era standards. It's not scary, it's not creepy, it's frustrating and annoying, and I want the two hours I wasted trying so hard to give it a chance, back.. I have buyed the gamecube just for this game, this is simply a masterpiece, the best classic RE for me, it deserves an 11 or 12. Great start to the series. I loved the horror aspect mixed with action. The storyline was solid. So good that, look, it broke off into a never ending series! The whole build up of the zombies, the danger and the threat, the bad guy, and good guys. Everything was built up perfectly. Setting it up nicely, for the destruction that awaited. The gameplay was fixed up a lot with the remastered version. Fixing the movements up a little. It was still a lot of fun, and manageable. The puzzles were good, and not too hard. But it was mostly the story and anticipation on what will come out at you next that kept you going.. This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. It took all the greatness in the original RE and put so much more into it. This game is a masterpiece, and is as good as survival horror can be.. One of my favorites RE, almos perfect. This remake are great survival horror, a great audiovisual experience.. The story of the wonderful meaning of the word and the way to play For examples of the most beautiful games Resident Evil We have events and scenario of the events of the game to reduce the fun with time and raise a difficult level. An instant classic in the resident evil series. Best game of the franchise together with resident evil 4.. This game was great. It was made in a way where it adds new scary enemies. Enemies such as the crimson head zombies and Lisa Trevor. It added new things while not being too far from the original in a great balance. Best remake video game when it came out and maybe even to this day.. Capsom just took and showed in 2002 how to do real remake of games on the example of Resident evil remastered. Originally the game was released in 1996 at PlayStation and after 6 years left for the 2001 console from Nintendo-Gamecube. As stated by the developers of the original game was only 35% and they did not lie, if you have already played in the original, then you still need to play in Remake. This is one of the best games of the 6th generation. Amazing graphics, good controls and a big replay value. If you played RE from PS1 first and you decided to play this remake go ahead. You will not regret it.. Legendary survival horror game that has changed an era, defined a genre, and driven the dazzling world success of PlayStation in the 90s. This was Resident Evil, and even if I had not ever finished it, I knew it very well. Searching on the Internet I learned about this version for the GameCube, and when I got the Dolphin emulator, it was one of the first games that I played with it. Many said it was better than the original version: they were right. Despite being one of the first games for PlayStation (the plot is identical on GameCube) it must be said that the plot of Resident Evil was definitely structured and deep. It was probably one of the first games to explore issues like the corporations that exploit people, to lie, to follow inhuman experiment, to kill and manipulate public opinion. It is a context that works very well, and where The Mansion plays a key role with its setting simply fantastic: dark, scary, full of traps and secrets. The plot really gives the feeling of being plunged into a nightmare. The gameplay of Resident Evil is the definitive horror gameplay: hard, ruthless, funny, complex, never boring and terrifying. I'm definitely not one of the best players of this game, and unfortunately I played Resident Evil 0 (because the plot is set before) that was easier and I took this chapter lightly. And I was seriously wrong. The gameplay of Resident Evil goes beyond the normal games, and its difficulty is remarkable: ammunition, weapons, shots fired, medical herbs, number of enemies, unforeseen events; resources are only a few and you have to plan your moves and the use of the inventory, but at the same time you have to know that plan could be in vain, because the game is unpredictable. The pace and atmosphere of the game are perfect: there are jump scare, but they don't really matter. What matters is the tension, the rhythm, the way the game forces you to feel overwhelmed, worried, scared of the unknown. The puzzles in the game are beautiful, they have consistency, they aren't impossible but simply require a good deal of reasoning, and I was never bored and they don't gave me too much difficulty. In addition, the GameCube version adds to the gameplay also new enemies as Crimson Head; when zombies are killed, the virus inside them changes and transforms them into even stronger and aggressive creatures. The only way to prevent this is to blow zombie's head off, or set their corpse on fire before they transform, using lighter and kerosene. This greatly complicates the gameplay: you have to go back and forth throughout the Mansion, sometimes you don't have enough kerosene, sometimes zombies transform too quickly, sometimes Crimson Head is pretending to be dead until the player doesn't come close, and the monster takes him by surprise. This makes the game scary but fun and challenging. But I wasn't ready for all this. My first round with the game failed, I exhausted ammunitions and herbs, I didn't know how to deal with the Crimson Head, and I couldn't continue. So I had to start again, and this time (still with some difficulty) I managed to play it for real. This is Resident Evil: a game that punishes the naivety and ignorance, but at the same time leaves you the desire to start over, to try again. And that's why I fell in love with the game. And thanks to this perfect gameplay, I can say it exceeded the original game on PlayStation. From a technical point of view, Resident Evil on GameCube, was definitely one of the best graphics of its time, considering it came out way back in 2002. There were not many games that could stand up to it, graphically. Once I even noticed that the mouth of the zombies leaks vaporous burr. Simply absurd. The soundtrack is great, it fits perfectly the horror context. With the Dolphin emulator the game did not give me many problems, it flowed quite fluid, maybe there were just a few graphic glitches but nothing serious. So, in the end, Resident Evil is the true survival horror game. It offers a high level of challenge, fear, atmosphere, a perfectly balanced pace. It requires patience and effort, but it pays off. It could be called the greatest survival horror game of all time. Definitely one of the best.. The ultimate horror game. Silent Hill 2 was for years my favorite survival horror game, until this game showed and schooled every developer on how to do a survival horror. The game makes you feel vulnerable: you are slower than some (many) of your enemies, your ammo is scarce, you cannot move or jump like Rambo, you have a very limited supply of healing items and (the first time at least) you have no idea what is behind each corner. You will find yourself returning to this game over and over again, and not only because of the nostalgic factor, but because of the quality it has even for today standards.. Reviewers should play games more before reviewing. I've played games for 20 yrs & a lot of ""professional reviewers"" either have no skills or give me the impression that they don't even like video games. When it comes to games on the Gamecube & during that generation, this game offers a very interactive experience over more ""movie"" like games of today like Tomb Raider on PS3. Compared to even a lot of the story based RPGs on the system it pulls you in. The graphic presentation isn't really what makes the game. It's the creepy mansion setting and layout that has made this game an instant classic when it first came out and what makes it still a memorable experience today. I'm playing this game in 2014 and looking at it from a modern interpretation of video gaming & this game really is an entertaining game. Though on paper it's a fairly simple system of combat, item collecting, & map memorization, each aspect doesn't ask you to do more than needed so the controls never feel limiting except for one... In this game you cannot leave an item or pick up an item if your inventory is full. People say play Jill because she has 2 extra inventory spaces. This is horrible until you find the storage chests in the various rooms. In the beginning it will be annoying but later on it does mean some backtracking but load times are quick & the mansion isn't that big that you'll dread going back and forth. This flaw though has a justifiable reason though so KEEP READING: In RE Zero ( a top favorite of mine that was designed specifically for the gamecube) you can leave objects anywhere and come back later to pick them up & the game memorizes where you leave everything until you progress onto the next main area. In this RE the ZOMBIE POSITIONS are MEMORIZED BY THE GAME. Why that is because in this new RE the zombies never die until you luck out and their head explodes while shooting them or you have to burn them with kerosine in your inventory! All the zombies you kill eventually rise again but with more durability & the run & lunge fast at you! The only hint to this is in a paper you have to read. In fact most the game is like this. You have to utilize & master all the different systems in place like reading, examining up close your inventory, attacking with your knife, modifying your control scheme etc... This is a very detailed game that provides a great sense of control & accomplishment once you get used to it. AND NO MATTER WHAT pro reviewers say these controls worked for people almost a decade ago when it was it first came out on the Playstation 1 and it's not that difficult or clunky as some suggest & it would be a shame to miss the game based on that. Most reviewers talk about the looks and controls. I'm going to write that it's much more than these... It's about a classic game environment & atmosphere that's still better than what you will find since it's release. It's also very challenging because you have to remember everything & it's a great game to play with my girlfriend watching in a dark room as she helps me keep track. It's not perfect so I'm giving it a 9... because I think though the develo","this review is for the PS5 version of the survival horror game RE1 . besides the visual upgrade, there have been several changes to gameplay and story . if they are going to remake this it will be hard to beat!"
221.Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater,"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater , released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, is a milestone in video game history. With its emotionally rich story, innovative mechanics, and unique setting, it redefines what a stealth game can be. However, while it is undoubtedly a masterpiece, certain aspects keep it just short of **** a 9/10?While Snake Eater excels in almost every aspect, there are elements that, while not ruining the experience, prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Below is a breakdown of why this title deserves a 9/10 instead of a 10/10.1. Outdated Controls and InterfaceWhile Snake Eater 's controls were advanced for their time, they feel somewhat stiff and fiddly today. Managing Snake in a three-dimensional environment can be awkward, especially during close combat or high-tension situations. The lack of a fully controllable camera system (fixed in later versions) makes some areas frustrating to explore, affecting the fluidity of the game.Impact:While the narrative and mechanics largely make up for these limitations, the controls can be an initial barrier for new players and occasionally a source of frustration for veterans.2. Irregular RhythmThe game shines in its moments of action and stealth, but its pacing can feel inconsistent. Lengthy cutscenes, while masterfully directed, sometimes break immersion by interrupting gameplay with lengthy explanations or detailed exposition.Impact:This is especially true for players who prefer a more fluid balance between narrative and gameplay. While these scenes are part of the series' DNA, their frequency can be a hindrance to maintaining immersion at certain moments.3. Survival Mechanics Not for EveryoneWhile the survival system is innovative and adds depth, it's not for every player. Managing hunger, injuries, and gear wear adds realism, but can sometimes feel like an unnecessary burden, especially on higher difficulties.Impact:Some players may find these mechanics tedious, affecting the overall enjoyment and accessibility of the game.4. Lack of Polish in Action SequencesWhile the game's primary focus is stealth, the open combat sections aren't as polished. Gunfights can feel imprecise, and enemy AI, while generally competent, has moments of inconsistency.Impact:This is most noticeable in confrontations that force you to abandon stealth, where the limitations of the combat system become **** is it still a 9/10?Despite these minor flaws, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a masterpiece in almost every sense. Its narrative is deep and emotional, exploring themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the nature of duty. The jungle setting, combined with its innovative camouflage and survival system, creates an immersive and unique **** Best of the Game:Story and Characters: An unforgettable narrative with multidimensional characters.Memorable Bosses: Every encounter is unique, especially the fights that take advantage of the player's psychology.Setting: The jungle comes to life with stunning visuals and sound design.Cinematics: Masterfully directed, worthy of a spy movie.ConclusionMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a gem of video game design and an example of how the medium can tell deep and impactful stories. However, aspects such as dated controls, uneven pacing, and certain divisive mechanics prevent it from achieving absolute perfection. All in all, it is a must-play title for any stealth fan and a testament to the genius of Hideo Kojima.Final Verdict:While not perfect, its impact on the industry and ability to thrill and challenge the player make it one of the greatest games of all time.. You are above even The Boss. I hereby award you the title.... of Big Boss. 🫡. This game is the best stealth game ever. The bosses are creative and dynamic, the combat is good, and the story is the best in the mgs series. The stealth is what steals the show. It is an amazing game, but kinda drags at the end.. Opus Magnum Kojima-San. Best storyline, best dialogs, best character and stealth mechanic. Thank you Kojima. Best game of era Ps2.. Probably my favorite. I love the unique mechanics of MGS, the gadgets, the cqc, the holdup mechanic and its ramifications, the camouflage mechanic, the secrets, the hidden ways to tackle problems (e.g. giving enemies food poisoning, the sniper boss dying of age, killing said boss before he's even supposed to appear IIRC), the medical treatment mechanics, and probably more stuff I don't remember.. Having just completed Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for the first time, I’m thoroughly impressed by its quality and depth, especially considering it was released in 2004. As someone who usually finds it challenging to stay engaged with older games, this one managed to keep me fully entertained and focused throughout. The mechanics are remarkably advanced for their time. The stealth elements are intricately designed, offering players various methods to approach each encounter. The camouflage system, which allows you to blend into different environments by changing attire and face paint, adds a layer of realism and strategy that heightens the immersion. Finding and experimenting with a wide array of gadgets and weapons further enhances the gameplay experience, encouraging exploration and creativity. Each feature feels purposefully integrated, adding depth without overwhelming the player. This careful balance kept the game engaging from start to finish, as I constantly discovered new aspects of gameplay to master. Snake Eater is a testament to Hideo Kojima’s visionary approach to game design, making it a title that remains both influential and enjoyable for new and returning players alike.. The greatest game I've ever played. From the cliché Hollywood story to the character development, even though it was released in 2004, it fascinated me with its incredible gameplay that will surpass most 3A games today (Shadow of The Tomb Raider). My brother Kojima is a man whose balls can be licked. He already created this game with the slogan ""lick my balls."" In this review, I took on the task of licking Kojima brother's balls. Although I am waiting with great love and excitement for MGS Delta, which will add nothing to the old game and come with updated graphics. My brother Kojima and my brother Hidetaka Miyazaki > The entire gaming industry. (Dan Houser, Sam Houser, Amy Hannig are also included in this list, but these two Japanese brothers are different.)*Note: Neil Druckman is also good, but a little less sjw please. Regards Emre Erbek. It's MGS3, what else is there to say, play it. I look forward to the remake.. The best story in the trilogy of the Metal Gear Solid series, addictive gameplay and really fun and creative bosses,really worth it. (I have played it on pc) From what I understand the pc port isn't good but from my part this isn't why i'm rating it a 5. It's because of the controls!!! They are horrible!!! But the story is really good 5 points for the story and 0 for the control 5/10. A brilliant game all gamers should play! The best entry in the metal gear franchise.. My favourite game of all time, best in the series and best overall in my opinion. To call this a legendary game would be an understatement, this is a work of art and a masterpiece to say the least, what an amazing game.. ""Snake Eater"" is arguably the best game in the series. It's a masterpiece that suffers from a few flaws. For example, the story's pacing is very slow during the first few hours. Even more problematic is the camera which was overhauled for ""Subsistence"". The most surprising element of the game are the survival aspects. For example, Snake must use the right type of camouflage to hide effectively. Also, his injuries must be treated properly or he will suffer. And he has to capture or kill reptiles or animals in order to eat. Of course, there is plenty of action and memorable boss fights. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.4 out of 10.. Snake Eater is in fact the best game from the franchise. The gameplay offers a seamless combination of the familiar and the innovative. While the core stealth mechanics remain intact, they have been revamped to suit the outdoor setting. The traditional radar has been replaced, placing greater emphasis on your senses and the ability to blend in with the surroundings using foliage and face paint. This allows you to seamlessly merge with the jungle environment. Achieving mastery over this system, along with its interaction with weather conditions and wildlife, is incredibly gratifying. However, Snake Eater goes beyond mere stealth. The inclusion of survival mechanics adds an additional layer of strategic depth. You must carefully manage your health, stamina, and even find remedies for parasites and snake bites. This constant need for attention creates a sense of tension, ensuring that every decision you make carries weight and consequence. Furthermore, the fact that the game is being released on the PS5 is a dream come true for enthusiasts who crave a visually demanding experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Being introduced to the series later in my life, I have never seen a man fondle my balls and then recognize that I wasn't one of his discord kittens. The fact they introduced gay characters before Overwatch was being made into porn shows how Kojima was ahead of his time with his ghostwriter on the games. The gameplay is also just meh. Fun but not as fun as the original Metal Gear Solid.. I missed out on the MGS hypetrain for a good chunk of my life, but I had always heard high praise of this series for the longest time. I eventually got to play the whole series back to back a couple years ago after picking the MGS collection for PS3. Personally, it kinda got overhyped for me, but I was still able to enjoy them enough. But the game I liked the most was Snake Eater. I definitely found it to be the most fun MGS game to play. From the tight and innovative stealth gameplay to the long ass movie-like cutscenes, it was a legit blast to play through. And whenever I feel like playing an MGS game (other than Revengeance) I usually play this one. I also found the story of this one the most easy to understand compared to some of the other MGS games (like seriously, MGS2's third half is wild) And I wont forget to mention that ""Snake Eater"" is **** stellar and is one of the great videogame soundtracks to ever be made. Honestly feels like this was peak MGS and none of the games that were made afterwards ever surpassed it. It's also my favorite Genius Kojumbo game.. An all time masterpiece and my favorite of the series. I wonder why it has a lower user rating than the others? Quite strange given that it is the most praised of the iconic franchise. It's the beginning of a wonderful and whacky franchise that only the mastermind Kojima could create.. One of the greatest action adventure games ever made and one of my personal favorites this game is great from its story to its gameplay mechanics it’s soundtrack.. MGS 3: Dung Eater THE VIRTUOUS:The game starts in true Kojima style with a long cutscene aimed at immersing the player in the middle of a story they know nothing about, allowing it to be revealed as they progress through the game. You find yourself in the shoes of Snake. After retrieving Snake's equipment stuck on a branch, the game begins at 100% of its potential, or close to **** BIRTH:This paragraph will underline the narrative structure and its depth, avoiding direct spoilers. In essence, MGS3's story follows Kojima's standard. A story that starts from point A and ends at point O; the player is introduced at point F without knowing anything about any other points, and from O onwards, these are parts they will only discover in other games. All of this is accompanied by an information density that starts at 0 and increases towards the end, where 80% of the information you have is in the ending itself. Math is not an opinion, and yes, throughout the entire story, you discover 20% of the truth, which is essentially nothing. But this would be good if all the characters were perfectly characterized. This is the case with its predecessor. In the case of this Metal Gear, most characters are either background characters, almost mannequins to destroy, or emotionless robots. Of course, there are obvious exceptions, notable from the beginning of the gameplay. There is no shortage of a multitude of excellent codec dialogues, providing a frightening amount of non-game-related **** STUMP:The gameplay of this game takes several steps forward and many steps back compared to its predecessor. Starting with the menus: a new camouflage system has been implemented to blend in with the environment. This is done through a menu that allows you to change clothes and facial camo, which increases or decreases Snake's visibility. Similarly, other functions and menus have been added; one for the backpack, used to move weapons from the inventory to quick items, one for healing where you can heal Snake's limbs and conditions, and a new food system, which mainly involves many different foods that can be hunted in the forest. Moving on to pure gameplay, the camera can now be changed from rails to shoulder, a new hand-to-hand combat system has been implemented, to follow the game's plot, and a very extensive wildlife system has been built, with obvious resulting **** GEAR:Aesthetically, the game is much superior from a technical standpoint but much inferior from a visual balance point of view. Faces and animations have been greatly improved compared to the predecessor, and the amount of on-screen props is frightening for a console like the PS2. Also, on the VFX side, this game is ahead of its time, and this is undeniable. Not to be overlooked is the character design, which is always **** DREAM:Nothing to say, starting from the dubbing to the music and sound effects, everything is **** WHY 7?!The answer will be very direct, and subjectivity will be minimized as much as possible.Metal Gear Solid 3 is an EXTREMELY overrated game. This title was released for the PS2, a high-caliber console, and many players were born on this platform, perhaps with this game. The second refers to those who loved this game because they know what comes after it and appreciate it by making comparisons. Personally, I played the entire saga blindly, so I didn't perceive this, and I could analyze the game for what it offers on the table, which is very little. But not little compared to the market, compared to MGS 2. Taking a look. There are more characters, but much less characterized and sometimes dehumanized (even when they shouldn't be). The movement has a better camera but always seems more wooden and slow, in addition to having many mechanics that are secret but shouldn't be, simply because of the poor tutorial. The boss fights are many but very sparse, also due to technical issues. The story was appreciated more because Raiden was no longer the protagonist, and this brought love to this chapter when objectively Raiden has a writing light-years ahead of Naked Snake and any character (except one) in this game. The final twist is inferior from every point of view compared to the predecessor, which tried and succeeded in predicting the now current future. The three mechanics mentioned earlier are new, but each of these menus greatly reduces the fluidity of the gameplay, with the need to pause the game too many times for healing (another problem with the game's pathetic healing system tied to real-world time outside the game). The camo system would have been nice if the player had to figure out how to adapt, but all the values that vary with the camo are listed by the menu itself, nullifying the skill required. The weapons are all unbalanced, either too weak or too strong. Finally, the overall difficulty of the game is very, very low, at any chosen level. .RATINGSGameplay: 7Music: 8Story: 7. This game is art, I love that, story in game very great and intersting, Metal Gear Solid 3 my favorite part of METAL GEAR. 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater' shines in telling a story of tragedy through the offering of hope. A downside curve. In true anti-war fashion, for the first time in the series, the victory lap is not drenched in altruism; but the pungent sense of sorrow.. This game is unbelievable perfect. The stealth is so great with the camouflage index and the survival aspect. I love the amount information the cutscenes give you so you know what is going on, its the best!. Best Game of all Time. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. The gameplay is good and all but I really don't like the game. Personally, one of the best games in all of history. Aside from the fact that the controls tend to be a little complicated, all aspects of this game are perfect: the gameplay, the development, the characters, the bosses, and above all the story. There's not much to add, everyone should play it at least once.. MGS2 was, imho, much better. Its an incredible game, very fun mechanics and tons or replayability.. This is my favourite game of all time, it is so perfect and it nails everything it does flawlessly, Kojima truly is a genius, the gameplay is amazing and the music is *chefs kiss*.. Im just going to keep this short and simple. This game was amazing and is a classic. One of my favorite games of all time, and it's one of my most played games on the PS2 (the other game being GTA: San Andreas).. MGS3 is probably one of those game that could be the best game ever, but because of the gameplay, it was nearly ruined. The story was meh. The Boss is cool character and enjoyed the boss designs. Soundtrack is probably one of the best things about the game tho.. Not the best entry, but still one of the greatest PS2 games of all time. I remember playing it all night long as a kid. Overall rating: 9.0.. one of the best games I've ever played, Hideo is truly genuineos... and the theme song is fire maan. For me. The best game of all time. The story is phenomenal; the gameplay is insane.. Another amazing experience from the Kojima teams, the Boss is absolutely iconic, just like the genesis of Revolver Ocelot.. This game is insane and ahead of its time, the story is masterpiece, the survivor gameplay is very innovative, there is no stealth game can even compare to this game. One of the best game in PS2 Era. What a thrill... As good as the first 2 games. This time, the level of romance increased. Even though the radio intervenes... The characters are as we know, each more interesting than the other. Different characters. Many of them have special powers. More fantastic. The game gets emotionally high towards the end. Especially the ""snake eater"" soundtrack is awesome. The effects of 007 are reflected in the game. I didn't like the boss fights as much as the 2nd game. But still enjoyable and epic. I enjoyed it overall. Kojima made a game like a movie again.. I've had more fun compared to the previous one. годзилла гелий....... Not counting Subsistence it's my favorite Metal Gear Solid and my fourth favorite game of all time.. What a thrill!!! This game is my top PS2 game, story, music, voice acting, the camouflage mechanic, the trolling on Raiden lookalike, I still tear on the salute grave scene. It's just the perfect game for me.. the gameplay is phonemenal, i got hooked within the first minutes of the game, with a very emotional ending, showing how big boss became the big boss, very good game especially for its time, everyone should play this game at least once, this series has changed my life , the theme right way is beautiful , i love the amazing james bond inspired sequence, as 007 is one of my favorite film series, its very cinematic i love it,10/10. I could write 10000 pages to describe how good this game is, but I don't have that time for a Metacritic review so I'll just say one word: Wow. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. This game is my favourite game in the Metal Gear Solid series. It has a great gameplay for a 2004 game and its the first TPS game in the series. Story was excellent and brilliant.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. Favourite game of my childhood. Loved the gameplay, the story, the characters. Best episode of the MGS series.. one of the most beautiful games on PS2, I like to play and it's easier than Phantom pain to kill the elderly sniper just stay a few days without playing LoL. Played this game when I was like 8 years old. I was impressed that when the PS3 came out that this game just looked better than some PS3 games. This game uses everything the PS2 got. I remember when I finished the game for the first time. This is truly a unique experience.. To me this is the best Metal Gear game ever. It's just beautiful how even after 18 years this game still goes strong. The new hunting and healing mechanics is just fantastic, and it's surely more forgiving than the traditional healing system. The suppressor durability limit really gives the game a little of realism, and the CAMO index is a fantastic mechanic that can be used in a lot of funny and enjoyable ways. For who wants to play it, it's a must play.. A very unique experience. One of the best stealth games ever; even a whopping 18 years later. Theres so much detail put into this game, it's mind-blowing. For example: You can ricochet revolver bullets off of walls and into enemies. (Can you recall a single time that was ever possible?!) The negatives are the outdated controls and the somewhat lengthy and frequent load times. If you do manage to stick with the game, you're in for one hell of a ride.. Interesting game to play; gameplay kinda lacking but its important to consider that this is a 2005 game, strongly recommend trying the HD version tho.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played it after playing MGSV: TPP and don't find the excitement as good as MGSV. I know it came from the previous years but still it's what I expect vs something it gives. Probably the best way to give the ""best"" rating is play the game when it's happening. Brilliant story and amazing stealth gameplay. The bosses were really good and the environments were superb. Gunplay can feel dated but other than that I highly recommend you play mgs3!. I played this game when i was like 12, I remember the feeling of emptiness and sadness when i finished it because i had enjoyed it so much i didn't want it to end.. Its a great game. the gameplay holds up well to todays standards. my only complaint is that the boss fights aren't really interesting. The only ones i liked were The end and The boss. I think this game is a great introduction to the Metal gear franchise because there aren't really any confusing stuff. overall this is a great Metal gear game. This is a masterpiece, the atmosphere of the jungle in the ussr is really well implemented you can't rely on the radar to locate enemies anymore only with sound but you can locate animals using radar and use them as food to regenerate stamina only, as for health can be treated using life medicine or in the menu which i really liked to spend time in looking at several camoflages and treat wounds and broken bones through x ray images, groznyj grad.another great location and of course all boss fights from ocelot to the last one the boss it's just epic. This is certainly one of the best games of all time. Good game. Music is great, story is great, graphics has aged well. My only downside would be the gameplay mechanics, specifically shooting mechanics. It's so frustrating. But i can see that this game would be 10/10 easily at time of release. If i had to describe mgs3 in a couple of words I would say it is a flawed masterpiece. For me to unpack why I believe mgs3 is so great I would start with the positives. 1. The graphics are phenomenal even though it was released in 2004. 2. The gameplay of mgs3 has to be one of the most subtly depthful in any of the games I have played, most games that spout depthful gameplay usually are not depthful at all or are overwhelming and make the player focus on menus and reading rather than playing the game. mgs3's under the surface gameplay doesn't force the player to do anything they don't want to do and still makes the game completable with no knowledge of everything in the game but rewards player that think out of the box (I would like to elaborate however I believe it should be experienced blindly) 3. The strongest aspect of mgs3 is its narrative, because I do not wish to spoil the game all I can say is that the story is not just amazing but unlike games like uncharted where the gameplay is at odds with the story, the gameplay perfectly complements it. The negatives 1. The story can get monotonous near the end. 2, This is actually more of a problem of most mgs games and that is the controls. it is genuinely disappointing that such a great game gets heavily weighed down but such a simple aspect, the controls are horrible and you have to expect that with mgs games from this era, yes you do get use to the controls the more you play. however it is still such a barrier entry to the series I would know because it was the thing I had to over come to enjoy this game. you feel less like you're playing a special forces operative and more like a string puppet that is covered in butter. But this goes back into what I would describe mgs3 in a couple of works, Flawed Masterpiece. I very much encourage anyone that is a thinking about playing mgs or wanting a story heavy game to play mgs3 and push past the controls because it is very much worth it.. The best game I've ever played!! Yes, I spoke confidently, but this work that hideo kojima released in 2004 is an unforgettable memory for me. The story, the atmosphere, the extraordinary mechanics for its period, the characters and many more wonderful things that I can't count.. its game that has it all with guns and story plot and good design and overall good impressions , it detail , i managed to finish this game in 2 months , its plot and story made it more playable , boss fights of many and good playtime of 14 hours , its a game worth getting. James bond what ? This game right here is a true artwork world class masterpiece the best PS2 game ever made and one of the best video games of all time hands down. The best Hideo Kojima game on the PS2 era, excellent graphics, plot, action and gameplay.. MGS3 just isn't a video-game masterpiece, its one of the most precious works of art made in history.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game sported the best graphics of the series and had fun memorable boss fights but was tedious to play through. There are new mechanics to add depth, like the camo system, or medic system, or food system for stamina but frankly it makes the game tedious. Changing you outfit was the best of these ideas, but needing to change every five feet was tedious and dull. The field medic system needed more tweak and it would've worked better. Maybe something more automatic. The food system was fairly solid and well implemented of the new mechanics As for stealth the camera angle mixed with no longer having radar makes that kind of impossible. You're bound to be spotted unless you've already played the game and know where the enemy is. its a catch 22 I guess. Cutscenes are a bit too long, but at least interesting. New characters like The Boss, are one dimensional and uncharismatic. Eva was a great new character but they went a bit too far with sex appeal in obvious ways. Other than that the plot twists are a bit more convincing than past games.. One of the best stealth games ever. The survival aspect fits in very well, the story hypnotizes us from start to finish (and what an end ...) In short, if you like infiltration and good stories, go for it. The best part of Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid series has always been the immersive story line.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is the worst evar!!, there is no first person cardboard boxing. kojima was mad because of this review.... Probably the best MGS game. The story and the ending where the best parts of the game. The rest was all average, particularly the gameplay.. Truly a masterpiece. Not only the best game in the series and the genre, but one of the best video games ever created. The story is great, the soundtrack is cool, the graphics are impressive and so on. Where the game really shines is in its replay value. The game is so filled with hidden functions and techniques that it would take many playthroughs to see it all. And everytime you find a new function you just want to start it all over to try it out in different scenarios. You can truly play the game in YOUR way. Do you want to enjoy the story? Fine. Do you want to complete the game with no kills? You can do that (with the exception of bosses). If you know what you’re doing the game is VERY SATISFYING to play and that’s why everyone should play it through atleast twice to see atleast a little bit of the game’s FULL potential. Or you could just play it through normally and love it for the story and tight level design.. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was one of 2004's best action games. Pacing and camera issues keep it from being a masterpiece, but it's still great. Chronologically, this is the very first entry in the MG universe and features Big Boss as the protagonist. It's set in the Soviet Union jungle during the Cold War of 1964. The gameplay is similar to the previous game with a new set of mechanics. In ""Snake Eater"", players must use camo to blend into the environment to avoid detection. This is also a survival game since you must stay healthy by hunting for food and tending injuries. The pace is slow due to the lack of an effective radar. You'll have to rely on binoculars, a sonar system and motion tracker to spot enemies. Unfortunately, the overhead camera angle can be a problematic. As a result, it can be difficult to maneuver around enemy soldiers. Despite its flaws, this is a terrific Metal Gear game. The Ape Escape mini-game is great silly fun. Overall, I would rate Snake Eater with a 9.4 out of 10.. It's impossible to describe this game with few words We're in 2021, and still I think there's no game like this. This game tecnologically anticipated games for a lot of years, nothing more to say than this: as a game developer myself, I think this is the best game ever.. Beautiful, masterful story. The ultimate spy thriller. Unique boss battles to boot. ***** (5.00). I translated this game by myself, but i got a good experience anyway. I can recommend this game for anyone who ask me about best story. I love this game and it's one of my best PS2 games. We hope a remake appears soon.. What can I say?? Kojima made a miracle with this game, the bosses are AWESOME, the game play are a little slow when your are a newbie but extremely satisfatory when you get it... a must play game. One of the Best games ever made, a game that every gamer should play, a unique and unforgettable experience, a script that would make many Hollywood writers jealous, along with a chilling soundtrack, graphics that have aged extremely well.. MGS 3 Snake Eater is an absolute masterpiece, and is easily my favorite game in the series. Epic bosses, a great and emotional story, and a third person prospective truly make this a must own. Whether it's on the PS2 or the HD collection.. This game is my favorite game in the series as well as one of my favorite games of all time. The plot on its own is a testament to its popularity amongst the rest of the entries in the franchise, it goes in the best direction I think it could have","the lack of a fully controllable camera system makes some areas frustrating to explore, affecting the fluidity of the game . the survival system is innovative and adds depth, but it's not for everyone . the open combat sections aren't as polished ."
222.Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition,"Best Dragon Quest game period. Has all a dragon quest game has to offer and enhanced. The story and the gameplay are fun and, for me, it is the ultimate classic rpg experience. A must try. This is one of the best games ever made the story and world are amazing and it also looks amazing I love this. Beautiful world and characters! I had so much fun with this and it's the first DQ game that got me into the series. Can't wait to get my hands on DQ3 remake.. If you can get past that super boring first area early section,then it became a really amazing rpg after that with a despair and hopeless feeling and amazing time travel story,very good music,theres a LOT of end game content,one thing i dont like is the reduce stat skill can miss,the depth of story,rpg mechanic ,likeable party member,world building,events,villain definitely worthy of the dragon quest name title and must play prg. One of the greatest JRPGs of all time. This may be the greatest RPG on the switch. Dragon Quest 11s is my first experience with the series, and it has been fantastic. The story is captivating, and the characters are well-developed. Leveling up is enjoyable, and the game includes interesting features like the casino, which add extra layers of fun.. My worst spent $ on eShop. Encouraged by positive reviews (""best game ever!""), having played several good jrpgs before, I had like 10 approaches and never could stand more than 30 minutes, it's just so boring. Combat system is like in SNES games in 90's. Character progression is shallow and not rewarding. There's a lot of grind in extremely boring battles. The music is horrible, there is like 20 mins of soundtrack per entire game. Although most people praise the graphics, to me it looks like fairytale for children up to 5 yrs old + most characters look like they have esotropia (eyes crossed). PLAY IT ONLY IF YOU'RE FAN OF THE SERIES. For good jrpg, choose, Xeno 3, Persona 5, Atelier Ryza, Octopath,Ni No Kuni... Anything but this lazy cash grab.. This game was hours of classic JRPG fun Very polished, fun story, interesting characters and amazing gameplay Truly a 10/10 JRPG. I can say for sure for people who want to get into the dragon quest series but for at least, for people who wanted to get into the 8 bit series. This is it. If you wanted to change the visuals. Then you can do that. Music. Yes. You can also try that. Sound yes. Bit **** yes I do think it’s possible for a definition of a remaster then yes. I do believe it is throughly. Possible if you wanted to remove all of the remaked parts and still basically visit the house and seas of the 3d world. Then yes. It is still a possibility as well. Dragon Quest XI is an old-school JRPG, with everything that goes with it. Unfortunately, so much potential was given away in part 11! It simply lacks the emotions in the game that the characters show far too rarely! The playable hero seems stiff, completely emotionless and is unfortunately not set to music (except for special exceptions) like the rest of our competitors. The biggest plus and that should actually bring all major games is the loading screen after loading a save game! Here it is briefly summarised in text form what happened recently and where we are currently in the story. Great!! :) Other cool extras are the 2D/3D change in the game to be able to play the game completely in 2D or the teleport system which allows you to jump to the beginning of a dungeon without roaming it again for a way back. I played a little over 80h and leave the game sobered.. Difficulty spikes are ridiculous Combat is clunky Ally AI is stupid even with tactics Dungeon design reminds me of D&D dungeons I designed in middle school Story Is Tolkien for dummies. It's not bad, but definitely gives off generic RPG vibes, coupled with as basic as can be combat and really, really bad voice acting. I feel like Square Enix is incapable of producing well written/performed games, as this is a recurring pattern in all of their games. But, this game is oddly charming and sets itself apart with it's beautiful Toriyama artstyle, snappy battles and comedic moments. It won't convert you over to RPGs, but it's definitely worth a shot.. Best RPG since Lost Odyssey. Played on Series X, looks amazing. Down side is sometimes annoying text tru options, not fitting music and start of act 2 with that parade.... One of the best games for Nintendo Switch !!! Love very muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Take this game if you want a really chill rpg without too much hassle. On the other hand, go your way if you want an innovative and different RPG. that's why for me it gets just average because you end up getting terribly bored, which is a shame given the number of things to do in the game and the pretty cool character design.. I've played 7 of the DQ games in the series, and I can't say this one was as amazing as other titles, yet, not a bad experience either. - Pros - as usual with DQ games (and generally one of my favorite thing about them) is just how saturated everything looks. Most RPGS are dark, and don't get me wrong, DQ11 has its dark story parts too, yet even those still look colorful and vibrant! The world just gives off bright and stimulating vibes which I love in RPGS. Also, the graphics are pretty good for a Switch game. (They were actually one of the reason I stopped playing PKM Karmesin cause in immideate contrast the PS2 trash graphics were just tooo apparent in comparison to the DQ ones but anyway,, ) --- The story is HUGE. You will definitely get your money's worth for the minimum amount of hours. .... Honestly, those are all its remarkable positive aspects. Now, for the --- Cons --- Honestly, one thing that I genuinely couldn't get over the whole gameplay is that I couldn't even pick the gender. Character Customization is extremely important for me for a good experience, and while I can get beyond not every game having a super detailed customization option, yet you aren't even given the choice to play as a woman here, although it wouldnt alter the story at all. Seriously....? --- You can not only NOT pick your party members (which is fine as this is something DQ games just do and the party members were fine itself) but you can not even pick their fighting classes. Yes, you're forced to accept their ability set, which would be fine if it did anything for a character build, yet there's no struggle to decide what build you want to go for, as all characters basically overlap with their weapons and after only a bit of grinding you're going to be able to pick ALL the abilities in the skill tree anyway, so there's no real ""point"". --- the world isnt very interactive in its terrain in the sense that you're just going to walk around and very rarely press the A button to automatically climbin up something, for example. For a switch game I wouldnt even mind it that much, but for a PC game, that's pretty underwhelming to be honest. --- The Music is mostly awful. I usually love DQs soundtracks, with DQ9 & DQ6 having the most beautiful soundtrack of any game I've played, but here, the music made me either feel indifferent or, I'm sorry, extremely annoyed. The general music outside of cities when exploring the area is the WORST, in my opinion. All in all I will say that I put 130hours in this game and I'm glad it was a source of entertainment in a way, but I will not likely in the near (or far) future replay this game as it didnt leave me amazed or overly joyful, or like I was even role-playing in the first place due to the limited customization of your character and party, to be honest. Still, it didnt leave me with a bad feeling either. Altogether, just above an average game for me.. If you're looking for something relatively unsubtle, lowbrow and gimmicky, then this game does a reasonable job of bringing together generic JRPG themes into a lengthy romp. But if you're seeking a work of art, look elsewhere. // 1. It’s a very patronising experience, in general. The whole game is so easy that, even double-digit numbers of hours in, it still feels like a tutorial. Want to know what to do next? You will always be told exactly what to do and how to do it. Worried you might forget? You will always be reminded repeatedly. For example, you find a distressed looking dog in the forest. You are allowed about 15 seconds of mystery before you experience a vision that tells you *exactly* what happened. The culprit has retreated into a chest nearby. Before you can head off to find the chest, you have another cutscene in which you discuss with your companion what to do, and your companion makes it explicitly clear that you should now find the chest, and he also tells you where to go to find it. And if that isn’t enough, the location of the chest is now also marked on your map, so that you cannot possibly not find it. Everything is like this – you are continuously reassured that, if you are ever even remotely uncertain about anything, there are multiple mechanisms that will tell you *exactly* what to do. The result is a game that ostensibly looks like a game of exploration on an open map, but in practise could hardly be more linear. Want to find the mysterious sparkly locations that contain items? Just press a couple of buttons, and you can see them all on your map. No exploration of curiosity required! There are also no proper problems – it’s just going from one place to another, doing things in the obvious order. There is very, very rarely a point where you get to feel rewarded for curiosity. The world also feel very empty. You know that feeling in Breath of The Wild where you find yourself in a special-looking place or unusual part of the map, and you are normally rewarded for it? Most of the time, the equivalent map locations in this game are empty – no items; just glitchy camera angles. // 2. The battles are unchallenging. If you’re looking for a turn-based RPG so that you can think your way strategically through battles, this is not it. The battles are literally just an equation of ""high enough level + mostly attacking + occasionally healing = victory"". You will mostly be hammering “A” to attack as quickly as possible. You will almost never be considering the specific weaknesses of given enemies nor even which one to defeat first. The only task I ever found myself doing was ensuring everyone in my party focused on dealing with one enemy at a time, because the system illogically defaults to your party members attacking different enemies. Fixing this every time is not strategy though; it's just annoying. Similarly, items and equipment are boring, and offer little beyond bumping up your numbers a little bit each time. The forge mini game to make equipment is a senseless slot machine too – there’s no skill, just persistence and time sunk. // 3. The music is repetitive and unmoving. No game is truly great without great music. To Zanarkand from Final Fantaxy X. Luma Pools from Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Palace End from Creaks. These are all works of art that elevate the games they’re made for. This game has almost nothing to offer musically. // 4. The characters and story are crass and hollow. Need to know if you should dislike a character? Don’t worry, the music will tell you to dislike them. Their slanting evil eyebrows will remind you what to feel too. Need to know if you should distrust a character that seems friendly? Don’t worry – they’ll say something questionable soon enough. The characters are also mostly extremely dated and gendered tropes. With the exception of Sylvando, they are boring. // I read a review about someone who said that they put most of the game on autopilot, and listened to podcasts as they went through it. That's possibly the only way for a smart, curious person above the age of 13 to enjoy this game. However, if you're either very young, or looking for something unmoving, uninspiring and unsurprising, this could be the thing for you. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a beautiful adventure, I’d recommend trying Final Fantasy IX. It’s the top-rated JRPG for a reason. It’s the Final Fantasy series’ creator’s favourite for a reason. Sure, you can tell that the team slightly ran out of time and money for the third quarter of Final Fantasy IX, but as a whole, there is – to date – still no JRPG that surpasses it in terms of story, music, world-building, characters, ethos, playfulness, strategy, immersion. I wish that Dragon Quest XI was even 10% as good as Final Fantasy IX… if it was, I might have carried on playing it, but like so many other people, I’m giving up on Dragon Quest XI through sheer boredom. (Other good games: Braid, Fez, Machinarium, World of Goo, Ori WotW). Playing this game is like waking up way too early in the morning as a kid and watching cartoons and eating cereal before school. Pure childlike bliss and sense of wonder. This is a game better described as magical and charming than anything else. I never cared much for turn based combat until this, and I don’t think I’ll ever care again. But this game is just too wonderful for that gameplay aspect to be of consideration.. This is my first time playing a DQ game, and it was an amazing experience. Gameplay was engaging and characters were fascinating. I'm looking forward to the next DQ game!. Dragon Quest is back.. I will only say that this game deserved to be GOTY of its year. Its magical. This is pretty fun. The game is so traditional, so I thought it would be boring or whatever? But not at all. That's why it's more fun. Compared to other famous franchises in Square Enix, Dragon Quest didn't try to ruin the game or change the genre at all, just maximizing the advantages they had. The story is slightly obvious, but I'm impressed by the voice in each cut scene, the motions that are mostly not reused. Considering what mass-produced JRPGs look like these days, this game is definitely fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game, great characters. It felt really charming, at start at the very least, kinda dragged on for a while. The plot was pretty decent. Enjoyable and charming JRPG. Very good game, a bit repetitive and not such a exploration to make. All the 2d/3d thing is a little confuse and could make the game really easy with the double rewards.. Dragon Quest finally gets an overhaul to its battle system, and the results are amazing. There's a ton of content for players new and old to the series, and I love the characters.. the best RPG ive ever played, im 80 hours into and still not finished, also looks great in the switch!. My first dragon quest game. And while I enjoyed it, I found myself not as attached to the characters and world as I'd like to have been.. This game is stupid Im sorry. Its filled with more filler A to B story quests than FFXIV. Its seriously painful. Starting act 2 was horrible. 10 hours just to get your party back and thats WITH rushing and skipping all scenes which there's tons of. Not to mention you lose ALL warp locations (zoom) and have yo re obtain every single freaking one Level and quest design get a flat F In the S version slime island was also nerfed. No metal slimes in act 1 at all. Youre forced to use electro to spawn any. I save wizard’d my save on ps4 because its bs. If visual novel bs quests werent bad enough, nearly all quests have such a poor description on them that youre playing a freaking guessing game on what to do. People on Gamefaqs have 6+ pages long of replies just to answer how to complete one sinple freaking mission and they end up arguing about how its done. This is absolutely poor game design. SE forgot this is an RPG not a Visual Novel. And Ultra speed in the S version isnt even ultra, its normal. I had quit mid act 1 the first version because of the animation speed being crap. The new act 2 quests are equally bad. Its just another 2 hours of complete visual novel GARBAGE. I love witcher 3, persona, FFX FFVII etc, other dw games are good too. This is garbage and all the high ratings are from people who probably think visual novels are any sort of interesting. Waste of time completely and a disgrace to JRPG.. This game is a standout in the already phenomenal Dragon Quest series. It has such great gameplay, a rich world, characters oozing with charm, a fun story and a great soundtrack. Admittedly, as much as I like the soundtrack, I believe the game would have benefitted greatly with more tracks and variety of said tracks. You are forced to listen to the same songs over and over again and they aren't varied enough to prevent them from wearing. The plot was fun and had some very high highs, but it was nothing really all that special. But I believe this game is really fun and incredible, and doesn't need a groundbreaking narrative to be a 10/10 game for me. Some of the most fun gaming experiences I've had in my life came from DQXI, and I will never forget this game, or the world of Erdrea, or it's fun and charming towns, or its character-rich monster designs, or all the fun I had playing this game.. The best game for enjoyers of nostalgic turn-based RPG fans or for new people looking to enter the RPG sphere. The game is more than worth the price as it contains hundreds of hours In just the very foundation of the game. Fun story and loveable characters, unique designs, long story, and simple but enjoyable gameplay.. this gameplay is very is awesome and lets you do awesome things. love this game. I really wanted to like this game. It’s beautiful, plays wonderfully and the voice acting is phenomenal. The plot also seems decent as well, but I found it just didn’t grab me as I had hoped. The combat and character progression is where I feel the game could have really been a lot better. The combat is classic turn based with no gimmicks or anything fancy. The new moves and gear come in a slow trickle with very little in the way of improvement. The abilities just don’t feel impactful and the mana pools are huge so you can easily spam them in combat. All in all, it’s a classic JRPG that hangs onto some unfortunately archaic systems that are wrapped in beautiful world design, great voice acting and likeable characters.. The best experience of a RPG game, great story, good gameplay, 80+ hours only for the main quest, hard mode in draconian mision for replaying, orquestal soundtrack, japanese voices. Masterpiece of rgp games. brilliant game with brilliant ideas. i love this game, the story, the gameplay.. It warms my heart to know that Japan is still making simple, medieval fantasy RPGs with no fancy bells and whistles. Just a good ol' fashioned fun time; it has a humble, retro feel with a modern coat of paint and level of polish. Of course you'll want to play the Definitive Edition because it has some neat extra features (like being able to play the entire game in classic 16-bit style) and the orchestrated soundtrack. Even though this was originally made for the PS4 I thought it looked fantastic on my Switch. Such a damn good port.. Being a huge DQ player I jumped on this one and rushed it, the experience was formidable, it was incredible. great game .. I was apprehensive going in. I had only played 2 previous Dragon Quests before this, and never really ‘clicked’ with the stop-start momentum of heavy grinding between towns & quests. But DQ11 blew me away. No random encounters, generous auto saves and flexible difficulty settings mean you can concentrate on the rich characters, the fantastic story and fun combat with gorgeously animated enemies. Not grinding. The story at first seems standard fantasy fare. But the moment you step out from your village the world comes alive. Whereas Final Fantasy feels like high opera, this is more an epic Odyssey combined with touches of the Brothers Grimm and Disney. (But always with an adult edge.) The detailed and lively towns you visit are filled with interesting NPCs & hilarious dialogue, in keeping with past games. Castles and caves are a joy to fight in and explore. You learn to know and love every member of your party. The art by Akira Toriyama gives it a Dragonball-ish feeling, with each new location bringing a new mini adventure. The game has some tiny flaws but nothing big. The pacing of the game slows down a bit towards the end, as in most RPGs, when you prepare for the final battle by assembling artifacts. (what else?) The post-game section is a neat idea but drags at times — and, for once, requires grinding. Bottom line: this is one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played at a time when I thought I’d exhausted my options (BOTW, Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Divinity: Original Sin, Witcher) and after a slightly disappointing experience with Persona 5 and Final Fantasy VII Remake (both overly long with pacing issues imo). I highly recommend it.. WARNING! This game is too easy, and the only other option is Very Hard mode, and you can't change difficulty after starting. This is a huge core flaw that really ****, and is hard to understand the existence of. I don't know why this isn't talked about more, though it is talked about. I'm over half way through the game and I have to stop. While at first the characters were charming and the quest fairly interesting, the story is just meandering from reason for it to keep going to reason for it to keep going using anime power up tricks and such. In addition, Akira Toriyama's art design of monsters is extremely hit or miss here, with half or more of the monsters looking like off-brand toys for very young children. The game also feels very cheap in a number of other ways, for instance you get to a cool new area only to hear the same exact music for every other area, then you go in a cave and hear the exact same music for every other cave and dungeon. This game is doing as little as it can to make a profit, making sure to extend the playtime so people don't complain. This game is very disappointing, and I am appalled at the praise it has received by players and critics alike. If you are looking for a good JRPG experience, I recommend these; Dragon Quest IV for the Nintendo DS Pokemon Blue or the updated Leaf Green version Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest 1 Radiata Stories. Do not stop after the credits roll the first time! The game's true ending and plot unfolds after the credits. This wasn't explained very well, but is how the game is meant to be played. And what a **** addicting! While the inventory menu is a bit clunky, and the characters aren't fleshed out as well as they could have been, it's still one of the best experiences I've had on the switch!. Refined JRPG. .. What a grand adventure this game was! A total gem, I'd never played a Dragon Quest game before, I'd heard it was good, but was always skeptical about that. I was in for a wonderful surprise this game was a breath of fresh air in the JRPG scene. It's very tried and true, but it had just enough QOL features to show what a JRPG should be striving for in this day and age.. Its a masterpiece, simply a masterpiece. i have thought that the times, were I spent hours and nights into a game are over. However, this game proved me wrong, I was so fascinated from the story, the characters and the battle system, that I simply couldn't put the controller away. The turn-based battle system is easy to learn and never gets frustrated or boring. There are a variety of strategies you can experiment with. In combination with the ability system, the motivation to fight gets never lost. You always want to level up to get enough ability points for the next technique or ability. So the core element of the gameplay is motivational and very fun. Although it is a very important aspect of each JRPG, the gameplay alone is not the reason, why I rate this game with the 10 out of 10. The main reason are the story and in combination with that, the characters. There are so many fantastic JRPG's like the Final Fantasy Series, the Tales of Series or Xenoblade Chronicles. However creating a cast of characters where anyone of them gets a deep character developement with interesting facets is difficult to achieve. Dragon Quest did just that. Every character, which will become one of your allies, has his own unique motivation, his own unique attitude, his own beliefs and most importantly his own backstory with other strong characters. For example, the relationship between Henrik and Jasper is one of the strongest side-stories in the game. Rabs sections of characterdevelopement and funny and serious moments are balanced perfectly. Sylvandos joyful attitude will thrill you sooner or later. The story as a whole, gets better from act to act. The third act, which is post-game is by far the best of the three. I don't want to spoiler here. Only one thing. Best time travel plot I have seen so far.. This is my favorite DQ game and RPG game so far! The graphics are so nice, even on Switch. The plot, as always in DQ series, is intriguing. I don't have any complaint!. One of the best RPGs of all time, polished beyond believe. There is so much to do and the characters are all extremely likeable!. Imperfect version **** gem originally released on PS4 and PC It has a brutal graphic downgrade and doesn't do justice to the original release of 2018.. When a game is not compelling enough to even keep me entertained for the duration of a demo, then there is something wrong. Very strange choice of voice actors. The girl of young appearance, sounded like a middle aged British farmer. It felt like a chore. At least with ARPG's you mash A and continue. In this, as with many turn based RPG's you mash a and sit through the animations again and again. Quite frankly, after 3, or 4 times, I was mumbling to myself, something along the lines of please hurry the **** up. To me, games like this can be saved by a good OST. This however has a really old fashioned OST. It isn't even remotely memorable. For comparison, I didn't like XCDE very much but I still listen to the OST loads. DQ 11 is a failure.. Dragon Quest XI S is a game steeped in tradition and brewed to modernized perfection: the perfect cup of JRPG tea. This is quite candidly the best JRPG and video game of this last decade. Dragon Quest XI S and Persona 5 have essentially led the era into a 2nd coming of the golden age of rpgs. So many great JRPGS in these last few years and DQ XI S is undeniably a leader of the pack. What a phenomenal, magical adventure this game was, just... Wow! Haven't felt this naive excitement playing games in a long time. Truly a masterpiece! Gameplay- was ludicrously enjoyable. Combat system is excellent. It's a traditional turn based combat with modern twists like the exciting pep system and each character's individual turn is acted upon as soon as a skill is selected, rather than picking all your characters skills at the start of a turn and just hoping they act in order of agility. DQ XI S gets rid of that bollocks and its turn based combat is much more conducive to strategic combat. The great turn based combat system is furthermore bolstered when played with draconian modifiers for emphasis on more strategic gameplay, which really makes excellent use of buffs/debuffs, status ailments, set ups, effective damage, etc. If playing normal, it's fun just clobbering the hell outta enemies anyways, so both difficulties have their perks, and difficulty picks up on normal mode in act 3 and post game for sure. Also, it's fun and I mean a fricken blast to ride on defeated monsters, especially on gnarly looking dragons and on the poor slime knight, who just kinda dangles haphazardly on the side as you hop along! That gets a hearty chuckle out of me every time. Story- starts out fairly traditional and does have some twists that definitely aren't expected, but the story is exceptionally well told. Erik's memory loss felt all too real and completely genuine. It made me feel like I could empathize with his pain... Veronica's act 2 moment left me in a state of complete emotional distraught. The story is just so heartfelt in this game. It's just a nice fantasy story without the superfluous fluff. Erik is now my new favorite JRPG character and video game character of all time because of both his amazing combat prowess and his characterization. What a cast of lovable characters in general though. Erik and Veronica especially, but the whole cast just was so salt of the earth and fantastic. Graphics- cannot tell you how many times I stopped playing this game just to indulge in the breathtaking scenery! This game is gorgeous! The graphic downgrade from PS4 to Switch is barely noticeable, so well played on DQ XI for not being a slouch in the graphic department on the Switch. The water and lava areas in particular are stunning and realistic. I love the unorthodox mix of the hyper realistic graphics using anime esque qualities with realism. Brilliant! Music- while the story certainly got more involved and considerably better in the S version, with it's add ins that make the story more cohesive and beautifully told, the music got a much needed redo: A orchestral soundtrack and the option to use Dragon Quest VIII's soundtrack. The only downside about the original DQ XI was the music, and DQ XI S fixed that and made the music much more palpable to the ears. Dragon Quest XI S changed my gaming life: I was addicted to gachas before playing this game. I had stopped playing real games like I had done my whole life to play sunken fallacy games in the form of gachas and my life had hit some all time personal lows to top it all off... I played this game, forgot my woes, and everything changed and I've been playing JRPGs and beating them left and right, but DQ XI S remains my favorite game of all time. Bye bye gachas, hello rpgs my old friends! I created a metacritic account just to review this phenomenal game. I had such a blast playing this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes JRPGS done right. One of the few games I'd rate a perfect 10/10 or in my mind: 11/10. This game is just...decent. There's no real investment on any of the characters, or areas you go to. The story is decent at times but really blah for long stretches. It's overall extremely easy, even doing the Draconian quests. My biggest gripe is probably the plot, which just seems like a game of telephone. The game is safe. It's never terrible, but never great either. 20-25 years ago there were a half dozen games like this per year.. 2nd best Dragon Quest game by far after 8. Every character is fun and has a great story both alone and combined with the other. Just wish they'd add DQ8 monster capturing to the newer games.. What a wonderful game this is. Its one of the best looking games on the Switch Period. Runs smooth and plays even smoother. I loved the story and combat. Be awhere, its a huge long game that will takes alot of hours to complete but well worth it. Good job Nintendo!. Cool, beatiful, immersive world and story. Turn based is not my genre but with beautiful soundtrack i can enjoy this games.. extremely boring dialog and storyline even 45 hours in. Combat and leveling system with the ability grid is like ff10 but for preteen super weebs. Very unstrategic and boring even late in the game. Worst rpg I've played in years. Music is annoying. How is this trash so popular?. One of the best turned based RPG games you can play. The combat is excellent, the world is astonishing and the story is incredibly interesting with a lot of twists along the way, and well written characters. The soundtrack is excellent, and one of the most important parts of the game. It's just a masterpiece.. One of the best JRPGs I've ever played (definitely up there with Persona 4.) I really appreciate how everything is streamlined with tons of quality-of-life improvements. (story recap, quest markers, markers for red doors, etc) so you always know where to go and who to talk to.. God game!! One of my best games in my life. Because if this game I become to look after other JRPGs.. Dragon Quest ","""dragon quest 11s"" is my first experience with the series . the story is captivating, and the characters are well-developed . combat system is like in SNES games in 90's ."
223.Tomb Raider (1996),"Tomb raider, that game used to flip my head as a kid. It took me 15 years approx. To finish it was worth it :) so much challengeand fun to be had and on the technical front so much to be admired. Kudos to the small and brave team that developed this first game, they fought time, tiredness and the greed of publishers (like many other developers out there) to put this out.. I played Tomb Raider on duckstation. It was hard to imagine that in the game environment with a bunch of pure 2D or 2D imitation 3D scenes, there would be such a game with all the scenes and characters in 3D. The atmosphere of exploring the tombs and being surrounded by mechanisms is very good. When I played the first level, I really didn’t expect that the maps in the subsequent levels would be so huge. No wonder Tomb Raider became an instant hit at the time.. I respect this game as a piece of gaming history as a transition to 3d gaming environments and controls, but it has not aged well. Graphics are very dated, even for PS1 standards, the controls are obtuse ""tank controls"" and makes it difficult to use regardless of if you're using analog or d-pad, and the puzzles/traps can require you to be quick with this terrible control scheme. The game was very ambitious, and I respect what they've done for the industry, and the fact that it created a franchise that I do enjoy. If you want to experience the story of Tomb Raider remade for newer consoles, try ""Tomb Raider: Anniversary."". Hey Lara Croft, what kind of character are you, the best female character, I admire you as a man, action adventure ceiling. the best game of the history.!! Best character, best soundtrack, best action levels.... Such a great game, so much to search Nd explore the variety of enemies is such a fresh feel for the time love the unlimited bullets just has a bit rough movement and the save crystals are not frequent enough thats the only downside thats not fact thats just my opinion. Don't listen to the carbon based life forms that gave a low score! This game can be very difficult at first but that is because it actually requires you to have a little skill, the ability to think, and problem solve. When I played it back in the day, I was deeply immersed in the tombs that needed to be explored. I thankfully kept my PS1 copy and actually started playing it again recently.. I loved this one back in the day. Still play it sometimes on my PS1. One of my earliest memories is me watching a neighbour playing this game. Later, i would try it myself but it was too boring and hard for me.. The ground breaking 3D adventure may seem a little primitive in this day and age, but it was a watershed title for the PS1 and still contains some pleasurably laid back exploring and ledge-leaping for the nostalgic.. This game is a legend. It was really difficult for me as a kid. I still come back to this game. Did you know that Lara Croft's hair was too hard for the PCs of the 90s?. I was a SNES and Megadrive user at the time and I was looking at the dawn of Playstation very sceptical. Nothing was there for me on its first 2 years on the market, but then this came and it blew my mind. Thanks to it I discovered for the first time the type of game most fit to me: those that allow me to discover and explore, with constant amazement. On my top 5 of all time.. Still unique to this day! There's just nothing else like the PS1 Tomb Raiders out there. The mysterious feel and atmosphere of the original Tomb Raiders hasn't been replicated to this day. Can't say the same for the 2010s reboot games, which were already unoriginal and generic the day they came out. Not games you want to go back to again and again either, unlike these original Tomb Raiders. Anyway, here are a few personal observations that I found funny: 1. The animations in the game are strange and funny sometimes. When you have to place lead bars onto the hand of Midas to turn them into gold, it looks like Lara sneezes them onto the hand, accompanied by a very feminine sound effect. 2. Throughout the game you'll be attacked by a man that will disappear when you've damaged him enough every time. He runs behind the nearest corner and disappears in a way that doesn't make any sense. It's like as soon as he leaves your sight, he despawns. If you keep chasing him, he will keep looking for ways to leave your line of sight, which is funny. 3. I also find it weird how the different animals attacking you don't attack each other, as they would in real life. Instead, they work together to hunt down Lara and EVEN team up with human enemies! Sadly, I have to give this game a low rating, because while I do want to have all the PS1 Tomb Raider games in my collection and finish them all, I didn't really enjoy my time with this one. I started out throroughly enjoying this game, but by the end, the enjoyment had turned into an absolute chore. It gets quite awful by the end. If you have played ****'t you agree? I expect to enjoy the next ones more and give them a higher rating, especially with the ability to save anywhere I want, which should help. Plus I've always liked The Last Revelation and Chronicles more. Anyone, who tends to get frustrated easily, please steer clear of this game. Make no mistake, this is one of the most frustrating games ever made. There's a chance you will hate this game by the time you're done with it. And if you're a Zoomer with a short attention span, don't even bother reading this review about this game, which you just finished reading. Then proceed to throw yourself into the nearest spike pit you can find locally. Thanks for reading. May the butler lock Lara in the freezer. Classic Lara must be preserved.. Before Core Design conceptualized the strange UK heroine Lara Croft, they initially considered a male lead in the likes of Indiana Jones. However, Core entrusted Toby Gard's concept to rest aside lawsuits from George Lucas. Their pitch paid off with Tomb Raider in 1996, which released with much acclaim. Tomb Raider was notable for its peculiar 3D level design and often is considered to have pioneered the third-person genre. Nowadays it’s kind of a relic of the past, but still made a big impact in the industry for the time.. This is probably the biggest revolution that gaming world have ever seen. Judging by the 1996 standards it's almost perfect. Even today you can still feel beauty, atmosphere and its enourmously big influence for the gaming world. So why not 10/10? Cause there are places where scripts aren't really working well and also there is to much pushing blocks style puzzles - sometimes it kinda felt boring and too long.. OVERALL - 92% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 9/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 8/10 Any game that comes out in the mid-90s and be as referenced and talked about as much as this, must be something pretty special. It was also the first computer game character that 5 year old me was confused about... Extremely immersive from start to finish, paired with some of the best level and puzzle design in the genre.. Tomb Raider has become one of the most popular franchises in video game history, becoming an instant success and a household name along with it's main heroine, Lara Croft after just one game. It helped set the standard for 3D, being developed at the same time as other groundbreaking 3D games such as Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot (I'll get to those games one day, I'm sure.) It's a game that's notorious for it's aged controls and primitive graphics, often regarded as a game that's essentially unplayable nowadays. Do I share this sentiment? No. Tomb Raider undoubtedly has a steep learning curve and requires quite a bit of trial and error but, to me, nailing this control scheme down and successfully pulling off a dangerous and difficult maneuver such as clearing a large gap was such a rewarding experience for me. It's truly a test of endurance and patience but it always left me feeling good about myself when I managed to play the game correctly without dying excessively. As I got better, the game got more fun... which makes sense. My point is, the controls aren't exactly bad, at least not terrible. Using a d-pad in a 3D platformer can hurt your thumb quite a bit and I felt like there were a few more cheap deaths targeted at first time players than I'd like to see but I overall had a very good time and thought it was a rewarding and memorable experience. Lara Croft is the type of protagonist you root for. Her cheeky attitude and likeable personality never fails to keep you on her side and I think it serves as some sort of motivation to keep going forward. It sounds childish but I think it's something you have to experience to understand. You want her to overcome the odds and win. Overall, due to it's massive influence and the fact that it was not only a great game for the time, but also holds up today in some capacity, I can't help but look back at my experience quite fondly.. Played it for the first time in 2020 and loved it. Outstanding level design, engaging puzzles, decent gun play and manageable control. Can be easy to get stumped on some of the level puzzles, but otherwise, i really enjoyed this game and the accomplished feeling i got when pulling off the platforming and puzzle solving.. Blew me out of the water back in the day. Exploration, 3d, ... Just a lot of fun.. I played this game again after about a decade. Such an awesome game, even now I still enjoy playing it and will probably play it again! I miss this kind of Lara Croft, just exploring and solving puzzles all on her own.. Innovative, classic and the introduction of the muse Lara Croft. One of the best games of the franchise.. The game that started a franchise for Playstation. One of the first games i got with the system and it's a pretty solid game that's well worth a purchase if you own the original Playstation.. Owned this game since it came out but never really got into it. My elder brother has really been into the Tomb Raider series since then, but I obsessed over Metal Gear and Resident Evil throughout the years ( I was six when this game was released) Anyway, finally got around to giving it a play through, and it was good fun. Difficulty was just right and was refreshing since in this day in age games are geared toward the lowest common detonator (so it would seem anyway). Took a couple points off for weak plot line, wanting mechanics, and some parts were just out right silly (just had to play through areas until you knew what was coming, didn't have so much to do with skill as it did with patience). 8.5/10 would recommend. God Bless everyone and have a fantastic day.. My favorite entry in the series and one of the most memorable PC/ PSX game experiences. This game is pretty much to the basics before the series got convoluted with it's gameplay mechanics. This was later fixed in 2006's Tomb Raider Legend. However, the original is what truly shines with excellent level design and atmosphere. A great sense of adventure and exploration as well. The PSX has a slight edge over PC version for having a music score that adds to the immersion. Great game. Fewer flaws than TR2-6.. This game is the reason why im a fan of the series,you control a british arqueologist Lara Croft who travels around the globe searching antique **** gameplay is simple,kill anything that moves and use your abilities and speed to get out any sticky **** maybe real real old now,but its a classic and classic are to be remembered and live on forever.Here a legend was born.. I bought my first PlayStation after seeing an add for Tomb Raider on television. I remember how amazed i was seeing this open 3D world, the heroin running freely around it, jumping, diving, swimming, shooting... at that time I just knew I HAD to get a PlayStation! I'm sure I am not the only one who considers this the best game ever made. It's already been said by others: the graphics were cutting edge at the time, the music is simply amazing and warns the player for danger ahead or a secret place being discovered. It's amazing how much you can do with the controls, stepping side-ways, lining up a perfect jump and much more... Granted, the graphics are very outdated by now. But even with enhanced visuals the remake Tomb Raider Anniversary on PS3 can't bring back the same feeling of excitement I had when I first played this game. Tomb Raider deserves far more than a score of 10 out of 10!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If I could think of one Tomb Raider game that was one of my favorite, it would have to be the original. 16 years ago, the geniuses at PlayStation delivered a good fast-paced action-adventure that would make Resident Evil calls for backup. I mean, I fell in love with Lara Croft since the second E3 1996. And when Tomb Raider released in November 1996, the month before Thanksgiving, I played the game on my first PlayStation and how did they created the game into a multi-million dollar franchise? Tomb Raider was one of the best games I've ever played since buying it on the PS3 store. From comics, 2 movies starring the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and a worldwide audience to geeks everywhere, Lara can't be tamed until back in 2003, it was the end of an era as ""The Angel of Darkness"" dethroned her reign and killed her career. Back 3 years later, she revived and came back in ""Legend"" and it's still my personal favorite. And now, the new and improved ""Tomb Raider"" is no exception. I was stunned when I checked on the Tomb Raider blog and it was delayed until March 2013. That's why I hate it when new games are going to be delayed until the next couple of years. It's still an action-adventure game with an Survivor meets Cast Away twist as a 21-year-old Lara struggling for survival in a mysterious island and now she has the ultimate skills on how will she become to be before she was a gun-totting, turquise-wearing, adventurer who's large breasts and acrobatic skills skyrocketed her to entertainment ****. I can't wait for 2013, but for now I can still get a hold out of the looks and smiley face of Lara Croft whenever I see her.. When this game first came out it was so radical. Everyone fell in love with Lara, and loved the way you controlled her movements and interacted with the environment she was in. There were no online walk throughs then so you had to work things out for yourself or pop down to the shop for a game mag. When you go back to it, it's a little clunky and glitchy but well work a look back if you still have the working hardware :-). A classic and the first game in one of my favourite series. I don't think the atmosphere of this title was ever recreated in later Tomb Raiders even the great remake of it. There's a sense of emptiness and genuine fear when something attacks you that is taken away by the later games' abundance of bad guys and man eating animals. My only complaints are the clunky feeling controls and combat system. Besides that this is a true great.. I can safely say that the game doesn't rely on Lara to carry or sell the game, although there's no denying that she certainly gave it a boost whether it be in a positive or slightly negative light. A great mix of puzzle, platform and action-adventure surrounded by a revolutionary 3D environment and an iconic character, Tomb Raider has to be one of the top games of 1996.. Tomb Raider was my first video game, so I'm gonna make this fair: Graphics for time: 10 Gameplay: 10 Story: 9 Soundtrack: OVER 9000!!!! GET IT NOW!!!!!. this game is great the music is there when it needs it and it is all atmosphere but the controls are hard to get used to but its definitely worth a buy you will be pleased. Lets go back to 1996, video gaming was about to be introduced to the single most unexpected game, that would change the action/adventure genre forever. I say unexpected because of the protagonist, herself who would become one of the most recognized and idolized women of both the 20th and 21st century. Lara Croft. Upto then games relied heavily, but not solely on the use of male main characters to drive them forward. Lara came like a storm, destroying the norm, and cementing herself as someone to be reckoned with, even to this day. Tomb Raider was fresh, exciting and engaging, plus who could forget those triangle boobs. Men wanted her, women wanted to be her. The game, although sluggish and glitchy by todays standards, had great gameplay, a character you cared for, puzzles and a story that piqued the interest of people who didn't even play video games. A must play for people who haven't experienced Laras birth into our world.. Exploration, puzzles and some combat make this a good game, not the best in the series though... It is kinda easy in comparison to the others... but overalll it is REALLY worth playing it.. Tomb Raider 1 was a revolutionary game for it's time. It was one of the first 3D platformers ever along with games like Mario 64. While i will admit that this game has not aged well at all, I still really enjoy this game. It's graphics were amazing for there time. The music is still amazing. And the game is a good challenge. While this game has not aged well. The remake, Tomb Raider Anniversary is amazing. If you want to play the original play that version. I still really like this game though. Brilliant game from its release and especially now to really appreciate how far 3D gaming has come. I first played this when i was six years old and immediately loved it and to this day it still provides enjoyment and a challenge. Tomb Raider really blew the doors off the action adventure genre with its awesome combat, puzzles and exploration which makes it a must have for any true gamer.. Tomb Raider is a game that involves you actually using your own brain, unlike most modern game. It has well thought out level design and a badass main character. I love you Core ;___;. When you compare Tomb Raider to other games of its time, it's hard to not appreciate how well made it is. It's a timeless classic full to the brim with atmosphere, mystery, great music and fantastic (if now dated) visuals. I couldn't recommend it any harder.. EPIC (adventure) GAME! Technically almost perfect, Tomb Raider brings out a gameplay that has never seen: competitive, funny, hard, and various. You will need to get medkits to get some health, you will need to manage your weapons ammos and kill a lot of enemies. It features a great plot that will not make you bored. Great longevity, a thing that is really good, because a lot of games have the problem of being very short. Graphically, it's mind blowing: it has light effects and very good textures. The only (little) problem is the performance, which, sometimes, is a little bad: sometimes, the game reaches low FPS, but it's still playable. Graphics and performance: 8- (7.75); Longevity: 7- (6.75); Gameplay: 7 + ½ (7.5); Plot: 7; AVG. SCORE: 7+ (7.25); Piece of art of video games bonus score: +0.5. OVERALL SCORE: 8- (7.75 out of 10 [Perfect]).. The game is pure classic. Everything worked when Tomb Raider was simple. The controls aren't bombarded with moves, the environments fit the title of the game, no vehicles, no rocket launchers, or cat suits. This game is the blueprint of all the things that work in the series. Every sequel simply took a cosmetic approach with changes. This game explains itself. Its filled with a ton of memorable moments. For the best experience the PlayStation version offers a chilling soundtrack. This game is full of win.. Ahhh Tomb Raider, the memories : ) My sister brought this game home for me to play when I'd actually asked for something else and at first I was miffed, but now I can't thank her enough as it was one of the best games I've ever played. Ok so the graphics look ancient now but at the time they were cutting edge and the hours of enjoyment I got from this game seemed endless. I still have a copy of Tomb Raider to this day and it's still as precious to me now as it was then. Here's to Lara Croft and where it all began.. Back in 1996 there was the dawn of the Playstation, which brought a whole new world into gaming and Tomb Raider (an action/adventure) was a taste of that example. If you loved the Indiana Jones films and wanted a game that involved puzzles, challenges, action and adventure, then this game (unlike the terrible Indiana Jones games that were released during the 80s) is the one for you. The story starts off in New Mexico, where a huge explosion sets off causing an earthquake that exposes an ancient device. Inside this device appears to be a person who has been frozen in carbonate for many centuries. Present day in a Hotel, archaeologist Lara Croft receives a message about a legendary artefact called the Scion, from a wealthy businesswoman called Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. The Scion is split into three pieces and your task is to retrieve those remaining pieces, before the other minions do so. The gameplay has probably got the best I have seen in all my years of gaming. Imagine you're in a big circular room and you can run all over the place for miles, well this is exactly what Tomb Raider has got. Set in third person perspective, the game has you exploring through caves, coliseums, tombs and pyramids, as well as climbing up rocks, swimming so deep that it's like diving down the deep blue oceans and shimmying along open cracks into secret caves. Of course it wouldn't be extra sweet without any combat, oh no you don't think Lara Croft would go through deadly traps, wolves, velociraptors and lions etc without any guns do you. Using your dual pistols, you must shoot anything that comes after you basically and don't worry about aiming - just point the gun in the direction of a foe and fire until everything is dead. Other weapons are found as you progress through the game (my personal favourite are the Uzis). The music, composed brilliantly by Martin Iveson and Nathan McCree, adds an extra feel to this game to make it note perfect. Sometimes the music will give you clues, for example either you have found a hidden area or it will alert you of any dangers ahead. The graphics in this game are stunning, but some are a badly pixelated (which may confuse players, by not knowing which rocks/platforms you can and can't stand on). The camera angles are a pain, and its lack of save feature will probably have you continuously repeating yourself again, because of the difficulty of each level. However, because I loved this game so much and because it is a very old game, I will accept these errors and they aren't really a serious problem once you master it. This, to me is in my list of top 5 video games of all time. When I look back now, I never realised how successful this game would be. Who would have thought that just one game would turn it, and the character Lara Croft into a series and franchise of related media?","i respect this game as a piece of gaming history as a transition to 3d gaming environments and controls, but it has not aged well . graphics are very dated, even for PS1 standards, and the controls are obtuse ""tank controls"" and makes it difficult to use regardless of whether you're using analog or d-pad ."
224.Twisted Metal: Black,"As with the PSone titles, Twisted Metal Black offers some short term fun if played with friends but isn't something you'll still be coming back to month after month.. ""Twisted Metal: Black"" is arguably the best car combat game ever made. It's certainly the best in the series. A dark 'M' rated reboot, ""Black"" refined the mechanics of its predecessors to perfection. Featuring a horror-based story mode (which can be played in co-op) and local competitive multiplayer, it offers plenty of challenges and maps to master. Like ""Metal Gear Solid 2"" and ""Tony Hawk 3"", this sequel really pushed the capabilities of the console. It is a true classic. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. It's an awesome game that has a lot of neat characters to play through. Plenty challenging and will give you hours to beat through it all. The dark nature of the game clicked with me & has an interesting background!. A dark 'M'-rated reboot of the car combat franchise. Visually, it was a major improvement over the PS1 entries. The gameplay also was refined to perfection and the maps were much bigger and detailed than before. If you were a fan of the previous games, then this was a must have title. An early PlayStation 2 classic. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. I miss my childhood when I was afraid of the game menu music and the CRAZY 8 character's face hahahahah pure nostalgia. I also love playing Coop with someone. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was the best TM in the series, followed by TM2. Loved the faster pace and cars. this was ahead of its time IMO, one of the most fun multiplayer games I played as a kid, before online gaming was a thing.. Twisted Metal Black is far my favorite Playstation game of all time. The fast-paced high octane action is what makes this game better than all those that came before and after it. Many people claim the difficulty is too high, but they miss the fact that taking the time to learn the game's mechanics and oddities is extremely rewarding. It has a unique playing style that'll keep you on your seat the whole time. You have to constantly keep thinking about your movement and strategy. There is no room to catch your breath. You have to keep moving and moving and moving, or you're dead. Not only is Twisted Metal Black highly replayable, (I still often come back to it after 10 years!) but it offers catharsis through chaos and destruction. The skill ceiling is extremely high for a game of its time, and it shows. Each character is fun to play and rewarding to beat the game with, and the online multiplayer is well-balanced and loads of fun, with a few interesting changes to the experience. The stories are demented and disturbing, which makes it all the more satisfying when you help them win the tournament and obtain Calypso's wish. The levels are well-designed, and fun to drive around in while destroying the various objects and uncovering certain secrets. Twisted Metal Black is ridiculously fun and engaging, which is why it's my all-time favorite This game isn't without flaws however, the main one being that in the development process, it feels just a tad bit rushed, leading to a lot of missed opportunities and cut content, the most famous of which being the final boss Warhawk as a playable character. A few of the characters are lacking story cutscenes, and story mode in general is limited on stage choices, which make it feel repetitive at times. The quality-of-life improvements that later games in the series added are lacking here, and the local multiplayer was not handled too well. For example, not only is there no team deathmatch options, but there is also no way to disable friendly fire in co-op mode, which can often lead to you accidentally shooting your friend, even if you were aiming at someone else. Also, the secret levels that you unlock by finding the hidden black cubes in the levels are only playable in multiplayer mode, despite the fact that you can play with bots on these stages in Twisted Metal Black: Online. It makes no sense. Despite its wasted potential, Twisted Metal Black continues to deliver on blood-pumping carnage, epic music, and satisfying kills. It's a shame that the franchise is dead in the water as it is, as I would love to see it make an epic return someday. Hopefully, Sony will pick up this game and remake it for the PS5 or at the very least, provide a 1st-person arcade port. This game is available for the PS2, is backwards compatible with the PS3, and has its own downloadable 2013 port on the PS4. If you are at all a fan of early 2000s, combat, cars, combat cars, or Playstation in general, Twisted Metal Black is a must-play for all gamers that want to show the industry the true meaning of road rage. 10/10. Sincerely, Shiru Otakuno.. To me, this is the second best Twisted Metal. The only real criticism I have is it's almost always dark in some way. Lots of dark colors. But other than that, it's a great game. It has that good old Twisted Metal feel with a lot of stuff in it. Lots of characters to use, huge levels, etc. This is a great Twisted Metal game.. thank you for my good childhoodz beutiful sound , amazing characters , looks sweet, gameplay -IDEAL!!! if you like good games from ps2 and original story - you must buy it!!!. Brutal, dark, gritty, satisfying and addictive. I really can't think of a better way to summarize this game. I absolutely adore the gritty, industrial themes of Twisted Metal Black, along with the disturbing and dark back stories of each character gives this game a real hard edge in comparison to other titles of the same genre. It all works so perfectly with the tone and flawless, fast-paced car combat action. You really won't find a better car combat experience anywhere else. The only downside to this game is that it was only released on the Playstation 2!. No real plot, no real point, but a ton of fun. Normally I rarely indulge in such mindless games, but Twisted Metal Black was just non-stop fun. Graphics are great, sound & music are top notch and character design is original and twisted. Overall: A great game that reminded me greatly of the old arcade days where you just played to have fun, and blow stuff up!. Am I missing something? The battles are fun, but they'd do so much better if the weapons weren't even slightly more capable at destroying a vehicle than a wiffle ball bat. The characters are varied, the cutscenes are cool, but why such weak and terrible weaponry? This isn't the chaotic, over the top explosion fest everyone seems to describe it as, it's more akin to a very drawn out battle of endurance.. I love Twisted Metal. Its my favorite Playstation franchise. However, this Twisted Metal is overrated. Its not that the controls are bad, but the car physics are not quite as good as the ps1 Twisted Metals. Not only that but the areas within this game are bland and boring. There are some good points. The cinematic approach is interesting and it has some of the most memorable characters in the series to date but overall its far from being the best that the series has to offer. Theres are better Twisted Metal games, preferably the ps1 classics and the new Twisted Metal 2012.. Twisted Metal Black has easily been proven to be one of the best PS2 games. It's 2012, and playing most PS2 games is quite a bore. Especially a game that's 11 years old. Every year your standards rise but TM:B has remained just as fun today as it was 11 years ago. It's complex in the way that you want a shooting game complex. It's low on features but strong handed on gameplay, and it's stories and atmosphere are some of the best in gaming. It's a shooter that you have to invest some time into to be good. Twisted Metal Black is the most mature TM and easily the most difficult. The gameplay is fast and tight. You will constantly be shifting your eyes from your health bar to your ammo consumption to your map etc. If you put a good amount of time into this game you'll be good enough to take on the only mentionable flaw with this game. You'll notice whence driving around a battle that none of the enemies are really fighting each other, and you're right, they're not. The game is supposed to be a contest of 9 players pitted against each other in an attempt to come out on top, but really it's just you vs 8 other contestants. This is what makes the game so difficult. You can't help but to get frustrated or angry when you get hit by a sickle, a ghost missile and a SAT at the same time. This flaw is quite annoying, and no matter how good you do, it's still a flaw, but the better you are, the less you care. Another mention is that this game is pure old school. On top of the only mode being deathmatch, you will also be spending the majority of your time driving and getting weapon and turbo pick ups. This isn't as annoying as you'd think it would be because there is no way you could survive in a stand still battle anyway. To survive you need to master driving to keep from getting shot by all the other contestants. This game is not by any means pick up and play. There is no single story in this game. Every individual character has his or her own story. There are 15 contestants in total. All the stories, characters and vehicles are equally entertaining and there are no carbon copies. The variation is stronger than any other game I've ever played. There aren't even any fighting games I've played that match the amount of variation in character design. All of the contestants are connected in the contest through Calypso, whom breaks them out of a mental asylum and promises them all (whence they win) a wish of their desire. There is no limit on price, size or even reality. This game being the most mature TM also has a worse fate it seems for those whom have better morals. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the ""good"" contestants don't have it so good in the end. The graphics are just as good as the other areas of the game. Slick, well textured and extremely dark. It's like a Tim Burton movie for serial killers. There will also be a great amount of time put into this game, for beating the game with every character is a good incentive and will take quite a lot of time. In the end, Twisted Metal Black is a flawless piece of gaming. It's dark, it's difficult, it's engrossing and most of all it's a blast to play. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. Though for someone looking for a shooter that's more than just a shooter, I'd pick it up on the spot.. this is the best twisted metal next to twisted metal 2 and the new one for ps3 the game has an amazingly dark storyline with awesome characters while some characters arent that great most are awesome. this the most fluid twisted metal besides the one on ps3 the controls are responsive and the online while around was really fun if you want a classic ps2 game get this you wont regret it. One of my favorite games of all time.. Twisted Metal. I'm a huge RPG fan so this game is out of my genre but I just love the fact that it's fast paced and basically just a very addictive car combat game. No other companies can compete with Eat Sleep Play's Twisted Metal. The storyline in this game is very dark and awesome, the cars are very detailed and have cool specials and the level design is great. The only minor problem I found was that all of the level's are ""dark"" which is cool and everything but I'de like to see some very opposite type maps in there for more variety.. What made Twisted Metal Black memorable were the cinematic sequences from each playable character and the song ""Paint in Black"" played at the ending credits. Everything else in this game was slightly fun in some levels with highly frustrating controls by using the directional buttons as your vehicle's acceleration. The controls were very irritating in the gameplay that my fingers were literally hurting two hours later. It also does not help either when the gameplay's difficulty is extremely tough. Twisted Metal Black has a great presentation in visual and sound starring these pretty dark characters in a fun sudden death car match competition, but it is just those excruciating controls that loses the game's fun.. I was excited for this game having played and enjoyed 1-3. I was sorely disappointed as the computer is was too good and this you with everything. I played for an hour and couldn't beat the first level. Everyone moves way too fast you can't target them and the controls are over-sensitive leading you to never be able to follow someone. I ended up getting shot every 5 seconds from every side while never being able to get a bead on anyone. I have played and gotten far in all the other one but the new combat in this is terrible and a major bust. Stick with #2, the best of them all.. Its so fun- but its so damn hard. This game is immensely difficult. Maybe its the control scheme or maybe its just my inability to carry on against un-winnable boss fights. The levels are easy and even if you're not very good with the characters that apparently built their vehicles out of tissue paper, its still not impossible... but then you get to the first boss. Its of course around the second that you start to wonder why you can't seem to progress through the game very easily. These boss fights are ridiculous and unless its magically easier with 2 players instead of one- I'm still guessing they would be a bit frustrating. Also the control scheme is garbage if you're not used to it. In fact I blame a lot the inherent difficulty in just maneuvering you're vehicle on the control scheme. Its un-suited for a car combat game and I've been playing these since the original playstation. Yet, the music rocks, the characters are awesome, the cars are great, the weapons are great, the levels are varied, and it just does what it does so well. Its hart to hate what you love, but even Twisted Metal has its shortcomings. They just don't kill the games appeal though.","""Twisted Metal: Black"" is arguably the best car combat game ever made . like ""Metal Gear Solid 2"" and ""Tony Hawk 3"", this sequel really pushed the capabilities of the console . visually, it was a major improvement over the PS1 entries ."
225.Spyro: Year of the Dragon,"It's a Spyro game so it's going to be GREAT no matter how you slice it but the skateboarding segments were beyond frustrating and in the reignited trilogy, they were broken. Specifically the skateboarding race in lost fleet, the only way to fix the glitch you have to let yourself lose then try again, it was very frustrating. The time attacks were easier, but a little too easy, and the races were superfluous at best. I would say easily this is weakest of the 3. Is it worth playing? ABSOLUTELY, but be prepared it's frustrating. It is without the satisfying difficulty curve that came with the second game, and the charm is derivative of the first. But as I stated earlier it is still a spyro game so it is gong to be fun, just not as fun as spyro 1 or 2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Spyro may not be as great as I remember him being when I was little, but Year of the Dragon certainly helped rekindle my childhood past self, at least for a little bit. And while it really is just a collectathon with some laggy controls and sound, it's still the same kind of gameplay that made Spyro so enjoyable back in the day.. Best of the collect-a-thon games on the PlayStation, taking the best features of the previous games in the series to provide a great experience.. One of the best PlayStation games out there. It’s the best platform adventure in the system, and one of the greatest games ever made. An excellent game that wrapped up the excellent original trilogy of Spyro the Dragon. Soundtrack is especially fantastic.. Greatest Game of 2000. The game changes everything of platform including the Spyro franchise.. This game has been ingrained in all our memories from the childhood. It's such a nice story.. King of Spyro games. The longest one in the original series but never boring thanks to the awesome soundtrack.. this game no one knows here, i tried to play and it's crazy it's really good, fell in love right away. OVERALL - 90% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 9/10 As a child, all of my friends had this game and I always made excuses to visit theirs just to play this game. Great game for the time with a beautiful colour pallet, level and character design.. This is the worst part of Spyro. The level design is soooooo bad and frustrating. The high difficulty of challenges (I'm not talking to enemies specifically) don't even related to the plot. Why TF do I have to play hockey to win eggs? What's the point if the plot is very simple to follow? Why do I have to spent hours to fly through loops and races if it's not even related to the story? I understand that it's a mini game, but why is it so badly designed? In first two games it was fine, I have no complains, but this is the worst part. And the level design is genuinely very bad. There are some good constructed levels, but most of them are badly performed and repetitive. I was very disappointed in this part.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Third and final installment from the original Insomniac's trilogy for the ps1. Spyro is without doubts one of the best platformers on ps1 along with Crash. Spyro is set in more of a ""open"" world than Crash's corridor levels. World maps which are actually hub allows you to access its respective levels. Worlds and levels themselves might not be any enormous by today's standards, but they sure do feel full of collectibles, secrets and life! If you enjoy collectathons you are up for a treat with retrieving stolen dragon eggs and treasures throughout the game. Once again minigames made their comeback from previous entry and, besides a few irritating challenges, make you feel satisfied once you complete them and redeem your reward. Major addition to this title were sparx levels and more playable characters. Sparx levels were little forgettable and for me, personally, they were not that enjoyable along with its clunky controlls. Some characters from previous game are also back and one particular, love him or hate him, Moneybags is too. He is willing to set free captured playable characters, for a small fee of course. These characters, Sheila the kangaroo, sgt. Byrd and Bentley the yetti, are fun to play and provide more diverse gameplay with their own gimmicks. Evil Sorceress who ordered to steal dragon eggs is a main villain and boss battles against her ""minions"" are pretty enjoyable. Definitely playstation classic and must play!. So I have no idea why there is only the third one of the trilogy here, but its a tough one. Its the best and at the same time, the worst, the best because it has all the important additions from 2 and builds on top of that with stuff as crazy as other playable characters! So why its the worst? Because it lacks the polish 2 had and playing other characters, as fun as it might be always feels worse than playing Spyro. It feels like Insomniac was tired with the series, did not know what to with it or simply there wasn't enough time.. Best game of the original trilogy! Wonder, wonder and another wonder, but this third is the best one! Gem!. Spyro Year of the dragon is a terrific game, lots more levels to explore, a new cast of colorful characters, and extra variety of challenges and tasks to complete. However, as much as I adore this game, their is far to many vehicle sections. I can not stand the vehicles, the hunter challenges, and submarine vehicles ****. And not to **** but their are a lot more difficulty spikes thorough out the game. I would honestly prefer Spyro 2 than this. In conclusion this is still a fantastic game. 9.5/10. By far the best Spyro in the collection. I enjoyed the immersive levels and the intricate puzzles in order to find all the secrets. A must-buy!. ofcourse it's not as good as the legendary crash bandicoot but its still a superb platformer. Spyro: Year of the Dragon for the Ps1 is an inspiring and imaginative 3D platformer with beautifully open levels and worlds that are incredibly immersive despite the limitations of the console. I remember the first time I played this game, I got it for Christmas when I was young, and my older sister told me that it was one of her favourite games growing up. Together we played through it and I became instantly invested. Since then I have completed it countless times and still find myself reaching for my Ps1 controller to play it again despite the more modern and updated games I now own. Generally I would say this game was originally aimed for a younger audience, but I would also argue that it certainly does appeal to a wider audience of perhaps those who are captivated by its charm and nostalgia. Upon its initial release the game was widely praised by both children and adults and the Spyro the Dragon series still has a cult following to this day. I would recommend Spyro: Year of the Dragon to those who have played either of the previous titles (Spyro the dragon and Spyro 2: Ripto’s Rage) as I would say that it is the best of the three; Insomniac Games definitely took the key aspects of this game’s predecessors and further developed them to make a near perfect Spyro game. When it comes to story, this game does what it needs to make the player’s actions have purpose. Although if you’re looking for an in depth and emotionally meaningful storyline this title may not be for you. This games simplicity in both controls and storyline, while some may see it as a negative thing, makes it easy to pick up and play no matter your age or experience with video games. You press the d pad to move, circle to flame and x to jump, nothing could be easier. However, don’t always let Spyro’s seemingly consistent easy gameplay fool you. For this game also has minigames and challenges that can be nothing short of excruciatingly difficult at times even for more ‘hardcore’ gamers, though these are not always needed to be completed to finish the game unless you are one for a challenge. Furthermore, what Spyro lacks in intricate storyline, it also makes up for with its fun and original characters. Spyro 3 is the first Spyro game to have other playable characters than just Spyro, you can play as Shelia, Sgt. Bird, Bently, Agent 9 and Sparx, which I think greatly adds to the diversity of the game. As for immersion, this game certainly finds a way of looking past the restricted graphics it had to have due to the platform. Not only does it manage to include many intricate details despite this, it also makes worlds seem more open by rendering objects further away with less polygons than objects up close, rather than just covering distant objects with fog or not having them there at all. This idea was a revolutionary one in its time. Arguably one of the elements that adds the most to the games overall sense of immersion is its soundtrack. Composed by Stuart Copeland, this games soundtrack really captures the feel of each level and turns it into a catchy, playful tune. And as for casting, I think Tom Kenny does a great job voicing the cocky, confident character of Spyro. Overall, I would say that Spyro: Year of the dragon is not only the best game of its original Playstation trilogy, but is also quite possibly one of the most influential and interesting games of its time. It is definitely must play for any fans of the genre or even fans of video games in general; its beautifully immersive worlds and charming characters make it a fantastic fantasy for players of all ages.. Spyro 3 is one of my favourite 3D platformers of all time it's fun game play and awesome areas to explore just make for an amazing game, the soundtrack, boss battles and other gaming modes just make for a great time.. This isn't my favorite Spyro, but it's one of the best. The controls are pretty good, the story decent, the lines are funny, it's just an all around good game. I do like the 2nd one more than this one, but I still enjoy playing this game.. Rarely does a third game come along and become the best in the series, but that is exactly what ""Spyro: Year of the Dragon"" manages to do. And the funny thing is this: the game sold almost 3.75 million copies (according to VGChartz) despite being released 3 days before the PlayStation 2 was released in America. Imagine how much more it would have sold early in the PlayStation's lifespan. Regardless of sales numbers, ""Spyro: Year of the Dragon"" is a fantastic game that, to me, still stands as one of the PlayStation's best games. Featuring plenty of expansive environments, plenty of minigames, gorgeous visuals that still hold up to this day, the same lovable characters from previous games to go along with plenty of new characters, great voice acting and plenty of polish to the gameplay, ""Spyro: Year of the Dragon"" is one of the PlayStation's finest titles ever. If you missed out on this masterpiece, go ahead and give it a shot. After all, it is available on the PlayStation Network, so go ahead and pick it up. I guarantee you'll have a blast! Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". Games like Spyro: Year of the dragon are so rare these days. Just like Crash Bandicoot, this platformer was revolutionary. Game design was on top. Looking for the eggs was one of the best adventures I've ever had in my entire gamer's career! I wish developers would make a remake!. A little dated but still classic as of 2017. Hmm the camera does get the dated feeling over time but then again I just tried spyro with a PS4 controller lol (updated 21/06/2017) (I am reviewing Spyro Trilogy not Spyro 3. Spyro how it should be great characters, new stuff ,Skateboarding!!! and gems you can see and a nice gem counter.. The best Spyro game perhaps ever made. In the days of platformers and Mario-look alikes wanting a piece of the fame and glory pie, Spyro always had the best potential to capitalize on itself when it came to levels. The first Spyro was very ambitious and good, the second improved and was better, but Year of The Dragon is quite outstanding. The level design was always unique and special in virtually every place you went to. The Rhynocs and enemies were still comical in their actions, but they had a defined charm that made them a threat to the lands they invaded, unlike Ripto's rage where by convenience everything just so happen to go south when Spyro comes in. The extra little missions with Bentley, Sheila, Sgt, Agent and Sparxx are fun distractions that breaks a bit from Spyro's main running. While it is a collect-a-thon kind of game, I did love just going through levels just get eggs and gems. As a child, this was everything I loved and now as a much older adult with a more critical perspective on it it might have issues (like plot and some challenging areas along with a cumbersome camera system), but the core game always feels unique and crafted well.. Spyro 3 is in my opinion the best Spyro game ever made. It combines elements from the two previous games while adding in new playable characters so It doesn't get to repetitive to collect throughout the game. It brings back gems that you get from defeating normal enemies and the chests that you need to find a key to open, both these things were in Spyro 1 but not in the second game. Many say that the multiple playable characters and different gameplay styles makes the game worse, and I could've agreed on that if it were Sly 3 or Crash 3 that I was talking about. However, I feel like all the characters in Spyro 3 are actually fun to play as, because they fit the collect-a-thon gameplay of a Spyro game. The story is better than both the previous games combined IMO. I do think that Spyro 2 had a better villain, but that's something that I could look over. The bosses are better, the gameplay is better, the story, the level design and even the music is better (if you play the greatest hits version). All these things makes Spyro 3 an amazing game and the high point of the franchise. SCORE 9.2 / 10. Spyro 3... Well, I Have an Interesting story with these one... Before i can play the Real Copy of that wonderful game, i play 7 pirate copies of them... and... i hope than my review doesn't affect by that… The Story Starts when a mysterious sorcerer order to her minions to kidnap all dragon eggs, so Spyro and Hunter (From the previous Game) travels to the buried old dragon worlds to rescue them… The Control Mechanics it’s basically the same As Spyro 2 (Except for the Double Jump Trick)... In Addition, You can also play as a New Spyro Friends... each one with their unique movesets... The Level Design, in some cases are even more shorter than the First Spyro Game, but their challenges are even more fun, especially the skateboard ones... jeje, a Purple Dragon With a Skate Board... that's really fun and unbelievable... Spyro 3... Someone could tell than is the best of the series... but... i can't support that... Otherwise, Spyro 3, has a really Funny and Fantasy Platforming game, with many modes of game, but... it is really short if you try to compare to Spyro 2 (These one have less levels but some of them are really extensive and with a high challenge) Other not favorable point it's than the Skill Points Don't unlock anything... these one is not a bad point, but, i could be some beautiful extra, like the Spyro 2's Epilogue and CTR Scrapbook... You Can Find lot of fun With Spyro 3, Is not the best, but is really Fun, and a amazing idea to play with more characters than Spyro.... Spyro is a very child-friendly platformer game, but you can never get too old to play with it. Definitely worth a try if you like humorous characters and rpg-platformer crossovers.. 100% the best Spyro game of all time! Why the gameplay is awesome the graphics are great for it's time and the controls feel free and the platforming really does rival Crash. This game is perfect.. The best triology's Spyro games. It must have a 10 score, because it is the game of my childhood, thanks Insomiac to create the purple drangon's singular. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I must acknowledge that as this was the first game I ever played I am probably somewhat biased towards it. However, I truly believe that this is one of the finest examples of classic Playstation games, on par with crash bandicoot. It goes without saying that it does show it's age so many years after its release, but for its time it wasn't far from perfect.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Spyro:Year of the Dragon, succeeds in many places other platformers fail. It has excellent and fluid controls, allowing for smooth transitions between moves, as well as the single best swimming mechanic in any game. The game has excellently designed levels with more complex challenges, enemy movements, more colours, and many different stylistic themes including Beaches, Snowy Peaks, Haunted Tombs, Islands in the sky with giant crystals and magicians, A fireworks factory overrun by ninjas and many others. The amount of detail in the levels from the colours, to the Skies( nobody ever talks about the sky ), to the excellent variety of minigames ranging from Cat hockey to Skateboarding and everything in-between, Spyro's gameplay never disappoints. On top of this, there are an additional 5 characters to play as, including a James Bond parody on Sergeant Bird, to a monkey with ADHD and a Laser Gun, all of which control differently to each other with uniquely designed levels and minigames to utilize their unique abilities. Driving all these Fantastic gameplay and design elements home is an incredible soundtrack with upbeat and slightly fantastical melodies, mixed in with various other styles to give each level a distinct and atmospheric wonder that only Spyro can. It's charming, it's fun, it's unique, and it's excellent 10/10.. As a child I would complete this game over and over again without boredom, along with gateway to glimmer (other favourite). So for that, my rating is extremely accurate!. The best PlayStation 1 game I ever played. Colorful creative levels, memorable characters, outstanding graphics, tight controls and some of the most addicting gameplay you will ever experience. Holds up so well.. I picked up my cousin's PS1 a while back and played this for the first time. And I have to admit it was pretty fun, colorful and immersive. When you first look at it, it seems like a quirky kid's game but still ramps up the challenge and can be really addicting to adventure around and keep unlocking secrets and challenges. Sure, it doesn't look very good but we'll give it a break for its age.. Loved charging around as a little purple dragon. Sure the graphics are from 14 years ago, and the story is basic, but it's just light fun searching for eggs and completing tasks. Nothing complicated or hardcore.. While this game never quite lives up to the original classic from 1998, it still manages to stand on it's own as a fun 3D platformer. It features different gameplay styles, hidden treasures, and much larger worlds.. I cant decide if I like this one or the second game better. the reason I love this game so much is that it is so unique and original in all the right ways. I love how every realm feels completely different and original compared to any of the others and how I thouroughly enjoyed exploring each and every one of them. a few of them may of had challenges that were kind of frustrating but for the most part I loved them all. the bosses were fun although very easy offering only a slight challenge and characters like hunter and that scumbag money bags are very memorable and have a special place in my heart. nothing bad to say about this game besides I didn't really like the other playable characters in the game that much and felt they were a bit unnecessary and am sad to hear that not a lot of people have played any of the spyro games, excluding all the games after this one of course, I just try to pretend they never happened. this game may be a. The best Spyro game ever, and the last good Spyro game. Spyro and Crash Bandicoot used to be so cool and fun, while their modern games are soulless. Also in Skylanders or whatever, Spyro looks mentally and physically challenged.. The Spyro trilogy was my first set of games ever. I never got tired of playing these games. Spyro 3: Year of The Dragon was a awesome sequel to Spyro 2: Riptos Rage! So, practically, this game describes my childhood, along with many others. The game added many new features to keep it fun, but still not turn away from the other two original Spyro games. It is definitely worth your time and money to get this game! That is why I give this game a full 10/10.. One of the better games on the PS1 all 3 of the Spyro games are great and are still great to this day, if anyone has not played these they should get them from the store or anywhere they can, it is well worth the money. Bright, colorful, cartoony... this is a great fantasy world to explore. Responsive and solid gameplay with some new features. Spyro is still one of the best platformers along with crash on Playstation.. A game that amazed me as a kid and amazes me now. I have recently started playing it after about 10 years and it is bring back my passion for gaming!!. This is how my love for this tiny purple dragon originated when I was 6 years old when I first played this game. When I turned 9 I got 1 and 2 and took really good care of them 13 years later I still adore this version of Spyro, you can't find games like this anymore.. spyro year of the dragon is one of my favorite games for the ps1. the levels are all memorable, the musics great and the 5 playable characters none of which feel tacked on and the story is great. well its a not epic RPG story but a nice simple story that is easy to follow and perfect cut scene to game play ratio. meaning the they aren't too many cut scenes to bog the game down but enough to have a story that flows thru the game. lastly the graphics for its time the graphics where amazing, colorful worlds and nice to look at enemies and characters. to simply put spyro year of the dragon is a must buy for your gaming collection and hell buy the other 2 ps1 spyro games there pretty good to.. Year of the Dragon is yet another fine entry into the Spyro franchise, and unfortunately the last game worth any praise. While there's a few tedious side missions and a few small qualms here and there, Year of the Dragon stands among the best platforming titles ever made, along with the two games before it. Final Score 8.9/10. This is literally among the best games i have ever played. If you have a ps1/ps2/ps3/psp or ps vita, then you NEED to own this game. And spyro 2 and even spyro 1.. I shall never forget this game, it brings such great childhood memories, and still is a great game, Year of The Dragon showed something different then the other 2 spyro games before this, well you weren't able to play as different characters and a whole lot of fun mini games. I suggest you play this or any other spyro game that was for ps1, purchase it off of the Ps store today!. This game ****! CoD for life! Ok, now that I have your attention, BEST ADVENTURE GAME EVER MADE!!!! (CoD ****) Great graphics, fun gameplay, compelling story, need I go on?. Having just got this gem **** on the PSN. I have been missing out on a very good platformer. It has plenty of level diversity and a very good game. Playing this in 2013, it seems like a very good PS1 title. Clocked this 100%. Loved Gnasty's Loot as a bonus level. Off to play Spyro 2.. The platformer was certainly a popular genre back in the PSone days and this first Spyro title was amongst the better efforts.. What great level design. The higher difficulty and incredible (for its time) graphics, infectious exploratory gameplay, and colorful visuals make it one of the greatest games on the PS1.. The little dragon that could gets his second sequel, which, unlike Ripto's Rage, a game that completely changed the physics and feel of the series, doesn't really spice anything up much. Spyro controls the same this time around. The thing changed the most from the previous games is the focus on Spyro, as there are FIVE other playable characters. Sheila the Kangaroo, Sgt. Byrd the... Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, Agent 9 the Monkey, and even Sparx himself is playable. While it's a nice change of pace, the characters feel like padding, and their levels are the least memorable of them all. Though it used to be my favorite as a kid, I have now seen the light and discovered Ripto's Rage! recently to be vastly superior. While it gets rid of annoying elements from 2, like the ""soul essence"" in favor of gems, and the double jump glitch, it's obviously Insomniac exhausted all of their ideas into the second, and while this is a VERY solid game with memorable levels, cut-scenes and characters, it's not even close to the greatness that is Ripto's Rage!. Not as good as perfect Spyro 2: Gateway to Glimmer, but still a great sequel. I miss the cutscenes, when you enter the level or get out of level. Gameplay is still fun, even though it gets a little bit slower, when you are playing with other than Spyro. I also like music, story and levels. 10 out of 10.. This game is absolutely incredible. Spyro: Year of the Dragon has it all, especially when it was first released. Graphically, it maxes out the PS1. Musically, Stewart Copeland and additional producer Ryan Beveridge did a great job continuing with that Spyro-esque sound with the strummy chords and all that. Gameplay wise, it excels. There's six (technically 7) playable characters in the game, and they are each very unique. I'll say this: Spyro STILL has the best swimming mechanic and any game, and Spyro the Dragon is probably the best controller platformer in existence. The engine is perfect. The story wraps up the original series in an efficient way, I just wish there were more great Spyro games like the first three.. Spyro 3 it took everything good about the first two Spyros and perfectly put it into one great game with new added features. Amazing levels, smooth controls, great characters this is a game that you can't help but love. By far the best in the series you should really check it out. Superb platformer game, probably the best one on PSX along with Rayman 2: The Great Escape, Croc 2 and Crash Bandicoot games. Spyro can now gang up with 5 other animals/beasts (a monkey, a yeti, a kangaroo, a penguin and even Sparx!) to solve variety of masterfully designed levels and puzzles. The graphics were excellent for it's time, and the soundtrack, produced by Steve Copeland, is a timeless classic. It's a shame Insomniac have sold the rights to this title and focused on producing generic FPS games instead.. this game is fun because there's egg you collect and you get then get new dragon which is cool then you can win more and get more dragons this game is cool. wow what a great game from my youth! I remember playing this for months on end! such an immersive world created and a great soundtrack to boot! easily my favourite ever ps one game!. Goofy graphic style don't seem to date even in this year, seriously thats fantastic. The levels are always a fun adventure that can't be miss. Insomniacs classic series went in a bang that left a nice footprint that can't be removed. I'm glad I played this.. Ah, yes. The last great Spyro game, and by far the best of the Spyro games. This game has it's share of defining moments from the fun as all hell flying mini-game (hell all mini-games were good), to ramming and burning Moneybags in order to get all of your gems from the bastard, to every boss battle, especially the ending fight, which is still among my favorite bosses ever. It has flaws, sure, but they are almost unnoticeable due to the greatness of this game.. Year of the Dragon is arguably the best Spyro game to date. Pros: Fantastic graphics; rich, colorful visuals; charming characters; a surprising amount of depth in level design. Cons: The control and camera are often wonky.. Insomniac knew how to make Spyro a working game. The game has such a large amount of content and variety of gameplay that this Spyro game was Insomniac's way of going out with a bang. Sure, you have a strange camera to deal with and a glitch here and there, but this game is outstanding. It still entertains me to this day... 10 years after release. My PSone classic downloaded copy of this game has noticeble semi-common framerate drops. They do not kill the experience, but they are somewhat annoying.. The early Spyro series by Insonmiac Games is probably the best platformer series ever made. Speaking of which, ""Spyro: Year of the Dragon"" is the best Spyro game. Still keeping its originality, ""Year of the Dragon"" still changes in some sorts. ""Spyro: Ripto Rage"" can be too quiet at times but not for this installment. There is a lot of action in this installment. Unlike the previous Spyro games, this game's storyline progresses from time to time, rather than staying stiff in certain sections. We have both old characters back and new characters appearing, as well as more entertaining levels with side missions. This game is very fun, a classic platformer and worth a play.. The only PS1 game better than this one is Spyro: Ripto's Rage. That's all. I am putting more words like this one to meeeeeet the minimum requuuiiirement of 150 charrractttersssss.","year of the dragon is one of the best collect-a-thon games on the system . it's the best platform adventure in the system, and one of the greatest games ever made . it wraps up the excellent original trilogy of Spyro the dragon ."
226.Forza Horizon 3,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. simply the best of the series!A huge playground, cars you no longer know what to do with them and thrilling races!. AMAZING, the map its really nice, i LOVED IT, also, surfers paradise was a nice shot by turn 10, that place give me chills, the hot wheels expansion, sheesh way cooler than fh5, well, we still had a story mode, unfortunally, that was the way to the new forza gamemode style...(only focus on online) anyway, the last good forza. This is actually the best Horizon game. FH3 > FH > FH5 > FH2 > FH4. Crazy good soundtrack that I literally still listen to today. Best map we've gotten. I actually played through this one unlike 4 and 5. Surfers Paradise PARKING LOT Nothing has hit like this game in 2016-17. Its fun and addictive, in my opinion the game is way betterthan forza horizon 4 & 5.. This my **** !!. A great game. This game was absolutely crazy. It is the best Forza Horizon game to date. Exploring Australia was awesome and it is the definitive Forza experience in my opinion. Still love this game to this day.. This game is literally is the goat the racing,the cars,the music it's just **** best forza horizon game for me.. I still playing it since 2018, almost every week! Now, FH4, 40hours is too much and about the other I don't wanna see in my life, I don't care. It's a huge disappointment compared to prevoius Forza's. It's empty, shallow, no real progression and the soundtrack is far beyond horrendous. And I'm not even saying about the SJW marxist ideology in it, with pronouns. FH3 has a great soundtrack, achievments, a real progression, which means you're not millionaire in the first hours/days in the game, and the map cities and places match with each other, they feel connected!. genuinely a step up from fh2, ost is just amazing, i would recommend if you are just trying to have fun with racing games,. Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.. It is a very beautiful, fascinating, and amazing game. It even lasts till this day as my main game (tho I also have Fh4). Tho there are some things like too much loading time etc. But it was far better than its time and it's still decent nowadays. It gets kinda boring tho. If you are kind of a budget guy, get this game. It's kinda dead but still works out. I'ma give it a solid 8. I really liked it! Great game, great setting! I loved driving off-road and just driving in general, man. The game felt kinda short? I haven't completed everything, and likely never will. But it just felt like it was over way too soon. Especially those special races, they were my favorite part and I wish there were more.. Had hours of fun in this game playing with friends and just alone over the summer. The game looks good and feels good and will always be the best Forzia game in my eyes.. This game is a must play. The Map:This Beautiful map is set in Australia, There are land marks in the game like, Sufers Paradise, Byron bay, and more! The Cars:There are over 600 cars in the game. For example there are; Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bugattis, and,,,, WAY MORE! The DLCs: There are 2 DLCs in the game, The 1st one is a Hot wheels expansion with a hotwheels map and over 5 Drivable HotWheels Cars in the game. The 2nd one is a snowy expansion, the map in the expansion is A Snowy Mountain and you get over 5 Offroady cars for the snowy mountain so you don't slip off. Such a really good game, I played it for hours, I can't wait to play Forza 2 and 1. Forza Horizon 3 delivered a gameplay with more freedom than FH1 and FH2 in many aspects, such as blueprint, forzavista and open wild map.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. My favorite Arcade racing game. Use to spend whole days on this game racing with my friends. Australia is beautiful and the road layout of the map was perfect. Wish i could go back in time and relive this game in its prime. Horizon 3 was the first time Forza introduced drivatars which was a cool innovation. It was kinda cool racing with A! that had your friends username. I liked how you bulld up the festival stuff as a story thing. Set pieces for the showcase races was neat. A lot of cool improvements to there past games. I believe this was also the first time the series let you download/use peoples car designs too but a may be wrong about this one.. better than forza horizon 4, has a more structured goal, very good australia map. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 8 Story: 6 Total: 8.17. Great core game with excellent DLC. All Horizon games are the same, but this is one of the better ones in my opinion. You can literally drive in a straight line in so many places on the map, plow through everything in your path, and never effect your speed with only minor damage to the car. This game is straight up arcade racing and it does it well but adds nothing to the genre thats defining Its pretty sure, but this dated formula with HD graphics is no where near enough to get anything higher then a 6 at best. Best console racer? No. Great arcade racing for noobs who want to play a racing game that limits itself to cater to that audience, Perfect fit. Forza Horizon 3 is THE game I go to for a shot of nostalgia! I’ve spent 12 days in total playing this and I’m still not tired of it. I’ll never stop playing this game because of how timeless it is. Oh the soundtrack, my favourite radio station was Block Party and for good reason! Sure Shot, Rings, Part Of, X Gon’ Give It To Ya, Higher, That’s Love, Shine, It’s Tricky! You know what? Im going to go play it now! See ya in my next review.. Forza Horizon 3 is best introduction to world of ""automobile enthusiast"" people, is first step toward sim-racing. I believe, Forza gives maximum driving experience, that you can get, using gamepad! Man, it my most favorite racing game of all time! Thank you, Playground Games for dozens and hundreds celebrating hours of Horizon Festival!!!. Graphics 6/10 Playability 7/10 Entertainment 7/10 Overall 7/10 Good arcade racing. Graphics could be better.. Forza Horizon 3 is set in a great Australian location with a map fun of diversity. The car stuff is fun and the DLCs are awesome.. EN: Pure fun. Phenomenal graphics and lots of adrenaline. The races are great, as are the side missions. MP and social interaction are great. SRP: Čista zabava. Fenomenalna grafika i mnogo adrenalina. Trke su odlične, kao i sporedne misije. MP i socijalna interakcija su sjajni.. This game is gorgeous one of the best racing games ever made for Xbox One a Masterpiece. Way better than FH2, mostly because it’s actually an open world game this time. Graphics look way better, map has more diversity, more cars. Everything about this game is better than the last one.. i like this game getting the base game and all of it's dlc for 25$ worth it i would say. First game I got on Xbox One. The graphics and detail are amazing. The freedom is astounding. The best racing game before Forza Horizon 4. This game is amazing. Probably the best arcade racing game out there. Period. I've gotten hundreds of hours out of it with 100% completion. The huge selection of customizable cars along with the beautiful map make this game have incredible replay value.. I have put over 900 hours into fh3. It's the best car game on console. It beats fh4 by far! The online is perfect and even if your friends aren't online you can still tandem with randoms and bang doors. The roads are perfect and game play is perfect. The car list is great but I would like to see more square body falcons and xbs upgrade. The great continuation of the Forza series with an amazing open world Australia with a variety of polished terrain will delight every player. Hundreds of various car models. The atmosphere of the game is very visible. Good multiplayer fun. Must-Play. Looks INCREDIBLE, with awesome art direction and formidable technical prowes Studios have done an incredible job.. The good: You are the boss and director of Horizon Australia so the festival moves and grows according to your whims and particular ways of playing. You can customize your pilot, choosing from established models. There are more music stations like Hospital Records, Timeless FM (classical music), Groove Music (a streaming music service and your music library), in addition to the return of Horizon Pulse, Horizon Rocks. The multipliers for “Skill songs played by DJs from time to time are standardized. More than 700 different cars all with 360 degree view and cabin view (no premium cars) and integration to Forzavista. Street races away from the festival return. The game gives you the ability to “hire” four Drivatars to be your lineup of champions and earn joint credits by running at festivals for both yours and theirs. It has the Blizzard Mountain expansion pack with its own events in the snow and Thrill-topical (the Island of Hot Wheeles with life-size Hot Wheeles cars and many orange plastic track roads, speed launchers, jumps on fire rings and even An animatronic T-Rex, both expansions add many more hours of games, and the promotion of taking photos of cars is added to earn rewards. The bad: It doesn't have a strict order, so you might get lost playing in the danger zones, skidding, exploring the map, even street races outside the Horizon Festival, forgetting or leaving in the background the races and the festival itself and to advance in history. The Meh!: So much freedom makes it unpredictable and keeps you on the edge of the game as you go along. This time, the location of the bonus signs was well above the average for the other Forza Horizon games (they are strategically located, very difficult to locate). Many talk that Playground is a great developer and it is just that it is supported by Turn 10 and everything it has created for the Motorsport series.. Forza Horizon 3 is unique in its own way. The ranks of fervent arcade racing are thinning, it is also full of fun. This is a world where summer doesn't end. This is a game about the holiday of life-a festival of music and racing. Those who are familiar with the series will feel like at a home party: they will quickly get fed up, but they will still break into a childish smile. The game is beautiful in all aspects!. I didn´t like FH2 much, I have tried this one just for curiosity, however I was surprised, it is a really fun game, precious graphics and excellent gameplay. Welcome to Empire State of Forza Horizon! could any arcade race be better than this? NO WAY.... Frenetic incredible! Excellent game! I'm hooked to this game and can't stop playing it.. Many cars, big open world and funny races. for 100% completion, there are to many repetitive courses. Giving it a 10 because it is the best Horizon game. It has flaws, but think this was one of the best racing games at the time. Forza Horizon 4 feels like a watered down copy.. Forza is amazing, the third title is amazing, with te graphics, cars, and gameplay. Excelent open world racing game, the best of this generation, thanks microsoft. [ ] Perfect [x] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. Wow this is best racing game i have !! Great visuals and music. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Three words: This is Horizon The third game of this magnific serie is the best of all, its really fun with awesome cars, awesome musics, and realistic graphics. Its really worth buying, trust me, you'll never have an adventure like this one .... In short, it is an expensive game, which after several hours becomes repetitive and makes you stop wanting to play it. There are more accessible options that offer similar experiences. Car DLCs are abusive but those are everywhere. It is a game that approves, of course, but that is not the revelation of the decade. Personally, if I had known what it ended up being, I would have expected some black friday.. This is the best racing game series there is. Do yourself a favor and try it on Xb or PC, it doesnt matter. The game itself is incredible but when you add the hot wheels expansion, it just takes it to a whole other stratosphere. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is amazing and fun, hell, even the soundtrack is great. This is a must own ( PC or Xb). HIGHLY Recommended!. Beautiful gameplay. Fun racing. Not the most realistic in the physics department. But it's not supposed to be super physics real. It's a racing game. And it's super fun.. Driving through kangaroos and beautiful Australia is AMAZING. every match is challenging. varied car collections. great support from turn 10 and the experience is better when you listen to your favorite music by groove while you're driving. there is no negative point at all.. Spend around 80 hours in this game, finishing it in 100%, taking part in many multiplayer races and blueprints. This is the best racing game. Period. The only thing that is s***y is the music... every radio **** ass... they should have added a nu-metal, death metal, oldschool rap and rave radios instead of awful pop/rock/newschool rap music, which you can hear here. At least you can turn off radios and listen to your own music. Pickens approves!. Better than this game may be only FH4) Best racing game i've ever played. Lots of cars, tuning, sounds are awesome! Best compilation for men- fast cars, beautiful nature, nice music, drift places - all i need for best gaming experience. If there was booty women, i would give that game 11/10). the game is awesome the intro is really great. it is one of the best racing games i ever played. not to mention it is an open world game. my favorite thing about the game is the amount of vehicles on it. some the vehicles are some i haven't even herd of before including: W MOTORS Lykan hyper-sport Zenvo and the Lamborghini jalpa the reason i gave it such a good score is the graphics i believe that the graphics are off the charts and this my personal opinion i hope to see your review. Racing games have always been with me since my childhood but ive gotten more into first person shooters as time went on, this is one of these games that made me come back to the racing game genra, if you enjoy racing games or even just racing in gta, you will 100% enjoy this one will a extensive number of cars to choose from and the very deep customization that you can do on each of them.. This game is awesome. Keep in mind that the ""Horizon"" series are more like a ""Need for Speed"" and less ""realistic"" in physics and car's behavior. That been said, this is an awesome racing game with beautiful landscapes, very fun game modes, vast collection of cars and a lot of personalization. I wasn't very sure about Forza Horizon 3 because I just couldn't stand ""open world"" racing games anymore, I thought they were repetitive and boring at some point (I prefer games like Driveclub, Gran Turismo or F1) but the gameplay in this one makes it worth it.. just the best x-bone exclusive, no more and no less than it,. (just after sunset overdrive). Just AWESOME !! The music, the open world, the car, the sky, the challenges, the festival, the water, the sound effects, the multiplayer, the drift and the car are AWESOME !! If you like cars, Australia, Xbox One, racing games or Microsoft, buy this game NOW !!!!!!!. Beautiful game, amazing graphics, the amount of events and cars are pretty good and will keep you playing the game for a long time, the game mechanics could be improved a little more but still feels good while driving, there's no need of having to buy the DLC'S to enjoy the full game experience.. Anything about this game that had to do with any narrative stuff fell completely flat. The game-play however was excellent and tight. The multiplayer races were incredibly messy and not fun, but everything else was great.. Arguably the best racing game there is right now. Big, beautiful and just fun to play. I know that it's all preferences in this case, but for me Forza Motorsports can't even compare to its open world spinoff.. best racing game of the generation. actually no. best racing game of all time. and this coming from a sony fan. what a game!. Maybe using a brand-new hypercar isn’t your thing new en xbox forza horizon 3. . The wealth of things to do, and entertainment far exceeds the price xbox one x.. me has max positive and relax atmosphere, hundreds of cars, great sounds XBOX. The worst thing about Forza Horizon 3 is that it may have stolen me away from the 'Forza Motorsport' series for good.. A massively addicting and all-round highly fun play for any racing guru who wants to get out in an open world and have fun. The open world is colorful, large, and enjoyably explorable, and the Hot Wheels and Blizzard Mountain DLCs are excellent. If you ever plan on getting an Xbox ONE for the first time, make sure this is the first game you grab.. this game is amazing ever i playing and graphic is so beautiful.. combat is incredible in real time battle... With consumers’ attention spans reaching an all-time low, where they often act like goldfish moving from one trend to another in lightning fast succession, it’s hard for developers to keep a franchise going for more than a few entries. With the Forza franchise now on its 10th outing (Forza Motorsport 7), it’s easy to see why Forza Horizon 3 was on many players’ top lists for 2016, as it doesn’t struggle at all keeping the series alive. I can honestly say without a shred of doubt that this is one of the best looking games this console generation, and I played it on a standard Xbox One without the 4K enhancements. I found myself stumbling to turn on the windshield wipers or grab for sunglasses regularly due to the impressive visuals from the background and weather effects, often forgetting I was playing a video game. From the detailed car interiors, the reflections bouncing off of the body of the cars, and the highly detailed beading effects from the water, this is the standard future games will seek to achieve and likely never accomplish. This is nothing short of car porn, sure to evoke a strange feeling in any car aficionado’s pants. If you’re new to the Forza Horizon series, it’s much like the standard Forza Motorsports titles, but feels a bit more arcade centric. While you can still tune your rides visually or mechanically as much or as little as you see fit, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of cars to make this enjoyable. The previous entries have made the player a willing participant in the Horizon festival, but this outing has you running the show. That said, there’s a huge wealth of customization options for how and when you race. Almost every event can be completed with any car, against any types of cars, with as many laps as you want. You can even save preferred settings for future races or share them with friends. The only exception to this is the Bucket List challenges, which task you with completing various objectives using specific vehicles, such as hitting speed checkpoints, racking up points in drifting challenges or simply racing point A to point B. Adding the option to create championships, as well as hitting all of the speed checkpoints, jumps, and XP boosting signs hidden throughout the vast Australian setting, there really is a lot to do here. Did I mention you can complete almost anything in co-op? Because you can, in addition to all of the online options available to you. There are a number of difficulty options and modifiers that can be toggled between races to ensure that you are always being challenged, with regular reminders or offers to change the settings in the event the game gets too easy or difficult for you. These make the title super accessible, especially for those of us who like to keep our foot on the accelerator nonstop. Despite each car controlling differently, the settings will help keep a mild standard between them, as some vehicles are more apt to spin out than others. The game does not belittle or penalize the player for using these outside of reducing the amount of credits and XP received for each action completed. These are needed to unlock additional perks, which provide various benefits to the player, as well as for purchasing new cars or fast traveling around the island. The island is massive, with a number of regions that give the player a wide variety of locales to race through, including beaches, jungles, and cityscapes. Progressing through the festival will unlock the option to select new areas to race through, which can be completed in any order the player chooses. Freedom like this is unheard of in most games, especially of the racing variety. Normally you would be forced to battle it out in some of the less exciting cars to get your feet wet, but here you can jump into a number of high end super cars right off of the rip. My one and only complaint is the inability to skip the voice over laden tutorials that never seem to stop. Yes, they do provide added insight into what you need to focus on in the game, but they are unnecessary and being unable to skip them is inexcusable. The same information could be conveyed in a short on screen display. While the loading times are not overly long, I found these to be tiresome and they limited the amount of time I could play in one sitting. If you’re in the need for speed or simply want to run around in the mud exploring the landscape, Forza Horizon 3 won’t disappoint. With its amazing visuals and wealth of content, the title will keep you busy for hours upon hours.. Firstly I would just like to state that Forza Horizon 3 is in my top two racing games of all time. I dont get into racing games I play mostly first person shoots, third person shooters, character action games, and RPG's. Over my 28 years I have been convinced by many ad's for racing games and almost none of them held my attention for more than say 8 hours of play time. Could not get into Forza motorsport 6, Project Cars, Project Gotham Racing, Need for Speed most wanted (the newer one), ect ect. I did enjoy The class burnout games, NFS Underground series, Midnight Club, again ect ect. I cant decied if this is IMO the best racing game I have ever played or if its burnout paradise. So why did I then give it 4 you ask? Performance. 30 frames per second is never fun. Never feels smooth makes the controls feel sluggish. If your think of buying this game buy it for the PC platform. I would easily give the PC version a 9 out of 10. The PC version is a butter smooth 60FPS with far better graphics than the console version. Its worth every penny and every second of your time. But only if you are thinking of getting the best version possible thats on PC.. If this was my 1st horizon i would have put 10, but being the 3rd I'm disapointed by the lack of ambition: the map, is great but it becomes so boring after racing hours (it's more or less 4 environments in a pochet size map)... No updates on sound except to make turbo so loud they hide the engine noise!! (ricer mode ON, certainly not car lover!). The career is pointless. The Sandbox do what you want is just a pale excuse to cut the costs on not even a simple reason to keep playing besides racing or exploring (the last one becoming quickly uninteresting due to the map size) The ""be the Horizon Boss"" is a joke as you do almost exactly the same as before, the difference being that it's not the boss that suggest what you can do but your subordinate... what a great boss we are!! And the economic system getting more and more in the way... no more direct reward, you don't make enough money by racing itself but by getting point that give you access to loot (sorry wheelspin), just to acclimate us more and more to the trash loot system like FM7 is showing us today and that FH4 and FM8 will keep on pushing to a next level later.... Best forza ever more new to the history, radio statios are realy funny and we have the option to play in simulation. This games deserves a 95 Can't wait for horzion 4. Forza Horizon 3 is one of the best open world racing game of all time. Beautiful graphic, decent number of cars, great game play, massive events, dynamic weather all in one package. Horizon series is flexing its muscles, and becoming stronger and stronger. I would recommend this to every serious and casual gamers.. Forza Horizon 3 Roaring through the Australian outback in a thousand-horsepower Lamborghini at neck-braking speeds simply shows what type of game Horizon 3 is. It’s not a normal racing game – such as Forza’s Motorsport series, or Gran Turismo – it’s one that gives you an open road, and no limits. This is what Forza Horizon is. Maybe using a brand-new hypercar isn’t your thing – maybe you prefer a classic American muscle, or even Japanese tuners. Whatever your favourite car choice may be, Horizon has most likely got you covered. With over 350 cars from all corners of the world, there is an endless variety of cars to experience within the game. The amount of tuning and customization within the game means that you can turn something as slow as a Volvo 850 R into an extremely powerful beast capable of beating the fastest cars in the world. In recent years, the Need for Speed series has been improving the customisation side of their game to a high level, and for visual upgrades Need for Speed has a bigger variety, however for the performance upgrades Forza has far more possibilities and options. The standard for map design in the Forza Horizon series was already high, with Forza Horizon 2 being set in a beautiful location in Southern Europe alongside the Mediterranean. However, Horizon 3’s world completely eclipses it. Forza Horizon 3 is set in Australia, and the amount of different environments – such as Byron Bay, the Outback and the rainforests – is amazing. Furthermore, the attention to detail across the whole map is extraordinary, as even little things such as road markings, signs and even garbage bins outside houses are made with extreme care and precision. Whilst the map in Forza Horizon 3 is nothing in size in comparison to The Crew, the amount of changing landscapes and different environments makes it just as good, if not better. Helping the world look incredible is the new authentic lighting featured in Forza Horizon 3. The dramatic, ever-changing weather is simply some of the most realistic weather in any game. The reason the lighting is so impressive is because Playground Games, the developers, sent six staff members to New South Wales in Australia, armed with a 12K camera to simply record the sky. The variety of weather is realistic to what happens in Australia, adding to the authenticity of the game. In the last two Horizon games, your character was simply just an entrant in the Horizon festival, with strict guidelines on the events you had to do in a certain order. However, this time, your character is in charge of the festival. Any single event has no restrictions – you can choose the class of car, the type of car, the weather, the time, the amount of laps and more. Not only that, but as host of the festival you have a larger choice of activities to complete in the game. The incredible graphics come at a price, however: the game only runs at 30 frames per second on the Xbox One, remaining locked as always. Inconsistently, the game can drop to lower frames per second, but this is usually only during unimportant cut scenes in the game. However, because this new Forza is released on PC, it is possible to play at a higher frame rate, but you will need a powerful system. The recommended specs for playing at 60 frames per seconds is a NVIDIA GTX 1060 combined with an i7 3820 is what is needed. Sometimes the PC version can experience frame drops, and rarely the game can crash, however it does not happen often. There are also two expansion packs in the game – Blizzard Mountain, which takes players to snowy, torrential conditions and the ‘Hotwheels’ expansion. This expansion adds ‘Hotwheels’ ramps, stunts and cars that many people played with as children to the game, adding a high-octane dream containing life-size toys completing loops and half-pipes type of fun to the game. Taking a Pagani Zonda R on miles of stunts, banking on many iconic orange tracks from Hotwheels is delightful. It differs completely from Forza’s realism, adding a completely different automotive experience to the game. The fact that you do not get penalised for bad driving shows that Forza is striking a clear balance between an in-depth simulation and a fun casual game, and they are doing that very well. Sure, you can get rewarded for ‘clean driving’ if you do not hit anything for a while, but if you decide to completely smash through every fence in your way? ‘Great wreckage.’ Letting players get experience to rank up by driving how they want to show they believe there is no ‘real’ way to play the game, so you can play it exactly how you want to. Forza Horizon 3 is, in my opinion, the best ever racing game to be released. It has a great mix between realism and arcade, with a simply fantastic car selection, and so far it has not been boring once. This game is simply miles ahead of the current competition.. I play this game for a very long time now and I am just lvl 386, but its a lot of fun to play I never get bored and Forza is right now making the best games ever realistic and fun u can make a lot of credits in a short time and make u'r own design for u car(s). beautiful graphics, full of content, gameplay is entertaining. You can customize paints, upgrade and tune cars. Even after completing the game I still find myself playing it, because you can challenge friends by setting rival blueprints or jump in online races and so much more. If it wasn't for the pesky ai drivatars that tends to hold me up in and out of corners I would have easily given it a 10 out of 10 stars.. In the face of the undisputed beauty, it is really fantastic to accelerate a Lamborghini on the beach, to run through the forests and to do rallies in the desert, is something that impacts and impresses, in this the freedom to run aimlessly enjoying the scenery, is to take off the hat. Forza Horizon 3 stands out, firing as the best racing game of this generation.. Forza Horizon 3 is the first in this series of Horizon games that I have loved. Excellent car variety, very large open world, nice course variety, and very pretty visuals. Music has a wide variety, but nothing that really broke new ground. Car clubs have limited use and were not very well fleshed out. Online is fun with some interesting game modes. Ultimatly, this game is about the cars and the environment and it is excellent in both of those respects. Not a perfect game, but a great one that I have sunk many many hours into. Great pick up for a fun experience, but do not expect simulator level driving.. Great graphics, detail and sound. One of, if","this is the best forza horizon game to date . it's empty, shallow, no real progression and the soundtrack is beyond horrendous . i still play this game to this day ."
227.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Master Quest,"A good challenge for Ocarina of Time fans, although the puzzles in the original were better.. As always being a masterpiece now it has a more difficult and exciting version. Ocarina of Time was already a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest games of all time, and Master Quest makes this game for the ages even better. At first it starts like the regular Ocarina of Time, but as soon as you enter the first dungeon in the Great Deku Tree, you realize right away that this is going to be a much tougher challenge than the regular Ocarina of Time. Only the dungeon layouts have changed in Master Quest as everything else the including the same masterpiece story remains the same as the original Ocarina of Time.. The best game in human history. 1st place in the world's best game.. 1st place in the history of eternal immortality Metascore. The game that made you realize that the only natural enemy that can surpass The Legend of Zelda is The Legend of Zelda. The only game in the history of mankind that surpasses 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.. Albeit it is not my favourite Zelda game (Liked WW and TP more,), this is still one of my favourite games of all time for sure. Master Quest could also be a fun adition for some but I honestly never given it a try.. It is a nice way to play tloz ocarina of time if you don´t have a n64, it also comes with the master quest mode, witch makes the ame even harder and challenging.. An amazing game with better graphics pal runs at 60hz which original didnt and master quest is amazing. The definitive way to play ocarina of time and master quest is a great new addition to an amazing game. My personal rating for "" The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Master Quest "" (GC): 8,3/10 - Great Gameplay: 9 Video: 7 Audio: 9 Scope: 9 Balance: 7 Story: 7. One of the best action games of all time and the first 3D Zelda game. Although the graphics are outdated they don't take away the fun and experience you get. Playing with the Gamecube controller is much more convenient than the N64.. Look i love this game that i put in over 300 hours from N64 version alone. its a masterpiece, it still holds up to this date, and set up so many staples that future zelda games must **** its overyhyped. its a great game but it's really not the best game ever. don't get me wrong this game has some of the best gameplay, puzzle, and exploration designs out there but its been outdone by so many other zelda games, i recommend this game but a better zelda game to play would be majoras mask.. This game is a great port of the Nintendo 64 classic and the Master Quest is an amazing plus! This game doesn't get a 10/10 for some reasons. This game is perfect!. This game is great but not as good as everyone says it is probably due to the fact that I never grew up with this game and I started playing it in my teens. The game is really fun and the controls are solid and the graphics are pretty good for the time, but the game does not make me feel as excited as wind waker made me feel. The game is really good but not perfect, if I played this game before any other 3d zelda games I would of probably gave this game a perfect rating as it would of felt new to me and not the familiar feeling I got while playing through it after I played every other 3d zelda game. 9.5/10 (metacritic will only let me give it a 9). Though Master quest really didn't change all that much from the original, what did change was often made the game more challenging and entertaining. The biggest thing for this game though is the fact that it's on the gamecube. I really never liked the shape and feel like the n64 controller and also traded in the system and all my games for it (horrible idea!) quite a few years back so being able to pop it in and play it so many years later is really refreshing. I would give this a 10, but even this game isn't perfect.",master quest is a great new addition to an amazing game . the dungeon layouts have changed in Master Quest . the game that made me realize that the only natural enemy that can surpass 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time .
229.Kentucky Route Zero - Act III,"Didn't grab me at all, the whole thing is just a bit meandering and lacking direction.. yeah, pretty epic. definitely worth playing if you like interesting stories and things that mess with your head.Very few things that are better in mind, though i did like the other acts better in some ways. excited for the final two acts.. Kentucky Route Zero is currently the best thing happening in the world of gaming. Seriously, no game on the market can match the way these individual episodes control tone, theme, and atmosphere. I'd say I can't wait for the next act, but my impatience is not a virtue when it comes to this game.. Although I miss more... ""game"" elements (like in the other acts) I LOVE the mood of this game. Great story, great characters... totally worth playing it.. An amazing game that had me blown away with the visuals, music, and storytelling. This act had me extremely impressed in particular, but I won't spoil anything. Yes, it is a slower game. There are (hardly) no puzzles, no collectables, no unlockables, no abilities. It's just you, your delivery, and a strange address you just can't seem to find. I'm not normally into point and click adventure games, but the art style and story of this game drew me in, so even if adventure games aren't your style, give the trailer a watch and decide if it interests you at all. It sure did me. Even though it's incomplete (with two more acts to go), it's worth picking up.. i didnt love kvests but if loved kvestes thet was my fevered game. but my frinds kvestes lovers they sayd thet no rely good game thet whay i give it 6. Enjoyed all the acts. I think the game is pretty amazing. You just have to take your time in playing the **** a good adventure game that's worth playing. I wont spoil the game but i will say what kinda game is this so that players can find them self if they like this type of game or not. First of all its a point & click Adventure game a very story driven game with choices. About Game itself well Kentucky Route Zero is a game that made me realize Games can reach or even surpass Movies in Emotion levels a big step taken by Cardboard Computer which is amazing and this game wants to make a point with every decision so it depends on your experience of life to react with words you choose if it fits(to think or remember) or not(not realizing or understanding). Act III is probably the best one, pretty much explores friendship, debt, musical to goal and keeps its unique atmosphere. this game made me realize how Much a game can be beautiful.. Skillfully written game with meaning, depth, and an array of subtext to pull from the story. The visuals are beautifully and enchanting, with a unique take on the Magical Realism genre. The OST is wonderful as well.. Good game, but I don't understand the 91 that it have in the ""critic reviews"" section... But, I am agree with a lot of peoples that says Kentucky Route Zero has a great story and interesting characters. Good game, but not as best as that 91 score says.. The third act of Kentucky Route Zero is on the continuing path of each act improving upon the other this fantastically surreal and poetic story continues to amaze my favourite moment in this act would have to be the musical piece ""to late to love you"". I'm not sure why the reviews are so high for this game. I've been playing video games since ""pong"" and this is probably the most boring game i have ever played.. Kentucky Route Zero already contains some of the most surprising and fascinating things to happen in adventure gaming for quite some time, only three of its five acts in. Act III builds on the foundations of the first two acts, adding new characters to your party, filling in more of Conway's story, and featuring a starling musical sequence. Cardboard Computer have justified its price tag with this act alone; when all five are released, this will be an essential purchase.. Decent game, need voice acting and reading should be made more exciting instead of blocks after blocks of text. Story is interesting and graphic unique, which is the redeeming features for it. As how this game gets a 9 from critics is beyond me.. Longest and the best Act so far. The addition of new characters creates better dialogue options than before (Ezra!) ,the story is evolving to be quite a surreal one, what with all the places and characters you'll be seeing all throughout 15ish scenes.. It is very noticeable that Cardboard Computer put a lot of effort into the third act. I think it has like 13 scenes or something which makes it significantly longer than Act II which only has like 5. It is my favorite act so far and includes some back story and introduces new phenomenal and original characters. It is full of mysterious and magical moments like I've never seen in a video game before. The story deliberately leaves me with unanswered questions and I have no idea where it's going to take me. My only problem with Act III is that scene 10 was too long and I wasn't really sure what I was doing.","""kvestes"" is a point & click adventure game that's worth playing . it's a slow game with no puzzles, collectables, unlockables, abilities . i'm not normally into point and click adventure games but the art style and story of this game drew me in ."
23.Tekken 3,"Tekken 3 - The best PS1 3D fighter This game introduced me to fighting games along with MVC1, the game has pretty good content having your standard arcade, versus, survival, team battle, arcade endings , Tekken force mode and even a music player. Pros: - Good fighting system - Good amount of content and characters - Amazing music - Good graphics for PS1 - Near perfect Cons: - AI can be bad I guess Honestly it's a perfect fighter, little to no flaws. A great introduction to fighting games for all ages.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not sure there’s a better fighting game; everything about it is perfect! If you haven’t played, DO IT NOW!!. It was one of the best fighting games of its time. It's not that good nowadays, but you can still have a very enjoyable time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simple and Entertaining Gameplay, Great and unique Roster of Fighers, You Can Play Beach Ball, What More Can Anyone Ask.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best ps1 fighter game.. All time favorite fighting game, so many characters and the controls were perfect wish they could another gem like this. The first fighting game i really liked. I **** at these kind of game even more than i **** now, and still had tons of fun with my friends. Good old times.. Unless Tekken 8 finds a way to dethrone it, this will remain the best in this franchise.. Tekken 3 is a fighting game, the third entry in the Tekken series. It was released to the arcades in 1997, before being ported to the PlayStation in 1998.. tekken 3 is best fighting game for ps1,i play this game almost all day,this game of course i give 10/10. The improvements over Tekken 2 are more spit and polish than real innovations which made it feel more like Tekken 2.5 at the time and therefore quite disappointing. In retrospect the improvements may be small, but they are definitely there making the third instalment the best fighter on the PS1.. This is The Best Tekken Game Ever, I played this game for very long time ago!. The king of iron fist, THAT'S WHY IT'S THE GOAT, THE GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAATTT!. I had this on day one was so much of a Tekken fan back then but I've since walked away from this franchise since 4 onwards I've gone from Tekken has a real world feel to it to wtf is this horrible looking air juggle combos I went off this shert franchise the moment the BS air combos started to show up in the franchise in 2023 it be since t3 I've walked away I hate what this franchise has changed into the air juggles looks out of place and abnormal this why I walked away. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good Fight game, one of the most popular. Hours in versus mode, tons of unlockables!. The best of the best... Love jin kazama n everything else about this game.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game still has great gameplay! Every day before going to school I would turn on the computer just to play 20 minutes of this game on the emulator. One of the best fighting games of all time. You can feel the character, the dynamics and balance are great. The music rocks and works for the atmosphere. The graphics are outdated, but the gameplay makes up for it.. Must Play definitely!!! Best game of all time, i have played in the past and i continue today.. Tekken 3 is the best fighting game I've ever played. I'm sure some people prefer Mortal Kombat or Injustice games but for me this one will always be the best.. It was the game, That made me a Gamer. One of the greatest fighters of all time. 1 and 2 had the basic formula down but 3 is where it all came together bringing a faster more complete game to end of the PS1 era.. Tekken 3 is possibly the greatest 3D fighting game to ever exist on the Sony PlayStation.. I remember how i want to copy the movements from eddie gordo and hwarang when im 19 years old, was funny.. The ultimate fighting game , it was and still remain the greatest fighting game ever released .. After all these years this is the greatest Fighting game ever. The characters are well balanced and fun to play.. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 9/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 10/10 While my friends were playing Street Fighter and Mortal Combat, I was playing this. I love the variety of styles between the characters while still feeling perfectly balanced. Only downside to this game was inspiring me to punch my sister until I KO'd her.. I've spent countless hours into this extraordinary fighting game. Heihachi for the win!. One of the best fighting games ever made, was amazing when was launched and still very fun today.. I never owned this game until very late. I always played at my cousin's house. It's one of those games that at the time, seemed too good to be true to me. I couldn't believe how good it looked and played. Amazing OST and awesome characters.. Tekken 3 is actually the best fighting game ever. I love it. The gameplay, the characters and the soundtracks, wow they are immortal.. My favourite Fighting game when I was a kid and still a great game today. But still, screw Gun irritating little dino.. It gets no better than this! There is no better Tekken game to be found, any platform considered. This game has it all, favorite characters that appeared throughout the series, unlockable characters that pushed you to play even more, variety of modes such as beat 'em up ""minigame"" called Tekken Force that also added Dr. Boskonovitch to the roster and Tekken Ball. Music, stages, everything is just perfect in this game!. Legendary and revolutionary fighter. Yeah, I know that there were Tekken 1 and 2 before, but Tekken 3 was something else. The graphics, the music, the characters, the movesets, the game modes, the movies. It pushed PS1 to it's limits. I dare to say that there is no better Tekken game to this day.. Best fighting game back in the days. Even better with friends. KING 4 THE WIN.. ""Tekken 3"" is arguably the best fighting game on the original PlayStation. At the time of release, it impressed everyone with superb graphics, fluid animation and smooth controls. The diverse selection of fighters were easy to control, yet hard to master. Highly enjoyable, this second sequel was the peak of the series. I'd rate it with a 9.3 out of 10.. One of my favorite games in my whole life, just Tekken 3. Released in 1998, this is a game ahead of its time and still fun to play even today, aged very well. Prompt commands, awesome characters and nostalgic feel to it, overall one of the best fighting games of all time.. I liked this game because of combos and story very cool my favorite game when i was 7 years old. The best 3D fighting game ever made up their with Soulcalibur II Namco knows how to make them.. Tekken 3 was the best fighting game for me in early 2000s it's the best in 2020(even after playing tekken 7) Non over the top clutter on the screen, no 9000 same characters, no hulk looking male characters and no loli looking female characters, visible hp bar Best music in tekken series as well for me it's perfect game. I remember walking into theaters and playing this on the arcade machine ah such a quality fighting game has never existed before. This will be short and sweet. Story 9.5/10 Game-play 10/10 Timelessness 10/10. I can not stress on how amazing this game is. For a PS1 game, this was easily in the Top 5 games of all time back then. Tekken 3 still remains the best in the franchise next to Tekken 5. For some odd reason, Namco decided to go multiplatform outside of the PlayStation brand. Ever since that, Tekken hasn't been very good. Hopefully they will return back home where they belong.. Tekken 3 that's the first fighter I played. I completed it by 100%. The game has completlemy consumed me and this tells about a quality.. I put so many hours into this game in 98. Memorizing moves competing against friends, discussing which characters were the best. Awesome game!. best ps1 game ever, there is no better fighting game out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. d bst tekken maybe some xaracters dont hav mux xarisma but 4 1998 s kinda clean. Tekken 3 was a amazing game . in that time every one playing this instead of mortal kombat .. The game that REVOLUTIONIZED the fighting game genre when the Street Fighter series was starting to decline. 1998, one of the best years in video game history period. So many childhood memories from this game growing up. Tekken 3 is superb. The graphics were a huge improvement over the polygon, block look of the previous games. They would become much smoother, stylized, crisp and realistic as the series would continue on. The music is perfect. I love the arcade version soundtrack. The console version soundtrack is amazing but nowhere near iconic as the arcade version. The sound effects are and still so badass like the battle cries, punches, kicks and deathcries. The new characters to the game and series were pretty cool. I loved the stage design. The gameplay was more refined in terms of juggling, combos and damage balancing. It introduced the evade/sidestep, the left/right side body throws and ukemi mechanics. It also gave us Tekken Force and Tekken Ball mode. The only flaw the game had was the poor bonus characters (Dr Boskonvitch and Gon) with their awful movesets and the lackluster mini game modes. This game is still being bought to this day. It has sold 9 million copies because it's so fun and addictive and it broke the mold for fighting games to come. 9 out of 10. A must own.. The best part in the series of Tekken games is part of my very first part of this series and this game is simply gorgeous and everyone has to play it and understand me and my feedback to this game. The best of the best when it comes to Tekken. One of the best fighters around and not just on the PS1. This is a must play game for anyone that owns the system.. One of the best games out there to collect for fans of the Tekken franchise and people who just want to get in some good fighting. The game, in terms of story, starts off after the events of Tekken 2 nineteen years later where Heihachi Mishima had reassumed control of the Mishima Zaibatsu and forms a organization to protect the Mishima Zaibatsu known as the Tekken Force. A team from this organization is sent to excavate for an ancient temple in Mexico. But when Heihachi arrives later on, he learns that his team had met their demise by the hands of a creature known simply as Ogre. Heihachi then wishes to capture this creature by all means necessary. That's when the new hero comes in. Enter Jin Kazama. The grandson of Heihachi who trains under him to be strong against Ogre due to his personal vendetta against the beast. Which just so happens to be the death of his mother by Ogre's hands. After all the training, Jin is ready to take on Ogre in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3. With the story getting out of the way, what else does the game offer? The game is much faster paced than it's predecessors but that's what made this game stand out from it's competitors. The fighting looked more fluid, it became less robotic, and there wasn't any delays trying to get up fast enough from receiving more damage. This title also reintroduces classic characters like; Paul Phoenix, Lei Wulong, Nina Williams, and Yoshimitsu. Likewise, it introduces new ones like; Jin Kazama, Ling Xiaoyu, Eddy Gordo, and more! Most that have become well known characters throughout the franchise, started here. This game also had a killer soundtrack, as do every other title that came before and after, that fit it's backgrounds very well for each of the characters. You can also unlock new characters for each time you complete the arcade mode for each character you choose. Unlike the previous two installments, when you unlock new characters, they aren't specific characters that you unlock with specific fighters. They simply pop up as one of the fighters you face before you face the sub boss. The game also has a new mode called Tekken Force. It's a beat em' up mixed with the fighting game elements Tekken 3 uses. This sort of idea is incorporated with it's successors even today. It's a fun mode to challenge yourself in ad you can even unlock a new character with it that I didn't know was possible to unlock. Overall, this is an excellent title that holds up even with today's standards and is a breath of fresh air compared to the rereleases of Street Fighter 4. I strongly recommend it. You owe it to yourself to play it through PSN, your Playstation 2, or your original Playstation. It's on the cheap and a definite good time for your and friends to enjoy. Thanks for reading my review. Have a good one!. Tekken 3 is the third installment in the popular Tekken fighting game series, developed and published by Namco. + One of the Best Fighting Game of PS1 + Excellent Graphics + Ending Cutcenes + Tekken Ball and Tekken Force Modes. One of the best fighting game of all time...graphics are ground breaking for 1998 that still look good today.............................................. This game is one of the best fighting games out there and is unique from others because of it's 3d style where you can move to the left or right and not just forward and back. It is also the final and best Tekken there is, the newer ones just have better graphics and more game modes.. Worst fighting series ever. relies to much on clunky cheap juggle combos. Cheap gimmicky characters. Choppy sorry deformed animations, ugly flickering jaggy polygons with low res textures. clumsy 4 button system that creats the illusion of depth but a punch is a punch unless one is a power hand and a jab hand. Gimmicky goofy characters. Soul Caliber on Dreamcast was Namcos only good fighter. Tekken is and always was just hype. Sony paid for good reviews because they knew that if people found out that VF is superior in every way the saturn might gain some ground. Good thing Sony owned media companies like Viacom which owned media outlets and the defunct blockbuster. Do yourself a favor Play Virtua Fighter 2 and you will see that tekken 123 are trash hype nothing more than a studio pop singer.. Tekken 3 is where the real Tekken fun starts,with its mostly new fighters along with a few old ones,with graphical changes along with the new fighting combos the sidesteps and the no longer jump so high made it to be more realistic and believable,i mean no one can jump that high **** also is remembered of having the Tekken Force where you play in four side scroll levels batteling your way against tekken force army,each level as a boss **** also have the Volleyball mode where you have to hit the ball so that it hits your opponent or hes or hers set.A classic game and where the true Tekken really begins.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not quite as good as Tekken Tag which built on T3's engine adding a lot more depth, The character cast was superb unsurprisingly almost all of them would continue to be regualrs even now. Almost every character had something in their locker to be threat (Poor Kuma). For the time the graphics where a major step up and the soundtrack is still one of the best ever, There where plenty of fun extras in too with tekken ball and tekken force. The bar was set so high Namco would never be able to top it.. Tekken 3 simply has it all, making it the best Tekken ever and one of the best fighting games of all time. Gameplay is great, graphics are pretty, sounds are legendary and it even includes the awesome volleyball mode.. simply the best tekken game ever. it's a shame we can't get it through PSN like the first 2 entries although it would make good money to the company hope to see it soon. Everybody knows Tekken 3 is best tekken, maybe the best fighting game EVER, if it wasn't for mash bros. It does EVERYTHING right! Except for Gon. But thank god he's never had a 2nd appearance!. Best fighting game ever, this is where fighting games were at their apex, I remember playing against my older sister on this game so much, it is an iconic game with many great memories.. This is a game that lasts forever. Whenever me and my best buddy are feeling competitive, we turn on the good old PS2, and play Tekken 3 for hours, constantly filled with adrenaline. I find this game much more suited for multiplayer, butthe single player game is great, the bots are fair, and there's a ton to unlock. There are many game modes, all equal in the fun they provide. The cutscenes were an unforgettable touch. The models look great, especially for a PS1 game, the environments are rich and diverse. You can't really spam one move and win (which is why I find it hundreds of times better than other fighter games), there's a lot of combo potential. By playing with your friend, you'll probably learn a new move, unless you've already mastered all of the 100+ moves your character has. There isn't really a best character, because Every character can defeat and be defeated by any other, again, why I favour this game. My personal favourite is Lei Wulong, for all the 5 forms he has. This has got to be one of the best fighters that have ever existed, topped only by Tekken 5 or Soul Calibur (also by Namco).. Tekken 3 on the PlayStation is the fighting game. Excellent fighting game with extra modes and practice features. One of the best games on Playstation.. best fighting game on ps1 great graphics and just outstanding character everyone with over 100 moves this game is absolutely addictive and still with today's standers you'll find yourself going back to play it. This game changed the way i looked at fighting games. Absolutely revolutionary for it's time. I could have gotten a PhD in the amount of time i spent playing Tekken 3 and Bushido Blade back int he day. Extremely tactical; best character model and motion by far, for its time. Viva la Tekken 3.. Pretty much the best fighting game on the PS1. Was even better on the arcade. For the time these graphics and controls were top of the line. Fighting is fun and generally very balanced and easy to learn. Great characters. Great back stories. Overall: Just a really great game and one of my top PS1 games. Tekken 3 is good fighting game but for me there are better ones in the series. Still like it, was my entry to tekken. Good graphic, sound, control and many modes.. Possibly the most classic of all 3D fighters, Tekken 3 is a masterpiece. One of few games that makes you go just one more round, Tekken 3 has it all; bright, unique characters, each with a recognizably different move set, and music that is just too cool and memorable. Add the new Tekken Force mode, Tekken Ball mode, and a completely positive overhaul to Tekken 3 and you'll see why this game is considered by many to be the best fighting game of all time.. Very good game. Graphics and performance: 6+ (6.25); Longevity: 6- (5.75); Gameplay: 7- (6.75); Plot: 4. OVERALL SCORE: 6- [5.85] (5.75 out of 10 [Good/Very good]).. Sorry about the 0 review, yes this is the silly Rice who forgot to score the review, anyways, best fighting game ever and allways will be, work on a HD remake Namco. I can not stress on how amazing this game is. For a PS1 game, this was easily in the Top 5 games of all time back then. Tekken 3 still remains the best in the franchise next to Tekken 5. For some odd reason, Namco decided to go multiplatform outside of the PlayStation brand. Ever since that, Tekken hasn't been very good. Hopefully they will return back home where they belong.. This game is awesome. Released in 1998 and still better than the most 1x1 fighting games I've been playing since than. Getting a new Fighter for each time that you finish the arcade with a different character and getting a new final video, with awesome graphics (comparing with other PS1 games) everytime you finish it gave me the will to replay it several times. Incredible gameplay. This game totally rocks. Better of the Tekken serie, for me.. So many characters, so many combos, so much fun! This is one of the best fighting games ever created because there are so many unique features and revolutionary fighting.. Yep, Tekken 3 isn't just an incredible old game, is one of the best game in the history and made proud the PlayStation. Who will forget the kick ass intro in it?","Tekken 3 is a fighting game, the third entry in the Tekken series . it was released to the arcades in 1997, before being ported to the PlayStation in 1998 . the improvements over Tekken 2 are more spit and polish than real innovations which made it feel more like Tekken 2.5 ."
230.Crysis,"This game was so ahead of its time in many ways. Most people see it as a sandbox shooter but I liked the story too. Its not only the graphics but the gameplay, physics and the sound which made it a masterpiece.. Destined to be a classic, Crysis is a creative and technological marvel that eclipses every other shooter released that year.. The game was ahead of its time. The graphics are amazing, look decent even for today's standards. The story is simple and easy to understand and follow. The gameplay is fun and engaging. Even tho its an open-world-ish style, there are many types of approaches you can take on every mission and you won't be bored. 9/10 because most things are good except the length. Base story is pretty short in my opinion.. Uh, yeah, open world was neat at the time. Unfortunately the gameplay is about as tilted to unfair as Far Cry 2 - lots of enemies have you in their sites despite your magic power suit. I'm not sure how far I am but there's a helicopter machine gunning me to death when I'm trying to stealth and a ton of enemies rendering me bullet ridden if I try to cross by land. The open world graphics are neat, although the provided maps and narrated direction are awesomely worthless. At one point your told to stealth enter a cliff located station only accessible by rope bridge. After that, you're told to take a road to the next waypoint, which I found a much more direct line via river. Kinda ****.. Good graphics,Decent story, Decent gameplay, not bad but also not amazing very average on my opinion. It was a game that captivated everyone with its graphics when it came out. For me, it has become a game that is no longer worth remembering. I don't remember playing it for long hours and I didn't find it as fun as the second game. Even though the first game offers more freedom on more open maps compared to the second game, the gameplay gets boring very quickly because the AI is very mediocre. It's not a bad game to play and I should probably play it again, but that's my thoughts for now.... it may be classic for the time announced but it is not playable today anymore. Magnificent visuals again, innovative weapon customization and legs! One of the two most advanced engines ever made for a first-person. Clean PC controls, but lots of lame scripts again. Nice physics, but bad game desing at all. (hard difficulty; no grenades, no armor, no cloak) Gameplay: combat mechanics [bad TTK, bad hitboxes, bad ragdoll] 8/10 combat logic [AI often cheats; some stupid missions] 8/10 stealth [cheating vehicle-gunner's AI - do not count on the bushes] 7/10 atmosphere [very uneven] 7/10 Story 5/10 Graphics 10/10 Sounds & music 7/10 . The first fight versus nanosuit-enemies is a wonderful reference to HL1. But not the subsequent ones.. Crysis is a fantastic example of PC games that makes you want to build a 2007 gaming PC to play this phenomenon ****!. I honestly thought Crysis would be like Far Cry 3, meaning it would have some open world and let me go where I wanted and that I would be able to upgrade my character. Unfortunately, I didn't get it. The game is partially open so that you follow a given path, but scripted. Shooting wasn't scary, but it wasn't fun. The graphics didn't leave me speechless, either. I was a bit disappointed, luckily I didn't get tired for long.. Gorgeous still to today an eye candy ****. Story is nice too armour still feels badass to use final mission is still awesome you can buy this game today and just play without feeling its age.. what an ambitious game, definite must play for every action fps lover for sure. I don't get the popularity of this game. Its very buggy on modern computers though but it doesn't change a lot. Graphics is old now, you can feel it: you can see pixels in background images and how objects show up in front of you on max graphics. And I swear I hadn't saw any blood in this game, which is frustrating. The difficulty is too much considering the unfair AI that sees through plants and HUD effects when taking damage make battles a lot more irritating all together. ""The skillpoints and upgrades would make the game better"", I thought all the time because the unique supercostume doesn't make you that badass. You feel yourself just a simple soldier: your armor is regeneration, speed boost regenerates too slow, Its lazy to push strength boost just for the jump or hits. It would be better if all boosts were not connected to only one charge line cause its not fun. The atmosphere is just any battlefield company one half of the game and the next half is second half of the Borderlands 1. Alien enemy: robots jellyfishes, spiders and ghosts; ancient as dinasours, more developed in techonoly, but stupid and unfriendly as any animal or movies' aliens. Thats Crysis for me.. Story -Main story 3/5 -Side Quests 2/5 -Story Direction 3/5 -main character 2/5 -side characters 2/5 Gameplay -Combat 3/5 -stealth 2/5 -enemy AI 2/5 -general gameplay 3/5 Graphics 3/5 -Environmental design 3/5 -Animations 3/5 -optimization 2/3 on my record : 12h. A game that was considered revolutionary for its time. Apart from the fantastic and unbelievably realistic graphics for the time it came out, it is a very decent fps. It has a semi open world setting, offers many ways to approach missions and lets you improvise. I also liked the way the story evolves and the overall pacing of the game. The aiming sometimes doesnt work properly, it has some bugs but without a doubt this game is a milestone for FPS and even today manages to impress with its amazing graphics.. as a fps dosen't compare to giants like halo or call of duty but the graphics and the experience overall i can say is a good game worth the play. This game was so ahead of its time in many ways. Most people see it as a sandbox shooter but I liked the story too. Its not only the graphics but the gameplay, physics and the sound which made it a masterpiece.. and a game that is good at the beginning but between the middle and the end it gets pretty boring as you start to face only aliens and what I liked was the shooting of human beings. Crisis. Insanely beautiful! The game that made a lot of noise in its time, which now goes to almost any computer, and it looks amazing. After the equally beautiful Far Cry, Crytek has made the game even better. Of the small minuses, a very modest set of weapons can be noted, which sometimes made it boring, but it was diluted with the fact that you can conditionally storm any base in many ways. Also, a small minus is a slightly boring first half of the company where you almost constantly go from one base to another.. Despite being a 2007 game I believe it is worth playing! Pros: - Campaign with very good story - Good variety of weapons - Mixes well Stealth with action - Very good graphics and scenery Cons: - Mission too short (+/- 10 hours) - Because it is campaign focused, there is practically no extra mission In a good promotion the game is very worthwhile.. This game is most famous for its incredible graphics, which were far ahead of all other games at the time of its release. As for the gameplay, it’s imperfect because the Cloak mode of your Nanosuit feels cheesy, enemies frequently exhibit glitchy AI, and driving vehicles is inherently riskier than opting to travel on foot. Nevertheless, I enjoyed immersing myself in a nearly photorealistic jungle and weird alien environment inside a hollowed-out mountain. A remastered version of Crysis is now available, but I haven't yet tried it.. A truly decent technological classic. When I first got the demo version of that game and ran it — I was in shocked. The graphics in that game looked so realistic and beautiful, that sometimes I used to think that I was in a real movie, and the only difference was - I could control the main actor. Still to this day I think that Crysis was and still being on of those games that other games should be looking up to when comes about graphic thing.. One of the best shooter game I have ever played. It made me feel amazed with its atmosphere, story and uniqueness. Being a game which was developed in 2007, it's much far a head than most of the FPS games today. It was worth every penny, everyone should give it a try you won't be disappointed. Special thanks to ""Yerli"" brothers, much appreciated.. I'm actually amazed that my PC was able to handle this game back in the day. It was Nvidia 8600GT that helped me a lot.. I know Crysis for a very long time, since this title was treated more like a benchmark than a game, but I never knew of someone who played the whole thing to speak fondly (or badly) of it. Bought it in 2015 (the backlog is slowly progressing) for a very low price and finished the campaign today. Despite the amazing graphics and physics (for its time), the gameplay mechanics are relatively simple, yet fun. If I had to complain about anything in particular, is the length of the campaign. I finished the game on Hard (without manual saves) in only 9 hours, according to Steam. It's worth buying to contemplate what's the ""Can it run Crysis?"" meme is about, but not at full price.. Will my computer handle this game? It was a very good game with island atmosphere and strong armor. There were some problems with the game.. We've all used this game to benchmark our PCs. It's a beautiful game nonetheless. Best shooter I've ever played. And I've played a lot, starting with Wolfenstien 3D, and even before that Dungeons of Daggorath if you want to consid. One of the best FPS games of All time. I hope I can play it for the first time again.. This FPS was diffrent When I played it I feeled I'm playing halo And this time we were the ones who looked great, not the enemies About mechanisms: light gun play, good enemies, easy control for changing nano suit powers, and many things But cars control wasn't so good. ---{ Graphics }--- ☐ You forget what reality is Beautiful ☐ Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{ Gameplay }--- Very good ☐ Good ☐ It's just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{ Story }--- ☐ No Story ☐ Some lore ☐ Average Good ☐ Lovely ☐ It'll replace your life ---{ Game Time }--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short Average ☐ Long ☐ To infinity and beyond ---{ Price }--- ☐ It's free!

This game has been published on 2007. And in these years, this game was a masterpiece with awesome graphics and enjoyable gameplay. But in the 2022, all the features makes the game good is outdated. although the graphic quality is still not that bad, graphic style like textures and models looks too old and boringly basic. Mechanics are still enjoyable, the main innovation is the technological armor which provides some ultra powered functions like super speed or extra power ect. With these functions, in the theory players can make different approaches to the objectives. But in the practice, i could not find a different ways to achieve my objectives. Because the game has too many lack of mechanics like basic stealth mechanics. Except for the lacking mechanics, npc's ai ruins everything. And other aspects like core game loop, game design or storytelling is not satisfying after all these years. Used to be this game could be a masterpiece, but now it is not.. But can it run Crysis?? Really struggled to get this game going even at low settings back in 2009. Those were the days.. Crysis' graphical beauty and freedom in gameplay would have made a more lasting impression had it not been for the game's disappointing and downright broken second half.. Disclaimer: I will be talking about the original Crysis released in 2007, not the Remastered version. Graphics Don't get me wrong, I knew Crysis was kind of a breakout in graphics in 2007 and it is not like I have never seen the actual gameplay on YouTube or something but it just hits different when you run it on your PC. The first thought when I saw the opening cutscene was ""I don't believe it was released in 2007. There has to be some sort of mistake. Did I download a modded version? Remaster?"" but there could not be any mistake - the game was truly the original Crysis released in 2007. The graphics are unbelievable in the fullest sense of the word - up to the last minute of the game it was hard for me to believe this shooter was released in 2007. It was so ahead of its time I don't know how gamers were able to deal with the **** graphics of other shooters for the next 5? 7? 10 years? Seriously, what was the year when games finally stopped looking inferior to Crysis? Gameplay First of all I want to admit the fact the Nanosuit is the most badass battlesuit in the history of videogames and one of the best looking suits in history of humanity. Additionaly, Nanosuit is a great game mechanic which, if you think about, is so simple and obviuous that I am sure if not Crytek then any other major game developer would come up with this concept so Crytek got really lucky there. So what is so great about the Nanosuit and why I can't stop talking about it even though this chapter was supposed to be about gameplay? Because the Nanosuit is the gameplay. Take the suit out of the game and it will lose its magic that very moment. How many times you had to suspend your disbilief when you were singlehandedly dealing with the whole armies in FarCry or Call of Duty? I mean, how come I can just heal my bullet wounds with first-aid kids and keep going as though nothing happened or even worse, how come my health regenerates by itself if I just wait a little? Forget about health, how come a single person or even a soldier is able to take out hundreds of other soldiers and trained killers? Do you know how many times in Crysis it seemed unrealistic to me that I am basically an one-man army? Not a single time. Because I am an one-man army. Bullets don't harm me as much as they should because I am protected by the best futuristic body armor. My health generates by itself because I wear a freaking nanosuit which definitely has built in repairing/healing mechanisms. Add to that the ability to become invisible, fast and strong and you will get a perfect receipt for a supersoldier who of course is capable not only of cleaning a tropical island of enemies but also can fight off an alien invasion. Nanosuit is basically the cheat code in terms of gameplay (just like a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war is the cheat code in terms of setting) - you just can't **** it up. Story Some say the plot of Crysis is trivial, I say the plot of Crysis is classic - I would even say Biblical. Don't expect this game to give you life lessons or pose deep philosophical questions: you are here to be a super-duper soldier who saves the world from an alien invasion - what else as a young man I could wish for? It is like the most generic plot you could come up with for a videogame but who cares if it is awesome? What surprised me the most is the courage: Crytek was so sure in the success of the game they dared to not tie all the loose ends and basically announced the sequel right after you end your final mission - even Modern Warfare which was released the same year wasn't so brave. Conclusion Crysis is a game which should be remembered not only for its mind-blowing graphics - the plot is solid, the charachters are memorable, the gameplay is superb, the music is top-notch. It looks like the graphics ended up to be so good it overshadowed everything else Crysis did right. My score for Crysis 1 is 10 out of 10.. One of the best shooters, great shooting, gameplay, physics, good storyline and graphics that are still great.. ""Can it run Crysis"" speaks for itself. When this game launched it was benchmark for PC platform and generally awesome game. The second part of campaign is not that great but I never forget running this game for the first time and being totally blown away.. can it run crysis?; this question of the release time of the game is enough to prove the amazing graphics; game play mechanics are amazing and give you a lot of option; story is good; boss fights are challangable. Sandbox shooter it's how it's supposed to be. Plus graphics are still better than most games.. Great game not just for its astonishing graphics, but also solid story, characters and gameplay.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 80 IIIIIIIIII====================. Great FPS game which took the graphics to its own league back then. Played this first on 2014, gave me a thrilling experience.. Though it looked great at the time and arguably has held up in that regard, the game itself is actually pretty poor. Incredibly slow movement, awful gunplay, skills that are useless more often than not and a trait seen quite frequently in many AAA shooter titles of that time...style over substance. See a lot of reviews here stating ""best fps I've ever played"", but none seem to really explain why. Which is incredibly telling. The physics are fun for a few seconds, until your jeep shoots into the sky for absolutely no reason, but that's all the fun there is to be had here.. this very very very good i think you play now this game my favorite 2. game. MAXIMUM. GAME. Maximum Armor. Maximum Speed. Maximum Strength. Cloak Engaged.. It still holds up graphically but graphics are not the whole game. Story, characters and presentation is weak. It starts good but quickly disappears. It bores you at some point. Nanosuit is nice but game gets so repetitive. Especially at later levels. And when aliens appeared I stopped caring. They are annoying and not fun to fight.. I'm not a hater to be a hater, I generally think Crysis is not a good game. I heard so much of this game before to a point were I was so excited, and let down is every way possible. This game is horrendously optimized. It doesn't run good even on modern systems, with constantly FPS drops and stutters even not on the highest setting. It even crashed on me twice, like what a lord of crap that this game is 'optimized', stop listening to the lies. Everything about the gameplay is awful. The suit abilities are underpowered to the point where they aren't fun. Gun play is some of the worst, with a ton of recoil and bullet spongy enemies. Everything little thing can kill you, like using super speed can kill you if you run in something. The game is also glitchy, like I saw props bugging out, a gun shooting itself, multiple graphical glitches, the list can go on. Don't get me started on the last 'mission'. Without any spoilers, let me just say I had to grab a weapon that was needed later on. I forgot to grab it, so when that part came, I didn't have the weapon. So I went back to grab it, but found out that I couldn't go back. I had to load an earlier save just to get the weapon. That is the worst mission design I have ever seen. Crysis is a bad experience that has been undeserving praised to a extremely high level. This isn't the amazing game people crack it up to be.. Some people only talk about how amazing this game graphics were but the gameplay is also excellent and way better than most recent fps games, thats what happens when you make a FPS game for PC and dont give a damn about consoles lower standards. The biggest flaw imo are the enemies turning into stone when you kill them, no ragdoll or gore, pretty unsatisfying; and the big bad boss fight that has a whole level hyping it, ****.. Legends stay legends. I played the game after nine years again. I loved it again.. It was really a next-gen experience. Looking back on the fact that the game came out in 2007 still makes me disbelief it. It had great shooting mechanics, interactive physics, very good setting on sunny island and better than average story. The graphics were on the other hand from a completely different planet. 9/10. This game gefted me a real Game in my life. thanks. It's gameplay was better than 2 & 3, but also they were very good. and their advantage was that they were running in my low spec pc with 2g ram.. I don't understand why people love this game so much. I can't say I didn't like it at all, but it doesn't deserve the 8.1 score it has. I can agree that graphics were insane for that time (still looks good in 2020), but everything else is quite mediocre. Optimisation is poor, game mechanics are unbalanced, story is boring, game design is bad, shooting mechanics are annoying, AI is dumb. The game seems unfinished. I do not recommend. Nano suit gives essential differences from traditional first person shooter, making this game extraordinarily intriguing.. Crysis | September 15, 2020 | [★★★★] Many people joke about the ""But Can You Run Crysis?"". Ironically, you literally can't and need a lot of fixing before managing to run it smoothly. Took me about 30 minutes to tweak every dated aspect of the game that didn't carry to an updated version of Windows. Gladly, after doing those remedies, It rewards you with one of the beautiful scenery that still holds up to the standard graphics today. One thing that captivates me is how the trees and vegetation felt like breathing, making the whole island alive. The protagonist has a lot of features similar to a Predator which quite the Gameplay revolves around other than being a military shooter. The map also gives you the illusion that it was Open World even though it was relatively linear. This wasn't really a Spoiler since it tells you in the beginning, but just wanted to point out that the In-game date was just last month (August 7th 2020) which kinda alarming because it was also take place in my local country.. 10/10 Will forever be a masterpiece, I salute you and R.I.P. CryTek. I will forever love your games and wish you were here to make more, will be missing you.. Crysis 1 is a pretty good action game with minor technical issues. Gameplay is interesting and varies based on the way you decide to approach objectives. You can go either guns blazing or take more stealthy option. Crysis gives you a really big sandbox to play around and objectives can be approaches from usually hundreds of ways with multitude of tools and weapons at your exposal. This is all great but some of the technical issues hinder the experience. The game suffers from optimisation issues and runs fairly poorly even with modern hardware. Also the game can and will crash at times due various reasons. Mostly bugs which were never patched. Excellent game. Also the graphics look really good even in 2020. Just don't make the mistake thinking that it's all there is to this game.. This game felt like that it came from the feature, the graphic was unbelievable. The gameplay was also good, but the story was just OK.. The game is great, but there is one minus when I threw a chicken at the Korean, he did not die! And then he shot me, I was very offended!. Suit, better than iron man, shooting better than COD, aliens better than Alien, and an over all predator better than Predator!. Nice open world shooter, cool powers, very addictive and pretty good graphics and visuals. Mandatory.. This game was a graphical monster back in the day and required a monster PC from NASA to run in max details. Every PC was sweating at hearing the word ""Crysis"". It was the ultimate benchmark for years. Of course it still looks good even today. But gameplay wise and plot wise it was pretty generic and nothing to really get excited about.. Played this on EA Origin. It's the year 2020 (real world, lol) and I think it's the best time to play this game. Gaming hardware finally caught up with the graphics, and the game is gorgeous when every graphics setting is crank up to maximum, and can be played without much lag!. Crysis is maybe the biggest leap in computer graphics history. It's effects are also a leap forward, Nano suit adds a new dimension as does mowing down trees etc. You'll need a great PC to run it properly but it's worth every penny, makes all console games look obsolete.. So i have just now PlayedThrough Crysis and have decided to write a review on its current state. OBS: This game was bought and played through Steam. Firstly, the game is surprisingly demanding even for a GTX 1080 and 1 i9-9900KS. In all, i had about 15 crashes, most of them during the Alien Exosuite and the alien ship Part of the end game. But overall the game was running fine and looked great for a 2007 Title. The graphics are really good, even in 2020. And when it came out, the graphics was one of its selling points of this game after all. I would recommend a buy in 2020. ""8/10 – Great. A very good product. These games leave me with something outstanding to remember them by, ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out."" ~DeathKillerNOR~. Mediocre FPS with competent story and gunplay. While graphics are good, the visual design of the game is average.. Crysis is the reason I brought my new PC in 2009... luckily by this time, pc gaming tech had evolved to catch up with the above average (for its time) GPU and cpu memory bandwidth limitations that notoriously plagued early adopters of the game (even then it was hard to get very high @ 1080P!). As for the game itself, the scifi-action adventure story takes us to the Lingshan Islands where it offers a gorgeous tropical setting as backdrop for the still to this day impressive physics and gameplay. The large sandbox play areas allow various nano suit powered approaches for aggressive/stealth/tactical navigation across the densely A.I populated maps. I play this game every year as a sort of Cry-holiday throwing soldiers into huts and cruising the waters with Jaws at maximum speed. I even enjoy the alien bits that seem a bit more dated in 2020, but blew my mind when I first played it. Would love a game developer to do a 'spiritual remake' of this game.. This game just amazing.Crytek created one of the greatest **** on 3 place on my top 10.. Easily the best Crysis game ever made, the original one. Its central mechanics which revolve around the suit are brilliant, the graphics are gorgeous (although that shouldn't be the top priority), the gunplay and pacing are solid, however sometimes the game can get a bit repetitive.. buggy unoptimized game. Can't play with 60 fps in 2020. CTD out of the box. Save yourself some money and don't buy this ****. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me this game will be always the best in the trilogy. Kind of open maps, outstanding graphics (still in 2019), great mechanics, and decent story.. The first part was with good idea but I did not like it, if to be honest. However, I played this game already many years after its release, so it can be imprint of modern graphics subconsciously. But even so, some in-game moments seemed strange and not good to me in terms of game-play and storytelling, so I’ll give an average rating: ""Neither to you nor to us"". P.S.: What... an individual... set the final battle with the boss as a trailer? Does this person know the meaning of the word ""s p o i l e r""?. best crisis game and best island game. it can be so much better with dinosour squel or dlc but serie lost the hype in 2dn and 3rd one even cant manage to be generic farcry game. forest desingn was the key here firt time used realstic forest. many not played on pc when cryisis come become a myth to system selling.. it was my worst game ever, because of the story. Story is not solid, and I don't know what the story tells me. It was boring to. I just go around unnecessarily, and kill enemy. IF this and the graphic was better, it would be a good game.. Very satisfying action and smooth gameplay. Feel like a badass utilizing the powers of the suit, speeding around the beautiful tropics or silently taking out your enemies while cloaked. Lots of freedom in approaching every mission. Go guns blazing, or go exploring for an alternative hidden route. Or just go exploring the island's nature for the hell of it. Gorgeous looking graphics for its time. Clean and crispy looking, just like I like them. The story is not very engaging, but the ""other type"" of enemies that appear later in the game sure add to the suspense.. Sandbox shooter it's how it's supposed to be. Plus graphics are still better than most games.. I guess the game looked nice in 2007, but now it doesn't and the rest of that game is just empty.. An impressive game from technical stand point. Graphics, Animations, Effects are top tier at the time. The shooting mechanics are also pretty good. A.I is good. I didnt like the story and the world design, in about half story i lost interest and forced myself to rush it. 6/10. The main plus of this game is the graphics, I got acquainted with this game rather late so I can't only for it to put this game 10 the plot is weak the characters Neocom gameplay uncomfortable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PC performance is mixed over the years. Origin have the 32/64 bit version, but Steam only has the 32 bit version. I got a cool powered up sci-fi suit to mess about with some nice vehicles and weapons to have a laugh with. Large open jungle/forest maps for most of the levels. Story wise some really weird mysterious stuff going on mid to late game. A.I. not the best, but enough action goings on distracts from how stupid the A.I. actually is. Good conceptually, but not so great in execution.. Cutting-edge graphics. I've played this game many years ago. But it's still looking interesting for me.. Best graphics in it's days. Plot isn't bad (definitely not good either) and I had fun playing it. Missions in most FPS games are all the same: go from start of the corridor to it's end and shoot everything that moves. It soon becomes repetitive and frustrating. In Crysis I could solve missions in several ways. Shoot everything like Rambo, stay cloaked and sneak past everything, run fast like lighting or any other combination.. Crysis single and multiplayer WERE GROUND BREAKING and I have no idea and am PISSED off the mutliplayer is dead and all other crysis **** mulitplayer wise. This multiplayer is still better than most other multiplayers due to its amazing size, graphics, powers, weapons, vehicles, and MASS destruction weapons :)﻿. An awesome experience and great start for a trilogy to start and kick off. Crysis offers a unique action-packed experience with challenges awesome weapons and abilities, and military tactics and strategy. Crysis and it's follow up sequels will go down in gaming history as a cult classic amongst sci-fi gamers and fans alike.. This graphic engine is the best I have ever seen. It shows such brilliant pictures and doesnt need much power from your computer. I can play this game with Blackfire mod even on my gaming laptop from 2012 without any **** is only a pity, that in Crysis you have the same settings like in Far Cry: a tropic island. Why not something different? The AI is sometimes buggy, but sometimes clever and attacks you from several sides. I improved it with Greater AI mod. The story is only average, especially the characters are superficial. Crytek had a nice idea to give you a suit, that gives you 4 modes. Yo you have even more possibilities to continue than with the fact, that the game is open as Far Cry, just a bit less.. Crysis is a beautiful game. in every aspect of the word. Stunning graphics, very well designed systems, and an atmosphere both very dark and thick, and very free. One of the only games that REALLY makes a difference because of it's stunning graphics. they make wondering around and doing objectives a very pleasant experience.. One of the best shooters ever it had stunning graphics in its time ( and even stands on graphical level with a couple of games now) , enviroment. Awesome gun action and weird but","it's not only the graphics but the gameplay, physics and the sound which made it a masterpiece . it's not a bad game to play and i should probably play it again ."
231.Ninja Gaiden (2004),"This Xbox action masterpiece is like a ninja version of ""Devil May Cry"". It's arguably better than DMC due to superb level design and engrossing combat. A prequel to the NES games, ""Ninja Gaiden"" has the epic scope of a Zelda title. It has expansive levels filled with intense fights, puzzles and platforming. The game also gives you the feeling of being Bruce Lee. Combat is fast, tough and strategic. You'll need to polish your fight skills if you want to beat this very challenging game. Hardcore action fans will savor every minute of it. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. Glorious return of a mythical game. Great design, varied levels and a unique atmosphere. Superb graphics and a high difficulty that makes it not suitable for beginners.. ""Ninja Gaiden"" for the original Xbox is a great action game in the tradition of ""Devil May Cry"". Developed by Team Ninja and released in 2004, it's a punishingly difficult action-adventure. According to director Tomonobu Itagaki, this reboot is set in the ""Dead or Alive"" universe and serves as a prequel to the NES titles. Being a fan of ""God of War"" and ""Onimusha"", I ended up buying an Xbox console just to play this and I didn't regret it. This is a masterpiece that ranks up with the best action titles ever made. It certainly is the best one made for the original Xbox. Unfortunately, the sequels did not live up to its level of excellence. In addition, the rebooted franchise never became as popular as its competition. Regardless, this first installment of the ""new"" Ninja Gaiden is a must-play. It surpasses the first ""God of War"" and ""Devil May Cry"" games in terms of map design, weapon selection and combat. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. + playability + extreme difficulty + creative final bosses + art and design - Storyline - Sometimes ridiculously hard. Otherwise solid game is actually **** because of the ****ty camera, You will find yourself constantly fighting cameras lunatic behaviour and attempt to make it look the way your enemies are, instead of concentrating on enemies. Totally ruins the experience.. Ninja Gaiden as an action adventure game with the primary focus on fast-paced, and rather violent, combat. To be honest I can't really recall anything about the game's plot but its largely irrelevant anyway as it takes a distant second place to the superb gameplay. These days it of course looks a little dated compared to modern titles but, even more than a decade after its release, it offers some of the most satisfying combat in the genre. The legendary level of difficulty might well put some people off but once you get the hang of things you'll find a genuinely great game.. A kick ass way of bring back a classic. Well done. Totally worth checking out. Sadly it's sequels after this were not so special... Oh well... This one was still pretty sweet.","""Ninja Gaiden"" for the original Xbox is a great action game in the tradition of ""Devil May Cry"" it's a punishingly difficult action-adventure set in the ""Dead or Alive"" universe . the sequels did not live up to its level of excellence ."
232.God of War: Chains of Olympus,"This is a decent installment from the franchise. It is still a good story just not very memorable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game used all the performance of the PSP and wow its so good maybe the best of the series. i like very much the combat sistem even if the story isn't very convincing but apart from that very good. God of War: Chains of Olympus delivers an epic prequel with stunning visuals and fluid combat. Kratos' journey through Greek mythology is both brutal and captivating, maintaining the series' high standards on the PSP.

You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. best game ever , really looking forward to it , I always wanted to play any of the God of war sequels. It reminded me of my childhood and thats a reason today ive got a psp on second hand market to play this game. everything is same as i remember and it gave me those nostagic vibes again. masterpiece. Another quality adventure from the highly consistent franchise. Good looking, inventive and fun although once again, it can be a little unnecessarily difficult in places.. PSP masterpiece. Interesting plot. I enjoyed a lot flight model. It was nice to watch how Kratos destroyed enemies. The set pieces, presentation and bosses hold this game together. It's a fun little spin off, but it's really nothing special. The combat plays the same as God Of War (2005) which is to say it's fairly simple leaning heavily on its constituent elements. God of War: Chain of Olympus is a good slasher. fantastic story , gameplay , boss fights , game design and music.. A decent game, but not very memorable, too short too, can´t be sure if it´s worth the money.. The look of the game, even the fighting animations or other animations are not worth playing too badly and the story is not good either. I don't recommend you to play it. I think you can download better stuff instead.. God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War God of War. one of the best games i played on the psp if not the best,its the first god of war i played and make me fan of the saga, for the psp good graphics and the gameplay as perfect as a god of war can be for the psp.. i enjoying every second of it on ps3 from fighting the invading persian army and their giant basilisk to crawling my back from the pits of tartarus to slay charon and at the end stopping the plans of persephone and atlas also doing all the puzzles where so well made music cinematics are great and graphics have aged but they are okay for their time i enjoyed using Ifrit so much and there was the gauntlets of zeus and shield of helios is so op i liked the mixup variety of new enemies and weapons incredible masterpiece all of the old god of war games deserve to be remaked for the PS5 in one collection. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. great great great What can I say about this masterpiece? All versions of God's War are masterpieces and deserve praise. the weakest game in the franchise for me it's not bad by any means but also not as good and the boss fights don't feel as epic as the rest of the tittles. One of the best games for PSP. I remember playing it when I was little and I loved it. I replayed it yesterday and I loved it even more!. I like this game more than the first one but it's still pretty mediocre to be honest. there should be movies telling the story of this game or everyone in the saga that would be amazing. Not bad i should say, less fights than in GOS and more riddles. The story itself kinda primitive, less impressive fighting abilities and effects and general feel of battle and epic. Still, quite good, still quite polished game. In my personal opinion, Ghost of Sparta was better. :) Don`t get me wrong the game is good, but it doesn`t really put as much to the table as the other one. Yet still its a nice game (as expected from the francize). My first GOW game ever. Enjoyed the hell outta it. Will recommend it. 10/10, one of the best stories i have seen in gaming, which surprised me a lot. Good - the hack and slash is as good as the first one. Though nothing really new. - the pre-rendered cutscenes are nicer looking - the premise of the storyline is much more epic, teaming with gaia, then fighting zeus, killing ares. - new enemy designs. Bad - Unconventional logic applied to some of the puzzles. Some things I felt could be done, couldn't, but could be only for specific puzzles the devs deemed. - the took out the roll into charge, making traversing slower and less amusing. - some weird camera angles. It's an amazing game, and even more so on the PSP. The story, the weapons and the mechanics make this game a great game.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 7 Music: 8 Story: 9 Total: 8.33. A great game, an amazing story, Kratos is the best spartan warrior. I just Love it.. Good graphics good gameplay good story and can play in school !!! that's crazy. Absolutely biased review, GoW is amazing, even considering the portable power, made great. It is one of the best psp and gow games. Don't think it lost its gow identity just because it's a psp game! the game is pretty good. Best psp game definitely. Just give it a try and then you will be addicted to it . thanks sony and thanks ppsspp for the emulator.. Let me just say that this is the only God of War game I have played. Let me also say that THIS GAME IS BADASS! The story is great, the combat is just the right amount of simple and satisfying, and this is definitely one of the best-looking PSP games I've seen, with a level of detail that challenges Original Xbox graphics when looked at on the small screen. Overall, a must-play if you have a PSP or Vita (which if you do then you are superior to most humans).. This game is a legend. Very fun and very enjoyable. It's technically a legend for its year of release. And it had a very satisfying ending. This game is my favorite game. But it may be bad for some, but it was very easy to improve. I played in easy mode. I'm just writing at least 150 characters because I wanted to save this review in a more convenient way to look back at scores that I had given stuff as a user. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Summary: I liked the game overall, but I have some negative points to mention. Negatives: 1- There are frequent FPS drops, especially when playing on the original PSP. 2- Sometimes the camera distance during story or cinematic scenes becomes problematic, making it hard to see the character or details. Despite these negatives, I've played the game multiple times and always found it beautiful. Ghost of Sparta remains my favorite. Positives: This game is one of the top three most powerful PSP games I've played. The story is connected to other games, but it's easy for newcomers to understand due to good storytelling. Overall, it's a well-executed game. Thank you for reading. -Yakuzet. Following the same formula it can't go wrong but it feels stale by being the third God of war game released. Lots of enemies are recycled for previous games. Play it only if you're a fan of God of war. This is everything we needed. There was literally no reasoning behind Ascension being made, especially if we have this game. This is the best prequel I think I could have expected, especially for an old PSP title. The gameplay is classic and just as exciting as the original games. I never really felt like it was too hard but definitely didn't think it was too easy either. It was honestly near perfect gameplay mechanic. the story is fun and original. I'm really glad I picked this up. It's hard to write for this game right now because it's exactly what you'd expect from a God of War game. The story is easy to follow yet seemed important, gameplay is fun and exciting and the graphics a pretty good for a PSP game. Way better than they were on the PSP!. This game could be played on PSP or remastered on PS3. I played at PS3 and was solid; for PSP i could imagine that was great. --> Positive Points: . Game-play. As any previous GOW, the hack and slash style fits pretty well. . Lore. This adventure of Kratos fits perfectly in the lore of GOW series and the plot itself is good. . Development of Kratos. Even though we all now the Kratos is a anti-hero, we can see the emotions he feels and he discovers how the god manipulated him . Philosophical questioning that the game brings especially when he reunite with his ""family"" --> Negative points: . Some cut-scenes aren't skippable. Man, when you fighting the last boss in higher difficulties and dies before the checkpoint, you can't skip the cutscene which delay ""trys"" and make the player mad . Graphics for the PS3 version are sloppy/bad. Santa Mônica didn't spend enough resources to remaster it greatly . Too short for a game. You can beat it in 6 hours easily, . At some fights, you could abuse of the ""grab"" enemies mechanics which make game a lot easier. That could be nerfed.. The story is mediocre the whole game is backtracking through the areas you've already been to before and there is lot of cut content some of it is even seen in the bonus section in the main menu.. In my opinion this game is incredible, because of interesting slasher gameplay with pleasent control, animations and combos. There are also some puzzles, which are complementing monotonous cutting. Designs and enteriors of levels look impressive: they are huge, atmospheric and beautiful. Bosses is one of the main aventages of the whole God os War franchise, because Santa Monica Studios are combinating all gameplay's mechanics and making boss fights interesting, satisfying and a bit hard. A really solid game. The story didn't stick with me as much after playing but a solid portable game nonetheless.. An excellent slasher, with bewitching gameplay, plot, cool locations, characters and a brutal main character.. amazing what they achieved with this one but after gowii this was just a bit subpair. still worth the playtime ! still wanna get it and try on my ps3!. Im playing this on ps now and dear god this game is unplayable with the input lag. The parry is broken, enemies keep bashing so you can't move and die quickly (on titan dif). The forgot a few health chest so make sure you make lots and lots of saves or else your gonna be in trouble. This is def the worst gow game i played from the seriers. The graphics look good the story is ok.... and don't get me started on the last boss. An unskippable cutscene. And the boss will do so much damage in the beginning because you can hardly dodge while the game is loading it's the most broken boss ive seen in the serie.. Graphics - 8/10 Gameplay - 8/10 Story - 7/10 Levels - 7/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Chains of Olympus was a blast to re-play, everything from the graphics to the sound is so impressive for a psp title, the only thing holding it back for me is the magic powers and its short length. As much as i love ghost of sparta i have a preference for this one (because of nostalgic reasons). 7/10. I am still amazed what the PSP was capable of. There is the valid statement that this game is a system seller and / or showpiece. It is set before the time of the initial God of War. Kratos is in servitude of the Olympian Gods to atone for his sin. He is draw into a plot that threatens the world and even the Gods. It has an engaging story with good twists and reveals. Be warned: Kratos greatest challenge will not be a fight or an enemy. Game-play wise it is rock solid. I have no complains about the battles and game mechanics with the exception of the final boss fight. There was a make or break point. If you did not succeed at one point you have no chance of coming back. It is possible that I made a mistake there or misinterpreted what the game expected me to do. However I could beat the game after a few attempts. The graphics and soundtrack are on the best list the PSP had to offer. Like I said I was amazed but will admit that it is not impressive graphically anymore. The soundtrack holds still up today. Overall a must own on the PSP and one of its most successful games.. One of the best PSP games I have ever played. Amazing graphics, great combat, and another great GOW game.. The second worst God of War game. But a god of War game is at least always ok. I played this game on my PS Vita - very enjoyable and fun to play. It's a GoW in pocket :) same mechanics but shorter and smaller :). My favorite PSP game. The story, gameplay, and graphics are all exceptional. Pick it up if you haven't yet.. God of War: Chains of Olympus is a 2008 hack and slash action-adventure video game developed by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio, and published by Sony. It plays perfectly into the franchise's storyline and offers up the same level of intense action as its console counterparts. + Excellent Graphics for a Handheld Console + Fun Gameplay + Good Soundtrack + Lots of Unlockables My Score: 9.3/10. The length is too short but that's the only drawback of it. Everything else is great.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. A great game on handheld for the GOW franchise...While not as polished as its console counterparts the game does an excellent job of bringing the same feel as the core series.. Chains of Olympus is really just rehashing the least epic portions of the first two games. Honestly, how many times am I going to have to level up the same blades? It’s like this character has memory loss and I gotta retrain him every few months. I get that this is a prequel but there are many ways to still have made it more unique. And the final boss? We meet the character RIGHT before we have to fight her, it’s the biggest left-field random “surprise” and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes— the final ending just feels tacked in last-minute. There’s not too much else to say, it doesn’t feel fresh but if you like God of War then this will most likely please you. Alternatively, you're like me and love GoW but this game feels like a lazy attempt at making GoW portable.. It's more of the same, but there is still plenty of fun to be had with the great combat system and locations.. The graphics background are very good for the system with excellent character models while also not so great ones then the cut-scenes are a highlight in the game. Great voice acting, interesting mythological level design like the games on the ps2 but shorter than usual. Sound is very good while the only flaw here is having no wind sound. The sounds effects are standard god of war sounds which is both great and familiar. The story of the kratos is before the events of the first game but it retells the same tragic story again but at-least with different villains, while kratos works with the future villains of the series. Overall the story is flawed because the main problem could have been easily solved and some of the actions of the characters doesn't add up. The game-play is smooth and satisfying, you can do the same moves of the previous games with interesting new moves and a few super magic powers. The distant camera works fine for almost all the game where you can see your character but in there a few moments that you can't see the enemies or the final boss attack. For some reason the camera doesn't show them. The game makes you walk, fight enemies then bosses, jump, swim, climb, open doors, push objects, press button prompts, and solve puzzles. While the enemy variety and puzzles is not much it is still good enough to keep you entertain for a good while and the un-lockable customs are a must. Also the challenges return and surprisingly I ended up preferring it over the original. Overall Chains of Olympus is a outstanding game.. Great game for a portable console, keeps up with what the franchise has done previously and gets you to know deeply the protagonist. Wow. And to think it's a handheld game. 10/10. I believe this game can easily be a triple A title no sweat. Amazing gameplay, great characters (I mean come on it's Kratos), beautiful graphics which is unbelievable on the PSP. Nice work Sony and SMS still got my heart. Great addition to the franchise and just an awesome awesome game.. Game: God of War Chains of Olympus Genre: Action Developer: Sony/Ready at Dawn System: Playstation Portable (PSP) Total Score: 80/100 Value Score: 8/10 • Story: 7/10 • Characters: 7/10 • GamePlay: 8/10 • Graphics: 9/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 6/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 9/10 Pros +Puzzles were well made +Visuals max out the platform's most potential +Gameplay is well balanced and modified for portable experience +Post game content consists of harder difficulties, challenges, costumes and developer videos Cons -Very Short, takes at least 5 hours -Very small amount of boss battles -Controls can be somewhat frustrating due to the PSP's analog. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great game that captivates you and does not bore you. Full of thrills and chills. The choice of weapons that we have is also nice, though you tend to use blades of chaos more often. It does not take time to get comfortable with the game. One of the best games I have played on PSP.. its the same game press x to win the game isn't very good and when it is the controls are horrible while its a fun game to play its not really a good game. Gameplay: Ready at Dawn did a stellar job on working the control scheme around the PSP's lack of a second analog stick. The controls are smooth and responsive, leading to seamless gameplay. Gameplay is identical to previous God of War's, you'll use a combination of weapons and magic to defeat your foes. The other sections of this game will comprise of puzzles, quick-time events, and few boss battles that are included in the game. It is very impressive that the gameplay remained intact from it's console counterparts. It seems as if the limitations of the PSP are nonexistent. Unfortunately, the game is short in length, so the amazement doesn't last for long. Story: Chains of Olympus takes place before the original God of war, but after Ascension. Kratos, during his 10-year service to the Gods, is sent to Attica to destroy the invading Persian army. After the victory, Kratos experiences the fall of the sun, bringing darkness to the world. Kratos is subsequently tasked by Athena to find Helios, the Sun God. The game takes place in many settings, including Attica, The Temple of Helios, River Styx, Tartarus, and more. The storyline is strong, depicting Kratos' growing anger for the Gods and all of their requests. It answers questions from Kratos' past and shows the reasons for his anger in the main series. Graphics/Appearance: This game proved that if a talented developer took their time on crafting a game on the PSP, it could surpass some PS2 games graphically. The graphics are mind-blowing throughout the duration of the game. That's not to say there aren't any technical faults. The game has occasional screen tearing and frame rate drops. The good thing is it only occurs while roaming around the map and not during actual combat. It's very minor, and does not take away from the experience. Pros: -Smooth Controls -Good Story -Amazing Graphics -Console-Quality Experience Cons: -Short Length (5-8 Hours) -Occasional Screen Tearing and Frame Rate Drops Verdict: Anyone who owns a PSP and does not own Chains of Olympus, is doing themselves a disservice. I highly recommend this game! Casual gamers may not enjoy it because the game can become difficult in certain instances, but it shouldn't stop you from playing the game. The controls are smooth, the gameplay remains intact, and it feels like a console-experience.. This is a gem for every player with excellent graphics for the time, it's time to say that after the two God of War Games, this is awesome game to play.. This game is absolutely spectacular. It has great graphics for a PSP game. Game play is simple and fun, it doesn't frustrate you. Story is satisfying like the other games in the series. Boss fights are very exciting, I love it. And Kratos is awesome as usual. It deserves 10 out of 10.. Chains of Olympus takes place before the original GOW, the gameplay is the same as the first GOW, the graphics are really good for a portable device and although the story is not as great as the other GOWs it is still pretty good.. All of the hype and great ratings brought me towards the game and the horrible system and simple bosses brought me away from the PSP. Simply said, this game offered no challenge and the random sex scene in the game proved to be pointless.. I played this game on Vita and this is still one of the best title I can get on this hendheld. Great story, great gameplay, so much fun. Love GOW, I am waiting for the GOW title espacially for PS Vita.. What a beatiful game. I´ve played it in PS3 in HD, but I´m pretty sure this is the best psp game. The Graphics, the story, the fresh weapons and **** bosses are great and this game has really nice difficulty, a bit frustrating in high modes. It has an awsome storyline, only a bit short for me. If you are a GOW fan you must play this one.. God Of War is Indeed the God of All PSP Games so Far. No Second Thoughts on that. The Moment you start playing this Game, you will find it hard enough to keep that frikkin psp Away !!. A few minor errors but still a good game full of action and adventure. I don't really mind if there is no multi-player since i have the new PlayStation Portable. Defenetly worth the money.. wow. another button masher. god of was, obviously, is a graphic, enemies and X button. Here we got average graphic, enemies and X button. Developers, please, use all buttons of this console. There is O left to X, really.. This is the game that got me into the God of War series, its the first GOW that ive played and to me its a classic. If you've played god of war before than you'll love this game,they've taken nothing you love about the series out and u even get some cool moments with Kratos's family. The only problem i personally have with the game is how long it is.....which isnt very **** took me exactyly 3 and a half hours to be it every time i beat it,and a lot of people complain about the boss fights,how there are not enough. There are enough you fight two of the bosses twice,and the last boss is so cinematic you can compare it to anything on the console games. If you have a psp or now a vita then either buy it or download it because its well worth your money. Realy good one. I don't understand why people stamp 1 or 0 score on it. That is just not fair.. The best PSP game I ever owned. I beat this game over ten times and unlocked a majority of the extras including the characters. Excellent game with decent replay value and extras to unlock to keep you blood thirsty for more!. God of War: Chains of Olympus for the Playstation Portable was great as if gave my inner killer great Spartan rage!!SCEA did a beautiful job on the graphics as well! Good Job! 10/10. For a handheld game this is amazing. One is enthralled by the amazing landscape and the meticulous game play. Kratos as a character is the marlon brando of the gaming world and u just cant help but getting inside the mind of the character and feel his emotions. My favorite part of this high-intensity action game is wandering around hallways with no enemies, pushing blocks around for fifteen minutes. So badass! The great graphics really enhance the hardcore ""press square repeatedly to kill everything on screen and automatically win"" gameplay. I like to watch Jersey Shore unironically, so you can imagine how much I appreciate shallow things.. Its definatly not a bad game, but its pretty disappointing, only about 3 bosses. The graphics are nice, but the game kinda gets repetitive and creepy. The story is kinda uninteresting. Comparing to this Persona 3 portable. God of war simply has no replay value, nothing fun about it, not much variety, nothing new or cool to explore, no eastereggs, etc. The story of Persona 3 was so well done, characters, developement, it was also a very long game. God of War was way too short. It is impressive for 2008 and if this game were released now, it would probably get a lower score. But the main problem is that its very forgettable. The bosses arent that fun. And it gets too repetitive.. It may not be the best game in the series but this is definitely one of, if not the best game on the PSP, the graphics are amazing, I was shocked that this was a PSP game, the soundtrack is awesome, and if you were worried that the controls would suffer don't be, if you played a game in this series before you will instantly grasp the controls, only one or to minor adjustments were made but they never caused me any problem, and the action is just as fun and gory as you remember it, and the new weapons are awesome, the Gauntlet of Zeus is particularly cool, my main problem is that tis adventure isn't as memorable as the first two games on the PS2, the story which takes place before the events of the first game and tells about Kratos time serving the gods, wasn't really all that great, basically the world is in trouble and Kratos needs to kill stuff, nothing really all that interesting, but it does pack an emotional moment that really makes you feel for Kratos, and it is pretty short, but things like un-lockable costumes and videos, and the challenge of hades mode will make you come back once or twice more, it's not the best in the series but if your a fan of the series who owns a PSP, or just a PSP owner looking for a great game, you really should get this, it's a huge achievement for the PSP.. i love god of war. i just wanted to get that out of the way. i got this game not 1 day ago and it lags like nothing else. i mean it doesn't break the game or ruin the experience but its majorly distracting. but everything else is good!. 9/10 = Amazing = This is one of the PSP's greatest titles. Excellent and very badass action game.. Great fun and fresh experience. Stays true to GoW heritage. Great graphics that stays at high framerate. Great sound and music. Wish the game was longer but that's a good sign.. Almost everything from the PS2 titles is brought to the PSP just about flawlessly. All of the combos you know are here, as are magics, weapons, quick-time events, goofy unlockable costumes, etc. Anyone who played GoW will find that this looks & plays just like they remember. I thought it controlled well too, and that's what most people gripe about on the PSP. The few minor complaints are the same too: short duration, not enough story, never enough boss fights. Overall though, it's brutally good.. I loved this game. The controls were ****, the story was good, and just everything about it was great... Except for the fact that it has no replay value. I beat it in 9 hours, (I know, I took my time.) And I bought it for $12 so I guess thats alright. But I wanna continue killing stuff as Kratos without doing another campaign. I'm just one of those people that dont replay the campaign on videogames.",this is a decent installment from the franchise. it is still a good story just not very memorable . i like very much the combat sistem even if the story isn't very convincing but apart from that very good . a must-play for fans and newcomers alike.
233.DOA2: Hardcore,"feels like Tekken in many ways, biggest difference is just more sexual characters For 2000 this game has beautiful graphics. I didn't like that it has few characters. I can't understand the rating at the time - in the end, it's just a rip-off of Virtual Fighter that's been polished up to a technical showcase without any unique features worth mentioning, as long as you exclude the creepy sexism and the questionable, stereotype-oriented portrayal of Zack. It's not for nothing that the game has never played a significant role in e-sports, but rather seems to represent a sort of digital rubber doll for middle-aged virgins. The former will be mainly related to the poorly implemented gameplay, which robs the matches any dynamics due to the counter mechanism. The game rewards a restrained fighting style, with the often underworldly collision detection doing its part and ensuring that the input of attacks remains ineffective. This is especially noticeable in the unevenness of the various stages. I find it almost ridiculous to stylize the game into a myth and therefore advise the successful Soul Calibur, Virtual Fighter or Tekken representatives.. A spectacular fighting game that looks absolutely beautiful for being made in 2000. Great mechanics, lovable characters with great designs. This is only a 9 because DOA 2 Ultimate exists. A game that will go down in history as one of the best fighting games to ever exist.. This is my favorite fighter on the PS2, right up there with KOF XI. I have many fond memories of this game, and as it was my intro to the DOA series, it has a lot a value to me. The characters are all excellent and fun to play as, the multi tiered environments and detail in the stages is something to this day that is still extremely impressive, and the combat always feels deep, all while maintaining a flashy, aesthetically pleasing battle experience. There are quite a few modes in addition to learning the ins and outs of different characters by taking them to training mode and seeing how they move, what they can combo, and so on. Great experience, and even to this day, it feels more impressive than the offerings we get in the fighting genre on PS4 and Xbox One.. Still the best Tekken-style game I've ever played. Graphics and move sets are on point.. Great game, though the story lines are short and hard to follow. Excellent graphics and lots of playing options.. DOA 1 was nothing special... DOA2 was better but still lacking... DOA2HC is really good and is what the game should have been... Part 3 was good but the xbox controller blows for fighting games... 4 was terrible as they made counters harder to pull off and that was the whole reason why you played this fighting game over tekken/streetfighter/soul calibur etc etc... It's like if they took knocking people off the map in smash brothers. They essentially killed the best/most unique part of the game by making the counters too hard to use rendering them mostly useless. Attack/block/grab is in every fighting game but the counter system was bad ass. Shame the series drew away from it... Doa2 online had the same prob. Then we got part 5 which also **** in the same way part 4 does. So in short... This is the best DOA game as far as controls go and fun times.. A pretty good game for great graphics given when it was released! The combos you could combine along with counters with even more damage through interacting with the environment was really fun. My favourite characters to play as I think I remember in saying were Jann Lee and Hayabusa. And of course, the gallery was certainly a bonus...","a spectacular fighting game that looks absolutely beautiful for being made in 2000 . the game rewards a restrained fighting style, with the often underworldly collision detection doing its part . the combat always feels deep, all while maintaining a flashy, aesthetically pleasing battle experience ."
234.World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade,"A ton of retcons to the previous story. As someone, who plays for the story, this was the first expansion, who ruined my expierence with this game.. Highly overrated and the start of a ton of retcons. It was fine for it's time, but the Classic version painfully shows how bad the story is and just how overall limited the game is.. The Burning Crusade is one of the most beloved expansions, largely due to nostalgia, in my opinion. Today, it has the worst questing experience, the least amount of story, and some of the most boring dungeons and raids. Its saving grace, in my eyes, is the zones, which still look beautiful even today. But aside from that, there’s little to appreciate. Since I didn't experience too much the expansion until much later, when it had become obsolete, I can’t speak to how good it was back then—only that people loved it. Today, though, it is a different game. This includes the raids, which I couldn’t properly rate, as I ran through them with a high-level character, pretty much one-shotting everything. Still, it's easy to notice how basic the mechanics are (and the lack of good storytelling inside them). I guess the best way to experience the expansion today is by creating a new character, choosing this expansion as the leveling campaign, locking experience before reaching max level, and then coming back at max level to complete the raids after finishing the expansion.. Made further improvements on the core without changing much in experience or gameplay. Just more good stuff and of course flying ;-). People like Bigj69 are completely, incredibly lost. PvParenas were a blast, and so was flying and so was the rest of the content,especially lore. Illidan???!?!?!!? YUP! The raids were amazing, dungeons were amazing, zones were amazing, despite the very annoying blade's edge mountains. And we finally got actual music instead of mostly ambience in vanilla.. A pinnacle of MMORPG expansions, introducing flying and new realms that expanded the WoW universe beautifully.. World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (TBC) is a remarkable expansion that revitalizes the beloved MMO, taking players on an unforgettable journey to Outland. With its immersive content, refined gameplay, and dynamic additions, TBC reignites the flame of adventure, earning a solid rating of 9/10. One of the standout features of TBC is the introduction of Outland, a visually stunning new realm that expands the game world exponentially. The diverse and otherworldly zones, such as the majestic Hellfire Peninsula and the ethereal Nagrand, offer a refreshing change of scenery and provide countless opportunities for exploration. The attention to detail in capturing the unique aesthetic of each zone truly brings Outland to **** also introduces new races and classes, adding depth and diversity to the player experience. The heroic Draenei and the mischievous Blood Elves bring fresh perspectives to the game, while the introduction of the Paladin class for Horde and Shaman class for Alliance allows for greater flexibility and strategic options. These additions breathe new life into character creation and provide exciting opportunities for players to experiment with different **** expansion significantly refines and enhances the gameplay mechanics of World of Warcraft. The introduction of flying mounts in Outland grants players the freedom to traverse the vast landscapes and unlocks new quests and hidden treasures. The refined talent trees and spell balance improve class mechanics, offering a more fluid and satisfying combat experience. The inclusion of new dungeons and raids, such as the iconic Karazhan and the epic Black Temple, provide challenging and engaging content for both casual and hardcore players, ensuring there is always something exciting to strive **** Burning Crusade also expands upon the rich lore and narrative established in World of Warcraft. The compelling storyline delves into the history of Outland and the struggles of its inhabitants, weaving a tale of redemption, corruption, and epic confrontations. Players are drawn deeper into the lore, encountering iconic characters and uncovering the mysteries hidden within the **** world. The captivating quests and immersive storytelling keep players engaged throughout the expansion.Despite its many strengths, TBC does have a few minor flaws. The time-consuming attunement process for certain raids can be daunting for players with limited playtime, and the occasional balancing issues in PvP can lead to frustration. These issues, however, are relatively small when considering the grandeur and overall excellence of the expansion.. Wasn't as good as people's nostalgia let them believe, but it was still a lot of fun.. The Burning Crusade is the first expansion for World of Warcarft. It added a large new area to explore and expanded the level cap. The expansion brought a lot of new and interesting features and generally improved on class viability versus the previous ""vanilla"" version of the game. There were some unusually choices from a narrative perspective given the storylines being continued from the RTS game Warcraft III. Overall, while Burning Crusade removed the ""wholeness"" of the World of Warcraft it was an absolute blast of an expansion.. The best iteration of WoW. Although not perfect (What is?) it's the expansion that has the most amount of pro's and the least amount of cons. Blizzard really managed to make all the classes more well rounded, without going overboard, and pretty much fixed every single major flaw that was present in vanilla. Could had done without flying though, in hindsight.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. TBC was good expansion with raids ,dungeons and atmosphere of Outland....... 10 / 10. People who write reviews after ""classic"" should be banished from ****..This game, this exp, gave many of US a hella of an amount of hours in our childhood. It was magical, fantastic, and fascinating. Don't you dare downrate this! **** THE BEST thing that has ever happened to a MMORPG genre...BEST. p.s playing since march 2007. The introduction of flying mounts in Outland was huge change in the gameplay, ganking was even easier for **** so not that good from this standpoint. I liked new races, and the changes overall, maps where great.. This xp had more things to do in the world like quest and team activity then the base game. Tho never got to any heroic dungons or raid duo i was not a pro raider with uber leet dammage(it was bit hard to get uber leet dammage when i did not get inv. to any heroic dungons to get gear).. Really I don't know that a MMO is ever going to beat this on an expansion by expansion basis for me. Everquest ruine of kunark might be the closest thing to it I can think of.. The expansion that changed the World of Warcraft forever (for better or worse). The introduction of the Blood Elves and Draenei ushering in Shamans for the Alliance and Paladins for the Horde really shook things up at the time. The introduction of flying mounts, arenas, heroic dungeons, true daily quests and smaller raid sizes are popular features to this day. Classic The Burning Crusade is coming soon for those who missed it.. This is the first time this game became almost finished since Vanilla was a broken mess since most classes were mostly unplayable at least for most patches. The world was too linear compared to the original but at least it was coherent. The game has not changed extremely since then at least regarding the basics of PvE and PvP and combat in general.. Really brought World of Warcraft to life. Outland was a fine addition to the universe of WoW and raids became much more fun than in vanilla.. The best MMORPG game ever. A dream come true for warcraft fans. It's a new kind of gaming when you can enjoy a great game while making friends. Still it's for players who enjoy the rpg type, and enjoys getting addicted with all infinite content blizzard has to offer.. I stated playing WoW in BC and this expansion still holds a very special place in my heart.. World of Warcraft BC was my first online game, and I loved it. I tried it out after seeing the ashes of alar flying animation, it just looked so cool. I have always been a **** for magic, elves and dragons and I always lean on the darker side of characters so I went for a Belf Warlock. He was my first and only max level toon.. BRILLIANT EXPANSION. I didn't play a great deal as i was only just getting into the game, but the leveling, capping, dungeons and eventually my dabble at raiding all felt so rewarding.. The best expansion of the best mmo of 2000-2020 period. The memories from this game is real. All the laughs and on some occasion tears to. All the people that you meet and all the people that you touched. In this game we are all keyboard warriors of epic proportion. This expansion brought the fight of the burning legion, the blood elfs and the dranei. Best every!. Just more boredom and grinding in a game that's nothing but. This was also where arena was added, and thus marked the end of balance in pvp, and the start of a FotM roller coaster that would destroy the game.. This is the WoW that i personally miss the most. back in 2007 the game was still fun to play, even if the leveling was a bit too grindy and time consuming. it has been a long time since i quit playing but if blizzard decided to open a burning crusade server today, i wouldn't hesitate to come back to world of warcraft!. Didn't live up to expectations. Appeal wore off quickly. Arenas destroyed PvP. Grindy as ever. Lore was crumbling fast. Some of the dungeons were good. Wasn't worth the $15 a month.. In this expansion I fell in this world... and OMG that world! Nagrand... when I arrive the first time in this place... I only can leave me mouse on the table and observe! This moment for me was epic! And in this moment I said... this this is me game!. After having played almost all expansions, I have concluded that TBC is probably the best expansion ever released in the mmoRPG scene ever. The game speaks for itself, check the cinematic, that is all you want. Too bad that after tbc the too much casualisation policy ruined the game, transforming it into a mindless farming fest with no purpose.... The Burning Crusade is by far the best expansion Blizzard ever released. Perfect quests, raids, beautiful zones, nice leveling. And not to forget beautiful instances like Mechanaar and Botanica. Mmmm, yummy! :). Anybody who really wants to play WoW needs to first build a time machine and go back to January 17th, 2007. What came before that date was a bugged, unbalanced and quite grindy game and what came after The Burning Crusade was a bungle of trivial, repetitive trash, cleverly camouflaged as ""casual"". On January 17th, 2007 though, World of Warcraft was great and would remain almost perfect for nearly two years. Every aspect of the game was still a proper challenge for people with brains, it had been updated in all the appropriate ways and dungeons were hard so that people had to actually learn how to play and cooperate to get through them. In fact it rewarded teamwork, dedication and social abilities across the board, exactly like an MMORPG is supposed to. Playing any other version of WoW than TBC is a flawed experience which is either too time consuming and poorly itemized or a poorly veiled insult to your intelligence. So what are you waiting for? Get cracking on that time machine immediately!. Burning crusade was the best expansion made for wow, but they destroyed pvp with arenas and resilience, and giving shaman to the alliance and paladins to the horde was the biggest mistake they could of done. Nothing differentiate the horde and the alliance now.. World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade is an amazing expansion to World of Warcraft. My favourite thing about the game is the environment, it's incredible. To get to the Outlands from Azeroth is through a portal in the Blasted Lands. Once I got through the portal, it was such a breathtaking sight. The surrounding scenery is about ten times bigger than normal things, there are elites that are huge that roam around the landscape, and the land itself is quite exotic. This is throughout the whole Outlands and it's an exhilarating experience wondering if one of those giant elites will spot you and come for you. The quests are average as expected, the dungeons are pretty good, and there are some PvP areas that can be fun. The new Alliance race, Draenei, have been introduce. The males are decent looking, but I think the females are kind of ugly. The new Horde race, Blood Elves, are a pretty cool race and are my first choice for the faction. It's a great expansion and it's one that needs to be fully explored. I had the most fun in wow during this expansion. It was much harder than the original and felt more rewarding. PVP was great with the introduction of areas, heroic mode instances and some of the best raids of all time!. Just a best WoW expansion. Best raids, best PvP balance. There was no LFR, and people were more sociable. Outland was astonishing and beautiful. Too sad after this WoW has become degraded. Out of all the expansions, The Burning Crusade has always been my favorite. I still get waves of memories when I walk through the burning portal and step into the vast expance that is Hellfire Peninsula.. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 8 out of 10, Fun: 9 out of 10, Controls: 8 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 7 out of 10, Length: 8 out of 10, Re-play: 7 out of 10, Value: 8 out of 10. Best of all add-ons. In my opinion, version 2.4.3 was the heyday of the universe WoW, but then went for the worse ... It is a pity that everything is as it turns out now.. I actually liked the Burning Crusade a bit more or about just the same as the first version. It was a cool game before the 3d version (Lich King) was released... TBC is without a doubt the best WoW expansion pack, and my favorite time playing WoW. This game was a part of my life from 14 years old all the way to my early 20s, and TBC was by far the best. Everything in this expansion was high quality the storyline finished the story of Warcraft 3's greatest character Illidan, as well as dwelling deep into Burning Legion lore. The setting is awesome and all the zones are just amazingly well-done. The new races are my favorite of the whole game, the new instances AND raids were both challenging and memorable, and the addition of arena made the game ridiculously fun. WoW would never again reach the high point of TBC as every expansion afterwards was worse and worse (altho still pretty good).. WoW was at it's peak at TBC PvP was most balanced at the time & Karazhan was fun as and pve content was good overall. Armors looked nice & not like the looks we got these days. thank god for transmog ) Rip wow MOP was truly most worst expansion so far.. A lot of sequels and expansions fall short, because it is just of the same old thing. Maybe that is exactly what BC is considering it just added more of the same thing. Vanilla WOW is clearly the best, but this expansion took it even further. All of vanilla WOW's potential was made active through this new set of dungeons, far bigger raids, and more factions and rewards. The world truly came to life, and the things you did really impacted what happened around the fantasy world.. A solid and enjoyable expansion further expanding the vanilla game and adding to the story. Not quite the same feeling as Vanilla but enjoyable none the less.. Burning Crusade is my favourite expansion in the World of Warcraft universe. Though I wasn't a big fan of the Draenei race (their culture seemed kind of weird to me and a little out of the blue, but I grew to tolerate the), I didn't hate them (though I admit I liked the Outlands and the lore behind it - Blizzard made it work). I absolutely LOVED the Blood Elves - the lore, the architecture, the culture - everything - and they're the main reason I switched to the Horde. I enjoyed the addition of daily quests and dungeons that were rich in lore and provided a challenge that was worthy of the original game. Outlands was artfully done and I really enjoyed the inclusion of PvP in Hellfire Peninsula, Nagrand and Zangarmarsh, which hailed back to the Sithilus and the Eastern Plaguelands in Vanilla WoW. The Isle of Quel'Danas and the progression of its development via player participation, as well as the accompanying dungeons were one of the highlights of this expansion that I will always remember fondly. Burning Crusade was an expansion that maintained the spirit of the original MMO without altering it to the point where it was unrecognizable, as later expansions did. Though WOTLK gave us some fine additions such as Achievements that gave non-hardcore players an alternative way of enjoying the game, Burning Crusade maintained the challenge and magic of the game that I feel has been lost with each expansion that followed.. WoW was a fantastic game in the past. It was filled with adventure, discovery, and most importantly, teamwork. However, the game has been going downhill recently with the release of the new expansion, the Mists of Pandaria. It has become too simplistic, and plays like a console game. There is no sense of accomplishment and adventure anymore. Clearly, Blizzard is now targeting a different demographic - the game is now for kids. If you enjoy paying a monthly fee AND playing with (other) children, this game might be for you.. The best game i ever see.I don't have words.This expansion is my favourite.I have 70 level gnome mage.I am good at battlegrounds and i never killed illidan **** is my favourite **** playing on last wow.. This was the only good expansion for World of Warcraft. When The Burning Crusade ended, an era of free epixx and general pandering to bad players began. TBC got a lot of things spot on. The instances were fun, and large enough that they took some time to go through them. Heroic difficulty was how you expect (particularly at the start of the expac) i.e, takes brains and skill to get them done efficiently. This was the last expansion to have a proper set of armour drop in dungeons. It gave people that do not raid something to aim for, it also gave the collectors and RPers an opportunity to grab some more nice gear for their collection. I probably should have stopped playing after this expansion, it was definitely a high point for Blizzard. The game has rapidly declined ever since.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It was fun when it came out. For some players it was the golden age of WoW. Sadly this part of Wow didn't age well. And this is the part where writers started to change lore and characters. But I remember it too fondly to give it anything less than 8.. ""this expansion was the peak of this game, every raid dungeon was difficult before the ""nerf"" and there was still a level of difficulty involved while having many things available for the casual gamer. This expansion set the perfect balance or the best balance this game has ever had."" I quoted becaus it was my exact opinion. I suppose when I started playing this Expansion set, I felt annoyed by the sci-fi and futuristic scenarios, the super-mega-coloristic weapons and armors everywhere, and the loss of credibility in general (yeah, let's assume that there was some in the original WoW). The fact that 95% of the players at this point of the game (level 50+) are normally focused (only) on empower their characters didn. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Of the 3 expansions so far, I feel that this is the best one by far. The dranei and the Blood Elves fit into the game well and are fun to play as. I also enjoyed the new area and the new factions. However, the new areas added were very devoid of players.. Better games out ****'t be fooled by the new gear, mounts, races its the same thing it was. Instancing, raiding for counless hours It just doesnt compare too the new better mmos coming out in the market. Game hasnt gotten any better quit wasting your money$$$.. WoW will forever be known as 'THAT MMO'. The first MMO to make MMORPGs a mainstream game. It was and forever will be the biggest game of it's generation and forever to come.. Burning Crusade is a nice addition to anyone eager to play more of WoW, of course , with some new , interesting contents the expansions its necessarily important to any person that is starting the WOW mania. Even though, at this time is a little late with the entry of diverse MMO coming and that came recently.. I joined in the midst of the BC expansion so a comparison to Vanilla would be impossible. I remember trying to level up, it was hard at the time and by the time i was leveling everyone else was in the 70's doing HC's, Raiding and PVP'ing. It is not the game you want to play if you are a hermit, despite what people may think, it's a very social game in which players must coordinate in many situations and friendships are built in your guilds. Kara, Sunwell Plateu, The Black Temple... FANTASTIC!. Leveling from 60 to 70 was amazing but end game was broken until first major patch. Still I have a lot of good memories from this expansion. Too bad today experience is so much boosted that you just skyrocket to level 70 and do not experience story of this expansion.. I found this to be the last real good addon for Wow since it only increased the size of the game but left everything else untouched. Meaning for example general game orientation towards target groups and game balance were left the same like in classic wow. The new zones and instances were well designed und fun to play.. Best expansion by far. It had the most original raid content, difficult instances and plenty to do. Sure it was grindy, but this entire game is -- it's an MMO!. I've played this WOW game a long time ago with my uncle, and I gotta say it's not that fun at all. The gameplay mechanics are copied off from Starcraft, only with third person perspective. Too muc laging as well as glitiches. I'm not a WOW nerd, so I don't give a **** about this game. If you like WOW, buy it at your own risk!!!. Best expansion ever but sadly and the end of it Blizz started to cater to bad players (free sunwell quality epix and Sunwell nerf so u could one shot every boss even Kil Jaeden). But neverthenless untill Sunwell this game was at it's prime, HARD 5man heroics, progressive raids so u had to actualy start from Kara to get to Tempest Keep and then Hyjal. Shame Blizz doesn't follow this style of design anymore.. This isn't the most helpful review, but as most others said TBC was the pinnacle of what WoW had to offer. I'm not sure why, but the developers made some drastic, and in my opinion negative changes to the game, and it's never been able to rebound from the first wave of Wrath content.. I would have given the Burning Crusade a 9, but the difficult part about rating these games is, firstly looking at the original vs. expansions. That is one thing, but then you have to look at the client patches and hot fixes. Well, when this first came out it was super challenging. PvP was challenging. There were some balance issues but honestly not nearly as so when Wrath of the Lich King dropped. After that everyone else was nerfed and Death Knights became the new OPed class. Really they say they have taken lengths to balance the game more but honestly I feel it required more skill in Vanilla and Burning Crusade than in the other two expansions. True, some things may have been more difficult in terms of facing other players but I can't help but feel that it was much more balanced in this expansion. Plus many of the things that made all the classes so unique in the first two, were changed in the following expansions, so now there are lots of people with self heals, bubbles (makes them absorb or not take damage for a while), things like that. I miss when I had to use the abilities that were unique to my class in skillful ways to take down the others. Having an advantage balanced by another advantage in some other way. (if that makes sense) Rather than having the same abilities with a different name or slightly different implementation. The instances and raids added during this expansion are terrific and flying just makes travel so much easier. Also the new areas added are stunning in terms of graphics. It was the nerfing and removal of many unique class features that caused it to drop a point on the scale.. This was a great expansion pack, and my favourite by far. I never thought you could fall in love with a video game till I found this. Even if you buy it now, you'll still feel the amazing feeling and epic aura spanning from the outland, it's a sight to behold in gaming and blizzard delivered it perfectly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Burning crusade was defintely a good expansion, the first time i played it i was like wow.. this is really great, a big step up from vanilla the fights in The Burning Crusade were rather fun, you had illidan that said 'You Are Not Prepared' You had outdoor bosses such as Doom Lord Kazzak, Doomwalker... this made certain areas fun... and Doom lord Kazzak was fun also when people tried to kill him i'd fly down and get killed repeadtly so he would heal and eventully wipe the raid, for me Burning Crusade was much better than wrath... Burning Crusade has Cool pvp sets, it had many fun raids, and heroic dungoens. and those dungeons were rather hard.. the amount of skill needed for these dungoens was awsome and how much you needed to think about what was happening in the fight, if your group wasn't good enough then you'd never even reach the 1st boss.. that's what i miss most about the game. i give this game a rating of 9/10. In my opinion this expansion was the peak of this game, every raid dungeon was difficult before the ""nerf"" and there was still a level of difficulty involved while having many things available for the casual gamer. This expansion set the perfect balance or the best balance this game has ever had.","the Burning Crusade is one of the most beloved expansions, largely due to nostalgia . it has the worst questing experience, the least amount of story, and some of the most boring dungeons and raids . it's easy to notice how basic the mechanics are (and the lack of good storytelling inside them)"
235.MLB 10: The Show,"I have to simply say this. This game was one of the greatest gaming presentations I have ever seen for a sports game, from the audio, the bat cracking sounds, the crowd booing you in their state, and even the commentary team as they react heavily towards your play, making villain decisions that can piss them off hard. I could go about the many other features that are in the game such as in game highlights, stat overlays and replays, and visually, could see players react realistically. For my final verdict: MLB 10: The Show was and still is a fantastic video game that successfully replicated everything that you and I love about baseball. If I could pick a PS3 sports game to play for the rest of my life, I’d be more than satisfied with this game. Best gameplay, best franchise depth, and best presentation, help deliver us one of the greatest sports video games of all time. This game transports you to a era where Sony was aiming to surpass Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and destroy 2K by releasing the best possible exclusive MLB year after year, and it was not just a great baseball game for PS3, not just the best sports game for the console, but one of the BEST PlayStation 3 games of all time in general. That statement is why I give MLB 10 a fitting rating of a 10 out of 10! Just a masterpiece that Sony can’t top ever again.. Solid game and it's really fun to play franchise mode. It's hard to hit at times if you don't have a stacked team.. Last original game with legend teams, sadly this has been taken out of the newer games until much more recently and for that reason it adds a lot more depth then the games from 2011 to 2018 in my opinion. Somehow even worse than the previous release and a new leader for the worst game of all time.. The best thing about this game is even if you're not a big baseball fan, (which I'm not, at all) the game is a lot of fun due to all the options and tweaks you can do. For example, Want to change the amount of innings to just 5, 6, or 7 because it starts to get boring after an hour of playing? You can. But then wouldn't the strategy to put in a relief pitcher or pinch hitter be wasted? Nope! Because you can adjust (and save for later games with your buddies) a pitchers fatigue level so that he'll get tired in the 5th inning instead of the 8th so you're still forced to make a managerial decision. Do you like to try and steal bases when your friend's are pitching but get annoyed at how many failed attempts turn into outs and wonder why even bother? Just turn up the players ability to run just a little bit faster around the bases. The level is up to you. You'll still get called out if you're trying to steal with a slow player but at least your success rate will improve with the faster players to make it a more strategic game. It all depends on how far you want to adjust your options. This, plus all the other reasons why this game is good which you've probably already read about, (graphics, commentary, control, etc) are what makes this game so much fun and exciting. There is no equal to Sony's baseball games. At this point, one could probably find this game for no more than $5 used. It's a definitely....a home run.. This game I think is not so good the pitching ****, where you go to pitch it it doesn't go. Also when you go to hit the ball the best way is the power swing which is the square button because when you hit X on good balls they won't swing all the way they stop and strike you out. Also if you have the runners on auto they try to steal the base when t he ball is to close to the catchers and they end up getting you out. Overall this game ****.. I still play this game on a regular basis and I got it right when it came out. Heck if you count the show 09 Ive been playing this series for about about 22 months in a row. This was the only reason I wanted a ps3 and Its been totally worth it. Cannot wait for the next version. At least the mets win the WS in my reality.. I have to be honest here,I love basketball and **** 2k11 I thought was the best sports game ever and it is true except for Mlb 10 the show.I know the two are completely different games entirely but after playing both for a very long time I will crown this game the king of sports games.This game is utterly amazing in every way possible to the point were now I don't want to play any of my other baseball games and I have just about every one that has came out on all systems.When I was younger I used to play Hard ball for the commodore 64 and I loved that game but basically this game is so good it has ruined all other baseball games and one that I don't believe will be topped at least in the next five years.Unless Sony has another trick up there sleeve,what a game!. This game is f*****g awesome, IT'S a hell of a lot better than the PS2 version, I love it. It's so cool how you can call strikes and balls as a catcher. The most realistic sports game ever. Thats all you can say about it. It is sort of fun but sometimes it can get boring. This is made up by all of the game modes and features that this game has to offer like franchise, season, and road to the show, which is when you are a rising mlb star trying to make a team. Overall, This game is alright but it could be better.",baseball 10: The Show was and still is a fantastic video game that successfully replicated everything that you and I love about baseball . the game transports you to a era where Sony was aiming to surpass Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and destroy 2K by releasing the best possible exclusive exclusive MLB year after year .
236.Shadow of the Colossus,"This is a game featuring one of the most enigmatic and awe-inspiring worlds, that you are forced to explore with some of the worst controls and animations in recent history. The shame of this game is that Shadow of the Colossus has what it takes to be one of the best games of all time, and for many it is, but for me the gameplay shortcomings add too much frustration that it ends up distracting from the beautiful environments, haunting ruins, angelic soundtrack, and genuinely interesting boss fights. Your character's animations and choppy. They take too long. You trip over stairs and small ledges. Walking too close to a ledge leads to a stumbling animation which can be cancelled with a jump, but somehow not by simply walking backwards. The jump animation is long and floaty, and you cannot grab ledges until the jump animation has completed, meaning you will sometimes be staring a ledge in the face only to have to wait until your character reaches the peak of his jump to finally grab the ledge. It also means that if you jump diagonally which often happens, you might jump past the ledge because, while you were close enough to it, your character hadn't finished the jump yet and was therefore unable to grab the ledge. The horse. It takes ages to start moving, and comes to a complete stop from the smallest pebble. It turns poorly, and sometimes decides to crawl along the ground at a snails pace. The camera. Do not get me started on the camera. It is never in the right place, it is constantly moving to reframe your view, fighting against your analog stick movements. There already is a function to focus on the boss, so I don't know why they felt the need to program a camera that actively forces a terrible perspective. All of this is frustrating on its own, but then there are the bosses. What should have been the highlight of the game ends up being a mixed bag. Most of the bosses are very fun, and there is a great sense of scale and wonder as you climb up the back of a colossus. But some of the puzzles to kill them are just too long, tedious, or inconsistent. Some are just obtuse. Some bosses take ages to do the correct animations, and some are just bugged. The frustration you will feel with some of these later bosses honestly makes you forget how fun the earlier ones were. And the last colossus is like Getting over it in boss form. The terrible camera and jumping controls come together to make a frustrating climb up a boss that should have been breathtaking. I enjoyed most of these fights, even if some were bothersome, but I think overall the colossi were more fun than frustrating. Just barely. The world ends up stealing the show in the end. The environments and the long, stretches of nothingness led to such a somber yet peaceful tone, that perfectly juxtaposed the battles against the giant enemies. After playing this game I feel like I could be transported to this world and be able to navigate without aid. The design is memorable, and the atmosphere is thick and beautiful. I loved exploring the vast world to find little secrets and pray at the shrines. The world ended up being a brilliant buffer between the action and the story, and it really made the game for me. I want to love this game, and in many ways I do. But in the end I am left wondering if I would have enjoyed it more simply watching it rather than playing. I love the world, I like the bosses, and I hate the controls. Overall, that leads to a positive score, but I think mixing these grading criteria is a mistake. Few works of art are perfect, and they don't succeed at everything. I think it is important to highlight the accomplishments of games, even when they might fail in other areas. This game set out to create an evocative setting, populated by mythical and imaginative beasts, and it succeeded. That is enough to earn it some respect in my eyes.. A hidden gem. The story is quite good. But the highlights of the game are its controls and gameplay. The idea of exploring the world to find the colossus (which by the way are very well designed) seems excellent to me. The controls feel natural, as if you were the protagonist yourself. The world is gigantic, which makes the exploration experience satisfying. Also the way you fight the colossus feels epic and cool. My only negative point is that the plot might get repetitive to some people.. Simply art. Amaster piece in all the meaning of the Word. More that a game It's a life changing experience.. Shadows of the Colossus: One of the Best Games Ever Shadows of the Colossus is nothing short **** masterpiece, easily one of the best titles ever created. This iconic adventure stands out with its minimalist storytelling, relying on its stunning world and monumental boss battles to deliver an unforgettable **** premise is simple yet powerful: a young man named Wander must defeat towering colossi to bring a loved one back to life. The game’s unique approach to gameplay—each colossus a puzzle in itself—blends action with strategy, requiring both precision and patience. Every battle feels like an epic, emotional journey, with each victory tinged by a sense of sacrifice.Visually, the game is timeless, with vast landscapes and hauntingly beautiful environments that add to the atmosphere. The minimalistic sound design and music further enhance the experience, complementing the solitude of the journey.Shadows of the Colossus is a triumph of both game design and narrative, a must-play for anyone who appreciates games as an art form.. Don't play this if you're depressed. I encountered this game on its release on the Ps2 and was intrigued with the unusual design and very iconic premis. Despite its appalling movement mechanics it still stands as a piece of interactive art. Its not often that genuine guilt plays a part in the emotions of the player, but slaying these collossi leaves you feeling disquieted and sad to the point of remorse. The world itself is such a lonely experience that you feel nothing but relief on its completion. This is ultimately a game that will haunt you .....and if you can cope with that, then I suggest you go and play it immediately.. It's a game of 2005 yar, not of 2018 year. The main difficulty of this game is to cope with the controls and the camera. Sometimes it's hard to understand if a character should be able to get there or if it's just bad level design.There was good idea use a small number of mechanics with large number of different enemies. But the implementation for 2018 is just terrible. An annoying game. If i was a player played it at the time of ps2, i would consider the game as a unique product and have fun. But from the point of 2024, i would not suggest anyone waste their time on this game with boring exploration, terrible camera and horse riding, and repetitive procedure of fighting with colossus.. Terrible game, overhyped and overrated. Clunky terrible controls, horse controls like soap, the bosses are just one simple pattern you have to repeat 16 times, story is so boring and bland they could've just let it out.. Going into Shadow of the Colossus, I was completely blown away. The compelling graphics even from a ps2 game remake were outstanding. All the colossi design felt real and enjoyable, and the minimal puzzle design through each encounter added a great mixup to each colossi. Some of the Colossi on my first play through felt outstanding by the gameplay and was a refresh on similar genres to SOTC. And the minimal story helps fit spectacularly into the world and makes the player connect the dots, which proves the story doesn’t always have to be a lengthy and filler plot. And you can’t even get me started on the music, it compels each fight to be a masterpiece. My only real complaint was the camera. The cinematic style of the camera was great, but sometimes I would have trouble controlling it. Apart from that minor criticism, this game was spectacular and I hope I could be blown away again as much as I did with this game. 9/10.. Didn’t have a chance to play before, heard from all over the internet that its one of the best games ever. Finally got it on PS5 and i am disappointed. The only good thing is the graphics, the game looks great. Horse is incredibly stupid to control, camera is just awful, the way it looks when riding is unnatural and weird. Platforming is bad, lots of times character wont grab and hold to the surface and i have to go again. The story is to simple and objectives also.. Genuinely one of the most beautiful and unique videogames of all time. It's a visual masterpiece, the ambient soundtrack is pure magic, and the atmosphere is like no other. I absolutely adore how subtle the story is, the game never really tells you what is happening, or what you're supposed to do. What I really like specifically is how most of the game consists of the player hunting down these unknown monsters that you have no idea what they really are, only for the ending to completely change your perspective on the story, and it hits so damn hard, it's a powerful ending that genuinely made me cry. The highlight of the game is definitely its scale, the feeling of being a tiny human in a world full of gigantic Colossi roaming around the vast yet empty lands is so melancholic and depressing, this game is just dark and not in a way most games are, it really makes you feel like a weakling going through literal hell to achieve your goal, and I honestly love that. I've got to say, this game aged so damn well when it comes to the details, the animations and the art-style, it just looks so gorgeous even for today's standards, but on the other hand, what didn't age well is the gameplay, or should I say, specifically the camera and the controls. This is a very faithful Remake but not in a good way, it's so easy to get lost while navigating the world, which can get pretty damn annoying, and while I really enjoyed the creative puzzles and different ways to bring down the Colossi, some Colossus fights are very frustrating. Shadow of the Colossus is one of the most unique videogames I've ever experienced, it's been decades since the original version came out, and to this day, no other game has replicated what this game did, it's a one-of-a-kind experience that we won't see ever again, so cherish it as much as you can. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. This is a game everyone should try out, truly beautiful world and brilliant gameplay.. This game is a rare gem, the art style and all the unique fights each colossus brings is amazing, the only this game suffers is the control and mechanics, but other than that everything else is a 10/10, especially the music.. I almost feel remorseful giving this game a 7/10, but I can't bring myself to rate it any higher. When this game originally came out, it was almost certainly a 10/10 game, a masterclass in design and unlike anything else at the time. However, compared to the games of the day, and rated as a ps4 game as a remaster, it just does not hold up. Most of the game feels clunky and confusing. The colossi are difficult to find, and alot of the time it feels confusing to fight them. Their weak points feel like they are stumbled upon or brute forced into. I have heard others praise this game for it style, innovation and care put into it. This is the reason the remaster receives even as high a score. while I'm sure the original game deserves an 11/10, this remake does not holdup to modern scrutiny. It is only the afterimage of a amazing game that gives it the 7/10.. This is one of the most disappointing games I’ve ever played I used to be really excited to play it but the controls are so clunky so I immediately quit the game. Really disappointed with the game because the controls of the player, the horse and generally the climbing is so bad and buggy. In this game, you go around a vast, practically barren world, killing multiple giant creatures to save your girlfriend. All because the big light from the ceiling told you to. Other than that, the battles are fun, and sometimes require a bit of thinking to beat them, but it's overall an enjoyable experience. I reccomend it highly.. It’s art for sure, but is it enjoyable? Kinda. Again it looks beautiful but the gameplay is quite rough.. Amazing game, never played before and it’s indeed a piece of art. The boss battles in hard difficulty are brutally awesome, the graphics and sound are superb. Only grip is the controls which are a bit rough but other than that it’s an amazing game.. The game that proved videogames can be art. Masterclass in storytelling, pretty good graphics, astonishing soundtrack, spectacular boss fights, an incredible inmersion, and the best ending in all of gaming.. The PS4 release is good, insofar as it brings this classic to modern systems, but it can't help but feel like the worst version yet. The updated framerate is not enough to save the ugly updated visual direction and the gameplay is no better - if not worse - than it was on PS2 and PS3.. Breathtaking atmosphere enriched in a great story, unique boss fights, perfect pacing, music is incredible. This game is one of a kind and still hold up well despite janky controls. This is a game worth experiencing for all gamers.. I lowkey don't get the ending. Also the controls are janky as ****. Very atmospheric though.. Shadow of the Colossus is fairly good for a ps2 game but it aged like milk in some ways. This remake didn't address 90% of the original's issues, which is great for those who want largely the same experience but w/ better graphics/collectables I guess. Both versions are fun but this game's beauty is constantly marred by frustrating design/control issues. I have a lot of respect for Bluepoint and I don't blame them for not changing things but man, this game desperately needed some tweaks. The game's merits aren't enough to make up for the frustrations.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 6 Graphics: 8 Music: 8 Story: 8 Total: 7.83. the game surprised me, in my opinion the game doesn't explain much to leave you intrigued and want more, there are many details outside the main story to find and that is very captivating, congratulations to the creators.. One of the greatest games of all time. The bosses are the obvious star of the show and are completely worth playing the game for. But the story is also quite underrated and great. Furthermore the game looks amazing and also has some amazing music. The only bad thing is that it feels a bit clunky to play. Go play this masterpiece. This game so so overrated. After hearing nothing but good things about it for years I finally played it and was massively disappointed. The visuals are stunning, the bosses are beautifully imagined but the gameplay is boring, tedious, and painful to say the least. Its an average game with far above average visuals if you're into that.. 'one of a kind experience' type of game. the game was designed to march to the beat of its own drum. it's not something everyone will like but if you find yourself immersed, it can be very emotionally compelling.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. This is a great remake it does everything that made the original great. It has great graphics and gameplay and is very fun overall. just beautiful piece of work. play this game and you will experience amazing adventure.. Probably one of the worst games with a metacritic score that high. The idea is good but the gameplay is terrible with repetitive mechanics, (""intentionally"") empty open world, annoying and often frustratingly annoying boss fights, which are basically all there is to do. The story is very basic with a good premise but nothing more to it. I am somewhat glad I have experience it but very glad to never have to touch it ever again.. If the controls were remodel for this remaster, with would been a 10/10 game.. +Colossi battles are often fun and inventive+Colossi design feels large than life+Paced well+Music adds to build~Music is not always there~Simple gameplay~1 part: Find Colossi~2 part: Stab Colossi~Story is minimal, yet deep~Little direction-Climbing mechanics often make things tedious at times. Just finished for the first time,great game. One of the best games ever made, they dont .ake them like this anymore...whhhicccch is why this remake is a bit uh...glitchy. but still.. Emptiness encapsulated on a PS4 disc. Yeah, it's a highly unique action game with a story only a video game could tell. The end left me in tears, definitely one of the best narratives in gaming.. A tragic tale with immersive gameplay. I played this on my ps3 almost 5 years ago and still very good for a ps2 game. The game in general is beatiful, soundtrack is great and there are many different colossus. The worse of this game is still riding the horse because it's a bit clunky. The first time I played this game I gave it a 9, now, I think it deserves a 7'5 or an 8, but in part I think I lowerd the rating because I already played it and because I used a lot the way to easily beat the colossus on the internet. I know that there is not any project to make a sequel but now, when I finished the game I was thinking that it would really be a good idea to get deeper into the story's characters and the world in a second game. It could be 10-20 years after the ending. That would be awesome!. Perfect. visualy insane. Inappropriate reskin of the original game. Only textures are upgraded, there is no quality of life updates. Slowest response in my life, 30 fps on PS5, outdated control concept . I dropped the game on the 14th colossus when the game literally crushed with nullifying all the progress. The game brings no fun, only pushes you to invent new obscene expressions. If you want to play anything atmospherically similar, just play any Zelda game, even 1986 Zelda is more friendly in terms of gameplay and control.. Shadow of the Colossus is one of those games I've never even heard about it back then but after so much nonstop discourse around it, I picked it up after I got a PS4 Pro but then never bothered to play it again with how busy I got. I can definitely say for sure that was a mistake since it ended up being the strangest masterpiece I ended up playing and I for sure regret not diving into it sooner. The few but key things that made this game work for me and what I believe are the sole reason why it's so beloved come down to the world, visuals, soundtrack, story, and bosses. Starting off, one look at SOTC's map might look like a very barebones map with absolutely no reason to explore it with how there's no side quests, NPC's, side enemies, interesting collectibles, or even any in game events. But that's the entire point since because of how you can only hear is the occasional bird chirping in the air and your horse galloping through the land as you travel and hear nothing else, it gives off a sense of loneliness that you don't normally feel in open world games making you feel like something is constantly off about what you're doing. Plus, it's **** in a way thanks to it's emptiness meaning as you move around the world, instead of talking to NPC's, constantly looking at the map to figure out where to go, finding any collectibles, stare at any UI, or doing anything that could interrupt the experience, the game instead allows you to fully take in the world leaving you both immersed and relaxed as you're riding around. Finally, due to the emptiness of the world, it gives off a sense of mystery that you want to explore to see what you could discover which is exactly what led it becoming a cult classic. Looking at gameplay footage on the PS2 version, I could tell the game pushed that console to it's very limits with it looks surprisingly good nowadays, but the PS4 version is something short of beautiful with how it's so detailed while also keeping the original atmosphere. I came into this game expecting nothing from the soundtrack and on the surface, I wasn't really blown away by it initially as I was taking on one of the colossi, but then as I took it down, instead of heroic and congratulating music, the music gave off a sense of sadness and horrible feelings instead making me feel like I did something wrong hinting of the bigger picture in the future that something was wrong. Speaking of which, the story starts off so simplistic but leads to something bigger at the end and leaves you wondering so much and the fact that not much is said benefits the story since it leaves asking so much stuff even by the time you reach the end credits. Finally, the bosses are easily the biggest highlight of the game since you have 2 weapons and don't improve much aside from health and stamina hence making you feel so weak compared to the colossi meaning you can't just rush in and just go wild with them since that's nothing short of suicide, the colossi are instead an inverted dungeon in a way since you have to use your environment to figure out how to kill them and it's always satisfying to figure out how to kill them, the designs are PHENOMENAL, and when they kill you, the game over screen showing each individual colossi feels like a person's nightmare enhancing the creepiness of the game. Now as much as I loved this game, there were a few but big problems that did mess up my time with the game. Firstly, the camera is a bit clunky and can be a problem if the colossi's limbs get in the way. It wasn't necessarily that hard meaning the speedrun trophy was way too easy. Finally, what ruins it for me is that some of the colossi are pretty unbalanced especially the 11th colossi soft-locking me and left me infuriated instead of frustrated. Overall, this game was absolutely amazing and I can't thank Sony for keeping the game alive with this remake and can't wait to see how this IP will move forward (or honestly, if it's not going to, its fine enough). The graphics are very impressive, the soundtrack is sensational, the puzzles could be better, but the gameplay is frustrating.. Definetly deserves all the praise. One of the most effective games at capturing the loneliness of an open, beautifully crafted world. Heartbreakingly sinister. 10. That was a freaking great game back in the PS2, I couldn't even believe what I was sawing when I played it for the first time. Fumito Ueda really did something, and inspired a lot o people with his work. This PS4 version delivers a visual uplift to the game, but nothing more really - and that is the problem. As much as it looks like a modern game, it doesn't feel like one, and maybe that could have been improved too.. Never play the classic version before, but still... Story Simple story and emotional, great one! Sound/music Well done i guess... Gameplay Gameplay is fine, but I really hate how the camera work... automatically rotate camera sometimes annoying. Horse sometimes not responding, no check point while exploring map... when you died while exploring, whatever you already manually save your progress or not, you'll respawn to the beginning place and you have to re-explore it again. And the final boss's difficult is really too far to compare to the other bosses. Graphic Amazing, great landscape, well-designed old monuments and colossus. Overall Still recommended even tho 6/10. This maybe the best PS game of all time i ever played. Better than these QTE, cutscenes Trash (TloU, GoW).. A beautiful, lonely, wonderful game that is ultimately held back by abysmal controls and camera. I started this game immediately enthralled. Even the empty world has a sense of foreboding solitude that feels bold instead of lazy. The setup feels like an incredible start to a hero's journey. However, the controls make this game nearly unplayable. I've been playing games for most of my life and I'm very competent at them. I could not make heads or tails of the control scheme from very early on. There would be bizarre camera movements just trying to find the next colossus or incredibly broken animations when trying to do the most basic of attacks. When I rolled for the first time, I literally laughed out loud due to how silly the animation looks. Your character literally throws his shoulder into the ground and awkwardly ragdolls back into position. I actually told my wife to look at the screen because of how silly it was. I would be lying if I said this game wasn't anything special--there is absolutely a sense of real magic to it. But I also can't in good conscience recommend anyone spend money (or perhaps valuable time) on a game like this as it currently stands. I don't think an update is coming five years later. But it is an absolute shame that such a widely acclaimed ""masterpiece"" feels nearly as clunky as QWOP or Getting Over It.. The greatest game of all time! From it's unique art design, emotional and powerful story, and soundtrack, Shadow of the Colossus is a phenomenal journey from start to finish with one of the greatest plot twist in gaming history. Each colossus feels unique to their environment. Although the open world can be argued as ""empty"" but it gives the player free range to explore and use their imagination to what the forbidden lands were. This ambiguity adds to quality of the plot. This is one of the games I consider a must play.. Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 9/10; Music: 9/10; Summary rating: 8/10. The atmosphere and visuality are really good but the gameplay is a real struggle. You don't just fight with the giants. You also fight with the camera and gameplay. I would never think riding horse to be this hard. I closed the game after 2-3 hours playing, the gameplay was irritating. I. This game made me apreciate video games as a work of art and not just a way to waste time; very beautifully done the only complain i have is the camera. WTF IS THIS ALL I HAD TO SAY AFTER IVE FINISHED IT? i kinda get it but this game has so much more that i can talk about. First of all the story is incredible right from the start because its so minimalistic u dont know what to expect at all. And the game takes such a sad turn at the end, the bossfights are gorgeous, and the world is so pretty, the atmosphere is great even tho the world is literally empty. Its in my top 10 games of all time, and its not my favorite it is still one of the most unique games i ve played. I know people love this game, but sorry, this doesn't do it for me. I appreciate what they were going for, but the controls have aged poorly (which shouldn't be a problem for a remake) and the game is just kind of boring. The Collosi aren't even fun to fight, which is the only interesting part of the game, whereas the open world is empty and a waste of time. I'm sure some people will say that the emptyness and lonelyness is part of the art here, but it just isn't enough to keep me invested.. Boring game for my taste. The graphics are great, the environment beautiful, but the controls over the horse ****, the camera control **** and the Colossus are easy to kill. The hardest part is to find the Colossus. This game are for the people that like the explorer and contemplate the environment.. Atmosphere and boss battles are completely unparalleled. The art direction is evocative and the very premise is novel enough to be memorable.. It is astonishing to me that SOTC can still be this player unfriendly even after a remaster, the game literally fights you at every turn and **** every bit of potential fun from the experience. The visuals and sound direction are spectacular but neither means anything in the face of gameplay this excruciating.. WTF is this game anyways. All you do is ride around on a horse and climb giant stone monsters and stab them with a pointy sword. I do not understand. What makes this game worse is that there is no cute girls. You would think if the creators wanted this game to sell more, they would try to appeal to the average player. They all want cute girls, everyone knows this.. It's less than ""ok"". Feels like playing a better version of Pong. Same story, equal gameplay. Working on my pile of shame, but this game is a shame and absolutly overrated!. Shadow of the colossus had an amazing soundtrack that accompanied when fighting bosses. The gameplay itself was fun and made you feel insignificant to the titans, what made this great is the ending that hits you out of nowhere.. This is probably the most overrated game of all time. Boring and repetitive, I can’t believe people think this is a masterpiece. Piece of **** game - devvelopers cant even bother to fix the broken climbing section in the first couple of minutes of gameplay but this **** got remastered somehow. The game is boring with an awful camera work and clumsy physics. Landscape is nice, though.. THAT is how you do a remake! Very faithful to the original. Are you taking notes, Squeenix?. i like the feel of the game. the story was confusing in a good way tho and i liked killing big things. Why the **** do people like this game? It is a nightmare to control. The gameplay is absolute cancer. The camera ****, the climbing **** and I love glitching through everything. To get to the next boss you need your horse that controls like person with no arms using their teeth to steer a car. This game is terrible. Why the **** is it rated so high. I dropped this trash after the 4th boss. It is not fun to play at all. Plus the world is so bland and boring.. A huge disappointment. During the PS2 era I had a Gamecube. I really liked it, but always felt jealous about all my friends with PS2. Since then I was told about the amazing games the PS2 had that made it superior. One of them being Shadow of the Colossus. I was honestly very excited to try it. I had already experienced Sony's storytelling on its more modern kins in the likes of The Last of Us or Horizon: Zero Dawn. I was, however, cautious, as I knew this was essentially still a PS2 game. Still through those lenses, I cannot say it's a good game. The controllers (supposedly improved) feel bad, camera is awful, the bosses, while being the best part, were only fun until I figured out how to get on them. I get that it's a game that it's supposed to make you feel sad and guilty, but the only time it managed to do it was nearly the end, and I would call that time just plainly cheating. I cannot help to compare to other games from that generation like Zelda: Wind Waker on the GameCube, the first two Yakuza games on PS2, or even Phantom Dust in the original Xbox, that managed to be better than Shadow of the Colossus on, essentially, every single aspect.. This game is truly beautiful with it's music, graphics and simplicitic gameplay. I really like that it doesn't use the same formula like every other game does where you go up to the enemy and just start cutting them with a sword, this is one of the reasons why this game is so cinematic and beautiful. Every is colossus is very creatively and well made. The only negative thing I can say about this game is that the horse riding feels sluggish at times, but this doesn't really effect gameplay that much is just kind of annoying sometimes.. Always wanted to play this, finally got ported to a system I have, and it was as good as I expected! I recommend it!. Gameplay - 5/10 , controls are sh**, repetitive tasks you get bored after the 4th colossus, i mean they are a bit different, each of them but god damn it gets boring fast even at 6 hours long gameplay it felt long. Story - 5/10 , very generic, your lady is dead, and in order to revive her you need to beat this colossi, that's it. I resumed it with 10 words. Visuals - 7/10, the art of the game is good, and the animations are very well made but even for 2018 game the textures are not that great Sound/music - 8/10 Fun - 5/10, because of bad controls and repetitiveness the game overall feels longer than it is and you'll get frustrated at some point because of those things Still better than The Last Guardian, which was almost unplayable.. Stunning visuals","this is a game featuring one of the most enigmatic and awe-inspiring worlds in history . the game has some of the worst controls and animations in recent history . most of the bosses are very fun, but some of the puzzles to kill them are just too long ."
237.Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3,"This game is genre defining amongst platformers. Extremely concise controls/actions with a gorgeous coloring book background that holds up surprisingly well amongst modern games. I replay this game almost once a year, and don't see that changing anytime soon!. There is no Game which give me Gossebumbs evertime i play it like Yoshi Island. It is the best Game. No Game ever will compete. I can play it anytime and never be bored, because of the great Gameplay, Artstyle, music, enemies etc.. A very fun game, full of imagination and cool things to do.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's Super Mario so you know what you're going to get; another great port of a SNES classic.. the platform super mario game as is knowledge with a little different gameplay, it is yoshi's time. Yoshi's Island, the one that kicked off the Yoshi series. The long levels encourage exploration, and the story is interesting. Lots of secrets and amazing art. The GBA port fares well as well.. This game is very good. The art style and colors are amazing, the gameplay is great, and the music is fantastic. The only thing really bad about it is that dang crying baby. Apart from that, great game.. This is Yoshi's first port game for Game Boy Advance. The gameplay is a Mario mixed with Kirby and some more unique aspects of this franchise. The game starts extremely easy and more towards the end it has some very challenging moments. Star Mario adds a nice gameplay diversity, but unfortunately it is little used. The game also has some morphs that bring a good diversity. The story is basically a pretty stupid fan service but it does its job. The soundtrack is good and unique but too repetitive.. I really love this game. The gameplay is 1 to 1 with the original Yoshi's Island and is so fun. 10/10 Would recommend.. Classic game boy Advance game with a great story. Simple yet effective game play with small puzzles here and there I believe 2nd/3rd best Mario Game in the game boy Advance i would highly recommend it!. Yoshi's Island is one of the most unique and colorful platformers I've ever played. The gameplay is simple. Yoshi must protect Baby Mario at all cost. If Yoshi gets hit, Baby Mario will be flung off and you must save him before he gets kidnapped by the minions of Kamek. This game has a load of enemy variety. Every level feels different from one another, which is always a plus. Yoshi can now transform into vehicles at certain points. The vehicles have a time limit though. This game has a great amount of charm. The bright colors and catchy tunes really seperates this from other titles on the SNES. The amount of detail within the spritework really shows that the developers went out of their way to create something truly special. In conclusion, Yoshi's Island is a platforming masterpiece that all Mario fans should try. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. When I was a kid I didn't own a SNES so I couldn't play this game on its time, now, the years have come, and as an adult, sadly I find a lot of issues within this game. The first thing that came to my mind while playing this game and a thing that was so hard to get past, is that this isn't a Super Mario game, or at least not in a conventional way, the controls are tight and responsive but the level design is frustrating and unintuitive, it has some verticality and a puzzle design that simply doesn't work, and a lot of times you'll find yourself just wandering around in circles because of its maze-like environments, the navigation is not that fun, but what makes it more annoying is the baby mechanic: if an enemy or projectile hits you, automatically Mario will be floating on an erratic bubble, and if you don't touch him in a specific set of time, you'll lose that life, in theory, this will be fun and challenging, but given the number of projectiles, annoying patterns and enemies that came out of nowhere it seems more like a cheating mechanic to make it more ""challenging"". As I said before, this is not a Super Mario game, so you can't advance the stages at a speedy pace if you like, instead, you regularly find stages that put you in a platform that automatically navigates the stage while you avoid things, sometimes they're a little challenging but more often than not they're too boring, and if you for some reason die on any part, you have to restart from the very beginning, it may sound like I want an easy challenge or a lot of checkpoints but the fact that you have to wait instead of jumping and running in a platform, it really kills the mood. Although almost my entire time was painfully in this game, there are certain commendable things like the soundtrack, each song it's pretty good and has a lot of memorability and style, the only bad thing is that there are few songs, so you'll listen to them more than necessary. The art direction is an obvious thing to praise, and with good reason, it is simply beautiful and stylish, not only the sprites are great but it seems that they recreate the concept art on point. Finally, the thing that I enjoyed the most, were the boss fights, they sweat creativity and exploit the particular art style to the point that makes you think how this game doesn't have more bosses than stages. As a little side note I loved stage 6-7 it felt quite a lot like a great platformer and it was challenging and fun, if only the other stages were more like it... Sadly, Yoshi's Island wasn't what I've expected, at a glance at this review it may be that I didn't grasp the mechanics but I'm pretty sure that it was more a design issue, nonetheless, I can hardly recommend it to anyone who likes Super Mario games or platformers in general.. Turns Out Sidekicks Can Do Well On Their Own Yoshi’s Island is proof that sidekicks can have a great game on their own.. Easily one of the best GBA-Games. Got it very cheap back then in a second-hand-shop for 10 €. Lucky me. I literally spent month playing this game. It was (and still is) so awesome! It's also super challenging for young ""gamers"", at least it was for me. Great gameplay, great level-design, fantastic soundtrack, funny mini-games and even more funnier bosses. Great world and really every level is totally different. Sometimes it was a bit frustrating for my younger self but that is all the negative stuff i can mention.. Super solid platformer that has some similarities to the super mario games but also has a host of other features that make it quite unique. The egg throwing mechanic, the jump, etc. all feel good and are utilized well by the excellent level design.. This is in all honesty is one of my favorite games of all time the colors the music, the gorgeous backgrounds. Mesh perfectly with the fun and innovative game play. The charm of this game is unmatched truely a classic of all ages ,and In my opinion this is the best Super Nintendo Game. Unbelievable plataformer. Perfect at every single detail, is so fun the attract every player to beat 100% of it. Deserves more attention fro the gaming crowd.. Game: Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island Genre: Adventure/Platform Developer: Nintendo System: GameBoy Advance (GBA) Total Score: 97/100 Value Score: 97/10 • Story: 10/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 10/10 • Graphics: 10/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 10/10 • Length: 10/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +More secret levels added to gameplay +UI has changed for the most part and looks more appealing than the original version +Some levels have been re-designed and better designed than in the original version +A overworld map was added +Additional sound effects have been added such as when Yoshi jumps for an example. +Wording and text have changed and been improved +Mario bros added as secondary game Cons -Some mini games were missing due to the lacking of the number of GBA buttons -Sound effects and the music's tone was dumbed down due to the lower quality of the GBA. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my all time favourite games and this is about as good a port of it as I can possibly imagine. Right up there with other Mario platformers, this is a must play. You'll be **** in to the island and all its character and charm. Another great platformer for the GBA. Don´t think it´s easy, because it cute looking with the crayon art style, no no, the later levels and boss levels are filled for traps just to get Baby Mario for preventing stomped Goombas. Music, Gameplay, Art style,many and great levels, it´s all there!. Yoshi is one of the only characters in gaming that was introduced as a pet. Yoshi will always be Mario's pet regardless of how may times Nintendo puts him in there other titles. that been said Yoshi's Island is really fun, the style of that game is something straight out of a pop up book. The enemies are all shy guys and for the most part they are just silly little road blocks. The music is very iconic, sounds like you are not on the quest to save baby Mario but instead just on a walk to the park. Its a really great game for a handheld device that was mostly used for Pokemon. Recommend this game one hundred percent, this is a great game.. Solid platformer and excellent port of the SNES classic, gets repetitive after a while, but still a very fun game to play, especially on the go. Graphics are retained close to its SNES counterpart and the colors are as vibrant as ever, I really praise the art style they used back then and still use now, very waterpainting like. Controls are very responsive, much like any Mario game plays. Gameplay is your basic run-of-the mill platformer, anyone who ever played a Mario game is right at home with Yoshi in their hands, when you finish the game, you revisit past levels to collect any missed red coin/flower, which in turn opens up bonus levels which keep you coming back for more. All in all, Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, is a perfect port of the SNES classic, brings everything you loved back and even adds extra sprinkles on top!. A perfect port of the SNES gem. While not the greatest platformer ever made it is certainly one of the greats. Offers great gameplay, huge worlds and one of the best boss fights ever.. This was my favourite game as a child on the SNES and I still play it on a weekly to monthly basis. The rules are simple, the gameplay is fluid and you can skip tutorials (the little speaking boxes) if you already played it. The only complaint that I could have is that it's too easy, but the boss levels and getting a perfect 100 score makes up for it. This is probably my favourite platformer ever, being followed by Super Mario 3.. This review is for the SNES version of Yoshi's Island, that is the one I owned, as you can't rate it on metacritic (put snes games back plz). Yoshi's Island was a follow up to Super Mario World, and set aside the crying mario this game was very good. The levels were fun and in it was rewarding to try to clear 100% on them. The artwork was actually pretty neat for its time and the bosses were really cool. All around I enjoyed this game very much when I was younger, can't say the same for Yoshi's Story though, YIKES!. This is game of my childhood. And I still think it's masterpiece and in my opinion best 2D platformer ever. The best thing about Yoshi's island is difficulty. Even though it's game for children secret and extra stages are really challenging (creators got little bit overboard with Endless world of Yoshis). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the five games on Super Nintendo that I was obsessed with when I was a child; I never had the chance to own it or complete it, until getting the port of it on GBA, and I finally played the game in its entirety, and I love it, it is one of my favourite games of all time. Easily one of my favorite games and my #4 Best Game Ever in my opinion, this game has excellent graphics, sound, challenges, and level design. I would've welcomed multi-player for the minigames, however.. An excellent port of one of the funnest 2-D platformers to date -- if Super Mario World is the best, then Yoshi's Island is certainly the most innovative. Pros: Excellent graphics, control, and audio; rich, colorful level design; lots of mini-games; Yoshi and Baby Mario are ridiculously charming. Cons: The difficulty is often frustrating, resulting with a lot of Baby Mario cries; multi-player is secondary.. This is the second best game I've ever played. Fantastic graphics with a lovely art style with pretty backgrounds, brilliant composed music which really fits the games various environments like the caves or the bosses castles, smooth and varied game play and imaginative and comically designed characters to battle make Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island an absolute must buy for any platformer fan!",this is Yoshi's first port game for the game boy advance . the gameplay is 1 to 1 with the original Yoshi's island and is so fun . the soundtrack is good and unique but too repetitive .
239.The Longest Journey,"This is not a game. It is a masterpiece of digital art. Incredible story + fun + great game dynamics + not so bad graphics. Probably this game changed my perspective for point & click adventures. A must try for everyone.. you have the feeling your are in an interactive movie and not in a game. the game itself consists of some outraged and poorly creative puzzles . probably many of you need to look up the solutions. dialogues are lenghty and boring after a time in this inflated fantasy world. End of 2021. I got a decent hardware: RTX 2070 and Ryzen 5 3600 and I played this game without any additional HD mods or whatever exists out there, it was a raw experience. I thing this might be one of my favorite games. You can just feel the effort and love that went into it and I'm really, really grateful for this game. I don't know if this is a relevant information but I just wanted to note that I'm 20 so it's not some kind of nostalgia because my parents weren't even planning on having me when this game came out. So yeah, I want to say ""Thank you"" to the developers and the whole staff. I'm especially grateful for the voice acting team that did an amazing job and made the whole world feel more alive. Again, thank you.. I’ve never been a huge fan of point-and-click games (which I associate with absurd puzzles getting you stuck in a middle of somewhat good story - infuriating) and, honestly, till now I hadn’t heard a word about this game. Apparently though, it is one of the genre’s classics and one of the best point-and-clicks of all times. This was how it was pitched to me by a friend (an enthusiast of such games) and we ended up playing it together. And boy, was the journey long… TLJ is the first game from Funcom, a Norwegian studio, released in 1999. And you can clearly see it’s 22 years old: low poly models, prendered backrounds etc. The visuals are not hideous though, it’s just clearly visible it’s an old game. Classic, creepy FMVs are also there, don’t worry. My experience with this renowned classic started with manipulating the game’s files. Because, unfortunately, as Windows 10 is not able to run old stuff properly, clicking mechanism in the game was completely broken, making TLJ unplayable. Fortunately, this wasn’t only my problem and after going through a short tutorial, I managed to somehow fix it. SOMEHOW, because clicking was still broken but a bit less. Welp. Nevertheless, we jumped into the story and initially I was sure it’s a kind **** keeping game, that is supposed to keep the noobs out of the point-and-click business. One of the first puzzles is 1) timed, so good luck with broken mouse clicks 2) so abstract that unless you follow a walkthrough, trial and error seems to be the only method to solve it. Luckily, a veteran was supporting me – and after making it to the 4th chapter (out of 13) the plot actually started to be intriguing and my annoyance dropped down a little. Nevertheless, I wasn’t mind-blown: TLJ tells a story of a teenage April Ryan, destined to save the balance between two worlds – Stark, a world of science and logic (which apparently is “our” world) and Arcadia, a land of magic and unlimited possibilities chaos. Why? Because if they are not balanced, bad things will happen. That’s basically all there is, and cool cyberpunk motives appearing during Stark levels do not improve it much. Neither do loads of cheesy lines and unfinished subplots. By no means is the story bad, it’s just pretty generic. The writers apparently tried to develop it a bit but it’s just another epic world-saving scenario. Except for some ridiculous puzzles, quest solving can be absorbing and that is what keeps the player with the game. A player like me, of course – I bet point-and-click fans can find all they need in TLJ. Once again, I’m grateful there was another person playing with me: otherwise I’d quit it pretty quickly. What was driving me crazy was the inconsistency of game mechanics. Sometimes to drink a potion you have to use it on yourself but sometimes you just click the button from the drop-down menu; sometimes to ask your companion for a favor you have to talk to him but sometimes you use him (!) on an item that needs to be interacted with etc. I was getting stuck frequently not because I didn’t know what to do but because the game couldn’t decide how it wants to run its UI. Also, as in all games of this genre you are offered a ton of dialogue options, yet your choices don’t really matter – if you don’t hit the right one at first, you just keep talking till nothing remains. And as much as I like listening to stuff in games, the awareness of total linearity was a bit disappointing. I guess this wasn’t a game for me – but I understand how it was a milestone in genre development. That aged a bit too much, unfortunately.. I never really liked this game as much as everyone else did. Yes it does have an interesting - though not terribly original - story and at least some of the characters are also interesting. Especially April is excellent. Also, the backgrounds are quite nice to look at and the ending is especially good (and completely unexpected). But this is were the good stuff ends. The puzzles in this game are downright terrible. Arguably the worst in any adventure game and I am not only referring to the now infamous inflatable ducky puzzle. Puzzles require leaps of logic and can mostly really only be solved through trial and error. Also, so often you really have no idea what you should be doing or that there is a puzzle there in the first place. It gets slightly better as the game progresses, but not much really. Then there is the length. The Longest Journey is indeed Long! Too long!! Mostly because the story is extremely stretched-out. Moreover, everything in this game is slow: the character animations are slow, the walking is slow and much of the speaking is slow as well. This, combined with the puzzles, makes the game just a chore to play. Finally there is the character models. Boy do they look HIDEOUS! Both in-game as well as in the cut-scenes characters look like drugged-out alien zombies. April herself is actually the worst offender. She even looks bad on the box art. Cannot imagine how somebody thought this was acceptable, even back in 1999. So there you have it. While this review may sound overly negative I would still recommend this game, but only for it's story - and for the sequel(s) that follow it.. Very good game! Usually not into point and click genre, but I love The Longest Journey. It definitely has something.. This is an old point and click adventure; there is a HD mod available for better graphics. You can get this game cheaply on Steam. It has an interesting story, great voice acting, and fantastic character development. April Ryan is a protagonist I will always remember. Some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse, but you can always use UHS hints system rather than spending days getting frustrated at bad puzzle design. There are 2 sequels (kind of sequels, but more really separate games). They are not nearly as good, and don't really have any proper puzzle solving elements. If you enjoy point and click games/ puzzle solving adventure games, play this game, and probably avoid the sequels.. A beautiful story much better than most of today's boring new games like The Witcher 3 or The last of us. I got to play this game around 15 years after initial release and it still managed to become one of my favorite games. Amazing story and voice acting is what made me fall in love with TLJ and it got me involved in point and click adventure genre. Finished it in 2020, used a mod that makes graphics more modern. It's a good game ... but not as good as people refer to it. It got boring a lot. I could predict a a lot of the end game adventures and that is really really BAD for an adventure game if you know by intuition what will happen next.. One of the best adventure games I have experienced. Great story, interesting characters and a gorgeous world. The Longest Journey is a good recommendation for a Fantasy/Sci-Fi fan.. Pros.: - Story. It's absolutely fantastic and advanced for that time. It is almost the same level of story telling as in the Blade Runner from Westwood. - Unlike many other things, I appreciated diversity here. The setting was encouraging it. And made more gigs for the gameplay. - Music. Absolutely stunning. Dragon is among my favorites now. - When you play you can FEEL the flow of time, the passion of the developers. It's magic itself. Magic of those great games created in the '90s. Cons.: - As usual with the adventure games closer to the end it's becoming too simple; - Graphics are out of date and not updated in Steam. There are fan packs with texture updates and so on. But still nothing changed. Pity; - There is a crash coming to the police station. Still not fixed; - The font crash after quitting the game and font disappearance after alt+tab. Minor cons. Game is 10/10.. The best old school adventure game. It is creative, introduces an interesting world and the ending felt just perfect, so yeah it's got a story as well :) masterpice. Avoid the sequels though. Even though the graphics have hardly aged well, this is still the best of the bunch.. I completed this game and never got the appeal and hype. There are plenty of better adventure games from around the same year or even years before it.. Incredible old school point and click graphic adventure. Ahead of its time and a mandatory purchase for fans of the genre.. I wanted to play the trilogy in the right order so I started with this one. It's old and the few 3D objects look like crap but that's too be expected for a game this age. The gameplay is a straightforward point & click adventure with a long and pretty good story but nowadays games are more accessible to the not so die hard gamer and help the player a little more. I have become used to that and I no longer have the patience to search every corner of the gameworld to be able to continue the story. So I used a walkthrough. One minor annoyance is that April (main character) doesn't run that fast and there's a lot of running around that you can't skip... Awesome! The Longest Journey - the greatest point and click game ever made.﻿. This game has a lot of good reviews, so I was curious about it. Nonetheless some magazines gave this game only average scores. And I also think, that The longest journey is only a good game, but not a masterpiece. First of all the atmosphere, the settings in a fantasy and sci-fi world and the story are top. Even today I could get into the world very easily and I was curious to find out more. I guess this is why many people like this game so much, but they ignore some big weaknesses of the game: It is hard to implement an interesting and complex gameplay in a point and click adventure and this game has the same problems. Some puzzles were even frustrating and a walkthrough is necessary. I am surely not the only one. And yes, sometimes this game feels like an interactive book, not a game. In addition you need to go back to known places so often, what is a big and annoying timesink. Another annoying timesink is the amount of text you need to read. It is so ridiculous, way too much, they could write the dialogues more tight and we could save a lot of time. In addition the dialogues were so naive, boring and stupid. This was the biggest motivation killer and the main reason, why I stopped to play it before the end. I need to mention also, that I couldnt fix the resolution, so it was only 640x480. In addition I couldnt implement any widescreen fix. In all other old and famous games I could change and raise the resolution. There are even more technical problems, look at the TLJ pcgamingwiki site. There are much better old adventure games outside (Zack McCracken, Manias Mansion, Monkey Island and so on), play them instead.. The Longest Journey is very big and epic adventure game. The plot is might not be that original and the ending leaves a lot of questions unasked, but colorful characters, great dialogues and superb voice acting make the story much more amazing than it might look on paper. Graphics are very outdated, but prerendered backgrounds are still gorgeous and imaginative. Backtracking is a bit too slow because of the scale of the world, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, The Longest Journey is very memorable experience and worth playing even today, 18 years since its release.. Great game. i have spent a lot of time on this title. It has a great story with memorable characters. Good gameplay and best cut scenes with good dialogs.. The Longest Journey is an amazing story adventure game and perfects the point & click genre. In terms of story, the game excels and the world is equally incredible as it incorporates both sci-fi & fantasy elements. The Longest Journey is imaginative in its way of creating a diverse and unique universe filled with lore and characters that remain memorable. April Ryan is fantastic as the game's leading protagonist. She is well written and stands out as a main character. The world is truly great from the moment the player enters the futuristic world of Earth, being set about 300 years into the future. Sci-fi alone is done so well in this game and so is the fantasy aspect inspired by classic medieval lore with a fantastical touch. While filled with great lore and characters, the adventure filled game play can seem slow at times due to April's walk speed and this requires a bit of patience. This may be a problem as it can make the game experience seem a tedious one. Nonetheless, despite this The Longest Journey features amazing voice acting and dialogue coupled with a very well written script. This game is a true classic and really is one of the greatest adventure games ever made; nothing since has really compared to the degree of detail evident in the game's story structure and lore. Scale-wise, it is a series filled with imaginative lore containing creatures and characters from different worlds and backgrounds. This all combines to make an outstanding story adventure. The Longest Journey is the first of the Dreamfall series and anyone interested in fantasy, or sci-fi with an emphasis on narrative should definitely experience this game.. For the first and last couple of chapters of this game I was engrossed. Much of the dialogue feels natural, the relations between the characters real, the world and lore fleshed out- as a story or film, I think I would have loved this game. I could talk for ages about the story potential and world building, more than what the character limit allows for sure. As a game however, it runs into a few of the issues common to click and point adventure games- frustratingly slow puzzles that require running back and forth over the map, or going through all your items to find out what will work, or having to run the character through the hints to a puzzle you've already figured out but can't complete until she does, or just repeatedly spamming conversations with people until they give in and do as you asked. There were definitely a few times where a puzzle seemed forced in just for the sake of it and didn't add anything to the game but frustration. Some puzzles felt more intuitive and made sense in the context however, and I did enjoy the game despite the occasional frustration of trial and error puzzles. The game was also kind in that it tells you when an item can be used, by having it light up when hovered over something else, rather than have you madly bash all the items against each other and the environment until something sticks. I also, personally, did not like the main character much, or the reoccurring sidekick later on. April to me felt like someone who wasn't considerate of others, had a habit of inane comments, and wasn't as fleshed out as some of the side characters. I realise part of this was because of design (the character needed to have something basic to say on random things clicked, or ask sometimes obvious or irritating questions to make sure that the player had all the info needed) and the fact the main character is an 18 year old art student who's personality is 'snarky'. This is definitely more down to personal taste, although it did spoil the game for me sometimes when I felt so at odds against the main character, although this may be due to me being used to modern 'choice' games where the main characters are the player, instead of individuals the player is following but needn't fully identify with. Still, this game has concepts and content ahead of it's time, and really blends the fantasy and sci-fi aspects together well, and as mentioned before, as a book or film (more likely a book) this would have done well. Making it into a game, however, didn't add anything to it. There was no part of the story that needed to have a game mechanic to really enjoy, and the puzzles often slowed the story down instead of enhance it. Also, while I'm normally a person who fully engages in 'lore' games and love world building, I found The Longest Journey's method of mandatory story telling rather tiring. You HAD to sit and listen to a tale carefully, or go study texts, in order to have any idea of what you were doing (even though the main character would still often act as if they hadn't heard the same information as you), or just spam esc, skip the conversation but sit through the unskippable animations, and read it in your journal later like a script. The voice acting was amazing and most of the dialogue well written, but at points (especially in acardia) you were lore dumped and it wasn't so much that you were seeking out this info for your own enjoyment, but that it was just that you had to exhaust every dialogue option possible for some puzzles to be solvable whether you knew the solution or not. I much prefer to seek and read info at my own pace and choosing instead of sitting and listening to a character explain the political climate and history of a different world because it's probably needed to progress the story. Probably- but it's easier to ask all the questions now, rather than learn you need to walk back through x number of areas to ask it because it turns out you did need to ask it. I would recommend this game, certainly as a classic and just as a genuinely good game. It's dated, yes, but if you're going to play an older game graphics and mechanics are a thing you just accept won't be as good as some of the modern games. The story is amazing and the game world fascinating. However, I would recommend it with a little hand waggle, as it suffers as most click and point adventures do where most of the game can be tediously drawn out by unneeded puzzles and fetch quests.. I really wasn't able to continue playing this game, I've never played it before, to the point I searched everywhere for rankings and opinions trying to understand if I was misjudging it. I think I'm not. The first impressions pointed me to the illogical puzzles I was going to face during the game. The first one pictured me that. I hate games with illogical puzzles and I hate pretentious games. The 1st Alone in the Dark is a masterpiece, the 4th resembling this one is a pretentious bull evacuation. Grim Fandando and Sanitarium among many others (Captain Blood, Botanicula, Machinarium, The Last Door, Myst, Riven, etc.) belong to the top. I should try playing it, but what can I do...? It doesn't appeal to me!. This is an excellent game for its time, rivaled only by Blade runner by Westwood Studios. It presents a game that lives up to it's name, with over 100 hours of play time, this is truly ""The Longest Journey"" of it's genre. The story is highly captivating, the scene is believable, it just draws you in and doesn't let you go. The only draw back that I can see is that some of the puzzles are bordering on very difficult to slightly absurd. I found myself playing through the game with a guide more frequently than I dare to admit. All in all, for it's time this was a astonishing point click adventure, and still to this date holds up as one of the best point click adventure games - if not the best, which was ever made.. Classic game that while slightly out dated now is a must play for point and click fans. Amazing story and world pulls you through a great and unique experience.. I have not felt compelled to write a review since playing ""The Cat Lady"" since no game has really appealed to me that much. Let me just get this out of the way beforehand. Yes, the graphics are incredibly horribly outdated. What do you expect from a game that came out in the year 2000? That being said, this has to be one of the most charming and easy to love games I have ever played. The dialogue is superb and the amount of sarcasm and witty retorts from this game will never go out of style. If you want to play a game with a fantastic story and some of the best dialogue known to mankind, I can't recommend this game more.. Created in the late 90's, The Longest Journey is a classic from the golden age of point-and-click adventure games. It is filled with great ideas, interesting well written characters, and a wonderfully immersive world for players to dive into. If you are a gamer who cares about a great story in your games, this is one not to miss. The game play, as you would expect, is of the classic point-and-click type, mainly focusing on talking to various characters, picking up and interacting with various objects, and using those objects in various combinations to solve a range of puzzles to progress the story. In truth, many of the puzzles in this game are obtuse to the point of being annoying, but there are plenty of walkthroughs around if you don't want to beat your head against them and want to simply enjoy the wonderful story. Given that the game was originally released in 1999, its graphics have aged quite badly, even through they were lauded at the time for being pretty cutting edge. Fortunately, point-and-click adventures do not depend heavily on fancy graphics to be playable, so its not a gamebreaking issue. The music and voice acting however, stand up very well, and once you get used to the dated graphics the game remains immensely enjoyable. Given the insignificant price you can get this game for these days, its well worth the investment if you love a good story.. Wonderful, simply wonderful game adventure game! Definitely a masterpiece which would stay in my heart forever. It has a few (minor) problems and unfortunately is not completely playable to modern gamers, but I'll try to review it as objectively as I can! Plot: without a doubt the strongest point of the game! The Longest Journey tells you about April Ryan, a teenager which got entwined in the complex story of Stark - the world of science and logic, the one we know, Arcadia - the world of magic and wonders which exists in parallel to ours, and The Balance - which is in between the two worlds. The balance between the two worlds gets corrupted, putting in danger both worlds. The story goes far beyond that, with some twists and turns, and is also quiet deep. A little complex at times, yet that's what makes it so interesting! Settings: The game takes place in the far future (23rd century if I'm not mistaken). It therefore has sort of sci-fi settings, with a futuristic version of our world on one side and the magical world of Arcadia on the other. The characters have depth and some are even memorable. The futuristic version of our world is rather believable, and the world of Arcadia is very well-crafted and actually lets you explore a whole new world, including its folklore, tales, histories and different nationsspecies. The game's setting is very well thought and detailed, which adds a lot to the main story and make the game even more interesting! Add the amazing writing and the outstanding acting and you got yourself a Masterpiece. Gameplay: The Longest Journey has the classic point and click interface. You collect items, combine and use them in order to solve puzzle, and keep exploring and examining your surroundings, talking to the people around you... The puzzles are pretty original and interesting, not too ordinary and yet I found most of them quiet logical. I (almost) never found myself thinking ""damn, I would have never figured it out myself!"" (except for that rubber ducky puzzle in the biginning!) One little thing that annoyed me though, there wasn't always balance between puzzles and dialogues, where I think there should have been. You can, at times, find yourself talking with people, more and more, without messing with the inventory at all, while at other times there's almost no dialogue and many puzzles to solve. Graphics: The graphics are generally beautiful, the game uses 3d models which move over 2d backgrounds, and while the models are usually ugly the backgrounds are amazingly beautiful and nice to watch and observe. Even by simply checking the game's artworks you can see there was much though put in that. Still, the graphics are limited and the game runs in a pretty low resolution (like many games from the nineties) Sounds and music:TLJ features a beautiful, magical soundtrack. Still, unfortunately, I felt the game lacks music. The game's soundtrack lasts for about a hour, and was used in the game only occasionally for short bits. I really like music in video games, and therefore was sometimes disappointed with this aspect. It's nothing critical though, because there are great sound effects and background noises which always correspond greatly to your surroundings, the the sounds&soundtrack are still done pretty well. Compatibility: This game is rather old, and I still managed to run it on 3 different computers, which were all modern compared to this game, with almost no problems at all. So you're still able to play it on modern machines even nowadays without much effort. Test of Time: Unfortunately, the game is not as approachable as it was on its release. Many modern gamers would stay away from it, as it greatly centers on dialogues and story. There's a lot of content which isn't even relevant to finishing the game. TLJ requires a lot of your time, attention and patience, and even I couldn't always stand it while playing it last week. It was different when I first played it, many years ago, but nowadays players don't have so much patience as before. Modern gamers are ususally looking for things they won't find in this game. Add the dated graphics which by today's standards are terrible, and you get a game which is unfortunately fully appreciated mainly by those who played it back when it was fresh and new, even though storywise it's a great classic! In short, this game is almost perfect, but is unfortunately not for the impatience or seekers of quick-paced adventures, as this one takes its time. If you only let it, it would tell you one of the most wonderful tales told in the video-gaming world in the last two decades.. This is my absolute favorite of all the point and click adventure games. It's so incredibly good in every way. The story is incredible, the characters are vivid, the locations colorful and full of eye-catching beauty. I love the mystery of this game, how it slowly gets you deeper and deeper into April Ryan's world, step by step, never leaving you bored. I remember playing this as a ten year old after school, totally blown away, couldn't even get my homework done, haha! You've been warned! :). The Longest Journey was quite literally the pinnacle of my experiences from gaming since i started playing games back in 1992! The game does have its shortfalls, the mechanics are a touch clanky, some of the puzzles are silly, but I have never gotten so completely engrossed in the story and characters **** as I did with the Longest Journey. The game is now 14 years old, so if you are after the latest and best graphics available then move along, the mechanics of the game are a vessel with which to carry one of the most intriguing and ingenious plot-lines you will ever experience.. Meh... At first, I loved this game to death. I thought it was amazing. The voice acting and dialogue are superb, as is the plot. It makes you feel attached to the characters (especially April) and really whisks you away. However, after a while, it started to feel like a chore, as if I was playing it just to see what happened, not because it was still fun (it wasn't). The puzzles are often silly and arcane. The game is VERY slow-paced and honestly the plot could have been told in 15 hours instead of 40 hours. Much of the game consists of doing filler quests - finding items and solving strange puzzles. Also, the insanely slow pace with which characters move (even with the escape key) and sometimes forces you to watch them to stupid things, such as take out a pipe and smoke it, then put it back, becomes annoying after a while.. This game is absolute a true addiction ! In my opinion is the master of all adventure games ( the whole story including Dreamfall and the coming soon Dreamfall Chapters.) A true adventure gamer who respects himself/herself must try it out !. I decided to give this game a try just recently. I knew it was an old game and at first I was put off by some of the screenshots, they seemed aged obviously. But I gave it a shot and I have to say this is the best adventure game I have played. The graphics may have aged a bit (in a technical sense, polygon-count etc) but the aesthetics and the art are still amazing and gorgeous. The story and the voice acting is the games biggest strength and easily beats most modern titles out of the wind. The dialog is extremely well written and almost all the characters seem authentic. The ending could have been a bit more satisfying, it was rather weak compared to all the other stuff the game had to offer. Still, easily the best adventure game out there, even after 14 years.. This game happens to contain one of my favourite universes and it was so well made. I'm not really a fan of adventure games, but this game managed to keep me enthralled. The characters were amazing and the story was to. I have recommend this game to multiple people in hopes they'll play it, so I'd recommend it to you to!. Worst game ever yo. I heard that this one is all about magic, and science and so I tapped it instantly, only to find out that not only you can't blow up stuff with this one, but you don't even have a decent inventory. Instead it's a walk and talk simulator, how boring is that. And whats with the graphics yo, seriously, it's like worse than Counter Strike, how is this even possible, oh my God. I mean look at this, they did not even tried to make it look better, how amatoerish they are. The plus side is that poor people who can't even afford video cards can run it too. 10/10 would play Mass Effect instead, seriously just skip this one guys, even games on my mums ancient iPhone 3 looks better.. This is The Game (with a big ""T"" and a big ""G"") of its genre: an epic Adventure, with a big ""A"". In this game you'll make a journey between our world, depicted in a very realistic way, and a fantastic fantasy world. This duality gives the game a lot of variety in its atmosphere, story, characters, dialogs and puzzles. Yet, the whole thing stays consistent, and is therefore really immersive, which is no less than a feat for a fantasy story. Story which is engrossing. Dialogs are funny, full of humanity and well interpreted by the voice actors, which gives characters a solid deepness. Graphisms (except for the archaic 3D of the characters) and art style are very, truely beautiful. Along with the music and sounds effects, they create incredible atmospheres. Most of the puzzles, while challenging enough, aren't as hard as in other adventure games: they make sens (and no too-small-to-be-seen item to pick up), which is yet another very good point to be added on one of the ""Longest"" list of qualities for a game.. Well where i am suppo","TLJ is the first game from Funcom, a norwegian studio, released in 1999 . the visuals are not hideous though, it’s just clearly visible it’s an old game . it’s a classic point-and-click game, with classic, creepy FMVs ."
24.Mass Effect 2,"Good follow up to the first one but ignores alot of the character arcs from the first one. Combat and gameplay are vastly improved, inventory system is also massively improved and the main storyline is fun and intense. Main drawbacks I have here are that older characters are pushed aside for new and not-so-entertaining ones and even then, the crew here is massive so alot of the characters feel shallow unless you're romancing them.. Peak bioware i hope they do but i dont think they could ever surpass this one Pros: -carries a lot from the previous games this pro will be present in this whole trilogy -Improved on the gameplay -every single companion is interesting and cool looking -you can be a major **** if you want -the game doesnt hold back and will kill a lot of your loved ones if you make the wrong choices (rare to find games that have the balls to do this these days) -Good overall plot the best one and some are really thought provoking Cons: -Combat even though improved still feels a tad clunky compares to more modern games. Mass Effect 2 is on of the best sequels made for a video game. It is a highly engaging story that Bioware has struggled to replicate since.. SCORE: STRONG 9 = 9,7 MUST PLAY GAME, good lore/music/story. The Mass Effect Trilogy are one of the best games ever made. 1 of my Favorit gemessen ever liked mass 3 More from the Story but sill great. One of the best RPGs/action games of the 2010s and it will always live up to the hype people give it.. Ive played the Legendary edition in mid 2024. I cant help but see my experience with todays standard, i understand that the game was released in early 2010. The story and characters are what make the game interesting but still doesnt do enough to make it worthwhile to play 14+ years later with so many great games out there.. A perfect game. The recruiting and suicide mission mechanics are tremendous. The gunplay and RPG elements are tighter and more refined. The story, world, and characters are top-notch. Everything goes right, everything lands. They don't get much better than this.. Simply Epic. Arguably the best Sci-Fi piece of fiction I've ever experienced, this game is an absolute rollercoaster, and I enjoyed every second. A bigger and better sequel in practically every single way, Mass Effect 2 might be more linear than the first game, with less exploration and RPG mechanics, but the amount of content is doubled. While the main story certaintly lacks direction, the loyalty missions and the characters carry the entire game. The characters are definitely the strongest part of the game, every character feels fleshed out, has different abilities and weapons, and develops throughout the game. The worldbuilding is unparalleled, so many additions to the lore, new races, more worlds and galaxies to see and explore, it's just insane. Even the gameplay is great, the power-ups are very fun to use, and every character has their own unique power-ups, granted, the RPG elements are weak, this game feels more like an Action Adventure Shooter than an actual Role Playing Game. Lastly, the ending is arguably the most iconic conclusion in the Sci-Fi genre, it exhausts physically and emotionally both the characters and the player, and since I managed to get the best ending possible, I haven't felt so satisfied playing a videogame in a very long time. Final Rating: ""Excellent"" ~ 9.5/10.. Remove the ho-hum gunplay, and the rest is an interactive action movie that's decent enough for one walkthrough. Don’t go for seconds, though.. mass effect 2 is an improvement to the ME1 formula in almost every way. ME1 has an edge with the pacing of the story but ME2 has depth, boldness in the story, beyond most 2020+ games's willingness to push the boundaries of storytelling. the gameplay loop is easier to understand, I do miss the variety of weapons and the importance of the leveling mechanic, but spending more time on missions actually shooting is very satisfying. the settings in the level design are very diverse and fun to explore. learning about each character through their loyalty missions was a highlight beyond the gameplay.. Greatest RPG game in my opinion, the final Mission is arguably the best in all of gaming history, the characters are so well written it makes the whole game more immersive, can't wait for the new mass effect game.. I'm giving this 1 point for those who worked so hard, what kind **** is this, you know it's a mobile game, aren't you ashamed, it's a shame to release such a game in 2024.. Immersive Story I loved everything about it - Bioware at its prime ! Can only recommend !. Mass Effect 2's story takes a hit as combat becomes more streamlined, sacrificing RPG depth and variety, leaving veterans feeling a bit underwhelmed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mass Effect 2 is a landmark achievement in gaming, a spacefaring epic that transcends the medium. Its masterful storytelling, unforgettable characters, meaningful player agency, and polished gameplay combine to create an experience that resonates long after the credits roll. Mass Effect 2 isn't just one of the best games ever; it's a testament to the potential of video games to deliver narrative-driven, emotionally impactful, and immersive experiences that leave an indelible mark on the hearts of players.. This is hand down one of the greatest ever made The characters and thier story is soo well written And it has one of the best final missions in gaming. this is the bad boy of the mass effect games. It is 2024 and Mass Effect 2 is still the single-best video game I have ever played. The story and characters are unmatched in any game I have ever played. The combat is good, the adventure is amazing, the scenery is fantastic, the voice acting is spot-on, the dialogue is well-written, the decisions are intense, the music is great and the overall feeling of being a part of the Normandy crew is like nothing you will ever experience in gaming. This is a one-in-a-lifetime experience and truly a masterpiece.. Perfect. My favorite game of all time. I honestly have a hard time of thinking of substantial flaws with this game. The games story is excellent, going for a more episodic feel rather than the blockbuster movie feel of the original. If choice heavy rpgs are your jam, this is the game for you. So much of what you do ties into one of the best video game endings of all time, truly life or death decisions. The combat has also vastly been improved, and the character building has been simplified, but to a healthy degree where you don't feel like you have to invest in useless abilities. The games characters are also some of Biowares best. Characters you start out hating become fan favorites, and returning characters get much more depth than they ever got in the original. The game also has a decent variety in side quests, from hub quests, to vehicle quests, to combat quests. If you're looking for a good sci-fi rpg, you won't find a better one.. Until I played this game, I thought the shooter and RPG genres didn't blend well together. This game changed my mind.. One of the best RPGs i have ever played. The story was amazing, and the combat system very fun.. The gunplay is enjoyable, but the characters are mostly science fiction knockoffs or copy and pasted versions of first games characters. The entire thing is mediocre from start to finish and the writing is downright bad. It was a pretty strange experience.. Much improved combat irons out all of the quibbles that slightly marred the original game making for the best adventure game money can buy, with the possible exception of its own sequel.. Amazing game, great RPG and story elements. Good side quests aswell and how your actions affect the story.. This game is extremely epic, with a very beautiful world and lore. I really enjoyed travelling in the space and discovering new worlds, meeting new characters and locations with quests. Also you can customize your starship, and add a cute space pet as cherry on top! It was one of the game that i enjoyed the most in my Xbox 360. Even tho im not a big sci-fi fan, this game is just too epic so i LOVED it. Also the heroic ending was amazing aswell.. Mass Effect 2 is one of the best Sci-Fi RPG’s ever made, even better than the first. Great atmosphere, Story and Characters.. The best mass effect game and it’s not even close. It’s hard for a story to really grip me and have me hooked the whole time but this one did. The characters were all spectacular and the excellent writing made me care about them all so much. This is a must play.. Perfect! One of a very few games that deserves a 10, but Shep and crew in Mass 2 well deserves it. Mass Effect 2 take a huge leap from 1 and this is the space RPG of a lifetime. Bioware were at their best with Mass 2. Definitely one of my favorite games ever!. Amazing characters but average story unfortunately. Could have spent the time setting up ME3 and used the exact same structure that makes the game so good. Imagine if Shepard had found the plans for The Crucible at the end of the Suicide Mission? But still a fantastic game.. One of the most, if not the most inmersive games of all time, the history that this trilogy of games provides to the players is as good as the best Tv series of all time, every decision you make counts and when you reach to the final part of the game, you are going to think over and over what you are going to decide because you love the characters of the game and you take it seriously. The main quest are awesome, but the secondary quests which i recommend doing, are also awesome, you know that you do them with a purpouse and that they matter to the game. I cannot say more things of this game because you have tou play it to see how Bioware can create masterpieces like this. One of the best games of all time with the best characters in videogame in my opinion. The suicide mission is some of the most fun hours of gaming you could ever have! Overall not as strong as the first Mass Effect game but still a very good sequel with fantastic combat.. A great experience from start to finish. Mass Effect 2 is what put Bioware on the map for many.. This entire trilogy is one of the most well-written narratives in gaming. The amount of impact you have on the game world as a player is staggering even 12 years later.. Mass Effect has become one of the most iconic franchises in the growing field of gaming, and it's easy to see why: it feels like a franchise that's always been there and it has a self-constructed history that we buy, just like the worlds of Star Wars, Star Trek and Doctor Who. However, Mass Effect 2 is debate-ably more ambitious than those franchises combined. And dare I say it: Mass Effect leaves the Halo franchise for dead (but that's just my opinion). This game is one of the most phenomenal experiences I've ever seen play out before my eyes, and I'm happily replaying it now. The whole series is immersive, deep in character development and freedom of player-choice: I can't fault this game if I tried. It's gorgeous, fun, exciting, and it's got an engrossing story that can take you on so many side-quests that are necessary to your choices as the player. The characters are three-dimensional, graphically and figuratively speaking, and they don't bore you; they compliment the world of Mass Effect even more with their presence. No character is a carbon copy of the other; they're all their own persons, something that a lot of developers wish they could say; but most cannot. Mass Effect 2 is a masterpiece of the video game medium and I think it's even suitable for non-gamers who want to try something new in the world of sci-fi.. Its a totally awesome game although I wished that they would have had a little more RPG elements left from the previous game and not be so action oriented.. One of few times the 2nd game is better than the 1st imo. I've never been a fan of sci fi for some reason. But this game made it an exception. The story was just so good. Miss tali. One of my most beloved Sci-Fi RPG's I've ever played, I recommend it, the game has some seriously good RPG mechanics that I've seen in a game and the Universe actually feels like a universe, you attach yourself to the crew and feel devastated if you lose any of them in your ending. If you love RPG's this one is a must play. Highly Recommended.. Simply put one of the best games I've ever had the enjoyment of playing, while it's quality as a fully fleshed out 'RPG' is certainly questionable, there is no denying the vast beauty and pure greatness this game is. The game is all built around reaching the end point of the game, and while, at almost any point, you can go to the end of the game you are HEAVILY encouraged to do the various quests around the galaxy, as based on the decisions you choose and make your ending of the game will vary massively. I love the concept of building up to one final point and having almost every decision you've made up to it come into play. The characters and companions throughout this game are definitely the best part about it but just the sheer amount of fun this game provides earns its status as one of the best games to ever be made, in my opinion.. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 8 Music: 10 Story: 10 Total: 9.50. The least interesting part of the trilogy, but the best game all the same. Best blend of combat and RPG, most immersive etc. Collectors story falls a bit flat, but it's still really good.. This game is honestly a emotional roller coaster than the first one and I love it.. Mass Effect 2 is my favorite part of the trilogy, which shines with breathtakingly well-written characters and a strong continuation of the story. story The narration of the story is very round and starts right away with a loud bang. In the very first round you just think: ""What are you doing to us here"". In the course of the game, the story is spun and told in a very exciting way, which then culminates in the last mission. The characters, regardless of whether they are new or old, get a lot of substance through their own loyalty missions and many well-written dialogues and you develop or develop a strong bond with the individual characters. The threat from the collectors, and therefore in the background from the reaper, with the harbinger as a spearhead is very well thought out and clever and the danger grows more and more as the game progresses. Gameplay Mass Effect 2 has seen some gameplay improvements which make the game feel more dynamic (reloading and ammo). It has become an action-packed cover game with very good-sounding weapon sounds. In general, the music is again very atmospheric and appropriate. There are many missions that don't seem trivial, but have hands and feet and the resource gameplay has been made more pleasant than in Part 1. Only I would have liked more role-play, especially the skill trees are very rudimentary and offer no opportunity for experimentation. Graphics / atmosphere You just get more of the very strong staging, the very atmospheric sci-fi setting and the picturesque music. In the Legendary Edition, everything is polished again to a high gloss. Conclusion For me the best Mass Effect 10/10 stars! The DLC are ABSOLUTELY recommended, outstanding.. The pinnacle of the Mass Effect series, ME2 is full of rich storytelling that connects you to NPC's in ways no other RPG does.. One of the greatest games, sequels, opening, story and ending ever made in the gaming industry.. Probably the best game I’ve ever played. Everything is perfect. That’s all I can say honestly, i love it to death. Simply the Greatest Game ever made without contest. This is an irrefutable fact.. One of the best video games of all time in the greatest video game trilogy ever. Brilliant storyline, amazing opening sequence and the greatest video game finale of all time. It has possibly the greatest video game cast ever with superb voice acting, character dialogue and interaction. The soundtrack is one of the best gaming ost's ever made, the graphics where incredible for its time and they still hold up to this day, the in game universe is my personal favourite of any gaming franchise and to top it all off the game has decent combat and gameplay.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Amazing Story.......................Amazing Score.....................Great. ""Mass Effect 2"": Amazing game, it provides an amazing experience for the player. 7 out of 7. Played it on Xbox 360.. OVERALL - 94% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 8/10 Great sci-fi RPG with huge improvements on the first game. Plus... Alien Sex.. This is an awesome game. Probably still my favorite out of the 4 games. I liked the new characters they added and I still will come back to replay this to this very day. It’s been 10 years and this game still looks great. One issue though is the lighting, if this game had good shadows and lighting I would still love the graphics. Also one complaint would be the bugs. I experienced a glitch several times in my second play through where Shepard would stop Turning and could only move in a straight line. But it could be resolved by being hit by an enemy though. Overall 9/10. The masterpiece game, the perfect sequel. Can not wait for it to be re mastered. it is the halo 2 but of bioware which means more and better, for me the better sequel of all times. The best entry of an unforgettable sci-fi trilogy and in my book, the finest game BioWare has ever made. The plot is less substantial than in other entries, but what really stand out are the characters and the experience of being in command of the Normandy. Suffice to say the gameplay mechanics, level design and dialogues are a vast improvement over its predecessor.. Mass Effect 2, to me is the best game in the Trilogy. Sure the majority of the game is just recruiting squad members for a suicide mission but the build up towards it and the characters and locations you visit was all well done.. A masterpiece in every possible way, improving it's combat and story with more emotion and an epic soundtrack. Not to mention a lot more content.. This a faux rpg with a COD skin. Less exploration with better combat and a lackluster story.. one of my all time favorite games. Replayed multiple times. Saved all my team but still wanted to replay this again also with the addition of the dlc characters as well.. This is an amazing RPG even with features being dumbed down from the first one. It still managed to create a fun game with a great story.. Mass Effect 2 is home to probably the best mission in all of video games. One that takes the context of your entire journey and lays out your decisions right in front of you. For that alone, it's worth playing, not even mentioning it's other successes.. Mass Effect 2 is one of the best Action-RPG games in history. There are only 4 main missions, all the rest of the time is allocated to collecting a diverse team. Each character has its own unique story, each loyalty mission is special. In the 2 part Bioware did what developers so rarely do: listened to criticism, cut out everything that misunderstood players and expanded or did not increase at all those elements of gameplay 2 were excellent in the first part. Unfortunately, some elements of the game have become easier. The dialogues were simplified, in the first part they were perfect. And the plot is not so perfect. I advise everyone to touch this masterpiece. For many, it 's the best part of the series.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. One of the very best. From the combat to the story. Also ME and andromeda was underrated. Thanks. I love the RPG game! Mass effect 2 - beautiful atmospheric story with good RPG elements! Very gameplay!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. great game if you like, non-rpgs handholding Regressive politics boring stories boring gameplay accessibility cinematic presentation lazy, simple, shallow content zero c&c one of the most overrated games ever created. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Game Ever !... Bioware nailed it with their game design , narrative and story.. Most rewarding game I've ever played ... Where all your efforts and decision adds up for the final suicide mission ... Thank u Bioware !. A wildly amazing space rpg. Improved on the first Mass effect in every way except one, the number of armor and weapon options. Story 9/10 Setting 9/10 Game-play 10/10 Graphics 9/10 Music/sounds 9/10 Replay-ability 10/10. This is the best of the trilogy. Playing through this again is like returning home to good, enthralling gameplay before EA crushed it from existence. This will remain one of the best of all time, and proof that when done right single player games are life changing.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 9.5 Sound/Music: 9.5 Graphics/Art: 9.5 Design/Atmosphere: 9.5 OVERALL: 9.5/10. Mass Effect 2 represents the improvement of the original Mass Effect formula: improved combat system ( although it still was very improvable for its time ), every decision feels like a big change to the experience, the whole story... Mass Effect 2 is a ''must play'' definitely. One of the videogames of my life.. A masterpiece of the series, awesome, difficult , sound, great improvement in the Mass effect series. You can say, already on 2nd's franchise game, that Mass Effect is one of the most genial video game series of all time. Story is simply spectacular, can be clever at the same time that gives the player the power of choice to molds it. Innovations can be felt just of a few minutes of playing. While ME1 focus is in RPG, ME2 focus in action, but not left behind role-playing. No more words to say.. Taking the grand scale of the first game, this sequel takes everything up a notch which delivers on more fun, more heart, and more excitement. Allowing the player to completely control who lives, who survives, and what direction Sheppard takes to get where he's going truly made this feel like something far greater than many other video games. I was absolutely hooked (no apologies to my ex lol) and even though it took me 18 hours to beat the campaign, I thought the ending was only the end of the second act. To be completely honest, I was amazed at the ending while playing but once it ended, I was shocked that there wasn't more. It definitely leads into the possibility of a sequel which detracts from the finality of this ending but doesn't disappoint as far as gameplay or enjoyment are concerned. I suppose that I was slightly confused that MY decisions as a gamer could dictate whether or not one of my allies made it to the end (was new to RPG's when I got into this series, aside from Skyrim); that element does offer an unreal amount of replayability and truly makes me want to go through it again to see what other outcomes are possible. And this game offers teamwork like none other, I held my supporting characters close to my heart, maybe even closer than the main protagonist. It's a beautiful and masterful game in every way, will keep you hooked to 100% completion and beyond.. Mass Effect 2's improved shooting mechanics are no-brainers; they're the expected advancements that clean up the flaws of its predecessor. But what makes this sequel so rich isn't mechanics, but vision. A nightclub lit with flames, deadly family reunions, a friend accused of the inconceivable--these are the sights and events that cast shadows in your mind and heart. A few blemishes prove that this planned trilogy still has potential for growth, but they barely diminish the game's overall impact. This is a galaxy you want to explore that is populated with characters you are glad to know. Mass Effect 2 is the kind of game that you return to, not just because it's fun to play multiple times, but also because its universe is a place you wish you could call home.. Amazing game. Best one of the series by far. You really care about all the characters. Flying to different galaxies and exploring planets. Fighting aliens. What more do you need! And what an ending. Bought all the DLC and they were just as fun.. The goat space opera The goat space opera The goat space opera The goat space opera The goat space opera.. My favorite game. I tattooed myself I love this game so much. The universe is rich and so full of detail. The characters are deep and thoughtful. Garrus is one of my favorite characters in any sci-fi universe. The game play is fairly intuitive and easy to learn. The story is just so fantastic. I don't think there will ever be a game that is this good!. Mass Effect 2 has better graphics, music, characters, story, and gameplay than it's predecessor, and it's predecessor was already a great game. Do not miss this experience.. A perfect blend of presentation, story telling and gameplay. I can't recall a game living up to it's expectations quite like Mass Effect 2 did. From the opening moments, you can almost smell the whiff of popcorn that would whisp through the lit up halls of a theatre. The music is amazing. Scene depending, it can go from quietly alluring to heart poundingly pulsating. From start to finish, Mass Effect 2 is a beautifully cinematic, brilliantly crafted and impeccably polished marvel. The story has been and can understandably be accused of stepping sideways as opposed to moving forward, but I would argue that stepping sideways is also way of saying that the main narrative slows down in order to allow for a less immediate sense of exploration via smaller scale stories. It is through these small stories where Mass Effect triumphs. The mysterious threat of the reapers and their plans are looming in the darkness while the Mass Effect universe breathes. The loyalty missions, the mystery of the terrifying collectors and the side quests shine so bright in part due to these very reasons. The gameplay is solid. Some might dislike the watering down of the RPG elements which is absolutely understandable but the combat in Mass Effect has never been at the forefront for me personally. It's fluid, it's fun and it's pretty - and that's all I need. The cast of characters deserve their own mention. They are incredible. This rag tag team of well acted misfits are without a doubt, the best thing about Mass Effect 2. They are all so realised, each and every one, save perhaps Jacob, who despite being boring is still likable and believable. Thane, Jack, Samara, Garrus, Tali - I could go on, are all the beating heart to this starcrossed tale. This is the peak of a series that is in itself almost perfect, and that is saying something. Mass Effect 2 is an absolute masterclass of its kind.. In short, ME2 is the most immersive digital experience I have ever had the pleasure of binging. Dialogue and character design are the key to the title's success; for the week after finishing the story, you'll forget you aren't Commander Shepard.. A game to fondly remembered from the peak of last gen, surely is the best among 3rd person shooter genre, a perfect beautiful space setting, yet a masterpiece story **** of these deserved to be remade one day, perhaps not in current gen's age but next gen surely fit into. This game is excellent. Way better than the previous game in the trilogy. Boasting new characters, improved gunplay, removed annoying crap from ME1, a very well done and engaging story, and very meaningful choices. Mass Effect 2 just all comes together to deliver an experience you won't forget for a long while.. A very tight sci-fi action game. A simple but fitting story. Vastly improved gameplay. Fantastic characters and character building, by the end of the game, you truly feel like a spaceship captain saving the entire Universe. While it looses the charm, sincerity and true sci-fi that its predecessor had, evolving into something a bit different, but still keeping the great wonderment of its world. An extremely immersive experience with great gameplay and good characters. It's a fantastic action game, though I do prefer the first Mass Effect.. Mass Effect 2 is like the perfect pizza. Impossible to stop eating. It is an unbelievable journey, and much more than worth the time. It does everything perfectly.. Mass Effect 2; one of my favorite games of all time. A game, that improves upon the first so drastically, that it feels like a different game. People will say that it lost too much of the RPG element, but I believe that it combines the RPG element and adds more shooter elements perfectly. The characters are still amazing, the story is even better than before, and the combat is the best ever. The game got rid of the annoying equipment menu in favor for a load out you select before starting a mission. While it was nice to select different weapons mid mission, the fact that that menu is gone is a plus. Speaking of equipment, without DLC's, the weapon selection is bare at best. The enemy is even tougher than before, and the final suicide mission is epic to say the least. To elaborate on the characters a bit more, they add more characters with even more depth, and you're able to meet up with a few of your friends from the last game. The loyalty missions are a vast improvement from the first game, and the dialogue is still one of the best features of the game. The cover system was fixed thankfully and makes combat much more fluid. As far as the story based DLC's are concerned, they are good and add to the story, and while I agree that they should have been in the main game from the start, they are worth the money. Overall, it is the best game in the trilogy and has minimal drawbacks that don't detract from the 10/10 score.. Mass Effect 2 Overrated. Mass Effect 2 is a 3rd person shooter that continues the story of Commander Sheppard... Who is customizable if you choose... When the game starts you have the choice of loading your character and choices from mass effect 1 or start fresh and choose the important decisions from that game during a brief recap… Which I was thankful for since the first mass effect wasn’t interesting enough or fun enough for me to finish… Thankfully Mass Effect 2 is much more enjoyable... Youre still dealing with the threat of the reapers here… You wake up from a 2 year long comma.. Things have changed, past relationships have changed, and now you have to deal with the collectors who are working for the reapers… And you spend the entire 24 hours of this game going to different planets, recruiting the best mercenaries out there and gaining their loyalty by completing their own missions with them after they join your crew… And if you see a fine piece of booty on that ship, you can hug them... You can hug them all… The sex scenes are no witcher 3 scenes... But the option to romance is there if you want to see bras or naked backs I guess. Or pretend that someone loves you while you shoot things with them. Between each mission you’re back in your ship the Normandy, and you choose the solar system and planet to travel to, you can then mine some of the planets for materials to upgrade your weapons and ship, or land for the mission… And before every land you choose the 2 characters to bring with you as well as edit unspent skill points and change their weapon loadouts… But the journey to the credits is fairly repetitive… There are a few cool missions in here that mix things up, making you use your brain to investigate or figure out how to get inti a secured location.. But for the most part you’re clicking r3 to get the tiniest idea where to go with the games added objective compass, which is for the most part useless as it goes crazy and often points in the wrong direction… And you shoot everything in your way… Take cover... wait",Mass Effect 2 is one of the best sequels made for a video game . the story and characters are what make the game interesting but still doesnt do enough to make it worthwhile to play 14+ years later with so many great games out there .
240.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II,"Great value for money. As the majority of gaming is still a single player experience, I can say this game is better than ""Quake,"" its nearest rival, and therefore has to be one of the best games on the PC.. With innovative levels, a sparkling soundtrack, enhanced graphics, and near-perfect control, this is one game you won't want to pass up. Jedi Knight is easily the best game of its kind available.. One of the best games ever. Cutscence, the lightsaber duels, the Engine for that time, gameplay. The Possibilty to setting your skills and at last the chose between the darkside and the lightside.OOOO BOOOYYY what a game.. I think it has a GREAT star wars atmosphere... it is pretty simple made but the imperial architecture, the sound, and the raw feeling... Makes it one of best Star Wars games for me. I hope this one time get a remake with better controls, better AI and better graphics, maybe extended levels and stuff. Anyway, with the Mod Remastered 3.0 its even better.. It will seduce you, beguile you and turn you into an unproductive but satisfied mess. Those that can break away from its grasp and lead a life away from the computer screen are to be saluted.. Jedi Knight combines all the good aspects that a game should have: good graphics, interesting story, innovative game-play and superb multiplayer support. Anyone who has a good system (fast w/ a 3D accelerator) will definitely be pleased with Jedi Knight.. Extra marks to LucasArts for giving the game an impossibly large number of options... Ignore the story and immerse yourself in the incredible environments - you may never want to come back.. What Jedi Knight lacks in spark, it compensates for with the oodles of money that a giant like LucasArts can throw into the development process. Add to that good environments, great music, tons of options, solid gameplay, and smooooooth net connections and I can certainly say that fans of the genre won't be disappointed.. In the end, I just couldn't get into Jedi Knight. Maybe it was because I'm not a big Star Wars fanatic that I found it quite boring and uninspired, but there was nothing here that grasped my interest.. The multiplayer on MSN gaming zone is what made this game for me. There were so many fun mods for it.. Amazing immersive Star Wars environment especially considering the state of game at that time. I was **** into the game from start to finish maximizing the freedom of exploring every bit of the world. The game had everything a Star Wars fan would love (cut scenes, Star Wars themed sound track, massive world, etc.). One of the best Star Wars games ever made even with it's dated graphics. Someone needs take those new Battlefront graphics and do an HD version of this and DF1. In 1998 this was the game to play. It was the first FPS I played, it remains one of the best memories of gaming I have. The score for this game is contemporaneous as today it would struggle to score 1. The graphics are abominable by today's standards. However the innovation and range of enemies and weapons is something modern game designers could take ideas from. The cutscenes and plot and both excellent and you can end up playing for 6-8 hours without a break. However despite this game being available for next to nothing on GOG or Steam please do not buy this game. It had a fantastic run but let it rest in peace... unless Disney want to do a remastered edition... please?. I preferred the original Dark Forces- it had a better, longer story, and I found myself frequently frustrated with battling the other Jedi in the game.","this is one of the best games of its kind available on the PC . Cutscence, the lightsaber duels, the Engine for that time, gameplay make it one of best Star Wars games . with the mod remastered 3.0 its even better ."
242.Halo: Reach,"do i even have to say anything this game is goated we got both it & red dead 2010 was one of the best for games. everything in this game feels real, it feels lived in. Your just a soldier in a war, but your that MF SOLDIER. this is the ending **** that i remember the most, i think about it even a decade later. what a game.. Halo Reach is an absolute classic, with a fantastic campaign, brilliant multiplayer and expanded forge. Custom games for this back in the day were soo good Unfortunately the new additions to the sandbox are lacking, revenant, focus rifle, plasma repeater,etc arent very good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bungie's swan song. Reach is a fantastic video game package that greatly improved on Forge and brought a highly addictive multiplayer suite. Reach is only held back by its campaign lacking likable characters.. It's a great game. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of action, its mechanics are very good, the story line is very solid and of course the master chief is great.. MASTER PIECE........................................................................ This game got me addicted to shooting games to be honest. Loved it and played it so much. However like all halo games, I don't like the kill your own teammate with grenades.. Perhaps one of the greatest prequels in any game, movie, or franchise. Bungie left the Halo series with this swan song of a banger. The gameplay was updated with armor abilities and different weapons. Master Chief is replaced with Noble 6 as the main character and follows the tragedy that is the fall of Reach. The ending of the game is not surprising from major fans of the lore, but the story feels personal as each of the members of Noble Team has a place in my heart. The game had the pinnacle of content as there was a substantial story campaign, a refined multiplayer with various modes, a firefight mode that felt methodical and included some of the most iconic maps, and a forge mode that allowed players to create anything that they wanted. This game is one of the greatest culminations in gaming and is still as fun as ever in the current day. Some of the graphics may be considered outdated, but its artistic vision is still captured. Some of the additions may be unwelcomed by long-time fans, but I felt that it was a welcome experimentation. There has not been a current Halo game that has reached the heights of Reach or Halo 3.. The best fps game of all time the storywas perfect there’s only one thing I would change and it’s that I wished jun died cause he is an ****. I wasn’t around when the multiplayer was still going but I heard it was damn good, and one thing I should mention is that when you change your multiplayer armor it changes in the campaign too so YOU are noble 6 the only spartan 3 labeled as hyper lethal.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolute masterpiece of a story with a character customization that is actually better than most of the stuff we get now a days. Multiplayer PVP is entirely skill based and also has a great selection of armor abilities to choose from, some are kind of useless, however I seem to find all armor abilities except for sprint pretty situational anyways.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is unironically my favourite game in existence. The only game who’s story gives me stomach-dropping nostalgia, the only graphics that make me think “Damn”, and I could sing this games praises until the end of my time. Seriously, this deserves at least a 95 rating. The story depth, visuals, functions, controls, variety in armour and weapons, graphics, performance, level design, price and all the below are impeccable. I will lay on this hill until I die that this is one of the best games ever made. this deserves a higher rating tbh. this is objectively one of the greatest games of all time.. Can't say enough good things about this game. I know Halo 3 got a lot of well-deserved acclaim, but I really find Reach to be the magnum opus of not just the Bungie entries, but the series proper. Reach's gameplay is brilliant. The wide range of weapons are incredible and each has merits in learning to use them. The addition of the DMR was great and offered a great intermediary between the magnum and sniper rifle, even with it coming at the cost of the SMG and battle rifle. The firefight mode offers a great PvE experience that really overhauls the mode as it was introduced in ODST. Halo's multiplayer options include a lot of modes as well. The campaign, without diving in too deep, is beautifully crafted. The game's OST fits the overall tonal vibe of the game, and there are countless shots that are just peak cinematography from the series. It's one of those games that you really have to experience for just how great it was. One of the best that the Xbox 360 had to offer.. This game helped to teach me about sacrifice. Truly gives a feeling of hopelessness, as we already know what’s going to happen.. Everything aspect of this game is wonderful. The story depicting a futile fight, but never losing hope was profound and inspiring. The gameplay was solid and action packed, and the atmosphere and setting were spot on. Definitely a top teir entry in the franchise.. Another one of my childhood game and i have the legendary edition for it till this day. Really phenomenal campaign, multiplayer and couch coop splitscreen function. The story of this game started off badass but ends up being really emotional. Gameplay and enemy variety is top notch, i will never ever forget this game.. The best halo game, enjoyable with friends, the forge mode offers a lot in terms of what you can build. The pinnacle of the series.. Halo reach is greatest first person shooter ever made, and bungie finest work. A collective of all the best parts of the halo series, such as special abilitys, brutes, elites and an amazing guns and vehicle selections. The maps of the game made it the high ranking game having just the right amount of city and hill alike. The story was a smart way to finish off the game, linking strate to the first. This was an outstanding performance of bungies greatest game and is an amazing way to make a prequel and to start the epic halo saga.. While I know today that the changes made in Halo reach were important for the series to continue. I personally still believe that the changes like armor abilities, weapon load outs and vehicle re-balancing were overdone with Reach. While the story still had those amazing set pieces you expect from a Halo game the multiplayer felt bland and lifeless, with the only improvement coming from the custom game modes community. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Love this game. Everything Is class: the story, the gameplay, the set peices, the weapons, the vehicles. Just a simple feature like being able to lock your altitude in a flying vehicle has me impressed because so many games are missing this. Bungie even does the little things better than most. Can we talk about how Rogue Squadron steals so much from this game?. Oh my god it’s amazing it’s my first halo and I confirm you that it’s the best story in any shooter game. Noble six🫡. Loved it from start to finish. My favorite halo campagin. Online is meh. But in 2024 story holds up.. The only good halo game in my eyes. No flood, No soy, No slow ass movements its just no nonsense quality with an excellent story. For bungies last game in the series before pissing off to destiny they really hit it out of the park. Reach was first introduction to the Halo series back when I was a kid. Even then, I knew that I was staring down the barrel of something wonderful. Fourteen years later, Reach still offers a cinematic and heartfelt story experience that trumps many titles today. Moreover, the gunplay and challenge found within the campaign is fantastic. Reach is an easy to pickup game with an achievable skill curve. Oh and side note, the armor and customization options are STELLAR. Best designs in the series by far.. Halo: Reach knows perfectly how to make a balance between action and sentimentality, which makes it very, very fun. The characters, especially the Noble Six, are tremendously charismatic, and you really have a hard time if anything happens to them. Also, the difficulty is quite level, so as long as you don't play on the easy difficulty, the campaign will always challenge you. In short, Halo: Reach is an amazing game full of incredible factors that make it crowned as one of the best games in the Halo franchise. Taking into account its hits and its (almost non-existent) misses, I give Halo: Reach a solid 10/10.. My favourite halo of all time. Amazing story, amazing multiplayer. So many memories made on this and the gameplay and story definitely holds up today in my opinion. Halo Reach is probably the Halo that gave me the most trouble when it came to beating it since my playthrough of Halo 3 on legendary. While I did have the difficulty at Heroic, more often than not Halo Reach just had certain suggests that felt too hard to manage or just went on for way longer than it should have. Which is weird because the game also has plenty of areas where you can run past the enemies and progress anyway. While I enjoyed enough of my time of Halo Reach, these difficulty spikes and inconsistency of length really hindered my enjoyment of the game. Overall the story is a nice brush of past events that led up to Halo and the overall tied of battle for the Halo universe. It's interesting to see humanity struggle this much against the convenant again, and Team Nobles interactions on and off the battle field really do give enough characteristics to make you miss them when they all eventually fall.Overall Reach is a tragic tale that had it's high moments, but largely fails to captive me the same way that Halo 3 or 5 have so far. While not the worst Halo game I played, the bad parts I remember hold me back from seeing the good ones.. Just play this game absolutely phenomenal game from its story to its multiplayer (Which I wish was still populated :/ ). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My personal #1 game of all time. Best Halo campaign, soundtrack and multiplayer was PEAK!. This Halo game was really good. Halo Reach campaign pretty much can't get any better, I mean sure it was a retcon, but both the book explanation and the game explanation can both be excepted. Halo Reach. Multiplayer is a bit of a different story. Bloom in Halo Reach is quite bad, and it is pretty hard to hit anything when shooting at what is seemingly a normal rate of fire. Another quite problamatic issue, is just how annoying armor lock is. Armor lock is one of the worst abilities ever put into a Halo game. It simply stops the fun of trying to kill eachother by making me wait like 10 seconds, and is so overpowered, that being shot by a scorpion, wraith, or rammed by any vehicle basically does absolutely no damage. Otherwise, being able to play as an elite is amazing, customization is basically perfect, progression is pretty good, but may take a little bit to get stuff, Firefight in this game is also very well done, and in fact, you can play as an elite going against the spartans in firefight, which is pretty cool. Forge mode was a lot of fun, and you could do a lot of stuff, and was great in making forge a fundamental stepping stone, especially with media share. Overall, this game truly was the last Bungie game.. Games a top 3 halo game easy. Good story, good multiplayer customization is great. Overall great game. One of the best stories on war a video game has ever told. The cinematography in this game put most movies to shame. The focus on armor abilities is an interesting shake up, and while slowing down the pace of the game, is an overall fun change that sets Reach apart from Bungie's previous games. It's artstyle does gritty realism right while absolutely still being Halo. The fault's of Reach comes in it's map design, these maps feel way too open in multiplayer. However, with the improved forge and a whole canvas in Forge World on disc, today this is hardly an issue.. Not as good as Halo 2 and 3 but still a very solid title and the last truly excellent Halo game.. Not only does this game deliver a stellar multiplayer experience, but one of the greatest campaigns in FPS history. An incredible send off for Bungie.. Its an EPIC game. I like the gameplay and the visuals were fantastic. I would like to play again in future. It's not that good. Some enemies are really brainless and the playability feels a little bit outdated, even for his time.. Another spin off using the Halo 3 engine, This time you join a team of proto-Spartans investigating an incursion into an Earth colony by a hostile alien force. There are a few tweaks to the gameplay involving some new special abilities and weapons mainly it seems for the sake of the online experience. This is also true of the format which revolves around you teaming up with an AI controlled partner throughout, which is my main problem with it; it's essentially a ""fake multiplayer"" game of the type that has proliferated since and as such hasn't got the satisfying single player story or variety of Halo 3 or even ODST. As such it's my least favourite Halo game, but by any other standard it's a beautiful looking and hugely enjoyable FPS.. A superb halo game with an incredible contained campaign. It breaks from the formula in a lot of ways, both plot wise and mechanic wise. Plusses are the campaign, negatives are the introduction of sprinting and loadouts.. Bungie's final ""Halo"" game is arguably the best one ever made. It may be a prequel to the original trilogy, but this installment also marked the beginning of the modern era. Series fans will easily see the influence it had on the entries made by 343 Industries. The story campaign, multiplayer, Firefight and Forge are all excellent. ""Reach"" ranks up with ""Halo 2"" as the franchise's high point. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. This was my introduction to Halo and I enjoyed the gameplay and the story. The game has diverse environments and is easy to learn and enjoy.. If Halo Reach isn’t the best Halo game, it’s just because it’s closely behind Halo 3.. Very good story and gameplay, but not as good as Halo 4. Firefight is fun though.. An amazing game with a very engaging story. Core gameplay is great. Missions are mostly great but not as great as halo 3. The music is really good. The weapons and vehicles are fun all fun to use. The DMR was a great addition. My favourite mission was tip of the spear. This game would have been slightly better if it allowed you to fight a scarab as they are so fun to take down but still very fun to fight enemies. Multiplayer is also great as well- with very well deigned maps. It was also very fun playing firefight on this game as well. Overall a great game with an amazing story.. SO i just want to talk about the campaign wich is brilliant!!! The ending is one of the best in all video games. The gameplay very smooth and fun, i never get bored and it has some quick and exciting action. Sure, it is a must play and one of the best shooters too. Not the best halo though ;). The people saying that this is a bad game have clearly not played it, probably some salty no maidens playstation fans. Still can't believe **** games that don't have a fraction of the care that bungie had with the halo series make way more money, it brings a tear to my eye knowing that halo is nothing more than a husk of what it used to be, still even the worst halo is as good as some of the most popular games of the decade.. This game is perfect. Incredible story, awesome story and the noble team is amazing. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. This game is insane : the scenario, the characters, the gameplay is a little old but funny. halo:reach is my favorite halo game I adore this game from its multiplayer to its campaign I gives this game a 9/10 only reasons its not 10/10 is because its still has a lot of flaws. but still it is a 9/10 totally recommend. It leans more into sacrifice and horrors of a total warfare than any other Bungie game did. Some parts of this game are so intense, It reminds me of CoD: World at War. The overall atmosphere becomes depressing as it gets. Plus, the weapon designs are top notch. There's no denying that. Master Chief Collection is worth it for this piece alone. The whole DLC wasn't even discounted when I purchased them all on Steam. And yet, I've no regrets.. Good to see this good insight into the old days it's a great game and so sad to find out things. Had a blast. Strong narrative pacing throughout the whole game, musical score was on point and brings home the feeling like you're a small part of an epic struggle, but only in a good way.. | Overrated | I do not have many compliments to give the game. I managed to finish it despite wanting to stop playing about three times, yet it still wasn't worth it. The story is interesting at first, but it's a story filled with underdeveloped characters and a monotonous tone throughout. There is no eerie feeling like in the original Halo, nor is there a simplistic story or an engaging one at least. It's a very standard Sci-Fi story, and the only ones that can enjoy the story are those who are willing enough to learn the lore. The gameplay: it's repetitive. It's walk, shoot, walk, shoot, walk, shoot, walk into an open area, shoot. This is the entire game, with about two missions that changed it up by being the world's easiest platformer, and by being a part-time weak StarFox game. The game isn't entirely bad though. There are absolutely story moments that surprised me, and the gameplay is very fun at first. It's just about the halfway point where I kind of got disinterested and didn't care enough. It's a very standard alien shooter that wouldn't be as popular if the title ""Halo"" wasn't attached to it.. The greatest game of all time. Played this for years during its peak. No game comes close.. the ending alone can care this game never mind adding to it an excellent campaign and amazing characters with top notch voice acting , great story , graphics and gameplay. best halo game even if you know nothing about halo you need to play this game it's so worth it. The spin-off that no one knew we needed but that became one of the greatest FPS games of all time. From the campaign to the multiplayer this game is a marvel.. In general, I want to say one thing - Watafak Bungie were able to create Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare before it became Call Of Duty?) Combined and correctly mixed an arena shooter with a story about the Sixth, who loses his partners) ?) Wow. In a word. It's a lot better than Halo3: ODST, and it even has the right mechanics. Although the shooting after the run is too clumsy, in Halo 4 it was more pleasant. But other than that, it's exactly what a franchise like Halo should have been. I really wanted to replay Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare after this game. Cool. Very cool. 10 out of 10. It is a pity that all subsequent parts cannot do this.. The graphics and art style still look dope after 12 years, gameplay and story are amazing and I loved the level design.. The story is amazing, idc what anyone else says about it. I love the campaign. The characters are amazing and lovable. The multiplayer is fun and enjoyable. Others might disagree but put in a good amount of hours into the multiplayer and had fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very good game made by Bungie before they left Microsoft. The art style of this game was amazing and the characters and setting were used to perfection. The music was top notch and it really felt like they tried to bring back what made Halo: CE so great. The reintroduction of health packs and weapons like the assault rifle feeling like they have that power behind them again like in Halo: CE was great. The only flaw of this game was it could have used two more levels to make it a little longer and flesh out characters and the conflict more. That being said you can tell Bungie put all their effort into this game and went out with a bang.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. no kat please don't die during this alien invasion suicide mission you're so sexy ahaha. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great story and gameplay is fun. Also leads straight into CE. Definitely one of my favorite Halo games and I do recommend. A really good game. The first Halo campaign I have experienced, but not the last one. It is a pity that things such as running are considered a ""skill"" and are not integrated on the game. But I know it is part of the experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Long time fan of the halo franchise and this game, while starkly different from it's predecessors, stands tall with the rest of them. Gameplay, story, dialog, and mechanics are all completely solid. I've been playing this game since release and it's hands down one of my top 5 games. If you haven't played it yet, give it a runthrough. 10/10 would recommend. Halo Reach will always go down in history the game is great Good Campian Good FireFight Good Multiplayer and Forge. This for sure also is a Bungie game, and it's as **** as anything else they ever made. Mediocre at best and not ever worth playing or buying. Just grab a pirate version to find out of not worth playing this game is or anything Bungie made... None Bungie games deserve a score.. An improvement from ODST. The story was a bit too self serious but it's not ""jarring"" in the way The King's Man was. It's self contained, and has something in mind. Forge is cool. This game is easily my favorite Halo game and also one of my favorite games of all time. It mastered the Halo formula and Bungie couldn't have done better work. The gameplay is the best in the series, the graphics are still beautiful and story is masterfully done. There's just no flaw in Halo: Reach. Bungie made a masterfully executed swan song to the franchise that put them to the map.. Reach's story is really good. It makes us love the characters and even ours has a role. It's not like those times when your character is just a bystander, but instead develops a friendship with his allies which makes the final moments of the game very impactful. A good game that marks the events before Halo CE. Such a great game!! I didn’t respect it for so many years in comparison to the original trilogy but if it weren’t for these men halo wouldn’t have we know and love!. Halo Reach is a fitting conclusion to the Bungie era Halo games that refines a lot of what made the series so good while still adding new and interesting ideas to shake up the formula. I love how the story has the character ware your multiplayer armor set. Noble 6 is already a mostly blank slate for you to put your self in and this makes the game even more effective. The game feels like a love letter to the series with effectively your own spartan and actions being the reason by the end that the subsequent trilogy to even occur. Prequels usually suffer from the audience knowing what's gonna happen by the end as is the nature of a prequel. And while we knew sorta what was gonna happen as we herd about how Reach was destroyed in the other games and expanded material. But the game gives a great cast of Spartans in your team that you come to know during the game only to slowly kill them off until your final stand is both genius and just very effective in showing the tragedy of Reach. So I love the story and in visuals and sound the game much like its predecessors is really solid. The gameplay is also really good although there are some minor changes that I and a lot of fans weren't a fan of. Such as adding bloom to the guns which never bothered me that much but can be annoying at least in multiplayer and the new armor abilities. The most annoying one being the armor lock especially in multiplayer can be a real headache as it allows a player to be invincible for a couple of seconds. Other then those aspects which for me are fairly insignificant the rest of the gameplay is really solid and a ton of fun. The enemy AI is still really solid with enemy's making pushes when they know your shield is down and taking cover when grandees are thrown along with a bevy of other small details that make fighting them so fun and repayable. Designs for the covenant have been tweaked but aside from the brutes who just look weird the rest of the cast looks wonderful or relatively the same. My favorite being the elite who were made to stand up straight making them taller and more intimidating. One really annoying thing with enemy behavior is the melee swings of covenant happen so quickly you have no way to counter them. Which on higher difficulties can be a one shot kill. Overall the Reach campaign is a ton of fun and while I might not put it higher then the original trilogy it is right below them if I had to rank them. The multiplayer though is also great and I've spent a ton of time in the past playing it. And aside from some of those minor annoyances I mentioned earlier the multiplayer is still great competitive fun. Along with the forge mode which was expanded upon from 3 and I cant even count how many hours I spent making maps and playing other peoples customs maps and just screwing around with the game engine with friends to see what we could get away with. Halo Reach holds a special place in gaming for me and I believe it still holds up just as well as the original trilogy based on my most recent playthrough of the series.. That's what I'm talking about it was perfect the stor the ending but I wish it was a little bit longer. Had an amazing single player campaign really adding to halos story. The online play was also really enjoyable.. I first ever halo game my god I love it best campaign and multiplayer I never forget even tho it 11 years old. I love this with all my heart, the last Halo made by bungie ️️️️. The story is dramatically good Noble team was noble and they the job done. Best Halo ever. We will never see new great Halo game with 343i. So sad. The franchise is dead. The best Halo game of all time, a brilliant story with a great multiplayer, what more?. the **** Awesome! the ending? one of the best! it makes you feel the fall of reach! heroic campaign... i loved this game!. Halo is quite simply the closest thing we have ever experienced to a living, breathing alternate universe.. Last Bungie's Halo game. Ga,me is refined and the story is thrilling and sad.. A thrilling and more grounded adventure than the previous entries, akin to a more modern shooter campaign. Halo: Reach is a substantial departure from the previous mainline Halo games. The soundtrack and environments are as great as they've always been. The graphics are also very impressive and still hold up to this day. The gameplay still feels similar to the previous titles, but the addition of some controversial features, such as the ability to sprint for a limited time, made it stand out. To me they didn't feel too drastic and they also never felt necessary in any encounter. In previous titles, when an enemy shot you while aiming, you would stop doing it, however here it's not the case, making it so staying far back and shooting the enemy's head was the most viable approach. The narrative feels dark and gritty and it portrays the desperation of the battle of Reach that had been previously mentioned in other games. It feels like a losing battle every step of the way. The characters, while interesting, felt underdeveloped, so you weren't very attached to most of your team. By this time, Halo's narrative also started going down a path that if you didn't read or watch any of the extended material besides the games, you would be a little bit confused about what was going on and who certain characters were (a problem that increased more and more in the following games). Overall, the game is a good send-off to Bungie as the developers of this franchise and, despite how controversial some decisions were, you have to admit they were trying to innovate and leave a mark. And I'd say they mostly succeeded.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Halo Reach is a great game. Both campaign and multiplayer have a fun design and are enjoyable. But, let's get a little more in-depth here. The story of campaign is okay. Not great. Noble Six being a self insert character for the player is great, allowing you to feel like you really are in the Halo universe. The other characters are not so enjoyable. I don't hate Noble Team. I really don't. They just don't get enough time to really flesh them out. The only ones that I actually care about are Emile because he has a very clear and present personality and you get to spend time alone with him, and Jun but that's because Jun survived past Reach and is featured in quite a bit of post-Reach media. So the characters aren't the best, okay. But what about the actual story. It's pretty good. The game tells you that you lose within the first few seconds. But you don't feel that way up until Long Night of Solace. The game makes you feel like you can take on the whole damn Covenant (much like the trilogy did) before ripping that away and showing you that you cannot win. Then you are left to walk through a city under siege and see the Covenant's brutality against the people. That is the beauty of Halo Reach's storytelling. It carries you to such high high's before pulling you right back down. Incredible. The campaign's gameplay is also pretty fun. It has a couple cool new weapons, returning weapons feel good, it works well. The level design is good and the variety in level layouts and locations are great. Gameplay wise, campaign holds up well. Multiplayer is interesting. The armor abilities are very controversial, and in my opinion are a good addition. I like what they bring to the table. Ten years after this game's release and there are still people playing online on the 360 (I know because I'm one of them). That should go to show that people still enjoy this multiplayer. Firefight is the only part I'm really split on. I think it was better in ODST. In ODST you felt like your back was up against the wall at all times. Here it feels more like you're DOOM Slayer rather than Soap McTavish (Gruntpocalypse is pretty fun though). Overall, Reach holds up really well. While the campaigns story doesn't hit as hard as Halo 4's, and the multiplayer doesn't quite rival Halo 3's, Reach is overall incredibly solid.. Genuinely one of the most incredible games of all time. The campaign is one of the best FPS campaigns ever with a great sandbox, range of enemies but also the most diverse collection of missions. Each mission is completely unique and utilises differently parts of the sandbox perfectly making every mission enjoyable. The characters are good for the short amount of screen time they have and the cutscenes are brilliant. The overall story is 10/10 and adds a lot to the halo lore in a completely unique and unexpected way, the final mission ""lone wolf"" diverts the stereotypes of usual campaign endings in a great way and conveys the ongoing feel of hopelessness portrayed throughout the entire game. As for the Multiplayer, armor abilities make it slightly worse than 3's imo, as they are annoying and dont mix well as sprint is one for some reason. However the sandbox is arguably the best and BTB is incredible as well as infected. Standard slayer is ok but there is no reason not to use the DMR as it even outguns the AR at close range. The main problem is the bloom on guns like the DMR which makes shooting enemies painful at times. Forge is the best in the franchise apart from 5 and gives you a huge world to explore and build on, plenty of","""halo reach"" is an absolute classic, with a fantastic campaign, brilliant multiplayer and expanded forge . ""this game is one of the greatest culminations in gaming and is still as fun as ever in the current day"" ""this game got me addicted to shooting games to be honest."

244.Mass Effect,"Best game in the series in terms of character development, world building and story. Gameplay and combat are clunky and the inventory management within the game are awful but with that being said, it's the best game in the series.. Mass Effect brings gamers a wonderful universe ripe to explore. While its gameplay falls shorts in some areas, the story and setting all but make up for it.. It's a bit janky, especially with the hindsight of the sequels in mind. But, goodness gracious, the greatness is on display from the beginning. The world-building and lore are a level on their own, second-to-none. The characters feel like real, living people. The combat and customization are flawed but promising. The main story starts nobly but then takes a dark turn that is exciting and foreboding.. An awesome game, one of the best sci fi games ever made. The dialogue can be a little slow but other than that its amazing.. Last but not least for me, the first Mass Effect. The reason why I didn't play this game before playing Mass Effect 2 and 3 is because I already got spoiled on it, but since I played and loved Mass Effect 2 and 3, I just had to play the first Mass Effect as well. Unfortunately, Mass Effect didn't age very well compared to its sequels, most gameplay elements feel either bland or tedious, from the shooting mechanics, to the driving system and useless sprinting, it's all kind of weak. However, Mass Effect excels in other areas, such as the story, characters, world building, set-pieces and sound. Mass Effect's story is great, it's probably the best in the series even if it's not a high bar in my opinion, and it has a decent pacing on top of that. The characters are good too, they're not developed yet because they're in the beginning of their story in this game, but they're likable nonetheless and they all play crucial roles. One of the best parts of the game for me, is the world building and the universe in general, it's just fantastic, very detailed and interesting. Also, while the graphics look a bit outdated, the presentation and the music is still immersive even to this day. Something interesting I noticed in the game, by the way, is the minor technical issues I had, particularly with the sound of the game. Not a big deal of course, but it's worth mentioning. Pros: + Very good story + Engaging characters + Awesome world building + Beautiful presentation Cons: - Awkward gameplay elements - Minor technical issues Narrative: 8/10 Gameplay: 5/10 Content: 7/10 Characters: 7/10 Music: 6/10 Graphics/Audio: ?/10 Final Rating: 8/10 - Great - Mass Effect might show its age in some areas, but it's still a great introduction to the legendary Mass Effect trilogy. Do I recommend it?: Yes, definitely, mostly because of its superior sequels though.. The beginning of a revolutionary trilogy that changed the videogame industry forever. Being the first game of the trilogy, Mass Effect truly revolutionized the genre, it's a game that tries to mix both Action Adventure and Role Playing mechanics at the same time, while keeping a balance instead of fully committing into being an RPG. The most important thing about this game is definitely the worldbuilding, so many universes, galaxies, races, politics... it's mind-blowing, the amount of effort that was put into creating this world is just insane. I've got to say, I didn't expect that much freedom and exploration in this game, there are many side quests to do, and many planets to travel to. The gameplay is not that bad, shooting feels fine, even though the hitboxes are weird. There is not much variety when it comes to weapons either. every character has the same 4 weapon types, but there are multiple upgrades and ways to empower your weapons and equipment. It's a fun game but it can also be frustrating sometimes, the mission design is very outdated, too many corridors, it's easy to get lost due to the complicated areas, it's like traversing through mazes until you finally find the right path. The story is pretty good, and sets the core foundation for the next 2 games, and I really like the characters, they're actually well written and likeable. Surprisingly, there is a lot of customization and character progression in the game, and every squad member has their own moveset. I have so much respect for this game, and I had a lot of fun playing it even though I was slightly hesitant at first because it's a pretty old game. It looks beautiful, plays decently, and tells an interesting story, a very promising start for one of the best space odysseys the videogame industry has to offer. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. Didn't get everything I could out of it, but what I did get was great. The rpg mechanics are great, the shooter mechanics are great, and the story is absolutely amazing.. Looks like a movie and plays like a great sci-fi novel. The shooter-based combat system might feel simplistic at first, but it's really a boon that great enhances the pacing of the game. The action is quick and you constantly feel that you're on the move.. If you dont like space then this might be the game for you. but everyone should be like shnoo, dislike dean for not allowing him to have a dog.. I gave this a bad review to look cool infront of my friends but now I feel bad. I think I've learned a valuable lesson from this. I'll take some time to reflect on my poor behaviour and I will see that this will never happen again. Regards Shnoorum. The pinnacle of RPGs for me, offering countless hours of engagement. Will revisit without question.. Immersive Story I loved everything about it - Bioware at its prime ! Can only recommend !. I played 3 hours then switched to Mass effect 3, to see if anything good can actually be learned from how bad the 1 started. To not waste my time. Perfect, as it did save me time, which I uninstalled before playing ( after choosing "" jump into action"") i had a 15 min cut scene without gameplay. Very unlikely will I ever reinstall this games and recommend to anyone. just the mentality of bad unskipable cut scenes is enough. Horrible unskipable cut scenes. Combat is horrendous, feels really bad, weapon switch feels really bad, aim feels really bad. Movement is terrible. Speed feels bad, SPRINT is disgusting to do. Whenever you hug a wall your character COVER, and now its not aiming anymore. It takes a LONG time before it gets back up as you hold down the key to backtrack. Just a nightmare. After playing the first few mission, boring discussion and trash cut scenes. This game is really worthless and a waste of your time.. Best space series so far. The first part is already excellent. The series has only gotten better from there. One the best trilogys of the gaming industry for me. The first One is not perfect but is very close. I played it a lot of times. It was beautifull. The history capture my attention from the beggining.. While not a terrible game, a rather rough start to an otherwise amazing trilogy of games. The game has an amazing world and lore, and the main story (while somewhat uninspired) is rather solid. However, many of the games characters are rather dull for a Bioware game, and many of the games choices only have an effect in later games in the series. The character building is a bit of a mess, and the third person combat is genuinely bad. While there is a decent variety of side quests, the environments of many of them are copy paste, and some boil down to collectathon quests. Again, not a bad game. However, it genuinely feels like a prologue to more interesting adventures down the road.. One of the best RPGs i have ever played. The story was amazing, and the combat system very fun.. An absolout amazing masterpiece, please bioware, bring this back to the original glory.. An epic galaxy-spanning sci-fi adventure, Mass Effect marries the styles of RPG, classic choose-your-own-path adventure game and first person shooter to create an absorbing and well written story that makes you feel like you are the lead character in your own personal space opera. The adventure element works better than the combat thanks to fiddly aiming and the weapon overheat feature that seems to exist solely to leave you defenceless at exactly the wrong moment, but as a whole it's one of the very best games of its type.. Mass Effect is one of the best Sci-Fi RPG’s ever made. Great atmosphere, Story and Characters.. Playing many years later. I was extremely stunned by how immersed I was in this game. I couldn’t believe what I was playing half the time. You simply can’t beat this writing and the execution of it through dialogue. I haven’t played older RPGs like Fallout or Baulders Gate, so I can’t say this game has the best writing in gaming. But so far out of the games I’ve played. This game and its sequel have the best writing and storytelling I’ve experienced yet.. Best Mass ever! This game with all the DLC has it all. Shep is a beast and the rpg elements are truly amazing. One of the greatest RPG series of all time is the Mass Effect series.. Amazing exploration and decision making throughout the entire game. Best storyline of the Mass Effect trilogy too but the combat/gameplay hasn't aged very well.. Mass Effect has become one of the colossal cult-classics of video gaming; and rightfully so. The game has great level design, endless narrative possibilities thanks to its multi-choice format storytelling that made it become iconic in the first place. BioWare knew what the hell it was doing when it decided to use the experience they got from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and decided to apply all that to an original IP for the company. And the result: a classic that forever changed gaming in 2007. Mass Effect can debate-ably be considered Canada's biggest important of the 21st Century; at least in multimedia storytelling which the franchise has since gone on to 'effect'. Commander Shepard, The Reapers, Garrus, Tali, Urdnot Wrex have all gotten well-deserved love and respect from gamers everywhere. Mass Effect is a special franchise that feels like it's always been there in the background.. My favourite game of all time. Just buy it and play it and see for yourself.. Mass Effect 1 (LE) on PS5 Game completed : Nov 30, 2021 Playtime : 17 hrs I played its original for few minutes because i was young back then but completed it for the first time in its remastered version. It holds up inspite it is more than a decade old. If you are a fan **** theme like star trek or star wars like myself, this game suprisingly delivers. It could still compete even to todays standard but its far from perfect for a reason this game is too old and for remasters, there will be some aspects of the game that is impossible to update. And this is the case for mass effect 1. The inteface is outdated, the overall gunplay is clunky and its progression system is not as appreciatable. These could only be change on a remake version and thats completely fine. Overall, it is still a unique and a must play even today. Remaster : 10/10 Story : 8/10 Overall gameplay : 7/10 Progression : 6/10 Phasing and replayability : 8/10 enjoyment : 9/10. I've never been a fan of sci fi for some reason. But this game made it an exception. The story was just so good.. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 6 Music: 9 Story: 9 Total: 8.50. Mass Effect is a timeless classic. Stellar first entry to the series from BioWare.. Fun to play with plenty of side missions to keep you entertained between main progression. A massive nostalgia hit and enjoyed playing it just as much if not more than when I was in my early teens playing it. Only issue for me was using snipers get like a handicap for someone who was meant to be a specialist with them. What a way for a new IP to make a splash onto the scene. The beginning to one of the best trilogies ever made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hasn’t aged as well as the rest of the series but it still holds up remarkably. Story is phenomenal, characters are all great (except Ashley) and I still enjoy playing the game even after beating it like 7 times at this point. Can’t wait for the trilogy remaster!. *legacy edition review* I really enjoyed playing this. Its fun, interesting story. Combat is alright. The version I played was a tone smother combat/movement wise opposed to the OG. But hey! I really enjoyed the game. Really really fun and chill. More logging this for games played in 2021...which has been a few so ****. Mass effect started this incredible trilogy off in a great way. This game offers a great storyline with a wide range of outcomes that carries onto the next two games. The characters are just brilliant and very memorable. The graphics where top quality for its time and the soundtrack is just brilliant. The ending is also amazing and nearly as good as ME2's ending. The gameplay is no doubt the weakest part of the game but it's far from bad, in fact I rather enjoy it at times with some of the unique combat mechanics.. I did and game says it auto saves but then doesn’t making me have to replay three hours of the game that I don’t want to. ""Mass Effect"": Amazing game, it provides an amazing experience for the player. 7 out of 7. Played it on Xbox 360.. OVERALL - 91% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 7/10 From a narrative and RPG point of view I think I prefer this to Mass Effect 2. The only downside to this game were the controls could have been better. This problem was rectified in the future games. It's a game that doesn't feel at all rushed, you feel you can explore it's universe at your own pace and is probably the best sci-fi computer game story of the decade.. An excellent start for an epic trilogy. While controls and combat feel a bit clunky at times, it has awesome and interesting NPCs to interact with, and a fantastic story line.. Fantastic start to a wonderful series. It doesn't hold back when it comes to killing some of your favorite characters, which makes the story even more personal and engaging.. One of the best sci-fi RPGs out there. It has a great story with decent characters and fun gameplay.. A fun game with a strong story that didn't fully tap into what the series would become. Laid the groundwork to become a blockbuster franchise.. Mass Effect is one of the best game franchises in video game history. One of the brightest examples is that video games are art that is not inferior to literature and cinema. In general, if you consider the trilogy as a whole, the first part is in fact a prequel to the main story. But Mass Effect has everything you need to create a great trilogy. We were shown what this world looks like and what laws it lives by. There is not the most fascinating main storyline, but a lot of not big additional stories that together form a real space opera. And even trips to M35 Mako on desert planets cause not irritation, but nostalgia. Having passed the original trilogy on PC after 7 years decided to pass it on Xbox360. And these are still fascinating games, after Mass Effect 2007 even in bleak Andromeda you don 't want to come back.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. Mass Effect is a perfect action RPG game! I love this very much! Very interesting gameplay and great to explore the world.. Great graphics, dialouge and a heavey emphasis on exploration. It gives me KOTOR vibes. Must-play for any RPG or Sci-fi fans. This is so good it could rival the original triology of star wars.. Story 2.5/3 By no means is the story in this game weak. I just find it the weakest in the trilogy. Where Mass Effect and games like it get it right is the immersion it creates for the player. When I first picked up my controller and delved into the story I found copious amounts of codex and journal entries that I would read to flesh out my understanding of this games Lore. This isn't playing a game. This is playing a movie. The cut scenes are moving, the side quests and characters are loveable. They can die in game if you aren't careful which came at as a surprise in my first playthrough of many. The side missions carry some weight to the resolution of the story. When a game offers you extra reading, most of the times it is sub par or just filler, however Bioware just got it right with Mass Effect. The ending to the game felt like a nice pay-off and I wont spoil it, however I did find it was quite rushed after the second act. Gameplay 2.5/3 Now dated yes, but at the time Biowares stop start and power/combo mechanics were new and fun to the genre. Yes it was a shooter, but it had RTS elements in a way which allowed you to pause the battle, change loadouts and combo up powers with other squad mates to unleash havoc. It was entertaining exploring which combos worked best and because of my love for each companion, I used so many different ones in every play though. The gun play was clunky but carried a certain feel to it that didn't annoy you when you played due to the other game systems. I played this game on its hardest difficulty and found it to be challenging but not to the point of frustration. It has a great balance of cover fire and guns blazing combat for anyone. Sound/Music 2/2 The Mass Effect series has some of the best in game music and background music in a game to date. The eeriness of the unknown galaxy is made evident through synth/organ and drum tracks when in major cities that almost become a character themselves. The voice acting is second to none. Making the characters even more loveable. Guns sound great for the time of release. Giving them punchy weight when firing. Art Design/Visuals 1.5/2 Character models have some glitches and some are generic however not game breaking like a Bethesda game. Great environments that are unique and alien. Guns and armour look great as well as the cities. The team does a great job at creating a new world to explore. HUD is good and simple and the map system is easy to use. My final verdict is 8.5/10. This is a strong start to what will be an amazing series. This series is a must for any RPG fan and would highly recommend to anyone who wants a Sci-Fi movie experience but in video-game form. You're looking at 50-60 hours of content by playing the main storyline and doing all the companion missions. 60+ for those completionists per play through.. This is a near perfect game that still has replay value over a decade after it was made. One of the best of all time.. For me it was the very first RPG in which decisions counted, and I have to say it couldn't be better. I loved how I took ages to make a decision since every decision could affect to story by causing a death or making it harder or easier. It was such a wonderful experience. The graphics were passable for its time despite they could have been better. The combat system could be a bit arduous being this the worst feature of the game , but even in that case it didn't harm the experience. The relations with other characters were very worked, making those secondary characters very interesting. Mass Effect it's a game/saga which every RPG enthusiast must play.. To start off, I have played all three Mass Effect games twice now, and I enjoyed them. The first time I played this game, I was blown away. The game has great music, amazing story, and in depth characters. Being able to upgrade your weapons, armor, and ammo was also a cool feature. The biggest downside to being able to do those things was the design of the equipment menu system. Selecting a weapon and armor worked fine, but upgrading them felt overly tedious. Only being able to go up and down the upgrade select screen one item at a time felt clunky at best, especially when your item count was near the 150 limit. The combat was another irritant, but only to a small degree. The fact that the cover system made you run into the item you were trying to hide behind, instead of using a button to initiate the cover, was annoying. I really did like the fact that you could crouch, which was something I wish they would have brought over to the other two games. Story was great and the cut scenes felt very cinematic. The voice acting was great, and the fact that you could talk to your squad mates in depth after missions was a plus. The morality system was a nice feature, as was the love option. All in all, it was a great game that has a ton of replay value and will not leave you bored. It's only let down by the somewhat hazy graphics, the random mid game play load message's, and the under designed equipment menu.. Incredible story + immersive and addicting gameplay + charismatic characters + an amazing power of choice + too many crafting around galaxies and planets + sci-fi + RPG + space + challenging but not frustating difficulty = An amazing game = Mass Effect. Although sensational, playability were been enhanced on the next game.. I have to admit...I absolutely hated this game for the first 3 hours of gameplay or so. I expected a third person Halo-like linear shooter, and this is not that game. This is an open-world third-person role playing game set in an enormous galaxy with a huge cast of characters and a story that the player gets to control. I'm embarrassed that it took me three hours to figure that out but proud that I dedicated time in order to overcome my misunderstanding and complete the game. Once I understood the game, I absolutely loved it (I didn't know you could upgrade and customize the characters, so I was playing with entry-level armor and damage for the first 25% of the **** was unbelievably frustrating and once I did figure that out, I was mowing down enemies and having a lot more fun. I'm going to hate Dark Souls, I guess). With an open-minded story, beautiful graphics that didn't feel 10 years old, gameplay that offers so much fun, and exploration that can keep you busy for dozens of hours, Mass Effect is a must-play for anybody who loves storytelling in general.. This truly is a great game. Great graphics, great music, great story, great characters, and good gameplay. The world is so well developed and you can tell that so much thought went into developing the Mass Effect universe. Mass Effect is very dialogue heavy, so for gamers who prefer constant action, this may not be the game for you.. Just make it to be 1 of my favor game, but doubt would ever re play it, just found out to extend my interest hours, simply have to made a costum appearance of shepard, cannot stand the look of its original default shepard's face! graphic : 8 (consider disabling motion blur and film grain) sound : 6 gameplay : 7 (Repetitive) Storyline : 9 (very good composed). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mass Effect sets a great stage for a Space Opera for the ages. The characters and story-line are magnificent, and by the end of the game you are left with questions and a desire for more. That being said, my most common recommendation to new players to this game is to set it on easy and power through. The gameplay is a little weak and can be janky at times and the side-quests are unfortunately atrocious with a few key exceptions. Mass Effect is truly the stepping stone into a whole universe.. It really draws you in and is a captivating RPG. All of the elements of the next two games in this trilogy are present as well plot and character development take a center role.. I played that game so much ... Finished it 5 times with all types of characters experiencing all the different romance and corners of the different story lines ... One of my all time favorite and a game that made be fall in love with the whole universe, buying books, comics ... There aren't any games I can think of set in the sci-fi universe that have been able to capture that space opera feeling. All characters are interesting and makes you want to get to know them and try to help (or not ) with their problems and ahhh the romance :) Gameplay wise it was really good (despite the mako sometimes being a pain ^^) I especially loved the RPG aspect which was in my opinion too simplified in ME2 & 3. Visually amazing even still pleasant by today standards.. Mass Effect is an awesome game but has serious issues with frame rate and tearing on the Xbox 360 version. Combat often turns into a crapshoot of trigger spamming and luck due to the low frame rate. Pretty sad considering this game has Microsoft plastered all over it. Ultimately, Mass Effect is a very interesting concept done very poorly. The universe is somewhat imaginative but nothing we haven't seen before. Would have been interesting if Microsoft acquired BioWare with a similar deal they struck with Bungie.. The first game in the trilogy that helped take the action RPG genre to a new level with its excellent gameplay and interesting characters. The sequel improved upon it in many areas but this remains an excellent game in its own right and is still well worth playing even nine years after release.. This game is great, never have alien genitalia been so finely rendered and sensual. I'm sure the aliens that the government are hiding are playing this for their own arousal and enjoyment. I'm glad video games have come this far and I hope they'll go farther with the new consoles. More alien genitalia. Please. I'm very thirsty.. Mass Effect is one of the most thoughtful, mature, and enticing games I have ever been introduced too. One thing that always comes to mind is the meditative “Vigil” opening soundtrack that starts off as the iceburg for one of the most well crafted RPG's of all time. The game world pictured is a vision of humanity in the future, and this vision is a glorious one. A massive galaxy is unraveled to humanity, big and full of exciting and new things to discover. A variety of species exist intelligent enough and similar to us in a variety of ways. The “galactic society” is idyllic. No longer bound to Earth, the stars are limitless to our grasp, and our thirst for knowledge unquenchable. Tolerating alien species is a developing logic in many human minds yet relations are steady and working. Alien species look and sound similar to us, with a variety of interesting quirks that make them “alien” yet enticing, as their own respective cultures are learned about. Our technology is similar, yet noticeably upgraded, with star ships as common of a sight as a wooden boat. A 1970's tinge reverberates around a narrative design with the future in mind, with a synth effect one can describe as “alien” and “high tech”. The world is introduced to us via the in-game “Codex” and in a short amount of time we can perceive this all too idyllic virtual world clearly in our heads. Mass Effect is a game not to be taken lightly. This is a game Bioware designed from the ground up as a masterpiece fit enough to remain a “legend” of early 21st century video gaming. The artistic level of Mass Effect is astonishing. With every detail and object designed masterfully to guide the player from start to finish, being linear, yet free. The most perfect blend of free roam and an enticing linear story that offers many different interchanging paths and endings. Commander Shepard, protagonist, embodies everything humanity's future stands for. His path can be good, neutral, or evil, and that is all dependent on the player's choice. Major characters can die and will never be seen again. This is a sci-fi that is worth playing, being as enticing as an action movie, as breathtaking as a shooter, and as deep as a novel, this is game that deserves to be played by everyone, a fitting description of many Bioware games like itself.. A fun, excellent game that you can play over and over again with a different story every time. I very much recommend this for sci-fi fans and RPG fans. What mass effect does best is that it combines a captivating story with great action and combat and turns it into your hands to let you decide the way you want to play.. First time I heard of this game I was sceptical, didnt think they could actually make an FPS with RPG elements and make it work. A friend of mine told me to buy it, that it was my kind of game, I saw the reviews and some trailers but it didnt caught my attention. 2 years later at my local game store I saw it again, and decided to buy it, mostly because they were having a sale so I got it dirt cheap. got home and played it, and instantly got hooked up. My friend was right, it is my kind of game, i love creating your own custom character and this game even lets you pick your own backstory, great music, great dialogue, tons of side missions, exploring, and most importantly GREAT story and another great shocker for me, the decisions you make and I do mean YOU make, have consecuences in the sequels, how cool is that???? Just make yourself a favor, BUY THIS GAME.. The original Mass Effect was an ambitious game; it set out to be this massive space drama and a blend between a role playing and an action game. It certainly accomplished this with a customizable character, lots of different powers to use and upgrade, tons of weapon mods, ample side missions (you can beat the game in twelve hours or you can spend thirty-five), and story-altering decisions (that carry on to the next two games). Basically, this rogue Spectre (a high-ranking official) named Saren is trying to take over the galaxy with an army of robots called Geth and it’s up to Commander Shepherd, you, to stop him. However, you learn that Saren isn’t the greatest threat to the galaxy. The combat is quite inventive, a blend between action and strategy, and the story and characters really shine through. Texture pop-ins and whatnot are rampant, combat can be a little unintuitive, and the Mako parts aren't perfect by any means but Mass Effect is a great start to a fantastic series (I'd say it's an 8.7 or 8.8).. This game is incredible. I had been looking for a great game to play after tiring of Fallout, Skyrim, Arkham City, etc... and finally decided to give this game a try. I'll admit, I almost never got into it. I didn't like the combat and gave up on it quickly. About four months later I decided to give it another shot. Again I was disappointed. However once I got used to the system and got a little further into the game, I realized that I loved it. The story is so deep, and the characters so engaging. I found myself wanting to make sure I always made the right decisions. There are really no ""good"" or ""evil"" decisions but rather one is slightly more right and the other slightly more wrong. The balance of good and evil is blended so smoothly in this game. I've logged over 18hrs so far and still have much to do and cannot wait to continue. I highly recommend this to any RPG fan. It's fantastic.. A fantastic experience and its a great game overall, even though I'm not too fond of the mechanics, the story held it up very well and delivered a lot throughout the ip entire experience.. Not bad, but not the best I've seen or played either. The story is okay, with some good action here and there, and it has a stable plot. The game has some good features, such as armor and weapon customization to name one. But I found it lacking in some areas, too. All of the armor looks just about the same as the stock, just re-textured in some cases, and the texture load times on the 360 during cutscenes makes everything look a little weird whenever you talk to someone or load a game. Overall, this is not a bad game, but it's not the perfect game, either.. I was playing KOTOR and thought how great it would be if I could play it on xbox and the fighting was more than point and click and wait to see what happens. This is StarWars minus the light-sabres. This game was like playing a movie.........Amazing game.. At first I was wondering what to expect from the game and I was unsure to keep playing and","gameplay and combat are clunky and the inventory management is awful . but the story and setting all but make up for it . the story is great, it's probably the best in the series ."
245.The Operative: No One Lives Forever,"+ Good/Funny writing and Kate Archer still destroys any ""strong"" female character they've written in the last 10 years + Level design is pretty good - Stealth is terrible due to the insanely inconsistent/clairvoyant AI which wouldn't have been an issue if... - The combat wasn't so mediocre either . Kate is super weak and enemies have laser and pixel perfect accuracy which leads to you baiting their braindead AI to come at you single file while you're waiting at corners Play it since it's free and it can run on a potato . Despite it's weaknesses and certain things not aging all that well it's still a fun game. Funny, innovative FPS with cool characters and missions. A nostalgia trip, everybody should experience. Overall rating: 9.3.. A great and memorable game, with an interesting story, cool characters, witty dialogue, fantastic action sequences and much more. I wish they made games like this in 2023.. An experimental shooter with a lot of fun stuff and Monolith's signature NPC dialogues. First grappling hook in single-player and first **** in first-person. Gameplay: combat mechanics [bad scripts] 8/10 stealth [bad scripts] 7/10 atmosphere: absurd Gameplay as ****: 5/10 Story 6/10 Graphics 9/10 Sounds & music 7/10 . Return of Monolith after the failure with Blood2 and Shogo. That's a good point before an AvP 2 masterpiece.. I would consider it the best FPS in released in 2000. The story is taking place during the 1960s and is a homage to spy series. The graphics are one of the best released that year. The gameplay is stealth and/or action. While the game suggests you play stealthy you can go run and gun on most missions. The story has a nice balance of complexity and excitement. The shooting is fun. The music, voice and sound are very good. The game is overall very fun. My only downside with this game is that it can get glitchy at times and that the enemies AI can be broken from time to time.. The Operative: No One Lives Forever is a must have for every shooter fan! I really love the story, it has great a humour full of movie references. The graphics and sound rule and every James Bond fan will go crazy. Everything from gameplay to atmosphere is great fun!. Having a favorite video game is not easy in a world that have seen lots of great games... for me The Operative No one lives forever is my favorite game of all time. this game is unique in every aspect , back in it's day and even today video games sadly don't do this kind of projects any more and sadly NOLF has been forgotten by a lot of gamers. The game's plot follows Cate Archer, a spy who works with a counter terrorism organization called UNITY, in a race against time to stop HARM from destroying the world. NOLF is a First person shooter with stealth elements taking place in a stylish 1960s era that has heavy influence from tv shows and movies like ""Get smart"" and ""The Avengers (the 60s spy series not the super hero movies)"" and ""Austin Powers""... so... what makes this game so special? well... the story is not very serious but is not ridiculous either, offering comedic moments and dialog with colorful and stylish characters, the game's gadgets that Archer will use through the game are disguised as cosmetics that gives a different air to a shooter game so it doesn't look like any other game from that time and even today. Missions takes place in different locals with a bast variety in levels and structures to keep being unique, now... missions even that sometimes could have the same objective, the way you can handle them makes them different each time, like, going totally stealth or going gun blasting like a maniac... well... not all of those missions, some will be strictly require total stealth. NOLF is a fun and awesome game, you will not get bored, but... it's not exactly an easy game, the more you progress enemies will be more aware of your presence and they will get each time tougher. Something to keep in mind... there are no health pack in the game, so... be carefuller if you die in the mission you either start from the beginning or from the last check point, and they are a bit far from each other. NOLF has the ""must play"" seal on it and it's true... this is a must play game that will totally worth your time... sadly... it's not available in digital stores like STEAM OR GOG due some legal IP issues with the game's rights, but you can either get if on ebay or by the NOLF revival team (for free). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun, funny, and novel in tone! The graphics hold up better than its contemporaries due to being stylized, but it still looks rough to modern eyes. The humor is also a bit immature, but so are the spy stories that it's mocking. I'd still be happy to play another game in this vein.. Surely a good game: The missions are well done, because they are very different. There is a lot of story, especially the 2nd half of the game is really good (10/10) and the humour is nice, but sometimes it is annyoing. Of course the graphics and animations are outdated, a pitty, that there are no texture mods. So I didnt count much that aspect. There are some things I didnt enjoy: The many emancipated dialogs in the beginnings should be cut out. It wouldnt happen, if the main character was male or the writers didnt write such dialogs. And the second is the bad KI, so that you can play the game as a shooter, although a stealth game would fit much better. So yes, the game is very easy and you have to raise the difficulty to have more fun. The 2nd half of the game is great, but the beginning could be cut out, so surely this game is not on the same level as Deus Ex, System Shock 2 or Half Life as written here.. A nice stealth/action game, somewhat similar to Hitman and Deus Ex. If you play stealth, the most typical situations involve sneaking up to enemies, throwing a coin to detract guards and shooting them with silenced pistol in the head. The coin was a novel idea at the time this game came out. You also need to shoot down cameras, deactivate alarms etc. It may get repetitive after a while, and the game is quite linear, usually with just 1 or 2 solutions to every problem. The story is fun, like in some James Bond spy movie series from which this game takes inspiration.. Groovy Baby! The best singleplayer FPS I have ever played. A completely unused scenario a la Austin Powers. Wonderfully cliche in regards to spy movies and a beautiful stealth game full of charme and autonomous identity. Lacking modern mechanics of the genre like extra animations for peaking behind corners but that just adds a bit to the challenge. Wonderfully colorful in visuals and acoustics, this game will have you chuckle every five minutes because of some humorous dialogue or ""intelligence"" item. One of those sadly kind off forgotten masterpieces in gaming. Definedly deserving of a HD remake.. A real classic that really is on my Top 10 games of all time list. The writing, the humor, the unique setup, the gameplay itself everything just blends so perfectly together it's... almost indescribable. What else can be said? Think Perfect Dark meets James Bond and you'll only scratch the surface. The only shame about this great game is I feel that it didn't get the sequel it deserved. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the sequel but it just didn't capture the feel/style of the original. This game really doesn't get the attention it deserves, it even is an example **** with a strong independent female protag. that all the hardcore feminists cry about. The sad thing is I really don't think they'll ever be a third game, apparently the rights have jumped from company to company without anyone really knowing who owns those rights. lol NOLF 1's full source code is freely available and just sits there without any real dedicated modding community. It's so sad.. I played this game when I was a child.When I found it yesterday,my memories **** is one of the best games I've ever played and I really want to see NOLF 3 or something.They can't make a game like that now(most likely).Nothing can make me happy but seeing the third game of this series(not counting J.A.C.K) We want Cate Archer !. A true masterpiece, full of funny and great moments, fantastic character development, a very inspired plot, stylish art direction and top notch voice acting. From the start to the very end, it only gets better and the experience grows exciting as very few games in history managed to do. The main character, Cate Archer, is full of personality. Actually she is the definition of a "" true hero"". The support characters are also very well developed, which is rare. No One Lives Forever has a plot, and an incredible funny one, full of twists. The level design is brilliant, and everything combined make you really feel into a 60's spy thriller. The graphics are a bit dated because the game is old (even if the games cartoon look does help a lot), but every other aspect of the game holds really well today, specially art direction, sound effects, music and voice acting. The plot is just fantastic and thats the main reason to play it. Just play this game, not only because its an award winning classic (it won many game of the year awards), and one of the best shooters ever. Play it because Im sure the whole experience will remain with you for years to come as this game is one to be remembered as one of the most special games ever made. I played it in 2001 and I still havent found a game of the same level. Thanks Monolith for such great classic, and I hope to live enough to play part 3!!! Do it Monolith, we need Kitt Harris in the role of our great hero Cate Archer again!. I'm writing this review in 2014. Besides the outdated graphics (which is unavoidable) this game absolutely slaughters any FPS in the last 5 years in terms of storyline, fun, and humor. This game is a perfect example of why graphics aren't everything in a game. They don't make games like NOLF anymore, now it's dumbed down crap like CoD and Halo with boring stories and zero recoil guns etc etc yawn. Yes, a 14 year old game in terms of creativity wipes the floor with almost any FPS released since. If you haven't played it yet you really should.. This game has many different environments and cool spy devices to offer. It also has crazy bosses and some (bad) surprises. The multiplayer mode is funny. But I have to problems with it: The enemies aren't really various and the dialogs are a bit too long.. That i missed this game in 2000 is beyond me. This game is simply brilliant. Its like an Austin Powers game only with an female hero. The jokes are also genial. Very well done game. Love it.. ""You look like you need a monkey"" ""'How is the goat, over?' 'The goat is nervous. How do you think the goat is?'"" An ""oldie"" but very definitely a goodie. Great level design, good weapons feel, fantastic swinging 60's soundtrack, and just epic gadgets (""horny pheromone robot dog"" that distracts any pursuing Alsatians, anyone?) They just don't make games like this anymore. NOLF is one of the greats from the Golden Era of PC gaming, with a great sense of humor (something a lot of modern games that take themselves way too seriously could learn from).. Even now, over 10 years after its release, this is still the best shooter. Great story, funny dialogue, great locations, great leveldesign which can be beat by both stealth and raw gunpower, never boring. Sure the graphics are dated by now, but the game itself is still far more interesting than all battlefield and call of duty and all other military shooters combined (which are no ""games"" by any definition) Too bad that I can't give it more than ""10"", because the 10 doesn't do it justice. This is truly one of the last masterpieces of the shooter GAME genre.. This is one of the games that cannot be made today, because of it's international scale and that it would be too long and requires an enormous volume of content hence requires far too many assets (probably might cost even as much as GTA). The campaign itself had a play time of around 20 hours, mind you there are no RPG elements. NOLF is widely known for it's overheard conversations among the enemies, exceptional AI, incredible storyline, amazing cut-scenes, effective all round humor, and so on. The best in NOLF is that, is it's wide variety of locations, for instance there are scenes where Cate Archer (protagonist), rides a motorbike, levels in moving train, airplanes with scenes involving free fall, submarines and under water scenes, zero gravity and in outer space, snowy Alps riding a snowmobile, etc. The level design is incredibly smart, and there's a lot of variety in it's game-play, from stealth to attacking modes, access to a wide number of gadgets, this is the best FPS ever. If only more people knew about the game. The game is unrealistic, very funny, spy - like shooter, but stealth component work not so well...also enemies are always same, and that is in late game little bit boring...good game anyway, even if released 12 years ago.... The best music, story and humour ever implemented in a PC game (in my not so humble opinion!). This is the funniest game I have ever played, and still worth playing 12 years on, if you have not already. It can be difficult to find a copy these days though.. A truly masterpiece... I really loved everything of this game from the strange spy gadgets that Cate can use to the musics of the game. The AI of the bots is way better of the one used in nowdays games (just look at deus ex human revolution AI of bots... ) What else to say? It's one of the few games (like deus ex, system shock 2, planescape torment) that you have to play before you die.","despite its weaknesses and certain things not aging all that well it's still a fun game . funny, innovative FPS with cool characters and missions . a nostalgia trip, everybody should experience ."
246.Resident Evil 3: Nemesis,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible game... I'm playing this Playstation version today for the first time and I'm loving it! It's better than the remake. resident evil 3 nemesis one of greatest game i played greet gameplay massive puzzles. Play it, make it play, even if you're done, play it againPlay, play, play, if you finish, finish again, you will not get bored, you will not get bored.. A little more action than Re2 but still a very fun game, and sometimes the Nemesis would freaking scare me out of nowhere.. Still the best Resident Evil game next to RE1 Remake, in my opinion. A true classic with an iconic protagonist (Jill) and a terrifying antagonist (Nemesis). Exploring the streets of Raccoon City in fixed camera is amazing. The OG RE trilogy just got better with each game. Even though the new fans may consider the game's graphics and its controls dated, it's a must-play for any true RE fans. If you can get your hands on it. If only Capcom would port it to newer consoles. Luckily for PC gamers, it's available though.. I recommend pick up one for Halloween and this game awesome story and lot action and graphic amazing and good day. In many ways Resident Evil 3 feels more like a glorified expansion to Resident Evil 2 than a full-fledge sequel, though its core gameplay is a strong as ever. Despite its shorter playtime and single campaign, RE3 still features a ton of replay value with RNG dependent puzzles and enemies, and the encounters with it titular stalker monster, Nemesis, steal the show.. Pretty good, i remember it fondly. A classic. I still think this game is just way too hard for unskilled players like me, but i had so much fun trying to beat it as a teen.. Vote: 7.5. Like the remake, i highly enjoyed Re2 and the original more. It wasn't bad but it's kinda lacking comparing to the next and previous titles. Another atmospheric zombie-blasting adventure with all of the strengths and weaknesses of the previous games. The camera angles can still be awkward (especially when battling the hard-as-nails Nemesis) but the graphics, cut scenes and voice acting are streets ahead of those of the original game. A little old fashioned by today's standards but it's a treat for the nostalgic horror fan.. This was my first RE back on PS1 era. I feel it shorter than i remember and some mechanics have not aged well, also the dialogues feels kind of dumb, i guess i never pay attention to that as a kid. But they nail it with Nemesis, it's a lot scarier than the the new one from the Remake (which i can tell now miss quite some thing from this) Still my favorite RE from original trilogy.. The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a story, I think it's not as impressive as 1 and 2. But the variety of characters is good. There is a large map, but what we can do is limited. I personally like the level design of 1 and 2 more. RE3 More of an action game. More enemies. There are too many bullets. One of the best parts of the game compared to 1 and 2 is the tension. Nemesis is probably a villain that went down in game history. It's really scary. And that music... There are also various options when deciding. This adds replayability to the game. This is a very good development.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis caps off the original RE trilogy amazingly. Raccoon City feels like a mini open world in this game. The Nemesis encounters are awesome and the choice system adds a good bit of replay value. The Mercenaries mode is also a fun addition that can boost your time played.. Survival horrors are probably my favorite games of all time: they possess both fantastic masterfully precise gameplay and outstanding groundbreaking plot. However, I personally value the last more than the first, so I would choose Silent Hill over Resident Evil anytime... ...Or at least I thought so until today. Even being 23 years old, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis holds unbelievably good even nowadays: it presents a perfect cocktail, featuring classic RE gameplay but with fastened pace, so it makes the game more dynamic and challenging; graphics are worse than those in Silent Hill, but still quite decent and stylish; camera angles, sound and game design make for an immersive experience, which naturally thrills your blood. Nemesis is a perfect video game foe as well - he's creepy, tough, unpredictable and fast. Moreover, you can never guess which second he appears - and he keeps appearing no matter how many times you kill him. Furthermore, he follows you either until you reach a safe place or until your death (more likely) Puzzles are sadly not as tricky as I was promised. Nevertheless they are almost perfectly set: they aren't particularly hard, but it takes a while to figure out hat to do and how to do. Every riddle is unique and brings tons of fun. I'm not quite sure if RE3 is better than RE4 subjectively. However, I have no choice but to accept my lust for classic survival horrors and give Nemesis 10/10, being my favorite game in the series. If you haven't played this game yet, you definitely must give it a chance. Despite ancient graphics and clunky gameplay, it's still one of the best games in its genre. Peace.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Now, those choices are pretty amazing. I hope they appear in the Resident Evil 3 Remake!. Userscore too high. They were at the top of Best user rated games of all time.. I just played this on original PlayStation for the first time after playing RE2 on PS1 also for the first time. It’s not quite as good as RE2 (which I rate a 9/10 game) in that it’s a little shorter and the enemy Nemesis can be irritating at times. I don’t mind tank controls, however, the sluggish nature of moving around a fast paced enemy doesn’t work quite well. You’ll find yourself dying on Hard mode simply because your character doesn’t turn left or right as quickly as you need them to. The environments look great and there’s much of the vibe from RE2 carried over. The puzzles are decent too. I had to laugh at times when Carlos would keep running off for no reason but it usually meant something cool was around the corner. A minor complaint, similar to RE2, is that there are too many doors and gates to open. It might seem really trivial but when you’re moving back and forth around environments and you have to watch a door open for 5 seconds each time, it robs you of the feeling of agency. Another thing worth pointing out is that RE3 Nemesis was released in 1999, 1 to 2 years after some amazing games like Super Mario 64, Goldeneye 007 and Ocarina of Time. While a totally different genre, the 3D objects in the game (like the player character and enemies) really highlight the PS1’s age by 1999. It’s made up for by amazing pre-rendered backgrounds, though. I absolutely love survival horror and this game met my expectations but didn’t exceed them. I would’ve liked a longer adventure such as more buildings to explore and perhaps a few more sidekicks to meet along the way. Still very much a recommended title to play if you have original hardware with a dual shock controller.. I like this game series. Definitely worth a try if you haven't still tried it. The music is also good.. Totally unmatched, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis is still to this day the best game of the original trilogy, it captures both action and horror in the best way possible and has a great replay value for the choice system like no other, its a shame that the remake totally failed to bring the same essence that this title gave us in the past.. One of the best resident eviL games ever made and one of the best survival horror games of all time and also one of the best ps1 games the Atmosphere of Raccoon city is unforgetable. Out of the original trilogy RE3 is my favorite. This game still holds up imo if your into the classic style Resident Evil games.. Awesome game dude I love it so much its really amazing and it's really cool well done wow. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best survival horror games of all time. (seventy-five characters). Best game of the original trilogy, it totally perfects every aspect of the previous two games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is baffling to me that no one talks about this game anymore... mention resident evil 3, and people automatically think you're talking about the remake, which people think is the only version of the game to exist. Say what you will about the new game, but when I was growing up in the 2000's, no matter who you were, when any one said ""Resident Evil"" people immediately thought of two things. Jill Valentine, and Nemesis. These two are, without a doubt, one of THE MOST iconic pair in horror video gaming history. People who don't play video games know who these two are, even if they don't know their names, THATS how well known they are. When the remake came out last year, people took the opportunity to say just how BAD **** the original Resident Evil 3 Nemesis was. The people who've said this have never played the game, and it's very obvious. Because you know what? I played this game for the first time just this last month. It has become my all time favorite Resident Evil Game. Tank controls are something to get used to, but when you do get use to them, you barely notice it. Dodging enemies is also very satisfying to pull off. I think it is literally one of the greatest horror games ever. It is that good to me. Yes, I've played RE2 and 1, and honestly this one is much more fun. Don't get me wrong, they're all good games, I enjoyed 1 and 2 very much, but 3 is like that game that transcends the series to me. You don't need to know Resident Evil to know who Jill and Nemesis are to each other, they're like David and Goliath. And it is a damn shame how they were handled in the remake.","despite its shorter playtime and single campaign, RE3 still features a ton of replay value . despite its shorter playtime and single campaign, RE3 still features a ton of replay value . despite its shorter playtime and single campaign, RE3 still features a ton of replay value ."
