628.Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath,"a small masterpiece superb job from Oddworld you stranger a mysterious bounty hunter hunting across Oddworld for a mysterious life saving surgery. the plays with the third person first person shooter concept, using various oddworld animals as amino a must play. Usually I'm not huge on shooters unless it's something made by valve, but MAN is this game great. Somehow they managed to combine platforming, first person shooting, and puzzle solving, all into one package that never feels jarring to play! Combine that with an excellent setting, unique characters, and an interesting story, and you get an all-time xbox classic. It's amazing how well this game has aged. Pick it up if you have the chance, it's not that expensive on ebay.. I remember seeing information about this game before it came out that got me excited. I'd played Abe's Odyssey and Munch's Odyssey, and I enjoyed both; They put you in interesting, immersive (though fairly linear) environments where you feel a strange familiarity with foreign creatures, in a sense commenting on our own connection with nature. So when I saw they were making more of a shooter, I was pretty excited; These developers have a sense of grittiness that's relatable, so I was curious to see how that would turn out in an outlaw-type protagonist. Personally I am a fan of platformer / shooter games, like Ratchet and Clank. However, this title unfortunately didn't feel quite like an organically pointed experience like the other Oddworld titles I played, though I never did finish this game. My main issue with it is that it seemed to get a bit repetitive to me, which was strange considering the mechanics weren't exactly stale. I think it was a mix of controls being just short of precise, without much guiding the way in terms of incentive for side questing, leading to a little bit too linear of a progression for me. That said, it is still an Oddworld game so the characters still have their own unique charm. Still recommended for any fans of the series, though I'd recommend starting with a different game if you haven't tried an Oddworld game yet.. One of the only games of it's kind. Amazing story, gameplay mechanics and character progression. Your character 'Stranger' never gets boring.. OH MY GOD!!! HD VERSION!!! YEAH... but original game was... better? I don't know why, but I think that new version is different than old. I'm weird, i understand. This game's my childhood, like Ghost Master or... uhhhm... Whatever. I don't like Munch Oddysee or Abe's Exoddus. Only Stranger's Wrath. :). Marking a change from the previous puzzle based instalments in the Oddworld series Strangers Wrath is best described as First Person Shooter. Fortunately it has more than enough personality, from the interesting lead character to the amusing selection of live ammo, to set it apart from the crowd. Add to this a solid control scheme and, despite the odd minor fault, you are looking at 15-20 hours of great entertainment.","a mysterious bounty hunter hunting across Oddworld for a mysterious life saving surgery . the plays with the third person first person shooter concept, using various oddworld animals as amino . it's amazing how well this game has aged, and it's not that expensive on ebay ."
629.Rise of Nations: Thrones & Patriots,"Although the gameplay is similar to a lot of games the engine and customization is vastly superior to many aaa titles out there even to today's standards. Eg. You can create unique challenges and place all units where you want them (recreate historical fights), change the stats of certain units to rebalance a story, download 100s of mods and scenarios to keep things fresh. Much more replayability than similar titles. This is the best strategy game I know of. Love it. Sure I can see it may not hold up today for all players. But for me its an old favorite.. Who can wonder a game that is a decade old with only simple 2D graphics could offer much entertainment even after few years. can believe that im still waiting to get bored with this game. imean, playing one session of 2-3 hours to get me tired and stopped, for a moment though. no more comments. this is a very good game!. With civilization 4, it's the game wicht i have played the most and when now I play at this game, I unterstand why. The editor of map is very good ( this is the best I have ever seen ). It is the best strategy game i have eve played it has so many things to offer to bat it is an old game, i would love to see a fresh new ron game with the same gampley like the original but with the next-gen graphics it was the best game at his time and it still deserve a place in the history of games totally worth playing even now afer a decade from his lunch. Rise of Nations is a fantastic RTS with great features. Government is an addition added in this expansion that adds a nice layer of gameplay to an already great game. Many new civilizations are added in the expansion pack on top of the ones already there, each with their own special power. The Conquer the World Campaigns are fun and challenging, and teach you a few things about history too. This is a great game and an essential game for any strategy fan.. Awesome game, if you like real time strategy, then play this game, a wonderful experience and delightful to play.","this is the best strategy game i know of. love it . can believe that im still waiting to get bored with this game . if you like real time strategy, then play this game, a wonderful experience ."
63.Gears of War,"I've played through the series and found the unique gameplay refreshing but always just found the games okay. I don't know why but all the games are basically the same to me and I wouldn't prefer one over the other. I would recommend though just for the unique gameplay.. I remember really liking this game as a kid, which is why I believe for its time it was a great game. However, this game did not age well. For the lack of the narrative there isn't much to bring it back to life. The story is overall very weak, the writing can be very simple and the gameplay has 30 minutes of new and exciting content stretched across the entire game. Which ultimately makes the game predictable and feel like a drag. We have to give gears its credit tho with its characters like Marcus and dom, who arent the most exciting characters ever but they serve their purpose. Also its influence on third person shooters.. The game feels significantly overrated. I didn't enjoy the game at all. Major flaws of the game: - Limited Enemy Variety: The lack of diverse enemy types makes the gameplay feel repetitive and monotonous over time. - Poor Companion AI: The companions are really dumb, frequently rushing into enemies and getting incapacitated - Inadequate Checkpoint Placement, sometimes before the cutscene or unskipable dialogue. Really fun and relentless. The story is mid but the overall experience is a good time. Revolutionized cover-based shooting and the gunplay holds up today still.. Gears of War is a masterpiece. In hindsight, it is the weakest of the trilogy; however, it set a foundation for its sequels to improve on. Gears of War has a stunning art direction that is let down by a lack luster plot, but makes up for it with its high-octane action.. One of the best games on the 360 the games main issue is that its kind of boring to look at because of how grey everything is. The worst of the trilogy, but not really bad in any sense. It probably has the most rough graphics of any game, which, personally, I LOVE. The story is ok, didnt really take me that much as other trilogy, the contolling has sometimes flaws, but thats probably becouse of my controller.. A Brutal Masterpiece – The Gold Standard for Action Games! Gears of War isn’t just a game; it’s a visceral, unforgettable experience that redefined the third-person shooter genre and set a new standard for action-packed storytelling. From the moment you pick up the controller, it’s clear that Gears is something special, delivering relentless intensity, stunning visuals, and a gripping story that will keep you hooked from start to finish.Groundbreaking Combat & Gameplay:The cover-based shooting mechanic in Gears of War revolutionized the way we think about action games. Every firefight feels tactical and explosive, as you leap from cover to cover, chainsawing through enemies and unloading rounds of pure destruction. The combat is perfectly balanced, fast-paced, and brutally satisfying. Few games make you feel the weight of every shot and every kill like Gears. The Lancer and its chainsaw bayonet? Absolutely iconic.Epic Campaign & Gripping Story:The world of Gears of War is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece, drenched in the raw emotion of survival and brotherhood. The campaign is filled with unforgettable moments, from massive firefights to quiet, character-driven scenes that give the story emotional depth. Marcus Fenix, along with his squad of battle-hardened soldiers, isn’t just fighting for survival – they’re fighting for the very future of humanity. The story’s pacing is flawless, blending high-octane action with moments of real intensity and heart.Unmatched Visuals & Atmosphere:At the time of its release, Gears of War pushed the boundaries of what we thought possible in video game graphics. The war-torn landscapes, the terrifying Locust Horde, and the larger-than-life set pieces are all beautifully crafted, creating a bleak but mesmerizing world. Even today, the gritty, post-apocalyptic visuals hold up remarkably well, and the atmosphere is thick with tension and urgency.Legendary Multiplayer:The multiplayer in Gears of War is nothing short of legendary. From the adrenaline-pumping team-based modes to the intense 1v1 shotgun duels, Gears multiplayer is as brutal as it is competitive. The satisfaction of executing an opponent with a perfectly timed chainsaw or pulling off a clutch shotgun blast is unmatched. It’s the kind of multiplayer experience that keeps you coming back for more, whether you’re battling with friends or climbing the ranks solo.Sound Design & Music that Elevates Everything:The sound design in Gears of War is a symphony of destruction. Every gunshot, explosion, and chainsaw rip feels thunderous and weighty, pulling you even deeper into the chaos of battle. The soundtrack perfectly complements the action, heightening the intensity of combat and amplifying the emotion of the quieter, more somber moments.Conclusion:Gears of War is nothing less than a masterpiece. It set the bar for what a third-person shooter could be and remains one of the most thrilling, cinematic, and intense experiences in gaming. Whether you’re fighting through the unforgettable campaign or battling it out in the multiplayer arena, Gears of War delivers on every front. It’s a must-play for any fan of action games and a gold standard that has inspired countless titles since.A brutal, exhilarating triumph – Gears of War is an unforgettable classic that still dominates the action genre!. The tempo of the game is very good. I want to play it all the time, it's one of my favorite games.. Banging! I was late to the series and played backwards but all have been great!. Man.. my childhood game, though i shouldnt be playing this when i was that young but its one of the most memorable for me. Awesome gameplay and especially the couch co-op splitscreen function with my friends was the best experience ever. Really love the hammerburst and the saw rifle in this game. Raam is a menacing villain. This game is when xbox was at its peak at the time.. A complete game , story , action , sound and shock factor . The vibe is military scifi with a horror element . A lot of dark and bloody scenes , small scale puzzles and traversing mixed with coop mechanics makes for a really fun experience alone or with a friend . The characters are really interesting but don't get full development arcs . 360 - XB1 gen enhancements , on Series X the enhanced edition runs really smooth . The 360 edition runs a little clunky but tolerable. Gears of War is an exceptional game that truly stands out in the gaming industry. The game not only captivates players with its stunning graphics and intense gameplay, but it also delivers an incredibly well-crafted storyline that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dark and gritty atmosphere of the game adds an extra layer of depth, creating a truly immersive experience. From the intricate character development to the meticulously designed environments, every aspect of Gears of War showcases the dedication and talent of the development team. In conclusion, Gears of War is a masterpiece that combines amazing gameplay, a gripping storyline, and a dark and gritty atmosphere, making it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast.. After almost 18 years since the game's release I finally get to try it, for a 2006 game it still surprisingly holds up some of the mechanics though playing this in 2024 can find many notice many problems such as famedrops and the aiming mechanics. To start with, the game seems unoptimized for the console as there are many framedrops and a rough frame rate and it gets really noticeable if you are on a heavy combat. The aiming mechanics feels stiff and clunky and its hard to focus your aim properly on the enemy especially when controlling the recoil making you miss most of the shots (personal experience) For its age, the story and gameplay is still pretty solid it also keeps its replay value and still enjoyable. ""Gears of War"" hasn't aged well, but it was the best action game of 2006. Like ""Halo"" and ""Resident Evil 4"", it pushed the genre forward with innovations. Cover-based shooting had been done before, but ""Gears"" refined it. At the time of release, the game's level design, graphics and multiplayer were cutting edge. It might not hold up well today, but ""Gears"" ranks up with ""Bioshock"" and ""Call of Duty 4"" as a truly great achievement. I would rate it with a 9.4 out of 10.. This is a must have for if you have a pc or a 360. would recommend the first three and maybe the 4 and 5. mass effect is one of my all-time favorite game series of all time. it has amazing missions and a wide plethora of interesting characters. i've always loved exploring the galaxy and learning about the deep political dynamics of the different species and how those dynamics shift with the looming threat of the reaper invasion. very good game.. To be fair. I played this on 2023. game’s concept still great. story just decent but acceptable cause this game’s on just shooting right.about bad things that is unique feature. I don’t like reload system. it’s so annoying and running camera angle and motion is so bad. bugs everywhere every maps every times. I don’t understand how people on 2006 can actually play this game.. Great game to play on split screen. And just a good game even after all these years. A gunfight mechanism for all times.. Great game. Played it in 2023, on my Xbox One. I was pretty surprised considering such an old game can be so fun and inovative. World,weapons and cutscenes were so **** game from time to time changes the playing style, so it doesnt get boring. Enjoyed it from the start to finish, i cant wait to play the sequels.. One of the most fun online games ive played in my life. Hours and hours of fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gameplay - 8 Plot & Characters - 7 Storytelling - 7 Pacing - 9 Music & Sound - 8 Replayability - 8 Performance - 10. Gears Of War 1 is the best out of the 5 games. It was a game changer for the industry which helped a great deal the sales of Xbox 360s. 1-3 Are amazing, 1 is the best and is a must play. Gears Of War 1 is a masterpiece. The only problem i had with it was when people cheated with the running cheat where they'd be extra fast. The glitch where you could get out of the map and climb around was super fun. I have a lot of fond memories with friends that I'm still great friends with way back from 2006. We Loved Gears Of War and still do. GET THIS GAME. Fun, meaty third person shooting. One of the most satisfying combat designs in all shooters, its just so much fun to play. And there's such a weight and crunch to everything! The super macho brickhouse dudes aren't interesting, but they fill the need as vehicles of carnage.. It did start a lot of things, but it's strange if you play it after you've finished a lot of other gears of war games, still a must-play tho, without any doubts.. There's a reason this games considered a classic. From the moment you not it up it pulls you into an adrenaline rush of an action title. The controls haven't aged well at all, but when you take into account when it released, the cover system was the way to go back then. There's also gore galore, and if you have a buddy, some awesome co-op to be had here. Gears of War is an excellent, fun time with friends or alone.. Revisiting a classic. Whereas Halo was the clean, spacefaring original, Gears of War was the grungier, blood-soaked younger brother. A great story with lead characters modeled after the muscle-bound action stars of the 80s, honestly, the game still holds up well, even after all these years. I've heard there's a possibility that the original trilogy will be getting a full remake, as well as a new entry in the series. Fingers crossed.. i liked it but it did have some problems loading completely sometimes apart from that it was a great game. Fantastic game, wish the save department was better but apart from that it's brillant. Nearly a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Slow, buggy, ugly, awful, with checkpoint right before cutscenes, but not after. I have no idea why people may like it. Maybe 360 was their first console and Gears of War was their fist game?. You might hear someone saying: ""Gears of War didn't invent the cover system in TPSs, Kill Switch did""; true but there was a before and after Gears, NOT a before and after Kill Switch. Gears was the watershed in third-person shooters, that's the point. And also importantly, unlike Kill Switch, Gears of War turned out to be a great, critically acclaimed and best seller video game and one of the most important ever released. It's clear Gears wanted to establish a new video game universe. However the game itself does not exude a deep lore and an important introduction is made in the game's manual, which would have been better if made as an in-game opening video instead. The plot flows well and is engaging from start to finish, the characters work, Marcus is iconic and the writing of the game is solid enough to keep the whole thing up, while being nothing special and at times even a bit mediocre. The plot effectively gives a sad, dark and ""last hope"" mood. Gears made the TPSs gameplay as we know it today, which is not how we knew it before Gears. The gameplay structure is solid and did not aged much, it's still contemporary. The cover system, not new but innovative in how it's implemented, works great. The system leads to stay behind a cover position and to choose with the analog stick where to move to the next cover, like the player is being guided, performing various tactical moves. Gears also notably introduced mechanics like blind fire while behind cover and shooting by the hip, which would become widespread in the genre. The game has slower pacing than other TPSs, character movement is clunky and heavy. The enemy AI is very good and aggressive, it's not rare that, despite the slow pacing, locusts launch fierce assaults, pushing forward combat and even flanking, effectively nullifying cover and forcing movement. This way, the gameplay ensures very engaging shootouts, also thanks to a great level design, for the most part. ""Active reload"" mechanic is interesting: push RB to reload, let the reload finish or risk and push RB again; if done well-timed the reload will be faster, if not, the weapon will jam and slow the reload. It's nice that sometimes the player can choose different paths for reaching the level objectives, even if this only has a limited impact. I did not find the squad orders particularly useful, whether they are used or not seems to make little difference; allied AI doesn't seem as smart as enemies'. The game is violent, with a high gore rate. But Gears is not perfect. The game's communication of the player's health is impractical, the whole screen color should communicate health status, instead of a symbol around the reticle. Grenade launch system uses a weird trajectory, it does not allow a complete movement of the view downside. The design here was simply immature for such a watershed game. Now the serious flaws. The game is playable in single-player but it's clear how many parts were made above all, I repeat above all, with the coop in mind, which can lead to irritating situations with allied AI; this could have influenced design of some parts within the ""Insane"" skill level, since ""oh, well, it's doable in coop so who cares"". Which is not good nor honest, Epic, cause the game has been sold also as a single-player game. Similarly, except for the lower ""Casual"" skill level, enemies take too much damage to die, as the skill level increases both their damage and health, making them annoying bullet sponges: a helmetless drone locust should die with a single head shot by any kind of firearm; it doesn't. Generally, there is a too large gap between the lowest and the two highest skill levels. Lancer chainsaw bayonet executions leave the player vulnerable to damage: that's lack in game design basics. Checkpoints are misplaced, sometimes not only for the purpose of artificially increasing difficulty, but simply out of bad design, making the player repeat boring parts after reload. Graphically, I mean, it's Gears of War. It was Unreal Engine 3's technology showcase game and aged very well. Those graphics were incredible in 2006, showing Xbox 360 power and it's a nice game to look at even today, especially in environments and models visuals, with solid frame rate performance. We all wanted to play Gears after watching the historical graphically accurate Kosinki preview trailer with Mad World. Everyone wanted to ""jump in"", even those who waited more than a decade to, like I did. With Gears of War video game history was made, to the point of it symbolising a whole era. A game with great gameplay and an out-of-scale technical side, which gathered the past, gave a new face to an entire genre and contributed the most to a new wave of games. It has some serious flaws but they are overwhelmed by what good the game offers nonetheless. It's a recommended video game for all lovers of the genre, even worth getting an Xbox 360 for it today.. I don't know how many games out there make you feel like a real alpha male: the only title that comes to mind is Crysis... the only title beside Gears of War. This game is soaked in testosterone, it literally flows through your screen - everything is made with one goal in mind: to make it look as badass as possible. Just google ""Gears of War"", take a look at the main character(s) and realize: that's how an ultimate alpha male should look like. They actually look more like aliens than humans :) The point is they look badass, their armor looks badass, their weapons look badass. But wait, there's more. I don't know if you noticed but architecture in ""Gears of War"" is ASTONISHING (as someone who understands nothing in architecture I came up with the ""urban neoclassicism"" term to describe that style ). Architecture is astonishing not only because the buildings look ""cool"" but also because their overall style perfectly fits the atmosphere of the world so as a result we get this completely coherent picture with immense power of immersion. Speaking of immersion: you only see HUD when you really need to see it! More game developers should implement this approach. Okay, I've realized it would be better to make the rest of the review in a form of a list: What I liked: - The game has no map. Thanks to the great level design you are never truly in need of one. - The music is **** gorgeous. No wonder it's set too loud by default - it's almost like the developer knows the music is awesome and just makes sure you won't miss it ;) - What else I liked is that there is no prologue, no intro, no explanation - you're just thrown into the middle of the mess and have to figure out everything on your own in the process. What is most important you really want to dig deeper into the history of the world. - Shaky camera. It is such a small detail but so important for the overall presentation. What I didn't like: - I was playing the game alone so I had to completely rely on AI of my companions and believe me when I tell you it is broken. They easily could just stop for no reason and you would have to move forward without them. - Even though the game is rather hard than easy it has no deal supplying SO MANY BULLETS throughout the game. There wasn't a single moment where I run out of ammo. They could as well just make the bullets infinite. - At first I wanted to say how the final boss is too hard but after I actually defeated him I realized how actually easy he is (if you know how to deal with him, of course) and that's the problem - the final boss shouldn't be so easy/simple. Conclusion Overall, I really liked Gears of War for its atmosphere and the overall design and presentation. It 100% lived up to the hype and the fact it was released in 2006 is really impressive. I didn't expect the ""manliness"" this game brings to the table but that's what it does: the ultimate simultator of an alpha male if you ask me, I think your father would enjoy this one. On the other hand, I am curius, what do women think of this title? Is it even possible for them to enjoy something so masculine as Gears of War? My rating score for Gears of War is 8 out of 10.. A dull, monotonous, drawn-out game with no plot. Even for a game of 2007.... 10/10. Just a perfect game! It has good gameplay and cool story. Can't wait to play Gears of War 2!. Pretty dull when it's all said on done, combat feels meaty in parts but complete absence of story and dull characters drag the game right down. How did this become a franchise?. Sensation game one of best XBOX TITLE after halo! When you start this game you can’t get enough it!. SPLASH....... is the sound Gears of War made when it first came onto the scene.. It`s been a long time since this game came out, but I wanted to enter the franchise with the first game. You cannot compare it with shooters of 2021, but it will be a great and satisfying experience. The controls are great, but sometimes messy as your character will not do what you are commanding. The story is deep and rich. Is´t definitely a must play and you will enjoy it no matter in which year you play it.. Gears of war was a next gen master piece to some back in 2006 but in 2021 the game has aged like milk, this is not the games fault itself but the onslaught of generic 3ps games that followed using similar mechanics and engines, this may be my first time playing gears of war but i feel like iv played it a million times already STORY: who cares you get to kill monsters ............................. OK fine you play as Doom Fenix chief guy who was court martialed for some reason ( the game never says) or dose any characterization besides the character designs and the fact that Dom and Marcus are good buddy's and watch each others backs , so yeah kill monsters save the world nut with plot holes , lots of plot holes , why was Marcus in jail ? why did only baried know they were at marcus's house , why did the resonator not work then in the same cut scene another character hacks something non chalantly making the entire mission pointless i donno and neither dose the game STory: 3/10 World building: the world is a little more realized than the story , enemy's interact with the world in believable ways , bats hate light and die from it , suicidy enemy's run at you and blow up , alien high honors guards , despite the locusts being neither bugs nor aliens the are a mole people that dig and have their own language and stuff it seems , but who cares what their society is or why they are trying to kill humans they are cannon fodder World building: 6/10 Graphics : the game is brown and black and dark its EDGY and that's how we liked our games back in 2006 but now i had a hard time even seeing straight , this game is ugly very ugly , the scale is also off , Marcus is huge and has huge armour yet everything is bigger than him so he can take cover , only models that are any good are the character models , even the guns are awkwardly sized and shaped but for 2006 the game looks OK just ok graphics 5/10 Gameplay : this is a hard one for me to judge the gameplay to me was really repetitive and generic but i know this game was the first to be repetitive and generic 3rd person shooter , it popularized the cover mechanic witch iv seen done before , maybe not this well but its been done before mostly in stealth action shooters, but this is much more fluid than that with halo influenced dual stick design and a more powerful engine . the shooting is ok i guess , the shot gun was a highlight as shotguns usually are in shooters , the automatics had about as much punch as a 12 year old bully's slingshot the sniper was very situational and the triple burst gun was just awful , revolver was fun and powerful and i used it the whole game as soon as i could , bolt gun was weird but useful at times , the chainsaw was easily the coolest and clunkiest part of the game , this game takes time to get good at witch i like. checkpoints where almost always before a cut scene of story bit so if you died you would have to listen to the same dialogue over and over again until it pissed you off so much you stopped dying , i bet the coop was fun as its constantly splitting you and a partner up going down different paths and the like , over all the gameplay was good , it was definitely designed by gamers and it shows Gameplay: 7/10 Sound design: voice acting was very good when a character speaks I believed what they were saying , gun sounds for the most part are good , shot gun again being the best , in 2006 there are some clever tricks , screams are louder than most other audio ( I hated this cause I was a playing late at night while every ones asleep but cant fault the game for that ) over all the audio quality was good Sound design : 7/10 3+6+5+7+7=28 285 = 5.6/10. This game is one hell of a time to play through. The graphics, while not great, still hold up surprisingly well to this day, the gameplay is also quite fun, and it has a pretty good story. One of my problems is the environment. Everything is grey and brown. I know that is the point of it, but it takes away a bit from the experience for me. Second problem is the mission length. Each mission can easily last over 30 minutes, which makes them a chore to crawl through. It certainly isn't a groundbreaking experience, but if you are a fan of shooters it's worth a try.. This game is pretty good, i enjoyed the story and it's nothing like i've ever played before. The guns are different and the lancer is extremely satisfying to use when you slice through an enemy. The characters are ok but the action is what i was mainly focused on because there really isn't much to do with the characters. The multiplayer was ok, the good thing about it was that there were a ton of new and interesting game modes i'd want cod to try out. Overall this game is pretty good but not the best ever.. Simply a fantastic shooter with great visuals, gunplay and atmosphere even despite its weak story.. This game was the reason why i chose x360 in that **** after,when i finished with GOW I was sure,that i chose well. Great game. Fun and unique playing style with enjoyable characters. The only thing keeping it from a 10 is a not very clear story.. Gears of War is a good game. But unfortunately the shaking camera makes me dizzy..

GREAT GAME WITH A BADASS SLAP CERTIFIED Story: 9 Gameplay: 8 ost: 9 Characters: 10. Is amazing. Great buy. Masterpiece. Excellent game, honestly. Graphics 10/10 Story 9/10 Characters 10/10 Gameplay 9/10. An epic start to one of my favorite franchises. Gears of War tells an interesting story with fantastic characters to root for, and super fun combat in both single player, and multiplayer.. Looking at this game for the first time on an HD tv was something to behold. I got a 360 because of it and had to upgrade to an HD tv immediately. This game tho, was good without that. It's a great adventure with amazing set pieces and world. The gameplay is so satisfying and good to look at.. In my opinion the best game of all the gears of war franchise, really good characters and a great ending. Gears of War was absolutely one of if not the best cover based shooter. Fun story and characters!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just a really cool game. Nothing crazy in narrative but the combat is brutal and fun.. Masterpiece, fun, amazing mechanics, nice gameplay, combats are brutal as must mean to be. A legendary game and the pilar for the genre with great graphics for the time and excellent gameplay.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. It was already a fun game to begin with but it was also the first time I ever witnessed a gun with a built in chainsaw... that's tuff. An amazing game with few flaws. It made the 3rd person shooter popular, with it's great and unique gameplay and enjoyable story.. A seriously good action cover shooter that had amazing graphics and sound effects when it released and was the perfect game to release as a launch title with Xbox 360.. I'll be frank, the game didn't age well. I admit it was revolutionary at it's time, but in 2019 it feels like most of the third person shooters. But it's not a bother, because I know it was one of the first ones, and it shows. The story and the mechanics are simple. The gameplay it's quite repetitive, but it's somehow enjoyable enough to keep you going. Yeah, maybe I couldn't play more than one act per day, but this didn't diminish my enjoyment. I played on hard mode, and boy, they meant it at that time when you selected hard mode. 2 hours of my life were spent on the last boss, because instead of a tactical shooter, it was like a clos-call puzzle game for me. One missed bullet, and my chances of beating it were done for. It was simply madness, and I wouldn't recommend hard mode if you just want to pass through the game like butter, because not only the last boss was hard, but other areas felt like I was the only one of my team who wanted to finish them. Speaking about teammates, they're simply ****. I know the A.I. wasn't top notch in 2006, but I swear to you, on hard mode, they didn't make any difference. Their guns were basically shooting blanks, I bet the enemies would laugh for days in real life at what damage my teammates were dealing. They weren't funny, they were frustrating most of the times, and it lowered my emotional attachment to the characters, because I couldn't help myself but feel glad if one of these dimwits died. But the characters, pushing aside the gameplay, are good, not extraordinary, but good enough. What made me say this is their pure synergy, the bromance visible in every cutscene. These guys are big guns wielding hulks. You can't help but feel badass throughout your entire play. The world and lore is simple to understand. It had straightforward levels with little spaces to explore for collectibles and ammo supplies, but I would not advise exploration if you're not a completionist, because most areas are stale, and you would enjoy much more viewing the scenery and level design rather than seeking cog tags. If you want more details about the world, you can read the comics or simply play the other games, because they give you enough details for the main plots. That's what I very much enjoy about this game: everything about it is straight to the point, it focuses on every aspect which it presents and nails most of them. I can'","the story is overall very weak, the writing can be very simple and the gameplay has 30 minutes of new and exciting content stretched across the entire game . in hindsight, it is the weakest of the trilogy; however, it set a foundation for its sequels to improve on ."
630.Sid Meier's Pirates!,"This game is really good, but players can get lost pretty easily unless they spend hours playing it to understand the missions. For example, I kept bringing governors to different towns only to enter without them, and then they get pissed off and left, or they died. Pirate ship battles are a blast (no pun intended), and plundering is cool. But duels with captains are monotonous (I won just about every duel by spamming “thrust”) and sailing can get pretty stale having to find a good gust of wind to get you going.. One of the best pirates games. Has all mechanics which good pirates game should has.. it is a fun and simple pirates game it is also very enteraining. it is easy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There are some good improvements of the classic Pirates game: Now you are much better introduced into the game and you have a much better overview,what to do. You have a map now, you are introduced into the story by a cutscene, you have a menu with many informations. This was a big problem in the old game. But still this is the biggest problem of the game. There are too many informations hidden: about the special items, the difference between the ships, why beautiful daughters are better then plain and so on. You need an overview about all the gossips you get from the taverns also But the biggest problem is the atmosphere: it is so childish now. The ""language"" is like in Sims, the art design aweful. Many gameplay mechanics are minigames and basically quick time events. This is a huge step behind the classic game. So the game mechanics are too simple, but on the other side this game is confusing, because you dont have siffucient overview, what to do. . The gameplay has even more mistakes: after 5 hours the game begins to be a grind and repetitive. For example you need to find and fight several times against the main villains. The sword duels and dancing minigames start to be annoying and dumb. After some time the crew wants to divide the fortune and you lose almost everything: your ships,goods and the crew. You have only one ship left. This is stupid and not immersive. Why do you loose all the goods and ships? I get back into the game only with a guide on internet. Now this game has more fun: Now I know how to handle the division of the fortune, that it doesnt hurt so much. Now I know which ships to attack and which to make as a flagship. The biggest strength of the game is the setting. There are almost no good pirates games out there and this game shows, how fun it can be.. If you want an immersive pirate adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously and is chock-full of mini-games Sid Meier's Pirates! is the game for you. Yes, the game is starting to show its age so maybe it's again due for a remake but I really can't fault the gameplay and the game remains my favourite game about pirates, except for the The Secret of Monkey Island of course :). I had a very good times with this game, back in the days. It’s a pirate simulator full with nostalgia elements. + Good and funny animations. + Great strategics elements. + Arrrrr! There is still no game in recent years that compares it. I like it a lot.. No depth whatsoever, and you begin to see this within the first 2 hours of the gameplay: - Only 5 goods to trade - You never know if you should switch to a different ship because you don't know if it's going to be better or worse - You don't know how many canons your ship can support - You win all hand-to-hand battles by just pressing buttons (and you ALWAYS win) - Sea Battles are extremely repetitive (board and kill the captain - don't even need canons) and become unnecessary tedious if the wind is unfavorable - Dancing? There is dancing? My Lord! - All cities are the same - come visit Tavern, sell ALL 5 goods (can't even buy anything, unless you play as a trader, but why play as a trader in a game called ""Pirates""?) - For Pete's sake - lack of basic Options in the game (no - you can't bind keys) and the tutorial give away this title as a joke and money grabber. This type of game - this genre in general - requires depth. Such games simply cannot exist without depth. This title is not worth to be played as a phone app, less so deserve to be called Sid Meier's.. I have played this on PC and on the PSP, and I can say this was one of my favorite games growing up. I have played countless hours on this game and I have to say it is an amazing game overall. I will also note that when I play this on windows 10, there are some occasional graphical glitches, however the game is still playable, and it doesn't seem to effect anything other than the visuals.. Firaxis at its best. A fantastic reboot of the original Pirates! game. Everything is there from the original and more (sneaking and dancing minigames). You get a great, stereotypical and ""kid friendly"" pirate adventure with good replay value. The graphics and effects are just right for the theme. The story missions can get repetitive over time. I wish for an update around 2018.. Yesterday I played Assassins Creed first time. I cried because this game was awful. Yesterday I played Sid Meier's Pirates! first time. I cried because this game was awesome.. This has been one of my favorite games for years, and it runs great on steam. You pick a nationality (which you can then blatantly ignore if you choose), board a ship and enter an open world pirate game with replayability rivaling any other game on the market. You can climb the list of greatest pirates on the sea, follow the main story or side missions, pillage cities, earn ranks in different nations militaries by killing rivals, whatever you wish. All this of course while maintaining a fleet, an increasingly agitated crew and trying not to get thrown in prison. I always love picking a nation and not stopping until every city carries their flag, but you pick how you want to play. I have over 1500 hours into this game across different platforms, accounts and I've bought it multiple times throughout the years (though with steam I never have to again!) and all I can say is, buy it.. Many hours of great Entertainment Feels like a piratmovie of the 50s but you are the maincharakter. This game has everything a good pirat RPG-Adventure needs. Only con is the clumsy gameplay.. The game is very much like the Mount and Blade series but it is sooooo repetitive! The game very overrated as it really does not have much to offer, after a few cannon and sword fight I really sad to discover that this was the only thing to do in the game. The graphics have really dated and I don't like the cartoon style at all, in fact I feel as if they where trying to keep the game child friendly for some reason.. Having just finished my umpteenth playthrough, I figure it's a good time to write a short review about this underrated gem. I've been a gamer for over 20 years. A relatively passionate one, and not one to generally like strategic games as much as the more action-y titles. The first time I was introduced to Sid Meier's Pirates was with this 2004 remake, in 2004/2005. Played through it, loved it, and sort of forgot about it. Since then, though, I've felt the urge to play it again and again. Sometimes it's after a year, sometimes a year and a half. But it always happens. That is a rare quality in a game, as most titles you beat once and forget about afterwards. It rarely happens with any game, and almost never with games that are this flawed. Pirates is repetitive, relatively shallow for a strategic game, and because it's rated E, it can be obnoxiously childish in tone as well. Plus some of the minigames are just downright tedious, the worst offender being ballroom dancing, that can luckily be skipped with a trainer. But none of the flaws overshadow the fact that Sid Meier's Pirates is FUN. Bringing criminals to justice, forcing that one unfortunate nation off the face of earth (for me it's usually Spain or France), plundering ships and towns, creating the strongest pirate army the world has ever seen, and retiring a legend.. With a bit of imagination, your journey truly becomes legendary -- if not for anyone else, then at least for you. And that's what counts. You start playing, and suddenly, nine hours have passed, and you have to fight against speaking in a pirate ""slang"" if you manage to somehow exit the game and actually venture outside your apartment for long enough to actually meet real humans. Actual humans, who never seem to have appreciation the struggles us pirates go through during the days after the game again draws you back for a new playthrough. And it will, faults and all. For me, Sid Meier's Pirates wasn't all THAT special when I first played it. But during the years, it's slowly brought itself up from behind, and joined the five games that I can honestly say I've loved during the 20-some years I've been around video games. A feat that almost rivals my latest career as a pirate, having retired as a 36 year old Governor of Campeche, with 180640 gold pieces, 37650 acres of land and a beautiful wife. I did everything that can be done in the game.. Except I only found eight hidden treasures. Which is undoubtedly something I will have to surpass on my next playthrough, in a year or so.. I enjoyed the original back in the old days, and this has everything that makes a good and enjoyable remake. It's been improved in all the rigth places (graphics and so on), the game mechanics have been reworked while retaining the spirit of the original. Hours and hours of good solid entertainment.. Gets an instant 10/10 for being the best pirate game ever made (don't believe those ""Monkey Island"" purists). The difficulty can be changed *while playing*. This is awesome! If you find you're having too easy a time plundering you can divide the loot and up the difficulty. Higher difficulty settings grant you access to different items to help you in your piracy and new quests. Your reflexes get slower with age, making swashbuckling duels tougher. There's all kinds of nice details like this waiting for you AFTER sinking everything French stops being ""fun"" and starts to feel more like ""community service"". All I can say is play it.. I have a love/hate relationship with this game. After every playthrough, I set it down declaring I will never play it again due to its repetitive gameplay. However, it seems, I can't help myself from coming back for just one more game. I would have assumed it was some sort of temporary charm from nostalgia, but the fact that I can't quit until I finish the entire thing again says otherwise. I'll easily concede that this isn't the freshest game on the market, but its excellent design, charming music and strong tone keep it as one of the contenders for my favorite game of all time.. Pirates is a great game fora nice long time and has a high replay value. What the other reviewers say is mostly true however, it gets very repetitive after extended amounts of play time. This is corrected however by raising the difficulty level! I found Journeyman difficulty much more exciting and rewarding than Apprentice, I think raising the difficulty level even once can make the game last hours more. The graphics are a bit outdated at this point, and the story is rather bland, but its certainly worth the 10$ it is on Steam!. Total Rubbish, boring, poor visuals, repetitive. Totally overrated, I just don't know how they give it 88, a score similar to half-life 2! I Would not finish this gave if you paid me too, 0 / 10.. Game's great, make no mistake, but there are some fatal flaws that make it awful or not lasting long enough. Here I'll try to devide + and - in sections: + Innovative gameplay, the difficulty rises slowly at your decision letting you get accustomed to the game. + Many minigames within one package, arcade naval warfare, arcade fencing, tactical assault of the cities, treasure hunting. + You can do many things in SM's Pirates, do quests, rob caravans, follow rumors, collect valuable items, romance royal women, upgrade your ship, board and capture other ships, represent one of 4 nations or meddle in their business and become a notorious pirate, give and receive gifts, share collected gold with your team, etcetera, etcetera... - Controls on the tactical map are just awful... Sometimes you hit Page Down instead of 7 and you automatically retreat from a fight. - The game is way too repetitive. The good experience will not last very long. - It's a sandbox arcade game. A good sandbox game is a game in which you have overwhelming amount of possibilities and everything is happening at random, making up for more fun! Although in Pirates, events are happening at random, randomly generated, they are getting old very fast, due to your limited possibilities e.g. you put your money in a bank, you have some items, but you don't have a character's doll, so at some point (very fast actually) all of the items are applied to your character and this aspect disappears from the game. Moreover, fencing challenging it may be at first, get's overly easy later on due to your equipment. Ship upgrades can only be made in specific cities (What?), so you'll have to sweep the damn Caribbean if you want to find them all. Back to the idea, all of your possibilities uncover VERY VERY fast, after that you don't discover anything new, everything else is just repetition of thing you did one hour ago. = Conclusion: A great game it may be, but it's way too lengthly for an Arcade and way too shallow for a Sandbox. While trying to get the best from each, SM's Pirates end up being none and losing it's greatness somewhere along the way.. I have been playing this game on and off for about five years now, and it I still love it. It's probably the second greatest RPG ever made. The story is pretty dumb, and the graphics aren't THAT great (but decent) and the sounds are fairly low quality at some points, but the sheer fun and addiction of the gameplay surpasses all of that. The main problem with the game however, is that is never really fresh. Once you have completed about three different quests or so, you've completed every quest in the game since every quest is practically the exact same thing.. This is how computergaming should be. You'll play for an hour, and when you finish, you discover 6 hours have past. It's oldish but the gameplay is so much fun, albeit frustrating at times. One can easily tell how much fun the developers had, when they created the game. Not without flaws, but by far the best pirates-game I know of. Uaaargh, ya lubbers.","this game is really good, but players can get lost pretty easily . after 5 hours the game begins to be a grind and repetitive . the biggest problem is the atmosphere: it is so childish now ."
631.EVE Online: Special Edition,"EVE Online is so complex and multifaceted that capturing its depth and possibilities in just a few sentences simply wouldn’t do it justice. Every player's experience is unique, influenced by countless factors—from the player-driven economy and the political intrigue of vast alliances to epic battles involving thousands of ships. EVE is a universe with a life of its own, where every player can become part of something far greater. To truly explain it, though, would require much more than a simple review.. One of the most controversial big games out there. Why? Because usually you have ""pay2play"", ""grind2play"" or similar models. Eve is ""pay2grind"": 1. You pay extremely expensive subscription (2x more expensive than i.e. World of Warcraft or other MMOs), then: 2. you wait for your in-game skills to rise (they rise passively, by just having subscription active, you can be offline - blatant cash grab), then you: 3. have a full-time job in-game to earn resources and credits, so you can finally: 4. play the f*** game... I can understand the subscription model, but the price is outrageous. I can understand the ""wait to train"" skill levelling model, but it just makes you ""pay now, come back to play in a month"" I can understand the absurd grind that makes 95% of the game content, but each other player LITERALLY waits to shoot you in the back to steal your resources (or just destroy it, just for fun, no gain). This game builds many clever mechanics and systems, but then meticulously sabotages them by connecting them together in the most malicious, infuriating, trolling way.. Best game ive played. So much to do in Eve. Great community and the art work is amazing for this game. No other game is like it.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Endless Isk grind for no tangible reward. PVP ****, since some clown who have played the game for 5+ years can just gank you, while you just want to explore. Skills are also slow and grindy af. This is a prime example of ""This is a very deep and complex game and you make your own fun"" Well yeah, the game is not going to do it for you. And there is no depth to the game, just a **** ton of random skills and grind. Oh yeah scamming is also encouraged in the game.. Very good space game. Mediocre story and game play but awesome community. Loved.. buggy interface, lousy anti-aliasing. Сontingent: just about 25% is european, paying CCP for everyone else and playing with themselves in 10-15 windows. with whom to play here? i cant moonspeak! mechanics just through the ass, but there are a lot of them, but in 20 years it was possible to do something humanoid. 這個白人怎麼說？. Developed by aholes for aholes. Predatory game where seasoned players cheap shot new players into dying a lot, because of developer encouraged scummy game mechanics. Never spend money on this game and save yourself the time and don't ever start playing it.. Hispanophobic Game. -respect. poor comunity acting like pirates trying to scam everyone.. I played this game for the first time 3 months ago. I nearly gave up while trying to complete the tutorial (which is so unhelpful and is the reason this isn't a 10/10) but for some reason decided to look up youtube tutorials and have logged on every day since. I should say that I'm not usually a fan of this RPG genre and prefer FPS PCP, or action adventure but something about the complexity of Eve Online has me obsessed.. Eve Online Summary by its developers Explicit or Implicit: enter a world of intrigue and possibilities where you can work together to shape this universe in whatever way you choose (e.g. Corporations, Fleets, Stocks, R&D, cooperate and build, cooperate and conquer, backstab, multi-day massive space battles for territory, espionage, etc.) Reality: They provide the tools to encourage conflict, and pay lip-service to cooperation. Because they're too clueless, defensive, or perhaps cynical to believe that people will also pay for a game where they can bring order to an unruly universe. They don't want this. They want you to destroy everything you and anyone might build so that their community will give them time and money to rebuild it. If after 17 years you haven't provided in game tools to support legal systems and governments. You're clearly just pretenders. You want people to destroy each other in spaceships. If that's your thing, endlessly, by all means have at, they'll pay lip service to the rest, but don't be fooled that this will ever be anything else. (Background: fortunately we never got **** into this. But you can see the destruction all around you. This is basically an engine with tools for sociopaths and griefers, which is apparently what the developers are).. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has so much going for it. 16 years online! Great community of player. Vastly different from certain other MMO's (Higher quality player for the most part). Open world that you can be anything from a miner to trader to faction PvP to space exploration and a million more. Nearly Unlimited potential for even non-paying ""Alpha"" players. vastly more potential for paying customers as well ""Omega."" (This is NOT a pay to win by any means). The Guild concept is replaced by Corporations that in itself begins a more extensive journey. Regarding Young Kids: I would rather have a child play this game than World of Warcraft or GTA are any of the other Jump Scare type games. There is no scantly clad females in armor, there is no **** etc. Yes there is violence but to an extent of no different that watching an episode of Start Trek (any version) on TV. This is NOT hello Kitty by any means but a vastly better choice than many of the current MMO games. HOWEVER as with any MMO. Be vigilant as to whom your child is communicating with, this pertains to any online game. The community is not all kids in trade chat with tasteless jokes and trolling. A good change from Trade and City chat in other games. Go for it, it is free!. I would say this game is the biggest joke in the MMO realm, except a joke has to be funny, and EVE isn't funny. Or exciting. Or rewarding. Or engrossing. Its a con job by perhaps the worst developer in the industry. If you wonder why EVE **** as incredibly hard as it does just do a little research on CCP of Iceland. You'll figure out very quickly why this game has the highest user churn in the industry. They have been caught doing everything from fixing the game for their buddies (because the devs actively PLAY THE GAME) to hiring people to post positive reviews. This game would give cancer TO cancer because the people who make the game are toxic wannabe techno-vikings. Don't fall for the F2P nonsense, either - like everything else in the marketing hype its complete lie. The real shame is that the basic gameplay of EVE would be appealing to a lot of gamers if competent, honest developers were in charge of it.. Dis gam suc cause frund Elvis leik it but i dont so is bad when play i say ""dis nu fun' and scream at parents IGN and polygon are better dan metercritci. This game has a massive learning curve, but in all honesty, if you have the maturity and willingness to learn this game you can go far and have a lot of fun.. This game is an amazing creation spoiled by a quite toxic communauty of people spending their time checking the number of kills they make, including newcomers. Given that veterans just don't give a cent to the game, people subscribing just end paying for the worst players leisures, which is truly bad. You can have some fun in New Eden, but once you'll be 3-6 monthes old, you'll have no other choice.than either to become a seal clubber like everyone there, or just play another game.. I have discovered where all the psychopaths go to play. While there are a lot of good people playing Eve, there are also quite a few people (if you can call them people) that need Eve to make them feel powerful. I doubt any of them could get a F-16 off the ground and by their own standards, that makes them morons. You know the kind. Now... If you have money.... Don't fall into the trap of taking a long term subscription. Most people will tire of the game and the community very quickly. Eve Online does not refund your unused sub if you want to leave the game.. The so-called defaults of this game are it's best features and game concepts. It's hard to learn in Eve? Because there is so much to learn. You can't learn everything on your own? Because you're not supposed to: it's a social game, you can't learn everything there is to know by yourself, contact people, speak to them, learn from them, analyse the spaceship that killed you in the kill report to improve your own ship, find a mentor... If you have difficulties to do so, Eve is the oldest MMO online, so there really is a lot of content outside, to help players, dozens of very good websites to provide you information. It takes few weeks to find your own path in Eve, to choose a career. This will be your newbie time. But don't trust the people explaining you need month to be efficient. You want to be a pirate? There is PvP corporations recruiting whoever can fit a warp disruptor on their ship: they will train you even if you are a two-days newbie struggling with the tutorials. They know new pilots are a ressource, and they better have to treat you well and to train you properly if they want you to fight with them. Eve is hard, Eve seems unfriendly for the people who want everything immediatly. But Eve has the best community you could find: players ready to help the new ones, school-corporations, hundreds of new-pilots friendly corps. It worth a try.. First off, allow me to introduce myself, i'm Andr. I've played eve online since 2007. I've done every possible thing there is to do inside of eve aside from supers. I started with just andr, but eventually my account numbers kinda grew as i explored more of eve. Anyways, eve WAS a really great game, but ever since they lost their economist [iirc he left for a better job] the game went down hill, but only because of their current leadership. Allow me to also say that some of their rulings involving multiboxing [multiple accounts] have gotten actual hand-eye-users banned. And now you see from my perspective of why I want my mains persona [older than my eve toon, i've had it for 10+yr] removed from their ""monument"". unless your an otaku with 20 hrs per day on your hands, you prob wont enjoy this game too much. high sec only serves as introduction area. playing vs npc is fun for a short amount of time but it doesnt cover ""leveling up"" 50 mio xp. low sec is you vs 50 noobs destroying you no problem. 0 sec is where the real action is. unfortunately whatever ur doing, lots of waiting is a big part of it. iam sorry guys, but waiting 80% of my gametime is not how i want my games. are you a spy ? omg, really it is just a game.. Well, Eve online is very complex. And have many interesting features. But the feeling I have in the end is that the game is Pay-to-Wait... Not Pay-to-Play. This happens because every single skill in the game is limited by real world time spent in the skill... You can't simply hack more, or mine more , or spend a vacation doing stuff to increase statistics... If you want to fully experience all this game have to offer, you must pay and wait... for years, even, depending on what you are trying to achieve... This makes the game become old kind of quickly... And you feel kind of shut-off from many game features, for a long time (unless you resort to buying a character from other player)... This also means, that you don't have a rewarding experience exploring alternative character development... If you do a wrong decision, your character will be marked by that decision, and you will have to spend months trying to correct that... Or wait for another couple years to develop a better character... Another time, pay-to-wait. Yes, I agree, some people will find this a kind of a feature, and not an issue. That is why this game have good reviews as well... But I simply can't keep paying a game, and keep waiting, for years just to be able to experiment a game feature that was just there all the time.... A game that is neither won or lost. Only experienced. This game has a large learning curve if you want PVP ( player vs player) or not if you want to just blow up computer ships. Playing PVE ( you vs the computer) requires running missions. You can only run so many before you fall asleep in your chair! Learning to fly the ship takes time....real time. Learning to PVP take lots of money and some one to teach you or LOTS of patience and LOTS of time. Even with all that time and training for PVP getting ""blob'd"" will be the norm and all the training and biggest or fastest ship you will loose. I have been playing for 5 years and its a love hate relationship...I love to hate it! If you want to play for enjoyment....join a corp! This is not a game for the ""Loan Ranger"". Its 5 years of my life I will never get back.. The main problem with this game is that you need multiple accounts or at least multiple characters on one account in order to play without ridiculous risk. Except it takes 6 months minimum for a character to fly the ships you need. If you need a battleship and a covert ops frigate to run anomalies inside wormholes than you will have to wait a year. Otherwise you can sit in high security space and mine mindlessly. Expect for your ship to be blown up by 10+ players sitting outside of the gates that you have to travel by. If you like to wait several years in order to sit outside an object with nine other people waiting for a ship to come through so you can blow it up then sign up now. Eve encourages grieving with its mechanics and too many players have been playing for too long for anyone new to get a foothold. If you are going to play don't fall for the discounts on multimonth subscriptions. i have over 150 days that I wont be bothering to log in for.. The one and only MMORPG game what i can play more than 1 hour. I played much MMORPG's, from World of warcraft to blade and soul, everything is peace of **** without soul, i can't play the game with PRESS YOUR SKILL ROTATIONS instead of gameplay.. First of all, If you like a game that is hard to learn, has a real time waiting period on learning skills, and having other player scam you, war declare you for no apparent reason or just destroy your character for their amusement, has not real in game support,a non existent call in support desk,strip you of in game monies and profit gain then this game is for you. With in its unreasonable space battles, no real control over your ship, and no way to counter measure real game pirates at early levels. EVE is for the unsophisticated PVP player or hacker that scams you for your in game money, allows you to be robbed by bogus contracts or for GM's to accuse players and strip them of there money. in addition allows real game pirates and war declarations to be held openly in neutral territories to prey on ships and warp out when there pathetic version of police arrive. Worst of all is the learning curve for this game. It takes about 6months to a year to actually learn this game and have enough skill to make this game enjoyable. Go ahead try the 14 day trial and see for your self, it will be 14day terribly spent.. Hard to learn-easy to master Like I said. The first few hours of this game where a living hell. Tutorials didn't help. Controls made no sense. A **** community didn't help, either. But then I got used to it. I found a few people that helped me through the starting hours. I adjusted myself to the controls. Then it was great. Granted, this isn't much more than a standard MMO, but this time, it has space-ships. The game takes place entirely in the cockpit of a ship. You grind to get better parts, and a better ship. Simple as that. Granted, this is a very specific MMO, aimed at a specific audience. Its for people that will spent hours on end figuring it out. Once you get it, its fun. Your ship becomes a god, your raking in money, and who knows, you can even do some of that corporate sabotage.. This game has had me hooked for a year so far. There is so much to do. The player to player interaction keeps you on your toes constantly even in the safest parts of the game. I'm absolubtly hooked to this game.. Welcome to GriEVE Online. If you're a RL turd, this is the game for you. It's massively boring. CCP (the devs) are after your money, and to make ends meet, they'll encourage cheating / grieving. You can't trust anybody in this game. Have I mentioned how boring it is? It takes 2 years to be actually any good at flying ONE ship for PvP. Also, unless you multibox (which again is ENCOURAGED by CCP) you don't stand a chance in this game. Almost everybody is running at least 2 accounts. This game is boring, the PvP ****, and it takes forever to do anything. In other words, this game is not fun. When you come home to play a game, do you want to have fun? Then EVE is not for you.. The game itself is fabulous and if it were a single player game, EVE would be the perfect space based empire type game ever! The graphics are superb, the feeling of the vastness of space is well captured, ships, combat, equipment and technology is realistic, and your character development is quite diverse and well done. It's the other players you are forced to deal with that utterly ruin this game and make it unplayable.That is of course, unless you're a sadistic psychopath that actually likes harming people, if that's the case, this is the game for you. Take everything you know about ganking, griefing, trolling, scamming, sociopathy, fraud, and the darkness of the human heart and forget it, any time spent in EVE will teach you a horrific new level of sickness that you had never thought possible in your wildest nightmares. You WILL encounter class 1 **** EVERYWHERE in the game wether, they're cheating you out of your goods and money in the markets or waiting to shoot you in the back as your defenseless shuttle arrives at the next warp gate, be prepared to deal with people empowered by the anonymity of the internet and a company that actually encourages bad behavior in their players. The real life equivalent of this game would be stuck in a rush hour traffic jam surrounded by teenagers, all driving ridiculously loud, tricked out rice burners and blasting God awful music at physically harmful volume levels. All. The. Time. Again, a great game ruined by the human garbage that play it. And that's a shame.. ""Players looking for repetitive gaming won't like EVE, whereas those with creative thinking will"" says one of the trailers for EVE. ""Oh God"", thought I. ""Finally something different. Totally disgusted with WoW kind of games"". After a bit of youtube watching I decided to try out this beautiful looking, breathtaking and very brain-promising space simulation ready to buy subscription. ------ After installation which also runs on MAC, I proceeded to character creation. ""Very detailed, very easy to use"" thought I with joy, taking care and time to perfection my in game myself. I can even get scarfs, even change lighting. What a beginning. ------ I read with interest information about the in game factions and carefully chose my bloodline. Ready. ------ ""I wish you see this. I am in a vast, huge futuristic station. It's far bigger anything you've ever seen. Tutorial asks me to undock. Click. Now, I am actually flying in the space! I can zoom out and in totally, looking in every detail of my little ship. Or is it capsule? It's like an egg. Let me think why would it be shaped that way. Aerodynamics. Look at all these buttons around. I am sure all mean something and I am sure everything is there for a reason. Oh wait. I am flying.. ou, just straight towards a huge planet. It must be it's gravity pulling me down. Oh no, no.. how do I stop it? Oh... well.... I just flew trough planet."" ------ My simulation expecations were ****. My hopes for learning about science were ****. My illusions for exploring and knowing the Universe were ****. ------ Being let down, kept playing. My impression is going to improve. I learn a bits from tutorial. About ship equipment, wait, it reminds me a little bit of Wow gear or all other games, no, just coinsidance. About combat - you actually lock target and then press buttons and shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot. No, only coinsidance this game is about much more than that. It's not like the others. This game is made out of real players. Not any Npcs. Does it say agent? What does it do when I accept this mission? Oh. I have to fly somewhere, kill something and bring something back. No.. it's... did I use word coinsidance? ------ Ehm... I do like 25th tutorial missions. I kind of stopped reading it. Only clicking accept, then wrap to (it's flying around 5 light years in a second) then take or kill and then come back, then complete mission. No, surely NPC is not going to tell me how amazing I am whatsoever, or that I did something noone has done before. ------ Well.. it's like my 30hour of gameplay maybe and I... I feel like quitting. Or should I play another 1000 hours (people in Eve spent even 10.000 hours of pure gameplay) just to earn trillion or gear up or kill another player? Oh right, the original system such as this has its cost. You know, let me evaluate. In there, you have gun level 1. When you want gun level 2, you need money. To earn money you besically need to study a book. Wide one. When you get your gun level 2, you can kill player with gun level 1. Target him and ratatatatatatata shoot shoot shoot. And he actually detonates. I am not kidding. ------ Today, right decision was made. Low security part of the Universe, that was my brave destination. With warm and eager heart I set my autopilot and watched all these wallpapers on the screen that look like stars and planets. I might put one on my desktop. Finally arriving. Ratatatatatatatata bum. I am webbed I cannot escape. I scream out for my life for the pirates to let me be. They do not listen. They charge. After amazing and memorable 2seconds fight I explode. Still in my capsule. Bum bum bum, my capsule explodes and with last swearing I end up my final breath, my body falls upon indifferentness of the Universe. This is the end. ------ All of a sudden, i wake up in new, identical body. With all money, maybe even all skills having all ships I had in the dock. End of my story. Epic story. I heard EVE are submitting user stories? Will you help me to send them this one?. Eve is beautiful, extravagant and challenging. It has a unique ability to filter out 12 year old trolls with its difficult learning curve. For a older gamer like myself this provides a deeper sense of exploration because you never quite know what you will find or figure out next. The diverse group of gamers that play EVE provide a very realistic world in which there are genuinely helpful, interesting people that you may meet along the way but there are also pirates that will plunder you for all you've got. All this adds to the intense and relentless environment that you frequently visit on your travels. In the gigantic Galaxy of EVE there are thousands of planets all with different security ratings to provide you with knowledge of where you are visiting and where you shouldn't pass through; however tempting it is. EVE is like no other MMO and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging game to sink there teeth into. Its truly one of the best.. 7 years of this game and everything is still essentially the same. People will scam you or gank your ships just because they can. You will lose connection in a mission or pvp battle and come back with no ship. If you have no life or have too much money this is the game for you!. Being a EVE player since 2008 I did have some amazing times playing, 3 accounts 9 Chars. Then CCP decided to release 'Time Dilation', where a fight that would last 1 hour now last 10. Cause of the super slow mo where u can go have a shower make your dinner and maybe just maybe your guns have finished one cycle so u can fire a 2nd round. If you don't have a job and have plenty time on your hands as it slowly ticks by at 1 fps in the huge fleet fights this down turn this game is for you. Sadly life is far to hectic to be watching a screen that doesn't move half the time and I guarantee u will get bored with all the other feature mass fleet fights was where it was until that sad day..... Eve aspires to be something more than it is. Each expansion has not been fully completed and the game needs an overhaul. The game environment or galaxy is much to small to be considered a space simulation or a sandbox. By that I mean people are constantly everywhere and the limits are too overwhelming. Each zone has way too many people. Admittedly the game is mathematically huge, but for PvP it is much too easy. PvP is so overwhelming in the game it should be renamed to Grieve or GriEVE online. The only thing you can expect to do in the personal goals department is build up your skills, which takes time, and there are smart ways to do it for good balance and have fun along the way unlike some of the misinformed negative reviews, and possibly your I.S.K. balance which newbs pronounce isk as if it is a word not an anagram for Inter-Stellar Kredits. Aside from that is is the experience of people interactions, which if you don't join as a huge guild like I did into the Goonswarm alliance, you are likely going to be backstabbed and not have much fun. In my opinion this game is much to oriented towards grieving players and it is supported too much. That is the community you are likely joining if you play. It is for some people and not for all. Good luck in your decision. I hope this helps.. I played the demo for a week and got tired, because it is so hard to learn i had to ask People in the game to understand and i had watch youtube videos too. They have a really bad tutorial. And it cost damn much Money like 15 euros a month. thats so stupid many games even cost that price. It cost 180 euros a year. that's quite expensive... Eve is not a spaceshooter game, it is about to command your ship like a STAR TREK way, lets put that way. You need to worry about your actions instead of maneuvering the ship. It is all about the strategy and team work, when you face battle fleets fights. The game is complex and can (and will) entertaining you for a long time. You have free will to decide your destiny. Want be a pirate and scam people, or leave inside a wormhole hunting invaders, it is up to you. You have some many place to explore as the EVE galaxy is HUGE, and so many ships to fly which different roles and ways of pilot"" that you will like it a lot. Other good aspect of the game is the relationship between developers and the community, that are composed of mature people. They always in touch and developers hear and produces what the communities ask in their bi-annual expansion. So you will play a game made by the feedback of other players that always looks for a way to improve the experience. Give it a try and see if it suitable for you. Of course it is not for everyone.. Nearly unlimited amount of spaceship-themed mini- and meta-games combined with nice graphic engine and healthy economy slightly spoiled by extremely slow character progression and lack of territorial expansions turning players into so-called ""bittervets"" over time. Yet until that ""bittervet""-ness moment you'll have a lot of positive (and a bit of negative) emotions. Highly recommended while there isn't any meaningful MMO spaceship sandbox game alternative.. Basiclie a very very good game grafics frkn awesome community very friendly helpfull etc.. but 3 points less because u need just i would say 3 months for only skilling to have fun on this game thats a bit annojing. The greatest game I have ever played. More complex than any game I have ever played, but more immersive than any other. I have logged over 2000 hours so far into this game, and not an ounce of boredom. There are so many different things you can do. You can spend your time sitting in safe calm space manufacturing ships for combat pilots, or be on the front lines fighting over territory and power with your faction. The player corporations (guilds) can actually control territory. Massive wars take place. Battles of thousands of players all at the same place. You can choose to fight for good, or for power and wealth. Backstabbings and betreyals, loyalty to your corporation, becoming a better pilot. Eve is a neverending adventure with limitless entertainment and opportunity.. Only if you all knew the problem in Eve online. I been playing this game for like 5 years on and off and it can get annoying. 1: Trust no one. What is your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow. 2: if you like to be surrounded by a holes feel free to join. 3: if your looking for all the good stuff, its always in low sec. Never high sec. 4: Expect to take up to a full 90 days to train out one specific skill set. When you need at least 4 major skills. a) Mission running skills because you have to do mission to get money just to start. Join a corp, you get plenty of money if they give it to you but your skills are so low in the beginning, your just a flee to swat. Trust me, your rookie ship will not put dent into anybody playing less then a month. b) ship skills mainly battleships if you plan to makes money from mission running. c) industrial skills is a must when players are over charging for everything. 1 billion isk for 1 round of small ammo that is only worth 1.50 isk per round. Scam #1 d) mining skills if you are tired of paying the outrageous prices on the market. Mine it and manufacture it. Problem, all the high sec roid belts are usually wiped clean before you even have a chance to login to go mining. 5. Getting skills takes way too long. Some skills costing you upwards of 30 days for lvl 5, which is your entire one month subscription. Great skill but too long of a wait. Capital ships try 6 months. Do you really want to wait 6 freaking months just to jump into a capital ship. I don't. 6. Older players like to hassle the newb and noobs all days just to mess your game up while learning. If the older player loses a ship and get there standing smack down, its no true lost to them. Frankly, I hope they keep it up so eve be put out of business one day. No new players no new subscriptions no new revenue out of business. 7, The ships itself is nice but they are too specific. Transport ships, I want to drop 8 small guns with hvy armor tank and pvp mid slots. But nooo. Pirate players can't kill you. I believe in China's law, China does not tolerate Pirates in Chinese waters. BANG!!! (WITH A 50 CAL) good bye. 8. I hope you like getting screwed in this game and I hope the pirate players get hacked and watch their real life money get wiped out and their entire account never existed. That would be great. See how funny it really is when pirates is on the receiving end of their BS.. EVE Online hit its 10 year anniversary this year. It is one of only a few monthly sub MMO's left on the market. It has an ever expanding playerbase that now exceeds 500,000 players. It is unforgiving and brutal and has a massive learning curve. It has a UI that would make a genius cry. There is no set way to play EVE. It rewards create thinking. It encourages ponzi schemes, AWOXing, market PvP, and scamming. The only time you are truly safe is when you are docked up in a station. Your spaceships are merely consumables. You will die and your spaceships will explode. Earn enough ingame money (ISK) and you can buy 30 day extensions to your account. Or join a player corporation, work your way up the ranks, and then steal all their money and ships. EVE Online is not a kids game and you will find few 10 year old kids with enough pat","i can understand the ""pay2grind"" model, but the price is outrageous . i can understand the ""wait to train"" skill levelling model, but it just makes you ""pay now, come back to play in a month"" this game builds many clever mechanics and systems, but then meticulously sabotages them ."
632.SteamWorld Dig 2,"Really good game,wasn't expecting this much fun from this simple looking game. Great game. Especially if you’re looking for a fun and relaxing experience. Reminds me the good old Amiga games. Its been a while since i last played this game. I remember cool worldbuilding, and the progression system involving all the underground map was quite simple but effective as well. Don't remember its story so I think it wasn't as relevant as I would have liked. Pretty good overall. Good soundtrack with simple yet addicting gameplay which involves digging to explore a world with hidden secrets and resources to upgrade your equipment. The game includes decent boss fights as well. I would consider it a Metroidvania with its spin on things.. The game was overall pretty enjoyable but couldn’t live up to the reputation of the original. Steam world dig 2 is a good game overall butit is a bit **** there is one or two more machines to destroy it would have been **** final boss good metroidvania elements good enemies are not that great but it is not a main element of the game so ı think this game should be played you can finish around 7 hours. Brilliant game, my only issue is it ended too soon. I was not ready to stop playing. Absolute must play.. This game's a little bit better than its predecessor. On the hand because it's slightly longer, on the other hand because you can tinker more with the character's improvements. Then you don't level up through the money you make, but by killing enemies. One thing is sure, it's still addictive to dig deeper into the mine to collect metals and gems. This game might not be the best on the Switch, but it's still a nice experience which is quite often on a discount at the eShop.. One of the best games you can play on switch. It’s simple but oh so fun and easy to follow. I only regret I also bought the first Steamworld dig, which is not half as good as the second version.. this game is very bad and basic, you have nothing challenge to do here. very bad. Following Rusty's disappearance at the end of SteamWorld Dig, his robot friend Dorothy heads to the town of El Machino in order to search for him. As with the original, gameplay largely involves exploring a vast underground mine whilst defeating enemies and collecting various resources to upgrade your equipment. With improved controls, a far greater wealth of equipment to acquire and hand designed (rather than procedurally generated) levels this is a far more enjoyable experience however. Personally I’d just give the original a miss and play this.. the gamepplay is boring and very stressful sometimes. i really dont like the soundtrack. Has the same addicting gameplay as the first game with improved game design and a bit more interesting story. I hope the 3rd game continues that trajectory.. Didn’t do enough different to the first game for me. Still a good game, well worth picking up on a sale.. This is an outstanding game! I loved it on the 3DS, it's even better replaying it on the Switch! Great graphics and atmosphere, a fun sense of progression and exploration, challenging puzzles that aren't annoying, and a levelling up system that makes you feel like an OP boss towards the end of the game! Most importantly though the controls are tight - your character really is a joy to control. If you enjoy platform exploration games or metroidvania style games you really MUST play this! By the way, ALL the other Steamworld games are also amazing!!!. Now this is what I'm looking for in a 2d game. Game concept is simple enough, and I really enjoyed exploring the world and digging around. Like any good adventure game, the feel and design of this world made exploring a lot of fun. I thought the different areas and their challenges and boss battles were good, and I liked the little upgrades you can get. Finding the hidden goodies was also mostly fun, and this game is one of the few game maps that I've gotten close to 100% on (if it helps, I am usually more than satisfied with doing about 70-80% of content for any exploration-based game- I'm no completionist for sure). Just the right amount of challenge and good for 15-20 hours of enjoyment.. Excellent adicting game. Super fun to upgrade your gear and explore more. Makes you want a sequel.. This is an enjoyable Roguelite with exploration and lots of upgrades. It is fairly easy and while I took my time and got 10 hours play from it, I imagine that many will finish it in well under 5 hours. That said, every moment of play is packed full of charm and it's well worth the price.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For the love of all that is holy, GET THIS GAME. Mining, exploration, platforming, metroidvania, soundtrack, it's got it all going on! I LOVE THIS SERIES.. Owned this game since day 1 and replayed it countless times, I think it's the beautiful visuals and the digging that makes this game so addictive... To me, it's a MUST OWN and THE BEST indie game on switch.. Nothing special, but stil a good game. Would like to see have to more story, more enemies, but still ok. Steamworld dig 2 is a sequel to excellent treasure digging adventure. Unlike steamworld dig, the caves in the sequel are hand-drawn and not generated, which makes really good gameplay with well-hid secrets that are satisfying to hunt for. The game is not super long or hard, which makes it a perfect on the go playing or while you are wanting some easier games in between. The graphics are good retro-style, a bit too busy at times for my taste, so I cannot easily recognise everything that's going on on the screen and what parts of the screen are background or foreground or blocks or not. This however gets easier after first few hours of the game in most of the cave settings, the game starts in a desert that is particularly clutttered. The music is not memorable, sound effects do their job. Good buy if you find it in discounts.. if you like metroidvanias, this is a pretty note perfect example of the genre. cool upgrades, a great map, challenging enemies and bosses and a great iteration on the first steamworld dig game. I'm hesitant to give a 10 usually but i think this deserves it.. Very nice game, a bit of a pain in the ass to plat but hey when you dont care its just a magnificent game like the first one with definitive improofments. A really addictive game that builds on the first game extremely well. It takes away most of the frustrating parts of the first game and adds so many great things including optional challenges and a much larger world and more populated town.. This sequel is much more refined than its predecessor and there's much more to do here. More time and effort seems to have been put into every facet of the original's template to really flesh out Steamworld Dig 2 into a stronger metroidvania. There's more abilities to find, better visuals, a better soundtrack, a decent story, and a bunch of well hidden collectibles too. The final boss is a big improvement on that of the first game. There's a lot more puzzles than there were in Dig that are a nice change of pace from the usual digging gameplay. I enjoyed the movement abilities you pick up along the way which make getting around pretty fun. Overall there's just more meat on the bones in Dig 2. That said, the story ends quite abruptly, the combat is still kinda weak, and a couple extra boss fights to shake things up would've been nice. Getting all the collectibles isn't really worth it, and as I was trying to find them all after finishing the main story I was finding it a little annoying but this is optional and it really wasn't too bad. In the case of Steamworld Dig 2, I'd say bigger is better and that this is a great sequel that's even more fun that the first game. I picked this up on sale for around a fiver and it's well worth the asking price. 7/10. Really fun metroidvania with lots of cool mechanics. The gameplay loop of exploring and returning to base to sell your loot is addictive and fun. A bit too short though! I thought the game had just started when it literally just ended. Well worth it for the few hours of great gameplay though. Recommended!. This is a pretty decent 2D action-adventure-exploration game that falls somewhere in-between Super Metroid and Terraria. Similar to Metroid there is a lot of exploring and certain places are unreachable until certain items are collected which allow you to gain access to those areas. Similar to Terraria there's a lot of digging, mining, ore and item collecting. Ores are sold for cash which can be used to upgrade your equipment. Additionally, gears and special blueprint items can also be discovered and can improve your equipment in other ways. There are a variety of enemies to kill and a few boss battles as well. Overall, I had fun with this game and it gave me a solid 12 hours of gameplay. 100% completion would probably take a few more hours. I do have two complaints though. At $20 digital and $30 physical, this game on the switch is a bit overpriced given both the short playtime and the fact that it's only $10 physical for PS4 on amazon. My other complaint is that the exploration element is a bit limited. The map isn't all that large, and it is very restricting in the horizontal direction - caverns go down pretty deep, but don't extend very far from side to side.. It's pretty alright. One of the plot points didn't really get resolved, and the dig –> upgrade –> dig –> upgrade gameplay wasn't my favorite (though I'm sure others will enjoy it).. It's 2020 and I'm writing a review for this three year old game. It's what **** weirdos call: ""kino"" - easily replayable, and polished. Music elevates it to even bigger heights. The only thing I wished was that it were a bit longer. It's a fun game.. So much enjoyment and so much upgrades. The flow of the characters upgrades very consistent and good. Massive world to explore with an epic story . Well worth the play. Just like the original but with a much better storyline, mechanics and missions. A metroidvania where you complete missions, upgrade dig and solve puzzles. Steamworld Dig 2 is great if you are in the mood for a top notch, old school, metriodvania/dig game. The game runs well with very little bugs or issues.. Literally for a couple of hours, but the game carries with it into the bowels of the planet. It takes place in one breath. Someday I will pass it again.. I couldn't stop playing. A near perfect game. So much to do, great difficulty level, I'd play a new Dig game every year if they made them.. This is just a beautiful game, and you can tell it was made with love. A metroidvania that in many ways plays more fun than Samus Returns - the concept of digging deeper and deeper is exciting and lots of great puzzles inside the mini levels as well. Just a lot of fun, and funny writing as well. I look forward to more and more games from Image & Form.. Having never played the first game, I jumped right into Steamworld Dig 2 without really knowing anything about it other than it's a Metroidvania, and that digging is the name of the game. From the get go, I was addicted. Steamworld Dig 2 has some great visuals, fantastic music, tight platforming and gameplay. Just like any standard Metroidvania, you'll find upgrades that will help you along your journey. This time, however, you'll have to dig deep to find those upgrades and uncover new areas. Along the way, you'll discover these caves that offer unique challenges that range from easy to rather difficult with a reward at the end should you decide to tackle it. My only two critiques are that it had too few bosses and areas, but other than that, the game is just fantastic throughout. I can't recommend Steamworld Dig 2 enough, so do yourself a favor and pick this one up.. Wow. Just... wow. Where can I even begin with this game? It looks beautiful, especially comparing it to its predecessor, and it controls smoother than a block of butter. The Metroidvania and Minecraft-like elements are great, with a lot of unique things that just make the overall game so great. The music is phenomenally atmospheric, and while the environmental cave music isn't the most memorable, most of the soundtrack above ground is just as good as the games it takes its inspiration from, and all of it fits the theme! My only real complaint/request for the next game in the series is to make it longer. This is truly a quality over quantity -game, and in a perfect world where SteamWorld Dig 3 already exists, the only thing really holding it back from it being a literally perfect game is it's short length. Sure, it has a challenge temple, but for newer players it's too frustrating and older players it doesn't make the game's runtime that much longer. Still, I do recommend the game for anyone who's ever enjoyed games like Metroid, Castlevania, Minecraft and Terraria, it's really that good. (Maybe Image & Form should name this beautiful genre they've 'crafted' ""Metroidcraftia""..!). I had a lot of fun with this game. What makes the mining mechanics unique is how much thought has to go into every dig, because there are limits to where you can mine. You have a lot to consider, such as where enemies might be, how they might change the terrain, and if that will affect your escape route or paths to different ores you need for upgrades. It's not immensely different but it's quite different to anything I've played before and it makes for some incredibly tense and entertaining boss fights, some of the better ones that I've played in a while. The final boss fight was somewhat disappointing, in that it wasn't much different from the prior bosses and it was honestly too easy, but it was still a fun time and a satisfying enough conclusion. The ending is interesting; one which left me feeling conflicted on how exactly I was supposed to feel (in a good way, mind). I have a feeling it was designed to set up the next game which means it felt a little underwhelming, but I'd easily be up for a SteamWorld Dig 3 any day of the week. Great game, check it out if you haven't.. A joy to play and a perfect introduction to the metroidvania genre The main digging mechanic is a fairly unique diversion, but it doesn’t offer quite enough, for me, to really be that interesting or entertaining. That said, the character handles responsively, and the friendly mapping and transport system both help to keep the momentum going. And SteamWorld Dig 2 does a few key things very well indeed. First, it does a brilliant job of guiding the player; you shouldn’t ever really struggle working out what needs to be done next. Second, the ‘mini-puzzles’ scattered around the main area, and the sub-areas are frequently very well planned and rewarding. And, third, the upgrade system, and extra movements that can be gained are both generous, making for a satisfying learning curve. Graphically, the game is bright, welcoming, and — fully in keeping with the overall aesthetic — entirely accessible, clearly highlighting objects, enemies, and hinting at secret areas. I guess you’d call it a ‘cartoon’ style, and it’s very attractive, particularly in handheld mode. Is it all just too easy? I guess so, a little, but in being so, it offers such an enjoyable experience, a really accessible counterpart to some of the more challenging titles in this genre, that the difficulty and length can be forgiven. This is a game you’re meant to stroll through, stopping occasionally to think a bit, enjoying the journey.. SteamWorld Dig was already a very good little game. SteamWorld Dig 2 takes everything that worked in the first game, and supercharges it. The charming ""robots in the old west"" setting is the same, and so is the game loop: dig for a while, collect resources, travel back to the basecamp, upgrade, repeat. Where the first Dig was almost skeletal in its simplicity, however, this second game adds some much-needed diversity to its environments, and a map that extends in multiple directions instead of just downwards. You could argue whether the first Dig deserved to be called a ""metroidvania"", but this second one definitely does. Some areas are not accessible until you get movement upgrades, and you get those signature metroidvania moments where you suddenly connect to a known area. Speaking of movement upgrades: the most powerful ones are a mixed bag. Minor spoiler: the jet engine improves your quality of life and guarantees that you won't struggle to traverse heavily mined areas, like in the first game. However, you could argue that it makes your life a bit *too* easy. Once you can fly around, the entire point of the game (digging tunnels) becomes moot: you just happily move around the map with barely any limitations whatsoever. On one side, this upgrade is very welcome–on the other, it almost nullifies the premise of the game, and removes almost all the challenge from the endgame. The Image & Form team is great at building compelling upgrade and exploration loops that hook you in and make you want to have just one more go, and this game is no exception. It's not a must play like SteamWorld Heist, but it works perfectly as a nice chilled diversion.. Image & Form is the kind of developer that gains a following of dedicated players who will buy every new game they release sight unseen, because they have an amazing track record. SteamWorld Dig 2 is a great example of why I'm one of these I&F devotees -- it is an almost perfect sequel to what was already a fantastic game. With an addictive gameplay loop, engrossing soundtrack, clever writing, endearing characters, and expert level design, SWD2 is among the best games of this generation. If you enjoy MetroidVania-type adventure games or solid platformers, you'll find lots to love about the latest chapter in the SteamWorld series.. I couldn't put this beautiful and addicting game down once I started it. The boss battles felt a little lackluster, until the final boss, which posed a good challenge. While I had a great time finding secrets throughout the game, the end came too fast. Since it has been over, I have not gone back to it once. A great game that ended too soon, but jam packs a valuable experience in a short timeframe.. Not bad. Some of the puzzles were genuinely challenging and fun to complete. Challenges near to the end of the game did not feel as challenging as they did not do enough to take advantage of the rapidfire new abilities - I felt extremely overpowered by the end of the game. Best part was beginning/middle.. Well designed. It starts easy but it gets more difficult as the levels progress. Good game at all, you should try it.. I am a big fan of the SteamWorld games - please make a squeal to Heist! Steamworld Dig 2 felt like a more relaxing Spelunky, and that is a great thing. Pros: - Fun gameplay, really like the addition of the jetback and hookshot - Nice vivid look to the game - Solid waypoints and upgrading system Cons: - Beat it in about 6 or so hours, wish it was longer - More boss battles or digging puzzles/mini games would have been cool. One of the best indie games on switch and a must play. Gorgeous, well designed and thoughtful gameplay leaves you wanting more. SteamWorld Dig 2 will not disappoint.. Is one of the best indies a have ever played. The playability and the play mechanics (at metroidvania style) are incredible. Is graphically wonderfull. The story is simple but it works to makes continue playing. I love the postapocaliptic world. I have played it twice. The mein game is about 6h, but there are a lot of collectables for play 10h more.. This is a near perfect 2D platforming adventure game, I only wish there was more of it. It lasts a decent amount, just under ten hours, but by the end I found myself wishing for more, though I guess it isn't necessarily a bad thing to be enjoying a game so much that I just want a little more of it. When it comes to 2D indie platformer/action/adventure games that have come to the Switch in 2018, this doesn't quite hold a candle to Hollow Knight, Celeste, or Dead Cells, but if you've already played all three of those, this is a great place to go next.. I have beaten SteamWorld Dig 1, and 2 now, were they both good? they weren't bad. However, 2 is a major improvement.. This is a MUST OWN on Nintendo Switch. I have a ton of Indy games including Celeste and this is hands down the best Indy game on the system. The game is a fun Metroid style digging game and highly addictive. Some people say the game is short but taking my time and finding everything I got 17 hours out of it, for the price you can't beat it. If I had ONE complaint it was that the story could've been more fleshed out, but since I consider it a must own and it's so cheap It absolutely deserves a 10. Buy it now!. This game is magnificent. The universe, music, mining, metroid-esque progression.. everything is just fantastic. This is one of my favorite games for the Switch. I only wish it had more replay value.. Really good and fun game, with a solid gameplay and story, For the price I recommend anyone who has a switch to purchase it. The only thing I found lacking is - I finished the game with about 50% of all secrets found. Plus I had a lot of upgrades left to unlock. But after completing the main story, I had no reason to keep playing,. One of the best surprises you can get. A charming game that just gets better as you play it, accompanied by an awesome soundtrack. Addicting really. Made me want to go back and play more 2D games. I haven't been into that much lately. Although this is a game that is so impregnated with charm that you will probably not feel easily the same with some other 2D sidecroller. I tried the old 2D Metroids, but just in the last decade or so, and they never really clicked with me much. But this game did. So I guess this is Metroidvania next. And did almost everything the game has to offer, something I never do. Lovely game. The downside is it is over too quickly and there should be more boss fights or intense moments. But it is great as it is anyway, and we can only hope for how much Steamworld dig 3 will grow.. One of my favorite games. I'll be starting it again soon. Three thumbs up.. Looks awesome docked and on handheld. Great gameplay. The game loop is a little addictive. So many hidden things to discover. The story is good. Haven't really found any bugs. Like the others said, I wanted to play more of it. One of the must plays for Switch owners.. It's funny. When I play this game, I don't even wanna continue. The platforming doesn't attract me much, and the graphics are good for sure but not that crazy good... but this game certainly has that little extra something. I didn't wanna play it, yet I played 5 straight hours. Then fell asleep, and woke up at 3 and played til 7. It has a hold on you, and it's a wonderful one at that. I love-hate this game, but so recommend it.. It's pretty good. But after a while, really repetitive. A good game for youngsters, but a lot cheaper in steam.. I bought this while I was sick, thinking I'd get a simple game I could mindlessly play while listening to a podcast. Boy, was I surprised. The gameplay starts out simple enough, but progresses at a good pace towards a solid action platformer. Every new upgrade is a surprise, and completely changes how you approach situations. And the next thing is always just around the corner. The story, similarly, starts out barely being there, sticks under the surface for the most part, and then comes together towards the end. Just delightful!. My first experience in this wacky little franchise was with this game. I did not know what to expect but soon discovered that Image & Form have created an incredible franchise. One I would recommend to everyone. The charm is there in the characters, dialogue, story, music, design, puzzles and all; something that is often lacking in the mass market of gaming these days. Very at home on Nintendo Switch. 10/10. What a great game that keeps you playing to do ""just one more run"". Goes hand in hand on Switch with the short play sessions. The loop of mining, discovery and upgrade is very satisfying and paced perfectly. I never felt like I had to grind to power up or that I was too weak to go on without upgrading. I've already resolved to be a launch day buyer when the inevitable Dig3 comes around. Steamworld Dig 2 is an excellent game that tops the indie titles on the Nintendo Switch. Its mechanics are a perfect combination. Pair the mechanics with its well designed puzzles, beautiful art and vivid sound design, SWD2 is a perfect game for new and experienced platformer and metroidvania fans. It is a must play on the Nintendo Switch!. This game is just plain fun. Dig, dig, dig. Discover, discover, discover. The gameplay loop is fantastically addicting.. Great game and had a great time from beginning to end. Mining for ore doesn't feel like grinding or ore. You will want to get every last one. This is my first Steamworld game and I'll be awaiting future titles. Proof that great games don't need big budgets, big prices, and huge playtimes. Well done.. All those steambots, awesome story - everything is made to perfection like all the other games! A game that makes you come back playing EVEN after you complete it. Brilliant game :). First off, Steamworld is an amazing universe. Image and Form have crafted it with love and humor, and I've really enjoyed my time in it. Steamworld Dig 1 and 2 were both polished game loops that were just fun. Steamworld Heist blew me away because it really was XCOM in 2D, but much cuter, funnier, and fairer. Steamworld Dig 2 is a great sequel because it improves on the first one in every way AND doesn't overstay its welcome with padding. It is concise and respects your time and skill, but has an amazing amount of replayability and collectible-hunting if desired.. SteamWorld Dig 2 retains the core gameplay loop of digging for riches, but layers in stronger RPG elements.. Get ready for an axe picking good time! Rusty, the protagonist from Steamworld Dig one, has gone missing and you play as the fembot Dot whose mission it is to track him down. Equipped with only her trusty pick axe, you begin building your tool kit of gadgets by yep, you guessed it digging. Just like it’s predecessor, you dig your own path through the randomly generated per play through mine. Where you collect resources to sell in order to upgrade your gear. Throughout the game you earn more advanced gear that is also upgradable, therein lies the loop. Diving into the deep dark depths of the mine, collecting as much ore as you can carry, before your light runs out, only to make it to the top and come back more powerful than before, is such an addictive gameplay experience that it’s easy to lose track of time while doing it. Each new section of the world is built specific to your most recently aquired tool, layering skill upon skill, think 2d zelda style, and yes there’s a hook shot. One moment you're grappling your way across a barren windy desert and the next you're animating molten iron giants with your ignition axe. Every inch of this world so cleverly designed combined with the fact that you dig your own path , it feels like it was designed just for you. Rewarding you with intuitively hidden secrets and just the right amount of difficulty for the perfect challenge. (desert clip, molten robot, button hook shot puzzle shot) Steamworld dig two has a lovely cast of characters with a variety ranging from goofy/crazy to prejudicial. The mayor of the town for example, warns you of the shiners, the crazies that live down deep in the mine, well once you get here they're just lovely and help you wholeheartedly . It's amazing that even though I'm a fembot mining my way through this fictitious underground, some things ring real and true. A very welcome change from the original are the boss fights. Throughout the game you will encounter many different boss fights, which are a great combination of level design and enemy attack pattern maneuvering. With your different mechanics that you acquire throughout the game, you have multiple options for defeating every enemy. Stick that mine roach with a hydrobomb, or shove that fire demon into a pool of water, the choice is yours. Another upgrade is the length of the game. While steamworld dig one was on the shorter side depending on your play style steamworld dig two can take you well over ten hours to complete. Especially if you like to get your hands dirty. For a 2d open world, metroidvania experience, steamworld 2 will deliver in every single way. Some metroidvanias leave me frustrated searching for ways to open the next section of the world but in steamworld 2, taking a wrong turn and getting lost on some random self imposed agenda is half the fun. Whether it's a great movie, a book, or a video game. It’s rare that a sequel can perfectly capture the same lightning in a bottle as the original while elevating the franchise to the next level. Well steamworld dig 2 has done just that. With an engaging world, rock solid mechanics, and a gameplay loop that will keep you digging for more. Check out my video review on my YouTube channel TheFlannelFox. Really enjoyable and entertaiment game. If you love Metroidvania, puzzles and a game with personality this is for you. I really recommend it. The first game was a pretty cool game... The second .. Wow.. If you like a game with a lot of puzzle and element of platforming with so many upgrade to find and twick then its the right game for you. For my part just love to take time to search everyting and after 15 hours I search for the next upgrade. The game never get boring because you always find something new and that you have to return to a old cave to find .. at last, the treasure... Fantastic game, graphic beautiful and fun factor at max !!!. I don't really like giving things a 10, but literally my only complaint with this game was that finished it and wanted more. But 10 hours for 15 quid is a solid return. I'd love steamworld dig 3 to be absolutely huge. The art style is gorgeous, the music and atmosphere is perfect, digging for teasure is tonnes of fun, the levelling up system, the puzzles, boss fights. All of it, no complaints. Mighy have to go play the first game now, but so glad i found this one, beats shovel knight as my fave indie game ever.. Good story, fun, and a great game. a lot of fun... BUT sadly enough, quite short (for my tastes) i tried completionist but i was done in 11 hours without any guides. still a great game but i'll leave whether or not it's worth it's price up to you. Bought this game when it first came out, played it until the final boss then put it off. Overall: It's an enjoyable title with good, single player gameplay and different caverns and areas to explore. Music it catchy and controls are well executed. Graphics are modern and well thought out by the design studio. The upgrade system is split between cogs and coins. Areas to work on: While gameplay is good, but after 3-4 hours, it begins to feel stale; you'll need to revisit areas and beat monsters or dig around until you find stones for money. After 5 hours, I found it less-than-enjoyable to run around and try to locate gems, stones, or other means for getting money. In the end, it's a better than average title you could complete in about 9 hours during a weekend.. Steamworld Dig 2 is by far one of the most entertaining indie titles that I have had the honor of playing in a while, the game play is fun, challenging and intuitive and keeps you wanting more and more as your progress. The story itself is lacking and the visuals take advantage of the 720p display on the switch making the game itself look amazing! i have come across a few bugs but nothing that breaks my experience or makes me want to put the game down. The combat is simple but challenging making it almost impossible at times to out maneuver the enemies. ","the game was overall pretty enjoyable but couldn’t live up to the reputation of the original . following Rusty's disappearance at the end of Steamworld dig, his robot friend Dorothy heads to the town of El Machino in order to search for him ."
633.FIFA Soccer 11,"It's good like Fifa 2010 with new feature and fifa ultimate for the first time to play. It's a football game that does what is expected. That's it. Thought there was more? Thought your extra amount of money spent upon release went towards some extra feature or something? No, of course not, don't be stupid.. With the once great Pro Evolution Soccer series continuing to struggle this gen FIFA is now the choice for most gamers. If you've enjoyed the series you’ll not be disappointed, just don't go expecting anything particular new or innovative.. FIFA 11 is any doubt the best FIFA game I have ever played. This was also the 1st FIFA game I have played online the game play is so smooth and realistic. FIFA Ultimate Team is fantastic, this game mode is playable to any FIFA fans. The best thing with Ultimate Team is that the best players to get have the highest overall ratings which is excellent no one would want EA handicap it would make the game unplayable. An example of an Ultimate Team I had which was great was an inform La Liga Team and I won almost every game which proved that there was no EA handicap. Offline is very good as well, it's similar in ways to Online mode were the best overall rated players are the best players to use. The shooting and passing feels very comfortable to me because passing seems to play out very well and the shooting online and offline feel realistic, what's realistic with the shooting is that it is not easy or hard to score goals. The difficulty of scoring goals is about right. FIFA 11 just did everything well, if you're looking a football/soccer game that you will enjoy this game is worth picking up.. This game was the worst fifa yet in terms of support from EA and updates. The lagging server issues were never fixed, and the b button pressure was worse than ever. Fifa 12 is a huge step up from this truly awful game.. This game was a disaster in my opinion. I got this game hoping for improvements from the shabby FIFA 10 effort by EA Sports, however it was better by the tiniest bit. The music was slightly more appealing however nothing which you would want to listen to all over again. The bigger variety of things commentated on made the gameplay time I had slightly larger. Ultimate Team made free was good however I do not see what the big thing is about Ultimate Team. WOW, create your own team with your choice of kit and your choice of stadium and play against other people, what an absolutely stupid thing to waste your time on. This is the game that has made me realise not to buy FIFAs from now on and I am sure it is the same with many more people. The Be A Keeper mode is the dullest yet in FIFA and provides you with more boredom than you would have if you were on the Main Menu.. Fifa 11 is a great game because I have played it before it is very releastic and the way you can curl the ball when you shoot also you can get injuries which is good overall Fifa 11 is worth all the money you pay for this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game was more fun than Fifa 11 and I liked the player/player manager/manager mode transitions but I disliked how I was asked to play against low level oppositions when low on stamina especially when there is a midweek match against a good team. I wish it had an option to start me as a substitute or if I'm leading by 2-0 or something at half time, it would rest me. AI was a bit weird at times but the game play was a bit better.. hate how crosses would go into the wrong place with auto settings.. better than Fifa 10 but still not up to par :(. FIFA is the absolute football simulation for any fan or casual gamer. The game has come a long way and beat competition long time now. The gameplay is extraordinary with passing feeling better and smoother than ever. Online matches run perfectly and makes you come back for more.. Possibly one of the most buggy games you will ever get. At first glance the game looks fantastic as the graphics are brilliant but you can't judge a book by it's cover. Career mode is fair enough but there has been no advance in increasing its features... instead there is no scouting, no youth system and no staff. It makes playability a weak factor as no youth system means poor old players in the future. There are also a few misses on EA's part as they failed to include the first name of players in their bios. Very small but noticeable and in the long run quite an irritating mistake. Also the constant e-mails from assistant managers telling you a player is tired or a player is playing well... yes we all have eyes we can see this mr assistant. Obviously the career mode isn't the end of the problems. I noticed that the new Be A Pro: Goalkeeper is a new addition to FIFA and what a pointless addition it is. First of all being a goalkeeper is insanely boring and playing as your pro against the computer basically consists of you watching a very amateurish match which usually ends 0-0 with your pro getting a rating of around 5. Also the Be A Pro online game mode 'Team Play' has been ruined by this Be A Goalkeeper as the matches only consist of goalkeepers running around the pitch while players tap the ball into an open goal. Pointless. One of the ideas that I've prized EA on is the Pro Clubs game mode. An absolutely fantastic idea of incorporating your pros into online play with friends. The only problem with this idea is... the execution. EA Servers must be insanely weak as every Pro Clubs match is generally laggy. There is also the nuisance of ""Sync Lag"" which involves one player going out of sync with the rest meaning their player reacts about 3 seconds after what is being shown on the screen. There are also not enough cups in Pro Clubs to make ""Cup Matches"" a worthwhile option. Also the ranking system in Pro Clubs is faulty. Instead of going by Pro level it goes by Team Level so if you're a team of rated 78 Pros with a ranked 2000xp team against a team of rated 90 Pros with 200xp and you lose... you lose a good 100xp even though they have the better players. Stupid. Also for those not wanting to ""Be A Goalkeeper"" in Pro Clubs you have to deal with the absolutely dreadful AI controlling the keeper who lets in just about any shot at any angle which proves to be extremely annoying. Yes it would also be annoying to make the goalkeepers unstoppable but even just able to make at least one save would be nice... Finally a couple of bugs in gameplay... Yes! The list continues! I'm not done pounding Fifa 11 for it's hundreds of errors. The referees in the game are atrocious. The strictness gradient of lenient refs to strict refs is absurd. One game a ref will tell off a player for a red card offense and in the next he will send off a player for a standing tackle. No advantage from offsides at all: if the opponents are called offside and you have the ball in a decent position don't even think about continuing that ball is being brought right back! Oh and one more little thing, one time I went to update my squads from online... and every player's name was replaced by a randomly generated Spanish name except.. from Agger. That might just be my luck though and it was moderately humorous so I'll let that one go. However after the game being out for nearly a year now and I'm still playing it then it definitely must have some very good game dynamics... or it might just be there are no other decent online multiplayer games to play. Oops... sorry Call of Duty and Halo!. I have given this game a 9 as it is everything you look for soccer product. It has the appropriate attention to detail in the players, kits and stadia. I have enjoyed playing this game both offline and online. The ranking system is ideal. The game would have achieved a 10, if small items had of been present, such as a name search in ultimate team, to save time and effort. Also the online play seems to have a few glitches, wether it is caused by connection or poor security, i don't know. I advise you purchase the game. its great fun and sociable.. Hands down best football (soccer for you yanks) game ever made. Fifa 12 is already looking like it's even better, so Metacritic best make an ""11"" score for me.. in my opinion i think fifa has took a step backwards and released a unfinished game even to this day has not had a patch or any of the problems fixed i believe fifa 10 was a better all round game and a better experience. the single player becomes boring and repetitive ultimate team is pointless ass you have people duplicating cards to get ahead and noting is done to stop them doing this so what is the point in spending lots of time getting the team you want for some one to have a better hacked team. my biggest complaint about this game is clubs i loved clubs on fifa 10 and played it till the day before fifa 11 release but there are countless problems on 11 namely the lag/button lag and its not just me its lots of people i play with to i mean fifa is the only game i get lag on and im on 50meg fibre optics also the a.i positioning is awful im sick of seeing 2/3 opposition strikers through on goal get close to the keeper then pull it back across goal for the open net it happens way too many times but it never happened on 10 and pro passing your having a laugh its hardly changed you can still ping pong pass and i will be getting fifa 12 but if its not been improved a hell of a lot it will go back the same week.. Fifa is by far the best game to play with your friends and this edition continues it in my view. Yes it is more difficult to score, free kicks are especially difficult and I usually only score of a deflection at free kick time. But through balls are crucial, you can't just finesse shot everything like in fifa 10 and once you are past a defender the guy manages to run you in mostly. It is in my view the most realistic sports game out there. People have mixed feelings. This is good but I enjoyed fifa 10 more even though this one is probably better.. At first, this game seemed to be amazing with new Be A Goalkeeper mode and a whole new passing system. But, as time went on I realised what these changes had done to the game. The passing is awkward and slow, which makes it difficult to ensure the pass goes to your team mate, rather than the opposing team. The Be A Goalkeeper mode is mind-numbingly boring, as any threat upon your goal is normally dealt with by the defence, leaving you with nothing to do. Also, the addition of Ultimate Team has really destroyed the game's credability. The constant need to buy contracts or medical cards is a huge drain on my time. Another negative is that, even though it is a monumental problem and annoyance, the 'noob pass' has still not been eradicated. The constant threat of noobies in online games has become a burden. However, some positives. The transfers in manager mode are realistic, with new board backing and player status' really has made the game more life-like. The referee's decisions are harsh but fair most of the time, but these virtual men lack the ability to let things go. A foul is commited. It is then twenty minutes before the ball is out of play and the referee has not forgotten. To make this even a 7/10, ditch the noob pass, ditch the stupid passing, ditch the unbelievable defence in poor teams, and ditch the shocking commentators.. the worst fifa i've ever played since i started buying them. SO full of problems. The matches are nowhere near as fluent as previous fifa's. Massive disappointment.. A few bugs and unrefined areas in some of the modes but these things can be easily forgiven for a game that is such a tremendous undertaking. I think my highest rated attribute of the game would be how well they caught the likenesses of the players. Pretty amazing...even the movements it seems. I don't want to begin to wonder how long it took to render them all. Anyway, I'm on my 9th season in career mode so it's safe to say the game is not a bore. Please purchase.. Teams and players update to the latest squads and overall level. Career offers Manager,Player Manager and player. Virtual pro and accomplishments put the iceing on the cake.This is well and truely the way a football game should be made! just watch out for bad losers on xbox live quiting early ! :). A game which had the potential to be so much better than it is. The ideas were all good - online it was too easy to score with 1-2's all the way up the pitch, this was to be addressed with 'pro passing'; career mode was decent, but every game felt the same, other club's never bought players, etc; Be a Pro was limited to only 4 seasons, so this was to be combined with career mode to allow for 15 seasons with the option to be a player, player-manager or just manager. Unfortunately, many things were broken and even removed in this process. There is now no depth whatsoever to career mode as they removed the staff upgrades and also the scouting network. Player growth is also broken as young players will now actually drop in rating no matter how much or how well they play. Be a Pro is unplayable as your teammates run around like headless chickens running into the opposition and refusing to shoot. Online, well head to head is who can abuse the flaws in the game the most. While the 1-2 'ping pong' passing no longer exists, players can now player killer lobbed through balls which completely evade your defence and play them one on one. The game also more resembles a game of rugby with the stronger players literally wrestling other players off the ball. Clubs is full of lag which makes it unplayable. In response to these problems EA released a patch which didn't actually fix anything. As of writing this review (around 2 weeks after the patch was released) they have gone into hiding and are completely ignoring us on these issues. They are only responding to those topics they want to like ultimate team which generates more money for them. In summary, when playing you get the feeling **** game, however there are a lot of bugs and missing features which completely ruin it. My advice would be to ignore all the critic's reviews as they are completely biased towards fifa for the sole purpose of money-making. For the record, I have played fifa since 98 and have never owned a version of PES. I refer you to the fifa forum where you can read some of the posts from other unhappy customers to see beyond all these false reviews: ****/uk/forums/show/34.page Don't make the same mistake I and so many others did.. In short: the best football game ever made. This year's FIFA has taken everything that was good from the last game, and tweaked it further in terms of gameplay and presentation. I know it's a cliche, but when playing this game it looks so much like the real thing. The pro player gameplay is also an excellent addition, as it seems to have killed the 'ping-pong' pass without looking tactic that plagued the game last year. This and an improved AI means FIFA 11's gameplay is fantastic. However there are concerns over the game modes such as career mode, which although its improved from last year, its still nowhere near perfect, and can feel repetitive and boring through extended play. The 'be a goalkeeper' however is a welcome addition, and will satisfy many real life goalkeepers. Online is ok, but a lot of the time the connection is poor and as a result can spoil the online experience. The online friends lobby is great however, and is a great multi-player feature. Overall this is by far the best football game for a complete experience, and i definitely recommend it to all football and gaming fans.. As impressive as it is, there are still plenty of problems which fair enough, some are forgivable but others can be down right annoying beyond belief. Ever played someone when your passes go totally the opposite to where you aimed them. Another thing is when playing against the computer you may pass the ball a bit weak, but your player will never run to get the ball yet the oppositions player will. Impressive footballing game none the less but still needs some improvements.â. I quite enjoy this game. It may not be much different to the last title in the FIFA franchise but it's the subtle differences that make it a better game. The ability to a play as a keeper, despite the simple controls, is a welcome change as it brings more to the game. The new creation centre gives the ability to add to and edit the game. The only reason this game does recieve a 9/10 or even 10/10 from me is that once again it lacks depth in the form of the new ""Career Mode"", it may have a ""Player Manager"" option but not much has improved.. Each year we hear from the games producer (David Rutter) that EA Sports have been listening to the fans and changing the game based on feedback and from June onwards we are treated to a host of football-shirted co-producers generating hype and showcasing new features. On release this talk usually materialises as one new function (this year it's Be A Goalkeeper), promises of improvements to existing modes ('11 has joined Be A Pro and Manager Mode into, ""all new and improved"", Career Mode) and some tweaks in gameplay (this year EA have given us 'Pro Passing'). Whilst 'Be A Goalkeeper' can be fun the game's AI is so poor that you are left watching what looks like a Sunday morning kick about from between the sticks. This years Career Mode is once again an unengaging and shallow experience which is full of bugs that should have been picked up at the testing phase - the alphabetical cup ties making more than a large dent in the mode's authenticity. 'Pro-passing' (whilst not a million miles away from the already present 'manual passing') is a nice idea though can be frustrating when all you want is a fun, 10 minute match. The game once again promised a lot but failed to deliver, the game is in need of a new producer and some real creative ingenuity to lift it from the feature-less, slog it currently is. On a slightly different note the critic reviews which have given this game over 90% need to step back and consider their professional integrity. PALGN and 1UP are the only two publications that appear to review this game properly.. Simply put, when your in control of your team, ie. when not in Be A Pro mode, its fine, the Personality + system is a great addition for those world class players who have those strengths, and are now able to use them more effectively. The general play after that though feels very close to FIFA 10. When you get into the Be A Pro mode, outfield and goalkeeper then the problems start. I'll start with the goalkeeper as i've put about a season and a half in that. The points system is completely and utterly broken. Most games i will finish between 5.5 and 6.5, and generally that with doing one or two things. You barely get rewarded, but get penalised within a second of a minor error. Apparently calling for the ball results in a negative score. Another example is if you don' get a single shot on goal, your left on 6.0, the rating you start on. The assistant then deems you had an appalling game and drops you from the starting 11, absolutely infuriating. Then the commonality with both Be A Pro sections is your AI teammates are awful, can't find a decent pass, and especially as a Goalkeeper your even more helpless to do anything about it.. The best football game I have played ever bar none, I prefer the xbox over the ps3 but this game is great on both consoles, also shows PES as a poor game with little depth and no real detail, a must for any true football fan.. Overly complicated, far too technical. The defenders are almost all, even at lower levels, world class. Yet you'r own attacking players have little to no intelligence. Unless you're prepared to play it for 20-30 hours a week with OCD like dedication you will be frustrated. The whole point of this game for me was that it should be fun but it becomes maddening. Despite all this i know that beneath it all a great football game is trying to break out, it just that i don't have the time to learn it all.. FIFA 11 is the best YET like every new iteration is. I don't see how a previous FIFA is better than a new one. FIFA keeps improving each year in terms of gameplay amongst a whole lot of other things. Ignore the naysayers their probably PES fans trying to bash the game, they should buy lives. The Personality+ is evident and has effect in the gameplay, the gameplay is very FUN! You don't have any other soccer choice, PES 2011 is still not better, so do yourself a favor and GET FIFA 11!. By far the best instalment of the FIFA series to date. I'm yet to encounter any bugs or errors with the game. The gameplay is fantastic and with every instalment, EA manage to make it more realistic and every year it gets closer to an actual game of football. A fantastic game.. I reviewed this as a 10 at first but gradually I have found more and more problems with this game. The ""all new"" career mode has even less depth than ever before, no youth system, no scouting, no picking backroom staff. Annoying e-mails from your assistant manager telling you that you have spotted a good player almost all the time. I KNOW THATS WHY I BOUGHT HIM! Micro freezing still hasnt been fixed. Player growth is poorly thought out, Lower league teams have all the kits and names but plain goalkeeper shirts. Why have they been so lazy as to exclude goalkeeper shirts? Instead opting to just a give a plain shirt wth no sponsor or badge. Pro clubs online has had a server update and more servers added but it still hasnt fixed anything. That mode doesnt work. Personality + is a BAD thing. You cannot have a competitive game that throws in so many random elements. The AI on your team sometimes randomly decides to stick a foot in with bad timing without you controlling it and get a player sent off for a menial challenge. For this next one fan boys will say ""oh well get better duh"" At times the passing is ridiculous, I will be stood with no pressure on me in an open space and all the time in the world, press A to then pass to a player right next to me and sometimes it has passed in completely the opposite direction because a players personality in real life will suggest that he is not good at passing. If Im playing a fighting game and I tell my character to hit a punch and the computer says ""sometimes in real life this guy misses this particular punch so I will make this punch go out wide and miss his face"" I wouldnt play it competitively. Fighting in real life is down to me controlling the situation. Football in real life is the same. It may seem random when looking at it but the way it is controlled is not random. A game needs to do what its told otherwise it basically renders a strategy or skill useless because it may or may not decide to do it. This is not realistic. My leg doesnt randomly decide to pass in the opposite direction to where my brain tells it in real life. Random environment events in a game work, randomising character controlled actions do not. This glitch happens everytime I play a friends league online. For example I pick Marseille as my team in the league. I then play head to head matches after I finish the league and pick Chelsea. My team and shirt are chelsea but if I go to team management it will have the Marseille team list. Go to start game with this and you will have a Marseille player in a chelsea shirt in the arena and then your game will freeze after about 6 seconds. This happens 90% of the time. If you do get a pro clubs game then your randomised team mates that arent pros probably wouldnt even be fit to play in League 2. They are easily out paced and muscled off the ball and so virtual pros stand out from the pack and can stroll through creating unrealistic high scoring games for both sides a lot of the time. This is after only a few weeks of the games release. Imagine what this is like towards the end of the season when the random AI players havnt grown with the virtual pros and the pros are now all much better than even Terry, Puyol, Messi or Ozil with 98% of the accomplishments complete! Its pointless. Im only on 30% and my pro is already better than half Chelsea or Man Utds players. What is good about this game? Well the keepers are fixed and I have scored only 1 lobbed goal and nobody has against me so thats not too easy. The actually gameplay is alright in terms of physics. Graphics are better than last year. Ummm, I can pick my own chants. Oh wait no I cant because if you create your own chants apparently the game cant deal with it and freezes. In all honestly now having played this game more I wish I hadnt wasted my money. Ive spent more time restarting my console with all the glitches and freezing than I have actually playing the thing. Apparently there is a fix on the way but I feel for people who play offline when a developer relies so heavily on updates they cant be bothered to test a game. I remember when online updates didnt exist and games had to be released in working order.. As has become customary with EA's Fifa the initial wow factor soon gives way to the realisation that the game has the usual endemic flaws ranging from the mildly annoying to the game breaking. It is staggering that EA can continuously release a game that is clearly unfinished and where game modes are riddled with bugs. The new concept of Career Mode, hardly a groundbreaking mode in itself, is severely let down by the amount of basic glitches affecting player growth which pretty much renders the mode redundant to name but one. Online the game is a mess. I was initially very impressed with the gameplay as it is definitely more of a challenge this year. However, even here the more i play the game the more i am getting fed up with the hackneyed way in which some of the players behave. Offline the AI of the player controlled teams suffers terribly from a badly designed switching system as mentioned by JudgeMental. This seems to occur regardless of whether you have it set to auto or manual. This gets you into all sorts of problems when trying to do some basic defending as you aren't able to move your defenders into position quick enough to deal with basic through balls and crosses. As the CPU AI has improved considerably (which is one of the good things about Fifa 11) you end up coughing up goals simply due to the fact that you can't get your own players to compete for the ball. The CPU AI will actively intervene to intercept loose passes whereas the players you control stand around looking at the ball and don't seem to have the capacity to stick out a leg to try and gain possession. Trying to win a header from a goal kick seems impossible for these reasons although, strangely this doesn't seem to affect going for headers in the penalty box which forms the most likely route to goal due to the AI defenders, no matter what club they play for, being able to brush you off the ball effortlessly if you try just about anything on the ground. There are some gameplay improvements and i do respect the fact that EA has tried to tighten up the obvious exploits from previous iterations which always lead to the same route to goal. These were absolutely necessary and it is commendable that EA has striven to make the game more realistic by eliminating things such as the oft maligned 'ping pong passing'. However, it appears to me that this has been poorly executed and has all the obvious signs of being rushed onto the shelves without adequate testing. The bugs affecting Career Mode are particularly galling when you consider the atrocious Manager Mode from FIFA 10, which EA did not fix. To repeat this with FIFA 11 is unacceptable.. I have given this title a negative review for the simple reason that it contains lots of bugs and in the 3 days that I have owned the game, has already frozen around 10 times online and offline. EA advertised Fifa 11 with the feature of 'Pro Passing', which I would change to Selective passing. The passes can be more manual than before and that would live up to its name but I would put the same power on a pass and it would try to make a pass in the opposite direction. I have to give Fifa 11 some credit for the way the players look more like their counter-parts than ever, but I think they have taken out the individuality in the players movement. I have always been a great fan of Fifa since PES 4 but they seem to have taken a step back this year with less real life movements. I have given it a few points for the better interface and navigation around the links on the game and I also think it was a good choice by EA to join Be a Pro and Manager mode into Career Mode. Overall I have rated this 3 because of the amount of bugs in the game. I was also very disappointed to find out that the 45 games that I had played so far had been reset because of hackers, cheating their way to the top of the leaderboards, the online ranking point reset only really affected the non-hackers anyway, as the people responsible are still at the top of the leaderboard and EA are no closer to stopping the problem which has cost all of the people who earned the points.. Very poor version, unplayable, full lags on online mode, lot of bugs and gliches. Dont buy it ! Till now nobody is online, servers are extreamly lagged. Offline mode is broken and every game looks same. No tacticks at all. Thanks. This game is like a well placed strike in the top corner of the net, in other words it's pure **** game play is silky smooth,animations are very realistic there are only a few negatives though,some of the player models could have used some more work,the goalkeeping mode can be a hit or miss and some rare AI **** overall this edition of Fifa is the best yet and in my opinion THE BEST SOCCER GAME EVER MADE!!!!. Having not played since Fifa97 but a very active gamer, I picked up played Fifa10, Fifa World Cup, and Fifa 11 within a few months of each other. Overall, this was a great experience for me, but Fifa is not a perfect game, perfect interface, or perfect experience. However the options, variety, polish, and feel of the core mechanic makes it a great game. It is a general year of ""hardening"" instead of big features, but that pays off in spades, in my opinion. The passing and challenging for the ball is A LOT more crisp. Chipping the keeper really only should be done now when it is required, which is not that frequent at all. Playing in the MLS in a Career is a lot more fluid and understandable. The ""Be A Pro"" feels a lot better IFF you realize what you are doing when you chose a team (you need to ensure the position you chose for your BAP exists on the team, or you will be benched all the time). And best, for me, is the fact that the game just flows a lot closer to a soccer game than a video game, for me. One player CAN make a difference, but role players is what the team needs, and makes the game great, especially for Be a Pro (if you chose a view other than the default -- yuk! Broadcast zoomed in to 1/4 all the way for me). As a new player returning to the series, there are LOTS of hurdles to overcome in the interface before games, however. The menu structure is just cluttered, period. There is just so much going on and so many different game types that the menu tree is daunting. If you are looking for how to do moves, which aren't described anywhere sensible, good luck looking for and finding those buried WAY down in the controller screen... somewhere. When choosing a Career, you can choose ANY team which is just really open ended, and not inline with the offerings from the other EA games. This leaves some American gamers I have seen to wonder why you have it at all, as there are no ""Minors"" to play in. There appears to be no progression, but I have not played long enough to know what progression there is. However, if you are not looking to play in the EPL, and just want to play in the MLS, there is nothing other than playing in the MLS. There are TOO many nuisances to passin",fifa 11 is any doubt the best FIFA game i have ever played . this was also the 1st FIFA game i have played online the game play is so smooth and realistic . the best thing with Ultimate Team is that the best players to get have the highest overall ratings which is excellent .
634.LittleBigPlanet PS Vita,"Second best little big planet game ever,I just loved it **** just good.... its insane that this doesnt have higher reviews, this is one of the few first party games you should buy a vita for, aswell as one of the few vita games in general, still love this game and its basically lbp2 on the go which is crazy to see review this poorly, its basically lbp2 on the bus. I recommended this good story and two player and good day. This is byfar the second best LBP game ever made it lives up to the original and it is almost as good as it. Highly suggest this game + the level editor is amazing and its super fun to create levels. The DLC stories are also a blast along with the main story!. Little Big Planet is must own for platforms fans and a worthy game for the PS Vita. Its' attention to detail is shown and its' easy controls make the game fun and enjoyable to play.Overall LBP:PS Vita is a wonderful port from its' big counterpart that brings the magic and creativity with it making it a successful port.. Just a very lovely game. Has all the lbp features that the console versions have plus front and rear touch interactions! The story is fun and the minigames are awesome.. I play lbp usualy for the story this one was very good the atmosphere was charming. Little big planet Vita is one of my all time favorite Vita titles to date. It's basically LBP 2 with even more features and thanks to the Vitas capabilities such as the touch pad and touch screen. Even the Marvel and DC DLC are both fun and interesting that has a way of making you feel accomplished when you finish a level. It's a great pick for your Vita. Oh and you don't HAVE TO PAY $10 TO PLAY ONLINE.. Now this game is pretty great, and actually feels like playing LBP on the go, unlike LBP on PSP. The Vita is powerful enough to handle a proper LBP game. The only thing that really wasn't as good was the graphics, but they're still decent for Vita graphics. The game did crash a few times, but they've definitely patched it by now. If you want to play LBP on the go; this is the way to do it.. This was the first game that I got with my Vita, and was absolutely shocked about how good the game is and how the graphics are compared to the PSP. I had so much fun with this game. I would definitely recommend!. There are games and master pieces, lbp belongs to the second category, this is possibly one of the best games ever made and the psvita version is the best version by far thanks to the tactil controls. Some people may say that is a bit short but I can guarantee you that you'll play it with a smile on your face... if you own a psvita just get it you won't regret it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favourite games for Playstation Vita. I play it all the time. It truly feels like LBP in your hands. It takes ALOT of time to get used to the creation tools, but if you do, the sense of accomplishment you feel after making a great level is just unrivaled by many other video games. Get this game now! Support your Vita so you can play more great games!. It's me, pkillerx (my PSN account name) I have come to finally talk about this game's strengths and flaws. Starting up.... strengths! 1. LBP Vita does have more gameplay, more prizes, and more gadgets. 2. Thank God that LBP Vita still has the ""Unlock Totorials"" option available. 3. Slap's still enabled. 4. New tweak options for each Material, Sacbots, and more. 5. Touch screen enabled. Now for the flaws... -_- 1. Challenges in the Story mode are to damn hard to get 3 stars. D:( 2. Why the hell in that flight level and more do you need to use rear touch pad when the joystick is the recommended option for players?! 3.Broken Multiplayer. Lag Switch on/off... FUUUUUUUUUUUU- 4. sigh* You can't use the d-pad/ joysticks to navigate through levels or Pause Menu... (The most tragic flaw to me personally) NUMBEEEER... 5. If wanted to show a friend something that's incomplete but awesome so far I CAN'T INVITE HIM/HER. Even if that person was in my party, it'll take us to Play Mode and WON'T LET ME GO TO CREATE MODE. Media Molicule (MM)! When are you lazy bumbs FINALLY going to get off your lazy asses and your OWN God-damn flaws in both LBP2 and LBP Vita?! That is all I have to say for LBP Vita. Now for LBP2!. This is downright the best Little Big Planet game in the franchise. The new innovative controls, the extra content, and the unique level design makes this the most rich and experience filled Little Big Planet game. The story s also just as interesting and funny as the other stories and you truly feel satisfied when you play it. The only downside of this game is the lack of splitscreen because it's a handeld, but the online is just as awesome as in the other games. Having played and owned every Little Big Planet game, this is probably my all time favorite. If you have a vita, you NEED this game.. LBP! Yeah sure it´s fun, and must say i´m impressed that it looks just like it´s older name brother on the big consoles. but even then i find it hard to play a game that so much feels like i´d already played through before. If you already have played they other LBP games it´s unlikely that you find much new thinking here. Great multiplayer and online functions saves this game for a slightly lesser score then an eight!. While this is a fantastic game, but it's not the definitive version of LittleBigPlanet like reviewers have said about it. While the story is greatly improved, the create mode has slightly suffered in comparison to the home-console games. The new tools are good and all but I feel like there is a lack of materials in comparison to the PS3 versions, although this will probably be different as more level pack dlc is released for the vita version as we have currently already seen with the Marvel Arcade pack. There's also something I can't explain about it, it's just not as fun as LittleBigPlanet 2 on the Playstation 3.. I was originally convinced this would be the definitive LBP game, and was disappointed to find it was not. Although, the game comes quite close. The story is classic LBP lore, an evil villain has done something bad, you have to stop them. The cast of characters are each interesting and have their own backstories. The classic platforming is back, with lots of little interactable things using the Vita's accurate touch screen. The community aspect is the same as all LBP games, although creators seem to have scaled down the effort on this one, sadly. The create mode is ever present with all the old tools plus more. My problems with this game remain the fact that there is no multiplayer create mode (during my time with it) which was a large source of enjoyment for me in LBP2. The community is much smaller and less experienced than LBP2 ones, thus community levels are not of a high quality (This isn';t really the game's fault) It is not the game it promised to be, but it is definitely still one of the best games on Vita.. Having played all of the previous editions of Little Big Planet this was a no-thought purchase and turned out well worth the money. The Vita version not only incorporated the different capabilities of the of the PS Vita device itself in clever and inventive ways, but it was easily the best one they have made yet. Once all levels were completed, it was still my primary game for weeks going back through all of the various levels. Would highly recommend this game to anyone.. this is the best LBP game ever made. It is better than PS3 version. Story mode is great, there's a ton of room for replayability and create mode wont crash.. Though the game isn't worth buying a vita, it is a really well made portable that, if you have a vita is worth a investment. It is the best game in the franchise and thought like all of the little big planet games, has a story that isn't really that good with some interesting characters. But the ability to save progress in community levels they don't take that much advantage in single player.) and some cool mechanics with the use of the touch pad and gyroscope makes for a great game that any vita owner should purchase. Expands on the LBP experience using the Vita's touch/tilt features in a fun way which doesn't feel at all 'tacked on'. The campaign is fun albeit a bit short. Multiplayer suffers from quite a lot of lag even with a fast internet connection, though this may be due to me being located in Australia.. This is great. It's the only Vita game I own apart from Uncharted: Golden Abyss, both of which are Vita entries into massively popular game franchises, and both of which weren't developed by the original developers. Unlike Golden Abyss however, LPBVita stays true to the Media Molecule standard. It doesn't try and veer off and stamp it's mark as a ""Little Big Planet game, but not"" it's just, a seemless continuation. It's very well done, and you wouldn't even realise it wasn't developed by the same people as the consoles if you didn't actually know. Also unlike Golden Abyss, where the Vita control inclusions seemed like gimmicks, the jump from console to touch screen is easy and uncomplicated. The touch screen and back panel parts are a vital part of the game, but at the same time, are just another element. You don't feel as if they've made this JUST to show off what the Vita can do. Absolutely love this.. I have always heard that little big planet is one of the best games on ps3/psp but i always ignored i never expected much of the game really i always figured it would a silly with no content and with some **** then i played LBPV and i just sayed to myself ''WELL THIS GAME IS FREAKIN AWESOME!!!'' Not only is it a good platformer but it also has a great story that i never expected the mingames are great and very addicting and then theres ton of content to find the customization options are endless for those with creative then i recommend this game beacause literally u can do anything in create a level!!Jumping into levels with fans playing user created levels,addicting games,great lenghted story.This is my firs LBP and i loved i hope i get to try LBP 1&2 one day but for now i have this amazing game and i rate this games 3 out of 3, 5 stars, 10/10, 100 out of 100 the game is awesome if u have a vita buy this game. This is an outstanding little game, it really is! I am a fan of the LBP games on the PS3, but I honestly feel that this game works better on the vita than it does on the console. The vita has one major advantage, and that is the 'Touch' ability which is used throughout the game. Everything about the game is good, the graphics are brilliant, the soundtrack is simply amazing (who makes this music?!!) , and the gameplay is outstanding. I honestly cant fault this game at all. There are loads of brilliant little side games to do aside from the main story, and an arcade area with yet more quirky little games. To summarise, just brilliant! A perfect 10 from me!. This LittleBigPlanet is absolutely beautiful! The PS3 was good but the PsVita achieved its best and making it look like a High Definition success! With new levels and excellent dialogue by the narrator it will be ""creative"" success!. Pleasantly surprised at this great title. I have not dived into the editor or the community yet but the story levels are very fun, and I dare say the best I have played of any of the LBP titles so far. I was wary - I assumed it would not get polish since it is on the Vita: Not so. I assumed going from controlling the sack boy/girl to touchscreen would be cumbersome, again not so. Best game so far that I have played on the Vita. More titles like this and the Vita will have a bright future indeed.. Lovely game, funny and very well acted. Stephen Fry is his usual intelligent Wordsworth. Graphics are lovely and the game play is spot on. I like the floaty-ness. Music is really superb and I am still enjoying this game with the online levels. Personally, I can't make a level that is any great shakes, but there are thousands of people that can, and I can access all of them. Thanks Sony for giving us this great machine!. Everything that made the LittleBigPlanets titles on the PS3 interesting is back along with a notable amount of new features and content. Co-op is fun when it isn't too laggy, and the online community is full of less-than interesting levels. I really have yet to see any great levels that couldn't have been done in LBP2 beyond a few iphone-esque levels, and I doubt anything amazing will ever pop up online. If you want to buy your first LBP game, or you're a diehard fan of the other titles in the series, this is a game you should certainly consider picking up. If you like LBP and you aren't dying to mess around with any new features, I'd recommend LBP 2. This game is AMAZING, and i say that because this is the best vita game I own. There's tons of user-generated content so the fun never stops. There's always something new to play and the gameplay runs smoothly and no lag. The only downfall to this game is the fact that you need an online pass to play online, but other than that this game has great graphics, that run smooth, always a fun game to play, and a great vita experience for everyone. I recommend this to anyone. This is one of my favorite games for vita, right on the day it came out i bought it. The sound, the graphics the new gameplay from the vita are just amazing as i expected from a Little Big Planet game. The multiplayer takes a little to load but is very cool and the creator tool are perfect to create a good and funny level, or whatever you want to create.. Excellent single player, troves of online options. Essentially endless level, finally a Vita title that lives up the hype. Great game. If I could only own 1 Vita game, this would be it. I found it fun and forgiving.. The single player campaign is great fun, really well done with a lot of polish. With that charming, if not a little too-hand-holding LBP style, I'm pretty convinced that this is one of the best single-player experiences that the Playstation Vita has to offer. The game is chock full of content, providing a meaty single-player campaign full of goodies and collectables, even a separate arcade mode with games that you'd pay $2.99 for in the iTunes Store or Google Play store. The game uses all of the Vita's features to boot, too. And with the creation suite? You could be playing this game well into 2014. That's where the good stuff ends. The multiplayer mode, a highly touted feature of LBPV, is just broken. My Vita connects to my network no problem. It connects online no problem - I can download full games from the Playstation Store faster than I can set up a multiplayer game in LBPV. And at least after downloading a full game, I can play it - not so with this game. In my time owning it, I haven't been able to connect once to another player, whether it's someone across the country or someone across the room. Marketing for the game (and the game itself) touts the ability to share and download new levels and the like - and to play multiplayer with friends. All of these are pretty much impossible with the current state of the online.. Absolutely amazing game which everyone should play!! Dont get fooled by the childish game cover or anything this game has a lot to offer even to adult players. Its also kinda hard sometimes ^^. Great use of touchscreen and motion sensors cominated with standard buttons makes it amazingly fun everytime you play. You can create levels , publish them , download/rate/review levels of other players which some of them are really good. This is the neverending journey in a crazy cartoon world. One of best games on PS Vita so far.. As most of the users i can fully agree, Little Big Planet is by far the most fun and entertaining game for the Vita. There are so many things to mention about this game, good integration of all the control concepts of the Vita, nice level design, short but fun story for the campaign, great graphics, good sound and many, many different small games for one or more players! The level editor is easy and fun to use, ensuring a constant flow of new levels designed by other gamers. There are even some short and surprisingly fun two player games that can be unlocked in the basic story, i really enjoyed playing them with my girlfriend in the train. This game really shows what the Vita is capable of and why mobile gaming can really be fun! I really hope there will soon be more games like Little Big Planet to get more attention and love from the developers for this great gaming device.... This game is really how games for Vita should be done - great gameplay, amazing production values and above all excellent use of Vita touch screen features. Most games force you into using rear touchpad or accelerometer in a stupid way but here you really enjoy doing it and it really adds to the experience rather than hinder it. Campaign has a lot of levels which really never stop to amaze you with playfulness and great ideas and when you are done with the campaign already there are tons of quality user created levels + the arcade - so you probably won't ever run out of content with this game. The only downside are longer loading times and sometimes annoying long connecting times to the Sony servers for checking online content.. amazing game every thing from beginning to end is a lot of fun i love this insane game the story impressed me and cut scenes is pretty awesome thank you lbp fans for the good user score. This Is literally LIttle Big Planet from PS3 on your Vita, nothing has been compromised, everything works stupendously, and the added touch functions really gives it the edge over the PS3 version.. This is the best game for the Playstation Vita. Nothing comes near it. Visuals are just perfect, gameplay is a treat especially using the vitas unique controls. Online features will keep you entertained long after you have completed the story mode. This game really sets the bar for what the vita is capable of producing. Very neat soundtrack also. 10/10. What can I say about this game? It is great & It fits perfect in the vita. You can play and create on the **** only cons is that the online gameplay is sometimes little laggy. With LBP series who cares about this infantile plumber??????. To be short and sweet, LBP Vita is the best of the series so far. The story is by far the strongest, the create mode is now next to perfect and the multiplayer is the same classic formula. Simply perfect.. One of the best, if not the best Vita game to date. The best story levels of any LBP game to date, mainly because of the fantastic level design throughout. Amazing boss battles, and fantastic minigames abound. Every level has meaning as it will unlock items for the once again fantastic create mode. Create mode is exactly the same as LBP2, except with more features that add in the ability to use the touchscreens and drag around objects. It's all very intuitive, and is an extremely welcome addition to the game. Create mode now has positional inputs for almost all things (pistons, winches, wobble bolts, etc) and you can now multiply and add signals easily with AND and OR gates. The memorizer allows for the saving of progress in a level, and is an extremely useful tool. Overall fantastic game. If you enjoy creating on LBP2, it's worth buying a Vita for. If you enjoy playing the levels and infinite user created content, it's a must buy for any Vita owner. 10/10. the best game on ps vita so far the graphics the sounds and every thing else very good the touch function impressive and work well like the rear touch pad and motion sensor and the camera the creation tool very good and complete. From the best games on Vita. For my taste is the best in the series. many possibilities, great fun, and incredible. I'd like that if you improve a little more online.. It's little big planet for the vita. It plays like LBP1 or LBP2 for the PS3, and it probably plays like LBP for the PSP. It is pretty easy to beat the single player campaign. Designing levels (creating) is still a difficult and time consuming task. Playing online can be a challenge and I have solid WiFi at my house. About half the time I can't connect or get booted from a game, not to mention the controls, which have never been a strength, are even more buggy when playing online due to glitching or delays due to the internet connection. I do like LBPVita, it just seems like I have done all of this stuff before. I find myself wanting to put this game up and go back to Disgaea or Rayman or Metal Gear Solid instead, so I can't give it a much higher review. If I had never played LBP games in the past or if I was younger and enjoyed platforming games more, I am sure my score would be a little higher.. Now this is a hefty statement.... but I would argue this is one of the best handheld games ever made. At this point, the ""volunteer"" level designers have reached a professional level, churning out content that is equal to, if not better than, most of the apps released on iOS. Not only that, but this is the DEFINITIVE version of LBP. Yes, better than it's PS3 counterpart. It's like having a continuous flow of free high quality game apps on your Vita. On top of that, some of the most talented designers from LBP and LBP2 were hired to build a top-notch story campaign and you have an all-around great experience that may entertain you for the next few years. Bang for your buck? Unlimited!. This is the exact game that the Vita was meant for. Every game I have played so far on the Vita has failed to take advantage of the system either by using its elaborate controls awkwardly or not using them at all. I'm glad in the cases were they don't throw them in there because I'd prefer it not be forced. The point here is that the usage of touch and tilt felt integrated into the game in a way resonated with the physics of the game. It felt as though what you did on the outside had a 1:1 relationship with what happened on the inside. So Vita aspect aside, onto the game. I played the first one about 3 years back and enjoyed it enough but the series really has come along way going on this one alone. Platforming was fun and unique and due to the different theme of every level it really never felt repetitive. The music was good and fit well with the gameplay. The characters were funnier than I expected; I would not go so far as to call them hilarious, but it was certainly written in a witty manner. The story was kind of interesting but was not really the driving factor for LBPV. Visuals. Wow. LBP looks great on the vita. The best part is that I haven't gotten into the community/creation stuff yet so it should get even better fairly once I mess around with that aspect. If you have a Vita this is the game you have been waiting for to make the console really stand out as an impressive piece of tech.. Utter brilliance by Media Module. A game with a great story mod, fun multiplayer, cute mini games, and overall the best experience on playstation vita to date!. An awesome game I brought it a week ago and it worth every penny great graphics, great gameplay looks like LBP 2 and there hundreds of games u can download online for free please buy it. Better than the console versions. The touch and motion controls of the Vita actually add to the fun of this game instead of feeling like a tacked on gimmick the way it does in many other games. The design quality of the levels that come on the game has never been better and the ability to save your progress on the levels you create is essential. I never understood the hype over this series until this game. LBP has always been fun, but I've always seen five or six other Sony franchises that easily topped it. LBPV has changed that and is a system seller in my opinion.. By far the best Vita game available, and the fun literally never ends. For a vita game to have the power to create, share, and download infinite number of levels/games is awesome. Get it! $40 well spent.. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is the best LBP game ever made. I can't believe they both outclassed and outfeatured (I'm allowed to use made up words for an LBP review.) the previous titles. Touch controls are usually a nice alternative and/or addition in most games, but in LBP Vita, it pushes the game well beyond what I thought it was capable of. Level designing alone is worth the price of admission. Seriously. I get lost for hours at a time in it. That and the single-player campaign is the best in the series...loaded with both original content and various arcade-like titles. I'm talking about full iPhone/Android games WITHIN LittleBigPlanet. It works well, too! Very well. This combined with seamless online incorporation makes for a game that deserves a 15/10.. If you like platformers Just buy it. There is enough platforming, community level, and prize collecting fun to be had for months and months on end. If you don't like platformers then you may not be thrilled with it and I'd try it out first but if you enjoy Megaman, mario, donkey kong, or any other classic or current platormer this game is for you.. The game isn. This was my first Little Big Planet game and I can see now why its so popular. An absolute joy to have on the Vita as it feels right at home on the portable system. While the Story is short there are plenty of items to collect throughout and all can be used in the creation mode. Of course this is where the game really shines. I spent more time in the Creation mode tutorials than I did playing through the Story itself. The Community is what this game is really about and though the re-playability of the Story is limited the Creation mode is entirely the opposite. If you own a PS3 and the other Little Big Planet games then all the costumes are down loadable to use on the Vita. Simply... incredible.. Littlebig planet feels right at home on the vita, having played all the lbp's i can say that this one is the best out of all of them. I hope they make more for the vita :). You know how with handheld games you'll play for a short amount of time then turn it off? well LittleBigPlanet Vita isn't one of those games. This game is just like a console game where you can probably play for quite a few hours. Plus on a side note, this game looks spectacular on the Vita, that its a lot like the console versions. Now with that said, it isn't just a full copy, it is its own game, and all the touchscreen controls and other features that seem off when implemented in other games work well here. And so with all the content and user generated levels and mini games etc, this makes one hell of a LittleBigPlanet title and definitely one you should consider.. Great game over all feels like you have the ps3 in your hands this game is really worth getting and if you don't have the vita i recommend getting it. this one game itself makes it worth while. i have been none stop playing it and the touch controls are absolutely amazing and feel great! 10 out of 10 it deserves it!. I have always been a fan of this amazing series since Christmas of '08. Who can't like this series? Now LittleBigPlanet VITA is available and it is no doubt the best VITA game yet. It looks almost as good as its big brothers on PS3, the story is somewhat short but very good and enjoyable, and the creativity is literally ENDLESS!! The platforming is just as fun as PS3's, and the new touch controls are perfect and doesn't negatively inflict on gameplay. There is also lots of customization with plenty of DLC from LBP/LBP2 and new DLC to come. Anyone that doesn't smile while playing has something really, really wrong with them. Get LBP VITA!. This may be the best LBP game out of the entire series. Creating levels is much more enjoyable since I can work on them on the go! Story boards are very well polished, and the vast amount of user levels already is very welcome! This will be taking up my Vita game time (and even take away from console time).. From a first time LBP player Well - that s not entirely true. I played LBP on the PSP and remember having a great time with it. I always wanted a second play through but that never happened. Of course I had been following all the awesome reviews of the game since LBP1 and I was sure I would like it - but the wait for LBP PS Vita was sooo long. The game is amazing - and the best thing I could say is that I do not feel that I need to play the console version to have a fuller experience. It just feels right!. this game is great its have a great story mode and great graphics and endless fun this game have more than 1000 game inside or maybe a lot more then that and if have a vita you gotta buy it. I just love it. I can't put it down and the only reason I'm here is because I've whipped my battery life for all it's worth and it demanded a one hour charge break. It loses none of it's big screen majesty, and in fact feels just as comfortable in your fingers as it would on the biggest of HD screens. Sound the alarm, my game of the year has arrived.. A game that supersedes the rest of the series, this is a wonderful sequel that manages to carve out its own name among gaming greats. The campaign is unique and whimsical, and the creation tools you unlock throughout it open up a plethora of varied opportunities. And if you feel lazy, not bothered to create levels yourself, you can simply draw upon the collective creativity of the rest of the world and play the rapidly growing number of community levels. A brilliant creation, made even greater for the greatest handheld currently on the market.. It finally happened. The Vita has its killer app. What Super Mario 3D Land did for the 3DS, this game does for the Vita. What I mean by that is it uses all of the handhelds mechanics in a useful way and it never feels gimmicky. Creating your own levels is fun and its also fun to go online and play other people's levels. Story is short, but if you are like me, you just play it to unlock items for create mode. Although playing through it in multiplayer is much more fun. I am not afraid to give this a 10. It just does so many things right.. I have always believed that the vita has been one of the only consoles thats powerful enough to rival the current generation of consoles, and as such games on the vita wouldn't need to be scored as traditional 'portable' titles because the hardware is just as capable as consoles. So far, this hasn't been true, until now. Ive really enjoyed playing games like uncharted golden abyss, but if you compare that game to its ps3 counterparts, you can't help but be just a little disappointed with golden abyss. I've always thought the excuse 'Hey that reviewer gave that game a negative score! He should be reviewing this game in the context of the expectations set by other portable titles' shouldn't hold true for the vita, so THANK YOU little big planet vita for proving this. Not only is little big planet ps vita a great conversion of a console title, it actually improves on the existing formula by adding some seemingly minor changes that definitely benefit the game in big ways. Things like the saveinator that allow you to make games where the players can actually save their progress through your game is a little edition that brings huge possibilities with it, so not only can you make quick arcade like experiences now, but you could make a full fledges rpg game that takes 10 hours or more to complete! The new vita specific touch, tilt, and rear touch functionalities are surprisingly a lot of fun as well, and the ability to take a photo of anything and upload it to your level (Don't worry I haven't seen any **** filled levels yet) is a really fun edition. Oh yea, and unlike the psp lpb this game has online multiplayer, and it works really well, pretty much any level can be played with someone else, well, except for the levels that the creator has specifically made as a single player level. There are a couple of things that could make it bet","this is by far the second best little big planet game ever made . the level editor is amazing and its super fun to create levels . the game does crash a few times, but they've definitely patched it by now ."
635.Armadillo Run,"It's extremely subjective if you will like it. It does what it does well, it simulates actual physics with a relatively good toolset, but if you are not into that kind of thing you might absolutely hate it at least after a few levels. Since I got bored of it within a few levels I'll give it a 7, but your mileage may vary, it may be a 1/10 to you, it may be a 10.",cnn's john sutter gives this game a 7 out of 10 . he gave it a 10 because he got bored within a few levels . sutter gave it a 7 because he got bored .
636.World of Warcraft: Legion,"Incredible expansion, the best to this day. The story overall is incredible, the fight against the long-time threat of the Burning Legion feels real and impactful. The Broken Shore Intro is great, the level-up zones are beautiful even if too disconnected story-wise from the overall threat of the Legion, a prettied up and expanded Dalaran as a hub city was a great choice, Suramar and the story of the Nightborne and the rebellion you help with assisting Thalyssra was one of the most enjoyable things I ever did in an MMO, The Broken Shore as a questing area was fine and probably the low point of the expansion but then Argus was just fantastic overall. The Gameplay, content, class-design, dungeons, raids, worldquests, everything! Was just absolutely fantastic and made it a joy to play through the entire two year run-time of the expansion, there was always something to do, that even just slightly actually advanced your character in some slight way. Getting those Lore relevant revered weapons like the Ashbringer or bladed forged from Frostmournes shards was just incredible and the quests for most weapons were a joy to do. The music was just perfect, with there being so many variations of the Dalaran music that played in the city, all the music throughout the initial zones, the various tracks in Suramar, the many tracks for Argus... All of it was just fantastic. I can't praise Legion enough and i miss it. Legion was so good it makes it extra bitter what happened to WoW after it.. Last somewhat decent expansion despite the outdated graphics and the questionable racial segregation they still use for the two playable factions. Everything went downhill right at the end of this expansion, though.... Just because it was over rated to the moon. SOOO many expansion were better. Story didn't matter. A high point in recent WoW history, offering rich content and a return to form in storytelling and gameplay.. The supreme WoW experience. Beautiful ! The storyline is very immersive and interesting.. One of the better expansions for World of Warcraft, has a fairly strong story for once. The whole MMO could have ended on a good note here.. The Best WOW expansion and the time to play. Main Storyline of all Warcraft.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'd say the best one so far at that time. TOO BAD the whole franchise went downhill right after this masterpiece.. I AM MY SCARS! The last good WoW expansion. The game probably should have died with Sargeras.. This game ****, you die 50 times before ever reaching level 20, its too difficult, pvp is unbalanced, terrible combat, mechanics, everything is so bad about World of Warcraft it should stop existing from earth. Honestly the first time i played it i was 12 years old, i cried in front of the boar, it made me have breakdowns, i had a terrible childhood, this game didn't make it better, today im 27 i still cry while playing it, its so bad, it makes you want to end your life.. best game ever, i really really like playing world of warcraft you can find friends do dungeons and raids :) 10/10. It's my favorite expansion in wow. Only with one word it was masterpiece........... Truly cannot believe the filth 0 scores. Legion had the best content, raids and dungeons in forever. There was so much to do in Legion it was ridiculous, and I loved every second of it. Mastered all 12 classes at the time, and all the class order halls! Some of the order halls were breathtaking visual treats like the Warrior and Druid. Awesome zones and incredible soundtrack and end game content was plentiful. The raids and dungeons truly stood out the most in this expansion. Story was awesome. Ignore the 0's because that is reserved for WoD's and Shadowlands' terrible end game drought. Legion gave us mythic+ which most people love to this day. Makes for endless grinding for gear, which is what MMO's are all about anyway.. Well, to be fair, it's not comparable with Vanilla, TBC or WOTLK. But still it rocks, it brought back the vibe with something new and kept some of the old stuff. Still overrates MoP, BFA, Draenor, SDL.. An utterly amazing expansion that introduced a lot of fun systems at the casual side and the hardcore side. Class halls should have been a permanent feature throughout World of Warcraft to maintain that sense of class identity and somewhere cool to hangout.. WoW is dying? Yes, he's dying. And a long time ago. Blizzard just has enough resources to support his agony on artificial life support for many years. Games outside politics. absolute garbage! Just as bad as the rest of the expansions starting with Cataclysm. Hands down the best expansion after the burning crusade, the launch experience was top tier, no lag, no server shutdown. The artifact weapons was the best addition to this game coming later with the mage tower that really test your skills for your class.. Hands down best expansion in the franchise. There was nor will be another xpac as good as Legion.. best extension ever, I loved it so much wow :O Probably even better than wow vanilla !!! PVP is a great into BG or in the map Gphx & Musics are amazing everywhere u can go , it's just a fantastic job made by Blizzard teams ! can just be described by only a word -----> BRAVO !. It is nice to see how good blizzard can make wow when listening to the players. Best modern expansion. Really mixed bag. The aesthetics are great, but you get three years of the same theme of demons, black rocks, and green lava. There is a tremendous drop in the musical quality of WoW coming off of the prior expansions. For the first time, I found most of the OST to be a dud. Classes were once again overhauled and gutted for no reason, when they were fine as is in prior expansions. There is more content than in WoD but the quality has not improved. The writing of the main story is really bad. Legion also really suffered from RNGendaries and artifact power grinding.. God awful game. I don't get how people like this game. The raids and gameplay are so dull. The graphics look like its still from 1999-2001ish. It should've gotten at least a small upgrade by now. I've tried it probably 4 times for a month on and off since 2018. Final Fantasy XIV is superior in everyday.. And unlike blizzard. Square enix isn't known to s3xually harassing their employees. Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn AND the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime?. For me, World of Warcraft: Legion is proof that modern WoW can be good if they listen to player feedback and give their development team enough time. Legion could shine only because they halted development on the previous disaster of an expansion (Warlords of Draenor) and poured all of their resources into making a great successor. I did not resubscribe until 7.1.5, but when I did, I would play daily for several hours until the expansion was over. I experienced every bit of content available and never grew tired of it. Artifact Weapons were a great idea reminiscent of the fondly remembered old talent trees, and Mythic Plus breathed new life into the game that—perhaps for the first time since Wrath's Heroic Dungeons—managed to make dungeons a relevant bit of end-game content. However, as we all know now, Legion was not the turning point for World of Warcraft that many of us had hoped for, as the expansions that followed it were both quite mediocre.. Great variety of activities. Most of all I liked the random battlegrounds. To participate in battles, you did not need to sit and dress the character in other content of the game. You came and started playing with your friends the content that suits you best. The mechanics of the characters are magical, in no other addon of the game I have played with such a number of characters ""Я влетаю в стройку"". Great game! This exact expansion brought me back to WoW world after I left on Pandaria.. This expansion managed to keep up my expectation. Thanks Blizzard!. I joined at the end of WoD so this was an expansion that I experienced fully from the start (not to the finish but very far), overall I had a lot of fun playing and the whole artifact system was also very nice. Legion is what destroyed WoW. Worst class ever conceived. Specs completely destroyed. Destro and Demo Warlock, Survival Hunter, Shadow Priest, Combat ->Outlaw Rogue. Convoluted progression systems that carved away any sense of growth during the leveling up process. And the worst part is that at the end of every expansion it is taken from us. Legion seriously damaged WoW and we're still suffering from its flawed gameplay design.. I know a lot of people liked this, but i just could not bring myself to care at all... Blizzard really needs to learn to leave there storylines alone.. Having played BFA and Shadowlands I realise that this should have been WoW's swan song.. The game fixed the problems of predecessors, there is an interesting plot here, which makes the game very attractive. The Burning Legion coming back on Azeroth, just this is a catchy thing for me. Fighting demons with the legendary artifacts from WoW's greatest champion had no price for me. Really liked also the M+ system. Raids were cool, from EN to last one Antorus. Really a great expac. Only thing, maybe a bit too much farm for the artifact power.. The best expansion ever, plain and simple. Good amount of content with quality and enticing lore. Raids were fun.. The PvE elements of this expansion were actually quite interesting to start off with, but the PvP experience is absolutely atrocious. After blizzard claim they want PvP to be balanced in every possible way, they actually managed to do the complete opposite. Some classes are 10x better in terms of mobility, damage and survival than others are. For example a demon hunter or a rogue can survive for literally 10x longer with their cooldowns than a warrior can. Warriors will just flop to the ground and die immediately in a 1v1 situation with almost any other dps class. Not to mention how bad the PvP gearing system is, you have to do PvE in order to increase your damage and viability for PvP. The new artifact system also makes it a very rigorous grind when wanting to make a new max level character and have that character actually become useful in a PvP scenario. Overall, the game got everyone's hopes up, then just crashed and burned.. The best expansion since Wrath of the Litch King. The only downside is the overwhelming amount of RNG and grinding needed in the end game.. Took some time but they got it right towards the end genuinely love this expansion. Garbage content. Game breaking Mechanics and skills. This is where the game died. One of the best expansions of WOW i really liked the idea about bringing back Illidan.. This expansion had it all, great gameplay and compelling story throughout. Bravo.. Best expansion ever! So so much lore, almost all iconic characters that wow has - gather to defeat legion. Class halls, with unic style and quests, artifact weapons, great overall story and incredible updates thruout expansion, with gigantic content pathces (7.123 etc), one of the best cinematics, and comics, great and meaningful raids with huge impact on story of the expansion. Especially, after looking at BFA shameful ending and all other bad stuff, i look back at Legion and really understand how great it was/. I think Legion will be remembered as the peak of World of Warcraft. It introduced several new systems - world quests in particular - that were so instantly and massively successful that they couldn't find any way to improve them for years afterward. Artifact weapons felt amazing. So much power and flavor packed into one item. I can't imagine how Blizz will ever surpass them. The Broken Isles themselves were phenomenal, filled with story and gorgeously realized. Suramar in particular is another remarkable achievement. The entire zone is packed with story and things to do, that all tie together into an amazing journey once you hit max level. It has already become a talking point for Blizzard, like the phenomenal story progression in Escalation, patch 5.1 - and just like 5.1, Blizz has repeatedly revealed that they have no idea what made Suramar so successful. And then 7.3 was the biggest patch ever, packed to bursting with unbelievably cool story moments. Legion was incredible. It's sad to look back now, and realize how little Blizzard learned. But I'm grateful we got it all.. A Great expansion with lot of fun content and story line, a great end to a lot of characters from the franchise. Not perfect , but most likely. I missed PVP vendors this time, but the PVE was just awesome. Great Class design but we lost a lot of spells. DH are just fun to play. PVP is not balanced but it's enjoyable, but no much as on Draenor.. I just miss the good old days when this game was what World of Warcraft stood for so long.... Awful expansion. Artifact power grinding. Rework of all classes, and some of them lost uncial mechanics. And green color, I hate it after Legion, because everything was green and i so tired of it.. Best Xpac ever. 10/10 P.S. when compared to BfA - 100000000000000000000000000000000000/10. this expansion was the most engaged I've been in a wow expansion since WotLK. Outstanding content. It's a bummer that BfA has replaced legion.. Thank l for such grind content and “amazing” random. Just give me my money back and have fun with yourself.. I have been playing WoW since the end of 2009, and I must say this is a great expansion! The past two expansions sort of went off the main story line, so Legion brings that back and continues it. The questing was a blast and I got wrapped up in the lore very much. It was nice seeing old characters return and some had to make heroic sacrifices. It really got my emotions going because the characters were developed so well. The later patches and additions were fantastic, and the expansion winded down smoothly. The next expansion is arriving in a couple of months but I'm still enjoying every moment of this one. Kudos to the Blizzard team for stellar work. The game's art, story, voice acting, and so much more are excellent. Looking forward to the things the team has in store for us gamers. For Azeroth!. The expansion that got me playing a lot like I used to Until WOTLK. It eventually dies down because the raids were lacking and bland. The last raid tier is really fun however. The Final boss has some nice RP elements. Artifact weapons are great and DH class is fun.. Much became better, but simplified mechanics(especially in pvp) and new stupid lore and story made this exp not perfect. The Game itself is quite enjoyable for a playtime of a month but lacks in many aspects like crafting,pvp and lacking individuality of your characters. Multiboxer destroying the fun for normal players and Blizzard allows it.. Ever wondered what would happen to WoW PvP if the lead design was handed to a numale moron with dyed hair who plays WoW using an art tablet instead of a mouse? Welcome to Legion!. This game took me by surprise. The most popular MMORPG in history with millions upon millions of players was supposed to be entertaining and shocking. This was not the case. The game is an eternal grind for useless gear and levels. Let me explain. As you level up you begin to receive less and less loot. This should be normal in any MMO. However, the PVP system is built around having all players equalized with the new ""Military Priorities"" perk that levels out all players on the battlefield. Yes, most could consider this only fair to keep veterans honest and help new players excel or at least try to. My deduction is that if you want to play a leveled out game with max characters, head to any moba. SMITE, league of legends, even heroes of the storm is like picking out a max level world of warcraft character and duking it out on an even playing field. World of warcraft is supposed to reward you for your grind and hard work, but all you end up getting is an even playing field where one team may or may not have healers, or decent dps. The endgame is basically luck and hoping your team has some semblence of cooperation. The game has lost its touch and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes free to play by 2020 because the hype and money income from Hearthstone, Overwatch, and heroes of the storm will die down. I'm sure World of Warcraft has a negative net income. I give WoW a 3/10. The graphics are nice, it has unique classes, and sometimes it can be quite a joy to play. But after playing around 15 hours you will start to think: ""what am I doing playing this game""? as you queue up for another useless round of PvP.. It has some good PvE elemnts to it. Not much but some are good. The legendary system is a JOKE. The loot system is also a JOKE as whole. Mythic+ Dungeons are a new element for wannabe Elitism people to judge everything based on meaningless numbers. Then you run the same dungeon over and over and over and over again just to get maybe one item and Artifact Power for your weapon, because thats it at the end. AP grind much. Nothing more. The game itself is too much based around Raiding. Best gear, Sets etc. only in raids and only there. Nothing comparable to these in any other place in the game. PvP... is in the WORST state ever since 12 years. It has the LOWEST participation in pvp since ever. It is plain HORRIBLE. WoD had bad PvP, and most players thought it can not be worse in next expansion, guess what.. Legion came out and it IS even worse than WoD! Blizzarc cleary shows that they do not care in the slightest about PvP and their players. They want it ti die, it seems. The Story could be ok, when it wouldn't be dragged out like CRAZY. I mean you play like 2 different expansions to run after one Boss and finally kill him. Then out of a sudden whole Planets appear etc. It sometimes doesn't fit the whole WoW style and just doesn't make sense at all. WoW Legion at the end is like Diablo, more so than Diablo itself should be. And thats thanks to developers and designers which came over to WoW team from the Diablo team, after the fiasco that Diablo 3 was. Now they destroy WoW... it is really a shame when you think about how good Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK was. Maybe even MoP too. It is not worth monthly cost anymore, not in the slightest.. If you thought world of warcraft was bad, the expansion is even worse. No game play improvements what so ever, no fixes to auto targeting where you dont even have to look at your enemy to shoot them ect, fetch quests galore, no customization and still, the worst of it all a SUBSCRIPTION FREE? Are they out of their minds? From blizzards mishaps of diablo 3, starcraft 2 and world of warcraft, the company doesn't seem to know whats good anymore. I would stay away and play much better games like Path of Exile. The first expansion since WotLK to hold my attention consistently since release with only some minor breaks. The mythic dungeon system is something I've wanted since BC and I think it's an amazing addition to the game, although it could use some refinement (which the next expansion may fix). The Suramar story for me was the highlight of WoW storytelling. There's a lot to do in the expansion, Legion itself became more altfriendly by 7.3 which was something I used to complain about at 7.0. PvP could use some love and hopefully the next expansion fixes it. Overall great expansion with some room for improvement.. Legion was giant improvement over failure that WoD was Pros + Amazing dungeons with mythic + system + Frequent updates + Good number of raids + Class order halls and class campaigns + Beautiful locations that feel alive because of world quests + A lot of content to do Cons - M+ can get boring - World quests aren't very diversive and they also get boring after some time - CONTENT GATING. So as i predicted in my soon after release review game lasted only 1 week horrendous grinding no alts allowed every class has 1 decent talent choice. Played as a druid and noticed why to hell i would bother playing other than resto each other specs are absolute **** specially balance. Over simplified talents also ruin game removes any flexibility. Once they tried to remove rng from this now it is just full of it every item etc. Zones are clearly designed for flying mounts and same **** as draenor ""Before you can fly Mr Bond you need to you must get certain achievements"". Achievements in this case forced content. Game has also become virtual **** jousting my gearscore is bigger than yours. Yippee finally i can run mythic **** in vanilla you actually were either good player or just piece of turd. Decent gear now is just rng gods are with me or they aren't you notice this in example leveling. How to get **** jousting with other guys you basically grind your fat ass off either its right legendaries or to upgrade your legendary weapon. So repeat same instances, garrison quests or weekly stuff, Professions have become biggest joke why the hell would you waste stuff using level 1 recipes. Some professions you get these **** reward quests you get 5 skill points when you go cliff take of your trousers take your weenie out have right items purchased and piss all over poor lad. You should always upgrade recipes to rank 3 because it's economical same could be said about gathering. So waste of time doing items when they might with be upgrade. Questing and story same old boring stuff that most players are fed up. Either it's kill stuff or collect stuff. Each prof is also tied to some dungeon and zone too need to basically do whole zone to open. Dungeon profession quests was stupid idea at burning crusade and still is. So game offers you grinding, nothing new, copied ideas from free to play games such as GW2, toxic community and joy of getting yourself dungeons or raids with utterly **** or otherwise speshial people. Oh joy! Luckily there are plenty of better things do like having a life. Best way to enjoy this game is never getting one or uninstalling it. Subsription is not worth it not any login rewards just endless grinding.. perfect in every way period. now to leath it out ...................................................................................................... Not my favorite expansion, but a damn close contender. The Demon Hunter class is extremely fun to play, and the content is abundant. With class halls and artifact weapons you truly do get a sense that you're discovering more about your character. Definitely an improvement over WoD :). I'll try to keep it organized. I've played the game up until march 2017 since, well, release I suppose. Story wise expansion is great. That's good news. Bad news: good news end here. Legion has introduced new levels of RNG walls, class simplification and content recycling. Prepare to experience the wonders of grinding for AP and legendaries, doing repetitive World Quests, and visiting same dungeons over and over again, but this time forced to go there, as best AP and out-of-raids gear can only be obtained there. To sweeten the pot - chance to get what you actually want in those mythic+ dungeons is extremely low (instead of individual loot pools from each boss you only get 1-2 items from doing the whole thing, so chances to get particular item drop through the ground, not even to mention that most of the time you need that item to ""roll high"" - get a sufficient titanforged bonus for it to actually be good for you, which adds another layer of rng on top of already awful rng wall. Grinding for legendaries is another plague that was added with Legion. If you harbor hopes of doing any high-end content - prepare to grind day and night, unless you are one of those lucky persons who win big in casinos in first hour: getting throughput legendaries that are not junk will require you to sell your very soul to RNG gods. Out of pool of ~8 possible legendaries (for the time when I quit) normally only 2-3 are really good, rest varying from semi-decent to ""burn and scatter that trash right now"", really depending on class. This also not only impacts directly your chances to be taken into a good progression group (also directly linking your luck to how well you can perform - without right legendaries you will never get close to other players who have them, and so you will be quite likely turned down by many progress raiding teams). Not to mention that you should probably give up any hopes of playing your alts - if going through legendary and AP grinding hell on main wasn't enough, you can always opt to repeat it on your alt and sink another sizable chunk of your life into this frustration fueled experience. This expansion is totally not alt friendly for said reasons: grinding AP, grinding legendaries, and the fact that thanks to lack of weekly lockout on mythic+ time you spend on your alt is time you could spend improving your main (and potentially getting that one sweet, sweet legendary). If you are in a progression/mythic oriented guild - you will always be reminded that you should be grinding on your raiding character instead of having fun with alts. Definition of ""Legendary"" items has reached new bottom: not it's not just rather ordinary to receive a ""Legendary!"" item, now it also can be disappointing and frustrating! Players that stay for longer periods of time are the ones that are getting hurt by new Blizzard course the most. Currently game is strongly oriented towards ""seasonal"" players: players who come for a few weeks every time new content is released, only to abandon game until next content influx. If you are kind of player who sticks around from patch to patch. Prepare to be frustrated by the game, and prepare to be disappointed every time you see that one friend of yours (who doesn't even really remember what's going on plot-wise) log in for a few days when new content is out to ""check it out"" only to luck out and get his best in slot legendaries and high titanforged items, then snarky remark that ""lol, that's all content?"", and proceed with quitting until next patch, while you still don't have the legendary you want half a year after launch and doing content weekly since then. Prepare to grind your soul out trying to get your hidden artifact appearance (especially Combat ""aka Outlaw"" rogue one. Really, good luck with that, I've personally met ppl who have ran both of those dungeons over 400 times each, and I myself ran them over 150 times without getting anything). Prepare to hear how some random guildie will get one on his alt and never use it, or laugh in chat about how easy it was. Classes have devolved even further, under false pretense of ""trimming""/""pruning""/making them ""fun"" to play. Instead of fun you get flashiness and instant gratification centered gameplay with little depth to it and low skill ceiling (even MoP/Cata were better in that). Some classes stay broken months into expansion without any improvement (promises that ""it's coming soon"" don't count) - look up hunters ever since legion launched, or warlocks. Overall I would place Legion among worst expansions World of Warcraft ever had, even more so because things it did get *really good* get simply crossed out by how frustrating and grindy game has become. Yes, story is good. Yes, raiding is somewhat solid. Yes, mythic+ is fun to do, but only at first. Yes, introduction of appearance collections and sets is welcome. But all of it gets totally overshadowed by how much game has degraded in its very core aspects.. After almost a year of Legion i decided it was time to end my time with **** you're someone who likes to do repetitive quests each day, than this game is for you!!!!! The reason is that World of Warcraft Legion is no longer a World of Warcraft ****'s a World of WorldQuests game. Character progression is based on world quests. Game progression is based on world quests. Artefact progression, class order progression is based on world quests. PVP is template based ****'s UNBALANCED. They sometimes introduce small class changes in order to balance things...SMALL they say.. from 7.2 to 7.2.5 they almost doubled the Warlock Chaos Bolt damage. SMALL changes. This goes to show how balanced things are... I almost feel like they never play a battleground before releasing a patch. Feels very stupid from their side. Coming from someone with vanilla experience I have to say that the fun factor has dropped significantly with Legion.... I'm really sad to say and write **** hoping for some patches to repair things but unfortunately it's worse and worse.. I love Legion. My score and frustration with the expansion however can summarized very quickly. Suramar rep grinding/gating. That is all. They're creating the illusion of content by forcing tedium upon you to drag an already boring overfilled zone even worse.. It's pretty bad. The social element and the gameplay is pure grindfest on all fronts. Every meaninful achievement is ""time gated"" which means you will have to wait for cooldowns to do simple quests or cooldowns to achieve any level of power. It's pretty much a ""game"" meant to exploit your commitment and time.. World of Warcraft Legion starts off of beautifully, the new areas have the feeling of the old world of warcraft. People helping one another when questing like the good old times. I love how they crafted the world. The storylines you follow while in the leveling up process are brilliant they come with cinematics too, This is a first for Wow. At this point in the game i felt like wow has changed for the better, revolutionised, until you finish the story lines for each area... Even when you hit cap in late game level 110 things still don't go downhill, theres area quests that keep you occupied and you can help one another and you get gear from this. The item level system is more forgiving this way. The raids are challanging and exciting. These are the pros. Now the cons. To fly in the legion world requires a huge grind of an achivement. without spoiling it they made it in such a way that your doing mindless boring tasks everyday for ages to a point until it turns into a chore. I rather do chores at work to get paid over time, then do boring mindless repeptative task and pay them! ( 3 months in by the way) Firstly you have to complete the storylines and the last one is terrible. You can only do so many quests before you have to actually grind rep to unlock these quests for the flying achievement. They do this to boost monthly subscriptions and thats not the only problem. They made the area of the final storyline questing place such a way, it wastes your time and your money. The drops in raids are very low. I went on doing raids for a few weeks before getting a drop. Thats how bad it is. 1 drop per 1 boss a week even though you don't get a drop. It seems like the game will be like this until it has a very small player base. I'm done with the game for good after 7 years of returning. No more i'v had enough. If your looking to start World of Warcraft again after so long stay away, believe me its not worth your time or effort. Don't get me wrong the first bit of the leveling process is amazing. But it seems like a marketing tactic to draw you in with a solid start to make you believe the the game has changed. Well it has changed, for the worst. To be honest i cannot see the games future, and don't wish to be a part of it anymore.. Like most expansions the initial story is pretty good. It pulled me in and I enjoyed leveling my main and even building my order hall was kinda fun. But then it hits with their patented brand of rep grinding to unlock quests to grind more. I wanted to unlock flying, but after doing some simple math I didn't want to spend the time repeating generic quests to fly around a continent I was already bored of. It just feels like end game progression has no choices, its rep grind the only way possible","the story is incredible, the fight against the long-time threat of the Burning Legion feels real and impactful . the gameplay, content, class-design, dungeons, raids, worldquests, everything! was just absolutely fantastic and made it a joy to play through the entire two year run-time ."
637.Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire,"Story, characters and options were all less interesting and I hated the ship mechanics. Best turn based rpg ever made. Perfect game in all aspect. Must play if lime turn based gsmes.. Extremely better than the first chapter. Fantastic side quests, outstanding world building and unforgettable characters. A must have for all crgp lovers.. I played throug the first one and enjoyed it so it was a no brainier for me to go to the second. It is very similar to the first one and gamewise maybe better, however I could not take it to play through the whole thing since the story was so boring and slow I just gave up after 40 ish hours. Everyone who rated this as a bad game didn't explore the game likehe/she should. It's not perfect, but it is a very good game. To me, they made turn based combat quite boring and there is some wholes in story and choices at the end. Overall, this is a 8 - 8.5. Boring and lackluster. Obsidian is an interesting case **** studio receiving a lasting god-like status for just one game, New Vegas, meanwhile most of other games they’ve released are ok at best. Pillars of Eternity II is far cry from glory days. It’s a CRPG that would look good at turn of the century, but manages to be too more-of-the-same and too different at the same time now. It feels dated compared to Divinity and not deep enough compared to Pathfinder, exploration feels generic and the quests are just uninspired. Writing somehow got worse since original Pillars and it shows especially with returning characters, like Eder, humour is more childish and the whole atmosphere is now less grim. Combat is fine, graphics are decent, but sad fact is – competition is killing it right now, while Obsidian continues to put out mediocre new “classics”.Overall, Deadfire is an OK CRPG, it won’t wow you, actually, it will probably annoy you at times, but there is some decent time to be had for anyone craving familiar CRPG gameplay or respects Obsidian’s efforts. Presentation - 9/15 Uniqueness - 2/10 Gameplay - 14/25 Story - 13/25 Subjective interest - 15/25 Total - 53/100. PoE:II is an improvement in everyway over the original and it sets a very high bar for any RPG to try and follow. Masterclass in storytelling and character development with every D&D mechanic you can want in such a game. I enjoyed it immensely and it deserves to be in the hall of fame along Baldur's gate 1&2 and their like. Obsedian are masters of their craft. they present a very compelling world with complex narratives, gods, characters, myths, magic and mystery. While in the first game you had a friggin castle to manage, defend and develop here you've got a ship! with a colorful crew too! I love the style of writing in this game which makes every character and location feel like they are truly part of the world. it's a brilliant game and I will be singing it's praises for years to come. This is the perfect game for RPG lovers and D&D lovers (though that mechanically this isn't D&D but close). A Highly recommended game!. Very good cRPG, in the line with the previous game but objectively better game. Improves significantly some questions of the gameplay, but his history, although deep and well written, lacks the freshly of the original PoE. The timeline of the quests appears to be chaotic with strange interrelation between main&secondary quests. 200+ hours into the game I can say it's one of the best game I ever-played.. Continues the story (love the writing) and has same great customization, combat system and sense of humour as POE 1 - and the addition of the ""moving base"" / ship is fantastic! Haven't finished it yet - but totally loving it!. Huge step up over its predecessor. Interesting concept of a pirate rpg, the story and setting are both very engaging. There are many interesting questions posed to the player, small and large. Combat is fun and did not wear out its welcome. Characters a bit hit or miss but some real stars in there. Soundtrack and presentation appropriately mythic.. Very entertaining! Some challenging battles, endearing characters -- and some companions and NPCs that made me feel feelings, both good and bad. Not sure if I totally buy the premise, but it's fantasy, I guess. :) Can't wait for the next Kickstarter .... In its core a great game is hidden but I'll deduct a full 2 points for the shabby state this game is in 4 years after release. There a game breaking bugs with gear / spells / potions. Bugs that can ruin full playthroughs. There's memory leaking (I thinks this was an issue in P1 too). After 1-2 hrs this gets unbearable. Also you can clearly see some areas are extremly fleshed out and others lacking heavily. The characters and the combat system is satisfying and I have no complaints there. The story is well thought out and deeply philosophical just like in the first game. Atm this is on gamepass. I recommend grabbing it there.. In spite of improving on its predecessor in many aspect, the sequel simply does not reach the same heights as the first instalment. While mechanically much more sound, the story and characters do not feel as endearing as the first game.. I wanted to like this game more because I really liked the world and all the deep lore, but it had so many things going against it. The writing is pretty bad my biggest problem is the inconsistent tone, the gameplay is too safe, and too old school imo, and it felt that it provides 2 interesting dungeons in my 40-hour playthrough and the ending was just lackluster. I love RPGs but I think there are better options out there to put the hours in. I will still give it a 7 because again I liked the world, the locations were beautiful, good music and good sound, there are some interesting quests and the combat is pretty enjoyable for a time. I also liked the reputation system and the responsiveness of the world to your actions.. well untill the end.. Besides problems witch long loading, pillars of eternity 2 is One the best experience playing classic RPG. The Turn mode works better in this game, the lore is so fantastic, it's One of the most underrated game that I had played.. It's a bad Divinity ripoff. The first game tried to copy Baldur's Gate. It's a series with no original ideas of its own. Even if we leave the story aside, the gameplay is terrible.. I decided to play it in turn mode. The story of the game initially is cool, but as the game goes on, it gets dense, with many unnecessary characters and dialogues. I managed to finish Pillar of Eternity in 65 hours of gameplay: I completed several side quests and obviously, the main quest. It's a good RPG game. The game is open world and there is a navigation system and naval battles different from conventional RPGs. I liked the game, but I confess that I expected more since I saw the many positive reviews before playing it. I recommend the game, but it's nothing fantastic.. In one sentence: fun combat but mediocre story 7/10 Pros ----- - Beautiful grahpics - Endless skills / weapons - Satisfying combat - Nice finisher animations - Ship management increases immersion - Entering other ships is fun - Quickload/Quicksave is really good Cons -------- - Load screens when you enter a house or even a new floor of a house, this is really too long - Too much religious blah blah - Story and most dialogues rather boring - Pirate settings is so overused I can’t believe why they chose that - Not much to do on many islands - Disappointing ending. The game feels extremely unsatisfying to play. A huge disappointment. Not even close to baldurs gate. It just tries to be what it isn't. There's no real depth to the world, most of the NPCs speak with one-liners, stand in 1 place all the time and are more like decorations than actual people. This isn't how you make this kind of games. The game is in poor technical condition- lags, bugs, takes ages to load. But the woke sure is there, the game's just infested with it.. This game builds alot upon the first pillars of eternity, but also has a Awful ending, the game in its entirety is pretty amazing, and worth playing, it adds on a lot of new features that are kind of awesome, like the dumb boat, with repetitive fights, or the many islands, with places to see and explore, loved its dlc, for what the game is, i liked it alot, but that ending, sours every aspect of playing this.. Classic. Following the D&D line. A huge LORE with great character involvement. System in the line of old RPGs.. Awesome, but I would like to see more visual affects in the future games. For instance, ship's fights could be animated. A masterpiece, made with a lot of love. It is not perfect but is probably the best you can do while staying true to the ""classic"" CRPG genre (including fixed, but absolutely beautiful backgrounds).. What a lovingly well-crafted game this is. From the beautiful animation and awesome story that carries over from Pillars of Eternity 1. Was a bit disappointed though how my original charater from #1 was Nerfed badly so I have changed my rating to 7 / 10. Great game, just like its predecessor PoE1. A must have for RTwP fans. There is one caveat only: it's too easy except the hardest difficulty level, so this will be hopefully addressed in the future.. Ultimately I developed a love/hate relationship with this game, that continued to its deeply unsatisfying conclusion. It is in many ways an improvement over POE 1. But would I recommend it to a D&D game fan? It depends. To anyone not already a fan of the genre? Definitely NOT! The good: Enemy and companion AI is a big step up from the first game. Characters have more voiced dialogue. Characters are more grounded and there were better companion interactions to be had. Some settings are very creative and pretty. The class system is more polished and intuitive. Some more compelling side quests and 3 DLCs far better than the base game. The game even got a bit philosophical at times. In places it had that old school Baldur's Gate quirkiness that is missing in most modern games. The bad: Fight balance. How items were handled. I liked the idea of finding gold items and upgrading them until they had the best stats in the game and came with a special ability, however a lot of the time this meant I found a best in slot item for a character, and had no need to change it out for the rest of the game. I took half my crew through the whole game never changing off the equipment they started in. It already had the good perk attributes, so it was just a matter of upgrading with gold and generic crafting stuff. So that took some fun out of itemization. Potions/scrolls would have made a big difference early on, but it costs gold to brew/craft them. Was too poor to when they would have made a huge difference and by the time I was rich enough to, I'd amassed basically all I'd need. So that was largely a wasted opportunity. The 4 major factions in the game are all flawed. Perhaps too flawed to the point it was hard to see redeeming qualities in any of them. I appreciate they didn't want clear ""good guy/bad guy"" choices. But the factions could have shown more good to go with their bad. Then there was ship combat. Basically its own text adventure that ended in a typical fight anyway. I appreciate this game is small budget and chose not to go into battle animations or cutscenes. But the text crawl with unclear rules made it no fun if you know what you're doing and just bad if you don't. Finally the main plot started off strong, but ended with a whimper, not a bang. It started out better, but ended worse than most of the side quests and DLC.. This is the best CRPG game simply because it has by far the best combat of them all. No longer do you just spam heal and attack like in other games, here you have to actually use your skills and items with different tactics each battle. Muticlassing and leveling characters is fun. I can't go back to any of the older CRPGs after this one, it just blows them out of the water. The only problems with the game are the boring story and naval battles, but they don't take up too much time. Would recommend playing with the Diffuclty Tweaks mod so you don't get overlevelled.. Exceptional game and rich world full of nuanced side quests and fulfilling character development.. Too many things felt off with this game. From the weird aesthetics of African italians in European clothing with weird accents (woke?) to the whole theme of pirates and Islands. Characters were pretty weak as well. Apart from Eder, Aloth, Xoti and Serafin, there wasn't much there. And even then Aloth and Serafin are not the best characters ever created exactly. I did like Xoti and Eder is a likeable classic from PoE though. Some may like it better than PoE 1 and it did have some great moments, but overall a very ""meh"" experience. Especially comparing to Pillars of Eternity 1 in my opinion. The plus of the game is the movement with the text-RPG, those I really liked. But the story, atmosphere, characters and quests were all worse than PoE. The terrible combat from PoE was neither improved. The music is pretty good, but not again as good as Pillars Of Eternity 1. Still as a fan of RPG:s, I say, give it a try. However, I personally burned out pretty quickly on the game and had to force myself to finnish it. I hope if they make a PoE 3, which I hope they do, that they take it back to a classic adventure setting without pirates and that they improve on the things mentioned as negatives in this review: aeshetics, setting, combat, mainquest, characters. + Text RPG moments Beautifully made enviroments Music - Aesthetics Setting Character choice (too few good characters) Factions Combat. A huge positive impression. Played 300 hours and did not meet the monotony of them. A very elaborate combat system, masterpiece quests, excellent tracks that are pleasant to listen to separately, well-developed lore, excellent graphics. It's surprising that such a small estimate. Of the shortcomings, after an abundance of battles in the game, FPS drops on my rysen 7 2700x and gtx 1070, after loading from the main menu, everything is fine again. Less than 9 out of 10 (due to technical problems) this masterpiece does not deserve, it is a pleasure to pass on high difficulty, since the game has an excellent balance for those who want to understand. Sony games (with all due respect) move over and hold the obsidian beer. Fine! (I put 10 points to increase the overall rating of the game). I have mixed feelings about this game.. though I think it is worth playing, especially for it's beaufitul graphic. I really loved the atmosphere, the game system, the characters and the really impressive scenery, models, lightning and animation, but I feel it lacks in some parts: the story could be better and more involving for the main character but i won't spoil it: the naval system is pretty useless as it doesn't really has an impact on the game and you can basically ignore it. Some story lines also seems to die, and some others you can completely miss because of no hints whatsoever.. In my opinion, PoE2 is a huge step up from PoE1 (which was also a great game). It improved on many areas, and from what I've noticed hasn't worsened in any aspect that was in PoE 1.. I don't like to **** on a game that's already sold poorly, but in this case, I have to. There's a lot of nonsense cultural jargon you're supposed to read and actually care about. I'm happy to learn a game world's history and lingo if the journey I'm going on is interesting, but it's not. Don't mistake a Fampyr for a Vampire or Hel for Hell. They're different, but not really. Even reading the quest log is annoying. Obsidian's idea of interesting writing is to throw as many adjectives, nonsensical character names and long winded descriptions into every line of dialogue and scene description. Yet, in the end, very little of it is engaging, exciting or worthy of the time I'm putting into it. As I hear some of the dialogue being spoken, I frequently laugh because of how damn silly it all sounds. It just comes off as pretentious to me. This is one of the most cynical games you'll ever play. Every faction is made up of monsters and bigots. There are a lot of time wasting issues within the game. For instance, the load times in between each floor of a building and entering and exiting a building. To fast travel around the city you have to run to an exit, you can't just open the map up and fast travel that way. Why? The ""running"" speed is also ridiculously slow. Nobody besides the obese run nearly that slow in real life. Why does it cost copper to craft items? For example, it costs 300 gold to create a single scroll of ""Garden of Life"" and 200 gold to craft a ""Potion of Ironskin"". That's a lazy way to ""balance"" crafting. If you add up the cost of the ingredients and the copper cost, it probably costs just about as much as buying one. That's stupid. What, are my characters tossing the gold pieces into the potion as it's being brewed? Why does it cost 30k gold to enchant an item from 'superb' to 'legendary' if I already have the skill and items to do so?. I've heard the counter arguments and they don't hold up. ""Balance"". So many potions and spells are so situational that they are useless because you can't use items from your personal inventory in battle. You can only use ""quick items"" in battle. That's 4 slots. I'm not going to load up my 4 slots with potions that I will likely never need. It's so easy to make your crew happy that low morale is never an issue. With all the money you rake in selling dead enemy loot, due to unlimited stash, that you can afford all the good food and drink and never have to worry about anything. You can also share the gold from every enemy ship defeated and that raises morale drastically. 10 morale up to plus 40 morale easily. There is no challenge in the ship combat because you can just board their ship and can avoid the text based naval battles every time. Obsidian is scared of commitments. They design a system but make sure to leave you an out and to allow you to skip it entirely, making that entire system they spent a long time developing pointless. According to the Fig campaign having a ship crew was an actual stretch goal, yet Ydwin, one of the more interesting sidekicks was locked behind the 5 million dollar goalpost. The ship crew was little more than flavor text. There are storms on the world map that you can see when sailing. They're just big circles on the world map to easily sail around. If you go through them there are some text based options that can kill or wound crew if you get unlucky, but mostly, you just gain a little experience. There is no risk whatsoever of running into a storm unless you want to. I sail into them for the nearly free experience points. The entire ship portion of the game is of no consequence. If I had donated money to that Fig campaign, I would be pissed off about the half-assed implementation of the systems on their stretch goals. I didn't and I'm annoyed. There is a formula for nearly every place you find exploring the world. You land on an island of interest, there is a site you want to visit. You're greeted by someone with vague speech who makes an offer. You say yes or no. Fight if you said no. You go to the site in question. The little text book pops up as you enter. Inconsequential words. You enter. It's essentially the same map as every other island's mini ""dungeon"". It takes 5-15 minutes and you're done. I have a feeling the writers were too busy arguing over which companions were going to screw each other than writing quests with substance. As a straight male playing a male character, having two male party members trying to **** me is a bit much. Obsidian, hire somebody to write for you besides 20-35 year old Californian hipster liberals. Get a little diversity in there. You actually do need it. And make sure to keep Justin Bell as your composer no matter what happens. He's really great. The music is fantastic.. One of the best RPG experiences (at least for me) since titles such as Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. The original game was trash IMHO, and this was largely due to limited healing options during combat and the poor AI/skill check system. However, the sequel is a super improvement. Obsidian listened to the fans and really outdid themselves. Here's my take on the game... THE GOOD Great Story Nice Graphics Superb Voice Acting Reputation System Joinable Factions Real Time or Turn-Based Combat Awesome Leveling System Tons of Replay Value Full Day/Night Cycles Great Character Creation/Customization Dynamic Weather System Memorable Characters Great Companions Nice Loot/Drop System Excellent Combat System Pirate Themes With Sea Battles Fantastic Exploration THE BAD DLC Is Mediocre Long Load Times That's about it. The free DLC (5) are worth it and a must imho, but the paid DLC (4) are not that great, as they only add extra quests to the game, and do not impact the Main Story at all. Surely get them though when on sale, but I wouldn't pay full price. The Pirate themes are awesome. You can get ships, assign crew members, ship upgrades, and can sail anywhere, fighting off pirates and other stuff. So yeah. Super great game that no RPG fan should miss. 9/10. Thanks Obsidian.. The Good: - The game is quite fun. - The tactical combat can be quite challenging, and interesting. - There are lots of places to see, characters to talk to, and moral dilemmas to consider. - The epilogue felt like a satisfying accumulation of my decisions along the way. - The story definitely fits well with the Pillars mythology and is a good sequel to the original game. - I got 80 hours of fun game play out of the game, and hadn't quite tapped all the game's potential. - Worth the money. I'd buy a sequel. The Bad: - Director Josh Sawyer said that sales of this game were low and he didn't know why. I can explain what the missing ""je ne sais quoi"" is from my perspective. While the game is fun (as stated above), the story is very fragmented. There are tons of side quests and factions to support, but the main storyline is pretty short and not well-developed at all. The game starts off well, with lots of richness in the story and characters, but that fragments into a ton of little side quests and things to keep you occupied. Don't get me wrong, those things are fun, but they don't add up to a story that feels really satisfying. There are plenty of hack & slash and MMO games that offer tons of diverting side quests. I think people play an Obsidian game for the story. Pillars of Eternity II did not deliver here. The ending is interesting, but getting there felt... meh. The Ugly: - two of the playable characters are cardboard cutouts--this is apparently due to the game having gotten insufficient funding from backers. Some of the characters are full of personality and have things to say at various points in the game, and have their own personal quest and epilogue, whereas there are a few that say virtually nothing and seem like ghosts. I would have preferred that the cardboard cutouts be removed entirely rather than haunting the game. - I didn't really like *any* of the factions presented. They were all unlikable in my opinion. At least, on the bright side, the game-makers gave me the option to go independently.. This game has great tactical combat and and many interesting classes and multiclasses to build. RPG system was pretty meh in PoE1(percentages everywhere, graze/hit, overly convoluted and shallow at the same time) and it was somewhat improved here, but nearly all character builds focus around the same stat spread, which again shows that its not a great system. Overall gameplay is very enjoyable. Graphics are good, they even fixed ugly character models and bad animations, which plagued all kickstarter RPGs of that era. A lot of quality of life changes(like city navigation) are also appreciated. Why the score is so low you ask? Well because everything else is from mediocre to terrible. Soundtrack still puts you to sleep. Setting of Deadfire is a step up from the generic medieval fantasy, but its still not that interesting(because the real world cultures it was copied from are not that interesting either). Overreliance on textual adventures for everything gets stale very quickly. SHOW, DON'T TELL. Unity is still sluggish, stuttering mess, as usual(yeah its not the engine, its the programming, except when 99% of the games have exactly the same problems and its all somehow the fault of programmers). Writing went from boring in PoE1(except Durance, who was written by one who shall not be named) to outright amateur purple prose. Story is unengaging, short and pointless, characters are one dimensional and unmemorable. But this is expected to happen when you hire a bunch of amateurs and drive out the real talent. They had a fairly interesting setting, but then they force feed you its lore by the cartload, until you want to puke every time ""soul"" is mentioned. Soul this, god that, soul, god, soul, god, soul, god. No character development, no strong motivation, no revenge story, no political nuance, no twist, no emotions, no finale, nothing but countless babble about souls. Not every writer can manage to make you hate the lore that you initially though was cool. My advice to new players is ignore the story and just play this game for the combat. Its polished and you see people who were involved into its development knew what they were doing. Don't bother reading every sentence, its no planescape torment, not even kingmaker. Unless you can tolerate fanfiction tier writing, you won't get any satisfaction from reading Deadfire. My advice to Obsidian is to sack all its ""writers"" and get some people who can actually write themselves out of a paper bag.. Shocked at how good this game was, I thought I didn't like CRPG's... I was clearly just choosing the wrong ones. The breadth of class customization can seem a bit daunting, but If you can get over that hump it is a fantastic experience. The world building is exceptionally well done - economics, government, religion, race, npc's just living their lives... it makes DOS2 seem extremely amateurish in that regard. Gameplay is fluid, and action is frequent. Unfortunate there are so many low votes due to bad optimisation... it quick saves and quick loads better than any game I've played, but going into fresh areas can take quite a while.. Great game! Too bad I'm not a fan of real-time pause fights. It is playable in turn-based mode, however it is not as polished and doesn't feel as good as something like Divinity Original Sin. You can feel that the game was not planned as turn-based, still alright though. Art and classic setting are superb, dialogs and text quests are pretty well done too. Love the text quests, too bad there were not very variative and pretty short. My biggest issue, besides the non-native turn-based mode that just lacks some zest, is the myriad little items and abilities, each with miniscule bonuses that just hard to manage and remember. I'd rather have twice or three times less abilities and item effects, but making them more impactful. Just tired of managing all those buttons and tired of keeping so many numbers in my head. and soooo many stats... Still, wonderful game, I'm just nitpicking.. Rpg are my favourite genre. But this game its simply... meh. A lot of content, yes, and the writing is good, but the plot is uninteresting, the quest are a bit repetitive, and the companions are underdeveloped in every aspect and not have much weight in the story of your hero. So, if you want to play a great isometric rpg... play Disco Elysium. Or Baldur's Gate 2. Or Neverwinter Night... or Baldur's Gate 2 again, and again, and again... :-D. Feels a lot shallower to the first game in almost every aspect despite having a lot more mechanics. Also gets very boring after a while.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I believe Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire was not a commercial success because of very poor marketing. I played and loved the first episode in 2016, and I realized a sequel existed only in August 2020, and only because it was mentioned as a positive comparison in another game's review. I will give it a 10, despite the very long and unjustified loading times between even small areas. The gameplay (both real time and turn based) is great, as well as the story, the graphics, the music, the character progression system and the companions (Eder is still the best). I also enjoyed the new naval combat and ship management system, a refreshing evolution of the ""player's stronghold"" concept. Belfetto! (Almost).. I must start from the thing, that i liked the first Pillars But the second part is just a step back I do not realize why the hell obsidian decided to create and open world. It just longs the gameplay and forces it to continue for 2-3 hours longer( and if you want to complete all the side quests for 10(!!!) hours or more). and yet, you do not have an ability for quick travel. Secondly, after 5-10 hours of gameplay it becomes sooooo boring even for the fan of CRPGs like me. All the dungeons are almost the same, and i have found only 3(!!!) interesting for me side quests. the main story is just **** If the game had autoleveling, it could be completed for 3 hours... But lets talk about pros of the game: 1) the graphics is one of the best among CRPGs 2) battle system has become better( which is the only thing that saves you from their monotony) 3) ""The Forgotten Sanctum"" DLC is quite good( it is best content of the game, as for me) So, that is it. I can't recommend it even to the fans of the first Pillars, so 5/10. ""Do not make further Pillars of Eternity game anymore, you'll only screw things further"" The statement above is the bottom line I would like to give to this game. Don't get me wrong, I WAS a big fan. I love the writing, 10/10, the story and dialogues, 10/10, I have no problem with bird view 3D character, but the game design, about how you managed it, really put everything into the trash can. First of all, I am a ""hardcore"" gamer, which means, I always do the craziest difficulty any game ever has, which includes PotD. I love it, I love the concept, what really infuriated me though was, ""What did you smoke when you put that save mechanism"". Honestly, if you want to remove auto-save for the sake of ""you get what you play"", not gonna lie, I will agree with you. But how can you expect us to forgive you, for punishing us because of one of your GAMEBREAKING BUG? Not to mention how annoying it is to manual save because of your bizarre manual save system. And now you wonder why nobody cares to buy your game. This isn't just some ""bug issue"", this is some ""mind concept"" issue. You want to punish the player as hard as possible but you don't want to compensate or anything of your own failure. That is a selfish paradigm. As a verdict, put your thought about making PoE III to the grave. The franchise is done. You are done. Don't screw things any further than it has. For new-players: forget PoTD. Not because it was too hard, but because this game got too many game-breaking bugs that would make you wasted a couple of hours.. Very good sequel which, unlike other wonderful rpg (e.g.dragon age or fallout 3 ), do not upset the original title transforming it into garbage. Only the story is, from my point of view, a little less addictive than the first one but you should not miss it if you liked pillars of eternity. Apparently a lot of people are giving the games 0 because of Deadfires 'Leftist Agenda'. Get laid. This is an incredibly rich game with a compelling storyline, interesting characters and relationships and an expansive world with plentiful lore. Voice acting is incredible. Lots of options to play classes and characters as you wish. A true soul successor to the old 90's isometric RPG's.. Deadfiire archipelago is such a new mood compared to POE1 and old Baldur's Gate games",best turn based rpg ever made. Perfect game in all aspect . a 8 - 8.5. Boring and lackluster . humour is more childish and the atmosphere is less grim now .
638.DOOM Eternal,"I put this game down right after release due to the fact I did not enjoy the platforming. I recently was going through gamepass and figured I would try it on my ROG Ally. I’m glad I did this game is awesome. I know I’m late to the party, but if you put it down like be before pick it back up!. I was 11 years old when Doom was released, I have played and beat every Doom game released since. I am telling you this because what I'm about to say is based on longstanding experience with the franchise. Doom Eternal is the worst entry within the franchise, even less enjoyable than Doom 3. And here's why: 1) Platforming. if I wanted to dash and jump I'd play Sonic. This is Doom not the 2024 Olympics, swinging on monkey bars is emasculating. 2) Lazy Level Design. Get swarmed by Demons, kill them. Now dash and jump over swinging flame ropes and falling platforms like Mario. Get swarmed again, wash, rinse, repeat. Every. Single. Level. Lazy. 3) The Marauder. Being overwhelmed by a horde of demons with diverse attacks and weaknesses is challenging and fun. Being overwhelmed while some horned bastard spams a holo-dog behind a shield is not challenging, just cheap. 4) Rigid play mechanics. Being completely reliant upon glory kills to get ammo for guns introduces an interesting dynamic but becomes annoying as hell when you realize it is the ONLY way to get ammo. And your weapons ALWAYS need ammo. I understand the rationale behind this: you eat what you kill, but having no other way to play the game limits how you strategize. 5) The King Arthur themed storyline. There are 3 tired-ass tropes I wish developers would abandon. Perhaps read more books and find new history to fictionalize: Medieval themes, Roman-Empire themes, and the evil-twin boss fight. Please, do something else.. There is nothing this game does better than DOOM (2016) and a lot it does worse the new enemies introduced simply make the game more tedious the additions to movement manes they can make tedious platforming sections. There is more story... it's is poorly told and utter crap. The game is definitely harder but not in actual difficulty just in annoyance and tedium. They wanted players to use weapons other than the sawn-off so they drastically reduced how much ammo you have but this caused a snowball of other issues that they tried to patchwork together but it doesn't work. This may be the greatest drop from an initial game to a sequel I have ever seen 2016 is a game I replay now and again and will replay specific levels of far into the future I have absolutely no intention of ever playing Eternal again.. 9/10 single player but arguably the worst online mode in any game I've ever played. 9/10 single-player 0/10 online. Switch review: Even at 30fps and sometimes sub 480p resolution, this game got me hooked from start to finish, gyro aiming comes in clutch to make this game feel so good to play, the combat feels so fresh even 4 years after it came out, the music is intense and the story is there for the people who want it. I really think this game is a must for everyone, even on switch.. So much fun so far, with high-quality headphones feels like a great old arcade game and is very immersive.. For what Doom Eternal is, the game is well developed. It is a very smooth and fast paced experience. The game is also a visual feast. These three things is what Doom Eternal does very well. What I dislike about the modern Doom is the parkour, enemy weak spots and death sequences that one is forced to watch over and over...these are gimmicks that I can do without. I prefer the old school Doom. It was just a straight up first person shooter that had a mixture of fast paced moments, mix with less intense moments as well. I recently started playing Prodeus and this game scratches the old school Doom itch....I have been blasting away for hours with a smile on my face.. Top of line game, not even a story game and has an amazing story, the soundtrack behind it was perfect (did mick wrong tho), and in general the gameplay is what really keeps me coming back, I personally try to stay in the air for as long as possible, 10/10. A game I am still playing in 2024. All those other AAA shooters pale in comparison to this behemoth of a title. Can't wait for DOOM: the dark ages.. It's really fast-paced, interesting. But It gets incredibly boring and repetitive overtime.. It's a boring game, it doesn't satisfy me at all as a woman and it has a lot of bugs, the mechanics are heavy, I don't recommend it.. ""Doom Eternal"" is an adrenaline-fueled rush that pushes the FPS genre to new heights of intensity. The speed and dynamism of the gameplay have been refined since the previous installment, with a combat system that rewards an aggressive and strategic approach. Each weapon feels distinct, and the relentless pace of encounters demands focus and skill, keeping players constantly engaged.Visually, the game is a triumph of detail: hellish environments rich with intricacies, high-quality lighting effects, and textures that create a dark, visceral world. The soundtrack—a mix of heavy metal and synth—is a driving force, perfectly accompanying each battle and adding an extra pulse to the game’s frenetic **** level design is complex and well-thought-out, featuring numerous secrets and alternative paths. While some platforming sections can be challenging, they add a touch of variety to break up the action. The Battlemode multiplayer introduces an interesting dynamic, even if it isn’t the main focus of the experience.Overall, ""Doom Eternal"" delivers an intense, thrilling FPS experience, ideal for those seeking relentless action and polished gameplay.. Doom Eternal isn't just a game; it’s an artfully constructed eruption of raw energy and relentless violence wrapped in a darkly compelling atmosphere. It takes the fundamental essence of what made the Doom series iconic and evolves it into an experience so immersive and breathtakingly intense that it feels like you’re waging an epic, timeless battle against the forces of hell itself. With every encounter, every weapon, every ounce of fury, Doom Eternal redefines what it means to be a first-person shooter and solidifies its place as not just a masterpiece, but one of the greatest games of our **** atmosphere in Doom Eternal is a chilling yet exhilarating concoction. The game thrusts you into a world dripping with both hellish horror and awe-inspiring grandeur, capturing the sense that you are traversing landscapes stained by millennia of war between light and darkness. Each level is meticulously designed to give the player a sense of impending dread and thrilling anticipation. Towering structures, flaming caverns, and abandoned, desolate cities remind you that you are in a place where the very air feels charged with danger. Yet, despite the ominous atmosphere, the world of Doom Eternal is richly detailed, vibrant, and—dare I say—beautiful in its own haunting **** cannot speak of Doom Eternal without delving into its approach to combat. The game does not merely allow you to battle demons; it invites you to decimate them with ruthless style. Every weapon feels like an extension of your wrath, a perfectly honed tool crafted solely for the destruction of these grotesque monstrosities. The shotgun, rocket launcher, plasma rifle—each weapon delivers its own satisfaction, and the sound design amplifies this. Every shot fired, every demon disintegrated, reverberates with a thunderous impact that keeps your pulse racing. The addition of the flamethrower, blood punch, and a seamlessly integrated chainsaw mechanic takes this experience to a new zenith. Here, you’re not simply shooting—you’re orchestrating a bloody ballet where every move, every decision, feels as consequential as it is **** visceral brutality of Doom Eternal is a spectacle unto itself. Each glory kill is not just a finishing move; it’s a moment of raw power, a vivid reminder of your dominance over the minions of hell. The animations are simultaneously grotesque and exhilarating, each one distinct, each one serving as both a reward and a taunt. The violence is stylized, intense, and satisfyingly gruesome, never dipping into excess but always pushing the envelope of adrenaline-fueled brutality. Yet, the game balances this with a rhythmic flow that feels, oddly enough, poetic. The pacing of combat keeps you engaged and breathless, forcing you to think on your feet and dive headfirst into the chaos with a grim, predatory **** its core, Doom Eternal is about unleashing a primal side that is, in many ways, a powerful release. The sensation of moving through the game's environments, finding armor, slashing through demons, and chaining kills is cathartic beyond words. There’s a purity to the gameplay, a complete lack of pretension. The game asks nothing of you but to destroy, to conquer, and it gives you every tool to do so with style. It’s hard to overstate the feeling of exhilaration as you stand, covered in the virtual blood of your enemies, breathing hard and feeling more alive than any game has made you feel in ages. In an age of complex narratives and morally gray protagonists, the Doom Slayer stands as a refreshingly straightforward avatar of destruction—pure, unadulterated fury given form and **** the end, Doom Eternal is nothing short of a masterpiece in the first-person shooter genre. Its exhilarating combat, intense atmosphere, and brutal, satisfying violence make it a game that doesn’t just challenge you—it consumes you. Each playthrough is an unforgettable experience, a journey through carnage and power that leaves you craving more. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but for those who revel in high-octane intensity and unfiltered adrenaline, Doom Eternal is perfection.A true game for the ages. Best Game ever!!!!!!!!!. I love the fast action combined with gore and the fact that you need to change your guns / mods for the best fighting moments. Best fps i have ever played until now. Doom Micromanagement Simulator. A step backwards from 2016. The micromanagement loop of having to constantly chainsaw and flame belch enemies to stay alive and have any ammo (you can barely hold any) gets tedious. Eternal essentially forces you to play the game in a specific way, rather than how you want to, which is a radical departure from how Doom has always been. Drains a lot of the fun from the game. The plot barely even feels attached to the previous game with how radically it shifted. Massive WH40k influence which takes away Doom's identity a bit. Art style is goofy and cartoony. Gameplay is more like Quake with the endless arenas rather than Doom. Systems like the rune challenge system were completely gutted. The platforming is also stupid and really doesn't fit the game. It all feels like Eternal was just a idea soup where every random thing just got added to the game, rather than sticking to what worked.. I don't think anyone could have really been ready for what iD brought in with DOOM Eternal. Hand's down the most intense gaming experience I think I've ever experienced, an incredible and majestic ballet of extreme violence, black humour and reverence for the genre and source material that takes the already magnificent successes of DOOM (2016) and amplifies them, increasing the challenge to an almost insane degree while offering so many options to players to set things to an agreeable level for the individual that the game never becomes alienating. The game flows like water.. Best of the doom series, one of the best fast paced fps shooters. The campaign is absolutely amazing making you not want to stop playing the game. 10/10. Weak point simulator, Completed on Nightmare. All of these week points on the specific super heavy demons really takes you out of the experience and hurt the overall journey. Also stop force me to use the plasma gun no one likes it. Plus no difficulty achievement?? But its still worth your money and improves a lot from the DOOM 2016. If I had this game at the age of 14 (when I played Unreal Tournament 2004) I would have played it every day with the same joy and fun... now, unfortunately, it's just a combination: shot + change weapon + shot + flamethrower + granate + shot + finisher... but still DooM - fun game with awesome brutality! :D. Best fps game and shooter game, arguably. I hope Doom the dark ages will be like that too.. The most OVERRATED game I have ever played. The developers **** it up by constantly forcing you to witch weapons. Switching between two weapons would have been fine, but here you have to switch between 4 weapons, each of which has 2 mods, which means you need to switch between 8 firing modes for specific enemies. The most annoying one is the sniper, really slow switching speed plus trash aim assist. This game is the perfect example of ""my first little game is so successful, but I want to elevate it to AAA for the sequel"" but done **** it up. **** you Bethesda.. Doom Eternal is the best first person shooter I have ever played. It's not that hard to make shooters good. Just get rid of Cover Systems, make the enemies more unique in visual and attack style, make the player move more, and make the player think more about how they want to beat enemies, bosses, levels, etc. It's not perfect, the ammo and chainsaw system isnt great, they fixed it late game, but overal it's a bit broken. Overall tho it's a massive improvement from everything 2016 set up. Levels, and enemies are more visually unique. Weapons are upgraded and changed to fit the game. And best thing is the parkour elements to break up the battle sections. 10/10. Best fps ever made at this point in time! I will never get enough of doom!. Simply the best Doom game ever made and it will be hard to top that in the future. This game literally helped me get over depression, like I was diagnosed with clinical depression, and shortly after my symptoms got better and overall just kind of stopped. I highly recommend this game, although I'm sad about Mick Gordon, if you know what I mean. I beat this on UltraNightmare and have been playing battlemode, which is... eh, either balanced and fun or just an unbalanced mess, but overall 10/10 game definitely recommend.. Bros the coldest guy in video game history Deserves the score very well, and the dlc is also pretty good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The enemy jump around like a monkey and you should too!,game have so many improvement over 2016doom,the arena design now a lot better for jumping around(it makes the flow of combat more fluid+even more fast paced than before),a lot easier puzzle/direction,all weapon have their own advantage now(make the combat not boring),theres this fast paced shooter intense moment/feel that can only be found in a few game out there,amazing graphics with smooth/high fps,must play but only if you familiar with fast paced shooter like overwatch/half life online mode. This game is not for everyone. If you just wanted to sit back and plow through hordes of demons without giving it much thought, you're not gonna get that with this game. But even then you have to appreciate the genius of Eternal. Each weapon has its own use and is a ton of fun to blast enemies with. The new dash move, the fact that the double jump is given to you from the start, and the meathook (which just simply feels amazing to use) give the player an incredible amount of freedom when it comes to how they want to approach an encounter. Weak points are there for players that want to exploit them, but they can pretty much be ignored if you don't care about them. The game can be daunting for newcomers with all the new mechanics and abilities you get, but once you get the hang of it and start figuring out how to maximize their effectiveness, this game is simply a blast. One of the best single-player shooters I've ever played.. It's a good example of what it would be like if Ubisoft made Doom. Doom Eternal's gameplay has nothing to do with the 2016 game. It's hard to even call it an FPS Shooter. It looks more like a platformer using the FPS camera angle. There are ridiculous puzzles and you jump and climb like a monkey. There's a lot of unnecessary and terrible side content, and that's why I used Ubisoft as an example in the first place, because the game is actually so short that the developers forced the player to do side missions just to extend the gameplay. The game has an incredible ammo problem. That's the only difficulty of the game. Doomguy is supposedly a character with godlike powers, but he can barely find bullets for his weapons and punches like a girl in close combat. He has a power called Blood Punch, but it takes a very long time to charge. In fact, all of Doomguy's powers have a cooldown and they last so long that you die just because you're not allowed to use them when you need to, so you have to die over and over again because of the limitations of the main character you control. How can people have fun and relieve stress with a game like this? All the mechanics of the game are designed to completely frustrate the player.. Controversial opinion, but 2016 Doom was far better. Maybe it's just because i'm bad at this one, but i don't know. I'd still reccomend you play it though, as it is held in high regards.. One of the greatest games of all time. However, Doom Eternal is not for everyone. It's a fast-paced game where the joy comes from mastering it.. The best doom game. The gamplay amazing The song is awesome. The story is normal. The best FPS of the decade, a masterpiece of level design, game design, optimization and musics. After 27 years, the franchise which was the father of the FPS games, succeeds to innovate in 2016 and 2020 again. Games are about feelings, and this game perfectly gives you the feelings of being a badass shooting up hell. Only 2 complaints and why its not a 10 is the bosses and certain weapons being a bit too weak. Wished the bosses were more like how ultrakill bosses work.. Doom Eternal is surprisingly one of the best first-person shooters I've played. At first glance, this game doesn’t have the biggest changes compared to the last game, but if you look at it, it’s just an incredible game, it patched up the holes of the last part, now it’s completely balanced, everything is in place here, for example, the leveling system, the regularity of battles and platforming , in general, we can talk for a long time about the changes, but right now, in order. The graphics have become better than the previous part, but still not coordinated. Now this game has an insane variety of locations, they have become many times more interesting and larger-scale, in almost every one of them I forgot that I was playing a shooter and just looked at the beautiful views. And all this beauty is insanely optimized; I saw only one bug in the game already halfway through the game. Mick Gordon also didn’t slow down, but on the contrary, he progressed; the soundtrack of this game is simply divine. Regarding the plot, it has not become much better, this is not necessary, but the lore of the game has expanded, the history of the world has appeared, some characters, worlds, and the game does not force you to be distracted by all this, but if you want to go deeper into the lore, which I extremely I advise that notes are the best solution. The game has improved in absolutely everything; I don’t know of a single position that has sagged. What is perfect here is the gameplay, for a game of this genre, it is simply incredible, the game will not make you bored for a second. In general, I highly recommend the game. This game has boldly entered the list of basic and mandatory shooters, maybe even all games.. Super smooth and fast paced gameplay, rockin' tunes, and LOTS OF DEMONS. Took everything from Doom 2016 and turned it up a few notches. They've added multiple upgrade systems and more mechanics making the Slayer faster and deadlier than ever before. If you like a fast paced shooter action game, you can't go wrong here. The Ancient Gods DLCs are pretty good as well. Though they can make the base game feel like a tutorial at times (they are SO hard, even on the normal ""Hurt Me Plenty"" difficulty. Best tip I have to offer, the ""quick swap weapon"" is how to truly crank your damage up to 11).. This is the only game I've ever played made me experience so much anger, happiness and pure violent intentions for all demon kind. It's also the game I've ever been actually decent at. I guess 500+ hours of practice will do that.. the game keeps throwing new and new mechanics at you which can be at first overwhelming. it took me a bit of time to get used to everything and then i loved it. excellent addition to the series!. the shooting and the blood is not even the best part of this game, you play this game for the **** soundtrack. I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY OTHER GAME!!! I played 2016's DOOM and i have to say they did a fantastic job on making a sequel. I LOVE that they kept some of my favorite glory kills and added new AMAZING ones. I love the gore this game has to offer and it gives me the opportunity to get my rage out in a ""productive"" way. This. Is. An. Amazing. Game. I even made a super hype playlist for when I play. I highly recommend this game if you love 1st person shooters and aren't afraid of a large dosage of gore.. This is a sick game can't lie about it fast paced fps optimized to perfection. The onlys Reasons I Won't give it a 10 is because it's not open world like GTA is and there times especially on harder difficulties you just have like bare big ass enemies in confined spaces.. While Doom 2016 completely nails its and is a damn near perfect game, this one might have gone a little too far in some directions. The gameplay is still the star of the show and is top notch as you would expect. All of the other stuff in the base could have just been done a little bit better and overall none of that stuff felt necessary. The humor in the first one is really good, but this one seems a little too try hard and can get a little more ""edge lord"" at times, but is still mostly fine.. Fans of the original series as well as new players who are launching Doom for the first time will enjoy the game. After all, Eternal is the descendant of the old game, and there's no shame in that. Despite its brutality, the game served as a calming and relaxing way for me to unwind after a hard day's work. The concept is as simple as ever: play as the executioner and slash demons, juggling weapons, as each monster requires its approach, and it's more advantageous to use different weapons in different situations. This is what sets this game apart from other similar shooters. However, this could be a problem for new players who are holding a controller/mouse for the first time, so I don't really recommend this series for completely new gamers. Unlike other installments, the story here isn't just ""for the sake of it"" but wants to be something more. However, it's only revealed deeper through notes scattered throughout the levels, which is both a plus for those more interested in killing demons and a minus for fans of the plot, as they have to read a bunch of text. I was pleasantly impressed by the level design, the structure of the levels, which was very interesting to explore and perfectly suited for fans who want to complete the game 100% and find all the secrets. Sometimes, just to pass the level further, not even for the sake of a secret, you had to think carefully. I often found myself in such a dead end that I thought I'd have to look up the solution on the internet, but I found the answer at the last moment, turning the frustration into self-satisfaction. As for the musical accompaniment, I don't even want to talk about it—it's a 10 out of **** game has a pleasant difficulty level; I started on a difficult level, sometimes switched to easy, but the game didn't turn into a shooting range, I still died sometimes even on the easy difficulty level. But despite all the advantages, I still couldn’t finish the game, although I had about an hour of gameplay left. Why? I don't know... I'm a bit bored with the game now, and I feel like closing it after 5 minutes of gameplay. But I hope to return to it someday because it left a good aftertaste. So: Gameplay: 8 Level design: 9 Graphics: 9 Sound: 10 Story: 8 Difficulty: 8 Overall impression: 8. Gameplay: (Amazing) ---- Graphics: (Great) --- Story: (Mediocre) --- Score: (Amazing). I love doom. I've played most of the original doom games, and I played Doom 2016 and doom eternal. I thought Doom 2016 was the best game in the world, but then Doom Eternal came out.First, I will mention nothing about the story because while the game is a lot more story-focused than Doom 2016, there still isn't much to talk about. I also want to avoid spoilers, so no **** combat in Doom Eternal is the best **** I've ever seen. Each weapon serves a different purpose, each demon has a different weakness, the movement is well-implemented and polished, and everything is just so balanced and well-done. The weapon and demon designs were changed to better match the designs of the original games, specifically Doom 2. The new mods and mod changes were very nice, and they each, again, had a unique purpose. The always being low on ammo thing is the best because it forces you to play the way the game was intended. Instead of blasting everything with your super shotgun, you have to be more strategic with what weapons you use, what demons you use them on, and the best combo of weapons to quickly take out said demon. Genius design, and if it wasn't implemented I'd be running around blasting demons with the super shottie playing the game all wrong. I can't stress enough how good the design in this game is. Each demon having a weakness and weapon to destroy demon with said weakness coupled with the always being low on ammo makes this game's combat so **** engaging and enjoyable.. Improves upon the combat of DOOM 2016 in my opinion, i like how there are more things to use, although i could understand not liking that. Good music too. Has some platformer parts that i didn't like very much but they aren't a big deal.. I really enjoyed previous doom multiplayer, and i bough eternal in first days, but oh men... new multiplayer is awfull. However still decent campaign.. This game is one of my favourite i finished the game in all of difficulties, in my opinion the gameplay is the greatest gameplay of all time it isnt too slow and boring or too fast and stupid its the perfect balance of two however, there is one little problem the multiplayer has just one mode and its so boring its pretty sad for me that you cannot experience this gameplay with or against your friends completely other than that all theaspects of the game is above avarage.. Excellent game, the best Doom in my opinión .. Undeniably the great FPS campaign experience in history. The gameplay is the best of the genre, just like Sekiro for its own. Insane amount of customization with weapon mods, suit upgrades, abilities, etc. A step up from Doom 2016 which was another 10/10 game. The only single thing that Doom 2016 beats Eternal is with the art style atmosphere. Regardless, both are masterpieces.. Hard and oldschool. One of the best games ever. Perfect continuation of old doom games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game so far is pretty great. I enjoy the combat and gameplay, but it’s a little slower than I wanted it to be in terms of gameplay.. >Doom 2016 >Bunch of shooting, metal music, and minimal story beyond the standard ""We're on Mars and technology accidentally brought hell here"" **** >Doom 2021 >Bunch of platforming and extra abilities, music was standard rock, bloated over-dramatic story that includes whole new races on top of demons. This game has it's fans obviously : there's a lot of micromanagement and tons of tiny things to master and learn... which appeal to a subsection of gamer (that is sadly very vocal and toxic) If that appeals to you, have fun ! However, if you expected to have the same level of braindead reflex-based fun you had with 2016... you're in for a lot of disappointment All in all... I don't even think it's a fun game, it's just too much of everything for its own good. But as a sequel or as a doom game it becomes abysmal.. THE Best Shooter ever made, hands down. While DOOM (2016) laid the foundation and was good for the time... But then this game was released and now I can't stand (2016). This game takes everything from the roots of the series and injects them with crack. Hope this helps. The perfect example of keeping the classic aesthetics and feeling of the series, and build on top of that. FAST AND FURIOUS. I remember playing DOOM 2 and loving the hell out of it, then there was DOOM 2016 which completely delivered in everything possible. When I played DOOM Eternal I found myself dying more often before starting to learn the game better, the bosses were challenging and the slayer gates were a test of will but in the end I succeeded and can confidently say that this beat its predecessor in all the right ways.. DOOM Eternal is one of the best first person shooters in recent history. The story is garbage, the voice acting and writing could use some work, but no one plays DOOM for these reasons. Due to it's brutal difficulty, the game requires you to be fully concentrated and engaged in its brilliant puzzle-like combat system which rewards players for using the right weapons against the right enemies. It's fast, hectic, gory and satisfying combat which gets your blood pumping and makes you feel nigh unstoppable, especially at slayer gate encounters which are the cream of the crop of DOOM's combat. The game starts losing steam towards the end, where new frustrating demons are introduced and the level design and pacing take a hit to introduce the final boss, which is more of a chore than anything. That being said, DOOM Eternal remains one of the best FPS on the market, and it's a must have for any fan of the genre.. Best Doom game I've ever played. Combat is evolved over Doom 2016. Still great weapon mods, but you gotta be strategic in battles, using up all ammo from various weapons in big arena fights. You can't just stick with your fav gun and tear through like in previous games. I liked this dimension; it forced me to think quick and make tactical choices throughout. Only really drawback I felt was they added a lot of platforming, beyond what 2016 has. I suppose I got used to it by the end, and I can understand how developers wanted to add something more to game, but I think they went a tad too far in this aspect. It is a shooter and not an adventure game, and they should not have overdone this. That being said, it still did not detract much, and everything else about game was so fantastic that this minor thing won't even make me knock a point off. Simply put, it is pure fun. Rip and tear.. this is the most stereo typical video game, you basically go to hell and kill demons, and i loved it.. Well well first try on the doom serie and I must say it didn't went so good. Yeah david gordon is out there in the clouds and the musics are dope but the other aspects tho .. I dropped after a few hours, I didn't enjoyed at all the gameplay. Coming from fast games like apex I got disapointed pretty fast with doom. Yes it goes fast but you'd better like glory kills and constant interruptions during your gameplay because otherwise you're as screwed as me. More than cutting off your gameflow it's a boring unskilled mechanic to my opinion. Got also disappointed by the AD, it sticks to it's origins yeah but the consequence is that I felt it was oldschool af in term of design environement and creature wise, disapointed. Sorry Doom I come too late for you glory.. Just a fantastic game, fast paced and satisfying. Last boss fight is kinda boring but excerpt that ... masterpie",i put this game down right after release due to the fact i did not enjoy the platforming . there is nothing this game does better than DOOM (2016) and a lot it does worse the new enemies introduced simply make the game more tedious . there is nothing this game does better than DOOM (2016) and a lot it does worse .
639.Art of Balance,"Simple, elegant, and beautiful, Art of Balance is an instant classic. My only beef with this game is that the lack of community content (that could transform this fairly short title into a daily ritual) feels like a real missed opportunity.. As the review says: a simple idea, very nicely executed. I really enjoyed the Art of Balance ... for as long as it lasted. Only a cheap game, but it would have benefited from a bit more challenge. One or two levels really get you thinking, but the majority are fairly brief and getting through all 4 levels only takes 2 or 3 hours. Lots of potential here for community content, or for a Tetris style time challenge, or at least a World of Goo style open-ended height challenge. Still, for a few Wii Points you certainly can't go wrong. A particularly nice water shader gives a satisfying effect to the whole thing. Calm, fairly challenging, very satisfying. Highly recommended.","the lack of community content feels like a real missed opportunity . one or two levels really get you thinking, but the majority are fairly brief . getting through all 4 levels only takes 2 or 3 hours ."
64.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,"A dizzying array of player freedom and sandbox exploration. Rough around the edges, and probably could have used more structure, but what works is pretty good.. Bethesda created a magical experience with Oblivion. While it struggles technically at time, it makes up for it through its immersion.. Hey you.. you're finally awake. This predecessor is just as amazing as Skyrim but with a bit less snow.. Very underrated game, Skyrim made the franchise accessible to the masses, but this game paved the way.. Much better thanSkyrim or Morrowind thats for damm sure. It has better factions, main quest, combat, side quest, wroldbuilding and dungeons. My first plunge into the Elder Scrolls series, and on my personal top 10 list. I remember being really excited to get Skyrim, but not having the money to buy it. I was about to walk out of the GameStop, before the cashier offered me an alternative. It was none other than this gem. Say what you will about the graphics, the voice acting, or even (God forbid) the bugs. This will always be the game that I woke up 2 hours early to play before school. And it will always remain dear to my heart.. The last truly good RPG that came out of Bethesda. It's more limited than Morrowind but not as empty as the 3D Fallout series yet.. It's a **** masterpiece, it's also a pretty calm game most of the time and I actually really like that. Wildly overrated (and overpriced at the time) t*rd ****. Characters set a new bar for ugly. Massive open world with massive cities, but no one is around. Content that scales to you so that you can never get ahead or behind, which also means nothing makes sense in terms of what you find where. Character classes are wide open, i.e. nothing means anything - join every guild, have every ability - but I don't know why you would play that long. Oh also, incredibly buggy.. I saw this game on gamepass and like almost everyone, I had heard of the elder scrolls series before. I had never gotten around to playing Skyrim, Oblivion, or Morrowind before as I am not really into fantasy all that much. I decided to download oblivion and give it a try after seeing some funny clips on Twitter. What a mistake. I got this game a week ago and I already have more hours logged than I’d like to admit. I am hooked. The fact that this game came out in 2006 blows my mind. I’m playing it for the first time in 2024 and I can easily say this is the best game I’ve played in years.. Decent game, but it didn't really draw me in as much as it drew in others. The guilds were a snooze... main story was okay. Really enjoyed the world and the exploration and the soundtrack was decent which made the experience better.. Playing for the first time in 2024 after years and years of Skyrim and i'm loving it. I'm feeling the same way i did 10 years ago when i played Skyrim for the first time. The game is very bugged but somehow, the bugs add some charm on it.. So much nostalgia for me in this game. What a world to explore. Amazing soundtrack. Lost myself for hours in the gameplay. 10/10. i loved it but it became kind of annoying at some point and the prices for items are really high especially enchants but all in all it was still fun. I saw someone give this a 4 due to it starting micro transactions in video games, this game is quite old to be citing that as a reason to give it a 4 in the modern age is silly, this review serves to offset what that person did. The game that started the microtransactions insanity. Nothing special, just another timesink.. Impressive like fallout 3 and 4, exquisite narrative, which is the engine that moves the whole game and makes it a thrilling experience. As we have seen in fallout 76, they have left aside scripted adventures and in favor of the on-line game and bethesda has plagued it with low sales and the loss of trust of their audience, I hope that in elder s 6 they do not make the same mistake or create procedural and unscripted side quests, as in skyrim. Game is Amazing, gives you an experience no other game will give you and you will burn some hours playing even in 2024.. The worst and most epic gaming experience of my life After a long time, Oblivion gave me a strange feeling, the wonderful world, the wonderful story, the music, the character of this game, everything is wonderful. I especially like Oblivion among Bethesda games This game has a deep sense of immersion in a fantasy world. I recommend everyone to play it. There is nothing like it, even Skyrim. I hope one day Bethesda releases a remaster or a remake of this masterpiece, which is the best day of my life Actually, I had a lot of fun with the Faction of Thieves and Dark Brotherhood. A true masterpiece. Eternal and perfect. This game was a revelation when I first played it.. This game isn't good. The plot is very shallow and predictable. The combat is trash because of mobs autoleveling. The oblivion realm is boring and tedious.. Absolutely fantastic RPG with an obscene amount of quality quests, build depth, and exploration to do. The magic customization and high-quality DLCs really stand out, as do the variety of quest lines and howthey expect you to play. What holds the game back from a 10 are it's pretty monotone environment and that it's visuals haven't aged well at all. I was never a bethesda guy, but about an year ago I tried Skyrim and enjoyed it a lot. So few weeks back I decided to try Oblivion too and I can say it's a great game. I've never thought I would enjoy this 15+ years game so much but I did and I have no regrets buying and playing it.. One of my favorite games of all time. I played this for hundreds and hundreds of hours.. One of the most Nostalgic games from my childhood. The graphics and leveling system don't hold up supe rwell today, but the quests and RPG elements are still S tier. Fantasy RPG done in the FPS style, the menus can be a little fiddly and it's a bit rough around the edges compared to the Mass Effect games, but an enjoyable adventure nonetheless.. This review is in response to the galaxy brain take from Benjamin Kukkee below. Oblivion was released fifteen (15!!!) years ago. If you are comparing a 15 year old video game to a AAA title from 2021, that's on you, not the developer. That's like comparing a first gen Nokia 3310 to an iphone 12, and then complaining about how much the Nokia ****. Technology has advanced exponentially. Duh. It's obvious this person played the game for several minutes and rage quit because they weren't doing well. Lockpicking is laughably easy and you can buy lockpicks from the Thieves Giild (a quest line they obviously didn't do) or from a vendor who hangs out outside the Imperial City walls. You also literally find them everywhere with random loot? I never had a shortage on any of my playthroughs. The minigame to improve NPCs disposition toward you is also incredibly easy. And this business about an unreachable tower? I guarantee there is a path to it if you had the patience to find it. You think you discovered a bug that no one else has in 15 years? Not likely. Also, Bethesda has made quite a few games since 2006 and continues to do so. Unless you're writing this review from the distant past. In which case, buy Google Stock! Oblivion has the reputation it does for a reason. Solid game play, awesome quests, and at the time of release beautiful graphics. (The graphics are potatoes by 2021 standards, but so is every game from 15 years ago. Go look at Tomb Raider Legend from the same year.) There are some unique mechanics too. I still wish they would bring back spellcrafting like we had in Oblivion. It was sorely missed in Skyrim by many of us. There are quest lines from Oblivion that still have an emotional impact on me. The first time I got to That Part of the Dark Brotherhood? Gut wrenching! The fate of Martin Septim? He was too good for this world. Does the game have flaws and glitches? You bet. So does every game. I wish folks could go back and play Oblivion when it was new so they could understand how great it was at the time. I replay occasionally for nostalgia (it's a comfort game) but I know it's dated as heck. So is Super Mario Bros. So are all the old gen games we go to great trouble to play on emulators and the like. Adjust your expectations and enjoy it for what it is. And when you see him, tell Uncle Sheo I sent you. The first RPG game I ever played in 2007. The memories. So good. Hands down the best RPG I have ever played.. Stupidly funny game very reliable when you want something to laugh at but other than that its not very special I mean there are a lot of npcs but DO NOT try to walk to places for your whole run it will take days of time overall.. I mean come on it's Oblivion of course it's good. This was finally fantasy in the hands of the player. Delving into the world of Elder scrolls is like no other experience. From the dungeon crawling sensation to the other worldly horizons sought out in the likes of Cyrodil, The Shivering Isles and more! Given its age, the combat is something to be desired but if you enjoy being who you want to be, making choices you want to make them look no further than the classic adventure that started it all for me, Oblivion.. The quests and guilds in Oblivion are just so damn good. This is definitely a game you should play if you like open world RPGs.. its a classic and a good one. not to changed or messed up by constant updates. A true complete game.. This is were elder scrolls got good didnt care for the first 3 games to slow.. This game is amazing. It's a well put together RPG and even though it has its flaws and glitches it is a great RPG to play and have a fun adventure. I played this front to back, no stone left unturned. It's something I think most players have done and if I were you I would play it too.. Bah, bah bah bah, bah bah bah, buh bah bah.... Oblivion is better than skyrim, but worse than morrowind. This was a funny game to spawn cabbages and cheese in, and stick bodies into doors with. Fun times. Only Fallout 3 reaches this level of immersion!!! Beautiful game world!!! Incredible high fantasy!!! Brilliant quests!!! Magical game!!! Best in the series and FAR better and more diverse than Skyrim!!!. Played this early in my gaming childhood. Def started my love for RPGS. Must play for anyone.. Im going to give Oblivion the 10/10 exception. To me and my bias. It is the greatest RPG ever made and it is the best Elder Scrolls game in its completion. On top of that it is the greatest Single Player Game ever. Characters that will stick with me for a lifetime and I will never forget. The beautiful world of Cyrodiil and its high fantasy setting. The ominous feeling you have to fulfill the prophecy and shut the jaws of Oblivion. And the game has Sean Bean! He voices Martin Septim and delivers a performance. This game has gotten me through hard times and for that I can never repay it it in full but what I can say... Everytime Oblivion is mentioned I will say it is the greatest Game ever made. The game at times was good but at other times it was very frustrating. The gameplay and graphics are very old and the story/side quests weren't interesting at all compared to skyrim in my opinion.. This is a fascinating role playing game, with detailed game design and addictive missions and mechanisms.. Oblivion is still my favorite game ever released, even in 2020. Regardless of the outdated gameplay and graphics, I still like it more than any modern RPG. The Witcher 3 included. If you haven't yet, try it.. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 9/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 10/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 9/10 While we can look back and laugh at the NPC dialog and bugs now, this game was incredible upon release. I loved the mystical world and was one of the few open world games that I actually wanted to fully explore.. The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is a masterpiece. Oblivion is a open world role playing game with a great main quest and lots of great side quests.. If you think of RPGs, Bethesda`s The Elder Scrolls ist indispensable. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is in no way inferior to its brilliant predecessor Morrowind. Even more, Oblivion`s splendid story and huge open world satisfies every adventurer. Graphics are great, the environment feels lively and the quests are epic. Every RPG fan and friend of fine arts should experience the trip through magical Cyrodiil and ominous Oblivion!. The story is amazing with some of the most evil characters that I've ever seen, magical experience and great graphics.. I love this game, I think it's so good I named my username after the most annoying character. In my opinion, it's just a tad better than Skyrim. The combats easy to learn, lockpickings easier, it's full of memes, and I don't get asked if I get to the cloud district very often. The Arena in Imperial City is a fun way to earn money, and it's a fun way to kill characters without a guard in your face. The city's are better than Skyrims, and the quests are better.. Fun title with solid gameplay, visuals and role playing mechanics. Interesting setting.. I was being unfair. This game IS a game, I'll give it that, but I was bored by this game. The NPC conversations needed some polishing, the AI is sharp and fierce, nothing but, though. It must've been a great game back then. Now, boring. [Note, this is my opinion, so please don't get offended]. One of the best games i ever played in my xbox 360. The ambiance of the game and the possibilities that have are fantastic. every fan of rpg, have to play this game!. While this game has some pretty nice highs, if I had to describe this game in one word, it would be bland.. Arguably the greatest game ever made. Even if you aren't an RPG geek, it still holds up many years later and is better than than Skyrim or the online versions. A must own.. The first RPG I played in the 7th generation... it **** the life out of me. i played it with DLC's and I can sya it's one of best RPG's ever made... You have a vast world to explore, hundreds of dungeons, good questlines, good rolling... It had poor graphics, but who cares ? MUST-PLAY. So many memories! This game got me through one of my deployments. My down time was spent with this game. I loved it. It was my first Elder Scrolls game and I am happy that it was. I still play this game till this day...sorry Skyrim.. Fantastic deep world. Almost complete freedom to build the hero you want to play. Must play.. I played this game from mid 2016 to early 2017 and I can assure that it's stood the test of time since I honestly enjoyed it almost as much as Skyrim. The combat is clunky and graphics and animations are very bad by today's standards but the game still offers a good main quest, a pretty big open world, factions to join with quality quest lines and several fighting styles with numerous spells. I put 60 hours into the game by the time I finished it and there's probably another 60 worth of content. Over a decade after its release, this is an RPG you can enjoy long after its release.. Oblivion will go down in video gaming's hall of fame. It is the first truly massive Western RPG with mass-market appeal on consoles. This game changed how I looked at games altogether. With a massive array of quests and campaigns and a main campaign that could easily be a Hollywood blockbuster this is a game you will not want to leave. I am still playing my original save after ten years. This is sadly where my only criticism of the game comes in, my original save is becoming unplayable on my Xbox 360 (however my Xbox One seems to be handling it better). This means I am 'rationing' the remaining play time before it becomes useless. I wonder if Bethesda could issue a patch?. Incredibly immersive and engaging, and a worthy successor to TES:III. Suffers from Bethesda's signature robotic combat which puts a damper on melee mechanics, but overwhelmingly compensates for this with its detailed world-building. Players can interact with nearly every object in the game, and have practically no limit to their options. It's easy to forget there's a real world outside of Cyrodil.. This game blew me away when i first played it at a friends house and was the main reason i bought an Xbox 360. Up there with the best of the best, a masterpiece for the time and still holds up well over 10 years later.. One of the best games ever made. It has content to last you for literally 200 hundred hours or more. And thats with ONE character class. The leveling system is stupid though, but it's just a minor complain. PLAY THIS NOW on whatever console you can. There are few games that you discover A sense of wonder and purpose than this **** even later Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout 3 made me feel like I was in A world of awe and one where I truly had the freedom with nearly unlimited possibilities within A gorgeous package. Cyrodiil to me way outshines any other Elder Scrolls **** matter how you play it is always A unique and special experience that you will be remembering for years to come.Replay-ability is so much fun,the action,the interactions with NPC,random adventures.exploration and A whole lot more await you.10/10 in my book!. Who wouldn't give The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion a 10/10?. This game has aged very well from it's release in 2006. The story is just as engaging as Skyrims and the gameplay too. Oblivion is not only just a great game in general, it has bought many memories to the minds of many gamers. Do I even have to mention the soundtrack? the soundtrack is awesome. The characters are as memorable as ever. Oblivion is a masterpiece. must-but now.. Around this time this is one of the best games I've ever played hands down. The art work. Man every thing when I first found this game I was hooked love the idea. Yes there was a glitch or two but with how big this game was and a lot of play hours I could understand. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played... :)). Its a great game, I never really beat it though. Honestly after a while all of the content is recycled. Like a lot of dungeons look the same, different layout but the same. Also the difficulty level goes from extremely easy to damn near impossible. I know you can lower the difficulty setting but I just wish they would have got it right. I think I should go back to this game and just do a speed run through the main storyline, because I would just keep doing the side quests.. The fourth installment of the Elder Scrolls takes us back to Cyrodiil for the third time in the franchise and the first time since Daggerfall. It is a beautiful game that is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The only problems with Oblivion is that it hasn't aged well. The graphical capabilities is way behind nowadays and compared to its spiritual successors( Fallout 3 and Skyrim ) and the A.I. is not as good as it should've been. My last thoughts is that Bethesda must've opted for an easy way out by going back to Cyrodiil and creating an easily thought out game so they could make something as epic as the next installment in the series.. Best game ever if i wanted more adventure id have to be friends with peter pan and that's not possible one things is possible playing this game and its the one thing i wanna do for the rest of my life. Oblivion is easily one of the greatest games out there on the xbox 360! you will find yourself playing this game for hours and hours on end the story is great! the combat is good the graphics look amazing even for a 8 year old game! but at times the game lags and can affect you during combat. And the soundtrack is..... Freaking amazing. So if you can buy this for either console or pc get it it is worth our money!. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an extraordinary experience and is hands down my favourite game of all time. If you like any RPG what so ever then Oblivion is right for you. The quests are amazing and exciting to play and the story itself is epic. The customization of your character and game play feels so unique because there are so many choices and paths you can take with your character. The environment is very bright and colourful and the graphics are pretty decent for being released in 2006. The music of this game is absolutely breathtaking, it's the best game score that I have ever heard, and I enjoy listening to it during my adventure. The only flaw is that there are not that many voice actors, so you hear a lot of the same voices from different NPCs. Oblivion is my favourite RPG and my favourite game overall. It would be a mistake if you didn't ever play this.. This game is truly amazing. The graphics are stunning for 2006, and continue to amaze people. There are so many quests that you can find anywhere throughout the land, and exploring never gets old. The different guilds give a lot of content to enjoy, and the flow of the game is executed perfectly. While the game has many amazing points, the combat is somewhat repetitive, and the leveling system is slightly annoying at times. I still love this game though, and if you're looking for a game that will give you nearly endless hours for your money: Try Oblivion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic world to play in, very well done, you can see that the designers appreciate what they are making. Another game that steals hours of my time:). The leveling system is broken, the graphics haven't aged well, everything looks generic, the combat system is atrocious, ... yet I love this game and its freedom & magical atmosphere. Daggerfall & Morrowind are true classics, Skyrim is better in nearly every way, but Oblivion has so much heart.. Oblivion, like its older brothers, is a timeless classic. that's all that needs to be said on behalf of this masterpiece. but for curios people who don't know oblivion is one of those few games that bring the game play, storytelling and visuals to a whole new level. Bethesda truly set the bar for the Xbox 360's launch and to this day Oblivion still holds up in every way. simply put if you have never had the pleasure of playing this game now is as good a time as any especially with the next gen under-way you'll be able to get this game at a bargain and believe me it'll be worth every penny. Best game ever I LOVE IT it's better than skyrim it isn't just kill this kill that there is actual strategy like that dark brotherhood quest where you have to kill the shi captai n and instead of walking in and killing him you hide in a box and pop out. Only it's successor Skyrim boasts a better Fantasy RPG experience. At the time it came out, simply one of the greatest games to ever hit the shelves and while it does have some flaws, especially related to certain combat mechanics, to this day it rivals most RPGs for quality.. My Favorite Game on Xbox! The dungeons are fun, the quests are unique and interesting. The lore is fantastic! Everything about this game is amazing! My only complaint is you spend a lot of time in your menu and quest journals.. Great game, huge map to explore and countless quests to complete. Don't be fooled by the WoW nerds who are giving this game poor reviews to try to lower the score. The game is fun and you can easily spend 50+ hours on this game without even touching the main quest.. This is a great game. The things I hated about Morrowind is gone but the only problem I have with this game is the guide arrow & how the game feels so piecefull that if you want to get in a fight then you will have to go into a cave, ruins, ect.. ---Rating--- Design: 4 /5 (few changes to an already enjoyable system, but not all for the better) Polish: 4 /5 (much improved graphics, but slightly less coherent aesthetic than Morrowind) Value: 5 /5 (as always, a huge open world with virtually unmatched replay potential) ---Review--- Yes, the game world is by all standards large and looks immensely better than that of Morrowind, but at the same time I have found that Oblivion sorely lacks the sense of imminent danger and risk that made its predecessor such an exciting experience. Part of this might have to do with the loot and dungeon leveling system that I personally despised (but which might appeal to casual players and fans of more conventional dungeon crawls), but the ease of virtually unlimited fast travel and omnipresent quest markers also contribute to the suffocating odor of unnecessary streamlining. Even if such ease-and-efficiency-of-use oriented features seem to be somewhat at odds with TES' trademark free-roaming at-your-leisure exploration, the latter thankfully remains intact. The dungeons tend to be boring and repetitive, but the setting of Cyrodiil is rather interestingly varied if a bit lacking in overall cohesion. Of course the world itself isn't perfectly convincing, and neither is it entirely realistic in how it reacts to the player's actions, but for a game of Oblivion's scope that's asking quite a lot. There are many things that Oblivion does very impressively, such that most players should be able to overlook- if somewhat begrudgingly- its few but obvious flaws.. This game is great. At the time of release, there was nothing quite like it. Sure the inventory and menus were a the voice acting was terrible and every goddamn NPC was ugly. But never before has a game given someone so much freedom to do whatever you want. The game isn't for everyone, especially those with low attention spans, or little patience. Sometimes the game can be downright boring, and the bugs will make you lose up to 10 hours of gameplay, and yet its still a masterpiece.. This game always loomed around the video store unnoticed, until I picked it up one day by chance. I never looked back since then, it is one of my all time favorites, and I will always treasure the memories and experiences this game gave me. Absolute 10/10.. Crazy Overrated. Skyrim proves why this game is such a dud. 1) The World is big but ITS ALL THE SAME. The whole place is lush green, towns are similar, and NPC's are static with the same voice actors 2) Persuading NPC's is not intuitive and all luck which severely affects quest outcomes, payment for items, etc 3) Dungeons are repetitive maps 4) Oblivion Gates are chores to get through with no relief. They are get in get out affairs and rush back home to relax 5) Those are horses? they act like coast rugs with little value 6) No houses to buy, no women to marry, nothing to do but join a couple guilds and fetch this for some money you don't wanna spend on anything cause there is nothing to buy This game is a bore. Morrowind was geographically interesting although flawed. Skyrim gets everything right except the voice acting. I think people just wanted to love some of the early xbox 360 games that were released because this game doesn't stand the test of time. Want Proof? Ask anyone that has played Skyrim or Oblivion which game they would rather play It will be Skyrim everytime which means this game can't be a 10 and shouldn't even be in green numbers. My favorite game of all time. The amount of options and possibilities in this game makes it so unique, apart from other RPG's. Skyrim is a very good game, but I have never enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Oblivion. Just running around in the beautiful cities and landscapes, to explore all the amazing things in this game (while gaining levels, yeah). You never have a dull moment, at least I didn't, in Oblivion! PERIOD!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. even though I have mixed feelings about Skyrim I loved oblivion. it is one of the best RPGs ever in my opinon and you should get it and i will tell you why pros: Story and characters, memorable dynamic storys you make on your own or through the quests, oblivion gates, Daedra are really cool villains, combat is good for a 2006 game, large amount of interesting content, the guilds have interesting storys and actvities and help power up your skills in each respective class (fighter= warrior mages guild= wizards thieves guild= theives duh dark brotherhood= assasins arena= whatever you dang want) spell creating cons= level up system (level up wrong and lose every fight after) kind of disappointing main story climax, character models are poorly designed, in the dialogue system the camera zooms in onto the NPCs face as time stops for everything else and you basically select the subject of the conversation rather then what you say all in all oblivion is an amazing game worth every penny of its purchase price and with expansions like the shivering isles and knights of the nine there is plenty of content once you finish all of the original game (which i doubt would happen). I reviewed Skyrim before I reviewed Oblivion, however, I played Oblivion first. All I can say about this game is that it is just amazing. It is not as good as Skyrim, but it is still quite good. Oblivion was the game that brought me into this amazing franchise, and is now one of my favorite video games of all time. The graphics of this game are quite beautiful. Of course they are not as good as Skyrim (not quite as realistic), but they are beautiful enough to get the job done. There is quite a bit of detail in the graphics, and it really was a graphical achievement back in 2006 when this was released. Even today, the game's graphics are still very good. The sound is good too. It's not quite as realistic as I would have hoped, however, once again, it is realistic enough to get the job done. The sound effects and voice acting are done well enough, however, the best sound in this game is the game's music. Along with this game's sequel Skyrim, this game ties with the best soundtrack I have ever heard from a video game. The soundtrack to both of these games perfectly fit the environment you are in, and add a very beautiful touch to an already beautiful game. Once again, there are several quests to do in Oblivion that each have their own story. However, I think the main quest of Oblivion might just be a tiny bit better than Skyrim. Skyrim's main quest is a bit of a cliched apocalypse prevention scenario, however, Oblivion's story has gates from Oblivion (basically hell in The Elder Scrolls lore) opening, unleashing demons. It is up to you to seal these gateways, and stop the demons from appearing. One thing that is unique about this game's story is that you are not the chosen one. Instead, you are helping out the chosen one. This may sound boring, however, it really is well done, and much more original than most video games about a chosen one (ones where your character is the chosen one). This changed back to you being the chosen one in Skyrim however. As for the gameplay, it is not Skyrim, but it is good enough. This game is also open world, just like Skyrim, and you can literally do just about anything that you want. You can even choose not to do quests if you wish. The gameplay is not much different from Skyrim at all, however, I would say that it is not quite as good. Despite combat being good, it does feel a little like you are waving your sword at thin air. It is also weird the way non-player characters change the look on their face from sad to glad mere seconds after reminding them of something bad then good. Leveling up is also quite mixed if you ask me. At the very beginning of the game, you have to choose your birthsign. You really have to be careful with this, because once you pick a birthsign, you keep it throughout the rest of the game. So there is no way you can change it in the middle of the game like in Skyrim. Despite these flaws, I can safely say that this game is fantastic. It is not as good as Skyrim, however, it is good enough to be worthy of recognition throughout the gaming community. That is why I award Oblivion with an outstanding 9 out of 10!. The fourth in the longing running PC series Oblivion is the first to be designed primarily for console ga","the last truly good RPG that came out of Bethesda . it's more limited than Morrowind but not as empty as the 3D fallout series yet . massive open world with massive cities, but no one is around . Massive open world with massive cities, but no one is around . massively overrated (and overpriced at the time) ."
640.Joe Danger: Special Edition,"Joe Danger's mechanics , level design and controlls are masterfully executed to the point where it feels like something nintendo made during its golden age instead of being an indie game developed by 4 people. 98%. This game is a lot of fun, but I still wouldn't recommend it for 1200 points. While I write this it's on offer for 600, if that was it's permanent price I'd give it a 9/10. The game has solid game play and and quite a bit of replay value. But the majority of people will only get around 10-15 hours until they get too bored to play any longer. Achievements 8/10 Challenging achievements but do able, the online ones can be done with a different profile. So yeah I'd only get it at 1200 if you loved games like trials. Otherwise I would recommend waiting, until download of the week.. Fantastic game - This is game has the fun elements of excitebike, the stunts and physics of Trials HD with touches of classic mario bros/Sonic the Hedgehog style of fun. I don't think I've ever cursed at a game more than Trials HD (that game is fantastic, but frustratingly difficult in a very good way)...this game is far more forgiving than Trials, yet can be as challenging as you want it to be. Great game all around a must play for anyone who has enjoyed any of the games mentioned above.. Oh Joe, how I have screamed at you! With elements of Trials, Excite bike, SSX and Tony Hawks this really is a candy coloured treat! You will be glued to that leader board and you will curse Joe... a lot!. @ThePizzaman100 You're an idiot for bashing this game and then giving it a 10. @randomreview You're just and idiot. This is a great game, but not for everyone so give the trial a shot before you purchase. And this is coming from someone who has completed Trials 100%.. how did this get a 91 and trine 2 get an 86? Xbox bias at it's best. well this game was fun for about 10 minutes then i **** did i listen to critics again? i gotta stop doing that!. This game is utterly fantastic. It's what games should be, fun and irreverent but with proper core game mechanics for the true gamer keep you going back for more. If you liked trials you should get this, itâ. Joe Danger Special Edition is lying in its title... It is not special but instead the usual ""This is going to be ok for a month"" arcade game. There are some fun elements to it but overall it is the same boring rubbish that we expect this time of year from someone trying to make a quick buck. If you want a brilliant bike game play Trials, not this waste of money!!!","Joe Danger's mechanics, level design and controlls are masterfully executed to the point where it feels like something nintendo made during its golden age . while I write this it's on offer for 600, but if that was it's permanent price I'd give it a 9/10 . the majority of people will only get around 10-15 hours until they get too bored to play any longer ."
641.Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal,"Really good ending to the original trilogy, and epic fights, but the story felt like a rushed Highlander movie, Overall it is my least favorite BG game.. More than an expansion, or whatever how you want to call it. For me.. history!. The conclusion to the Baldurs Gate saga. It was planned as Baldurs Gate 3 but was cut short to an (still really big) add on. There is a lot of content and the most important thing is that it gives a truly satisfying conclusion. After Mass Effect 3 this is something that must be mentioned for Bioware games even if no game from Bioware before that struggled in this regard. The story continues a short time after the events of Baldurs Gate 2 in Suldannessalar as 5 powerful Bhaalspawn are killing all others bringing chaos, war and misery to the lands. Your playercharacter which you can import from Baldurs Gate 2 or create is going to a holy place of the elves to get answers from an oracle. Here the story starts. It is an epic conclusion as the whole world holds it breath to wait for the results and even the gods were watching the events without interference with mayor interest. The story has its great moments but you see that it was cut a bit short in some areas. Sounds maybe too negative as I fully enjoyed it. There will be huge revelations and open questions will be answered during the game. I like that you import also your decisions as romances and arcs for your partymebers are continued. The strength of all Baldurs Gate games are the excellent characters and you have the full rooster of Baldurs Gate 2 available except one certain character and the addition of one new character I wont spoil. These single new character was an amazing and bold choice that improved the game if you want or even dare to recruit him (To good to not do it gameplay and roleplaywise for me;-).. Again your party members will comment on actions or have conversations with each other. There might be even some changing events for some;-). There are some new NPC characters that I enjoyed and you can even meet Volo. It adds also the Watchers Keep which is a large remarkable Dungeon full of puzzles, fights, decisions and opportunities that can be accessed even as early as in Baldurs Gate 2 if you start a new playtrough. It has an interesting storyline and is challenging, I should also mention that you can upgrade weapons and armor from Baldurs Gate 2 if you get certain items. Gameplaywise there are some additions like legendary abilities. Most of them are truly awesome with some exceptions. For example: The thief's ability to wear all equipment is game-breaking as it overrides even class restrictions. A Thief / Kensai or Thief / Mage combination is truly terrifying with this. There are also some new spells, a few updates and a higher level cap. I must say it is a huge add on as it took me a while to finish it (Like I already mentioned it was planned as full game). The new antagonists work well but I think they could be a bit more fleshed out. Overall this is an epic conclusion that left me satisfied. The meaningful endings are a great closure to the saga and I still remember the epilogues for my character and patrymembers. From all videogames the Baldurs Gate games have my favorite cast of memorable characters. They were immersive and I cared a lot for them. I could never abandon for example Imoen in Baldurs Gate 2, I just always pick Edwin for the Edwina part and have fond memories of the other character. Simply a prime example how to make a good saga with a satisfying conclusion.. This is a good conclusion to the series, but only good. Compared to the other part of the ""trilogy"" throne of Bhaal is like a boss rush expansion for the base game. Sure, there are some epic fights with demigods to finally end the chaos in Faerun, but you are fighting one of them after another with a little story between the encounters. The problem is, that the combat mechanics are not that good to not make it tiring in the end.. This was a very pleasant surprise for me. I belong to the minority, who liked the original Baldur’s Gate better than its sequel, Shadows of Amn (which still is one of the best role-playing games ever made). This had lowered down my expectations for the expansion of the second game. I am glad I was wrong… Where I found Shadows of Amn lacking, Throne of Bhaal shines. Firstly, it is a very focused game. The linearity, however, is its strength. Combined with one of the best stories ever written for any video game (better than the previous Baldur’s Gate titles and maybe only surpassed by Planescape: Torment), Throne of Bhaal takes you to an epic journey. What is a bit odd is that as an expansion, the game provides more story and gives more character progression than both Baldur’s Gate I & II. It masterfully wraps up the story and concludes the Baldur’s Gate Saga. Moreover, it introduces the antagonist of Shadows of Amn as a playable NPC and a massive dungeon, Watcher’s Keep, to level up your characters to extremely high levels for a D&D world. With its 50+ hours of gameplay and the epic conclusion to the Baldur’s Gate Trilogy, this could easily be called Baldur’s Gate III by today’s standards. But the year the game was released was different times and the standard of respect to gamers was so much higher, this giant of an RPG -and one of the best of the genre- was only considered “an expansion”.. As said before, too much combat. And the combat is too difficult; playing your mages etc. well requires an amount of planning and thinking that borders on work, not play. I played on normal setting.. like the addon for BG1 this addon is great and improves the gaming experience, although Baldurs Gate is already great. The fights are perfect and there a are a lot of good story ideas to make the fights interesting: whether to understand the combat mechanics or the story. Watchers Keep is a first class dungeon and the story about the bhal spawns is epic and great. There is only 1 problem, that became more obvious than in Shadow of Amn: The controlling is bad and you have not enough overview, what is going on in the combat. 10/10.. A welcome addition to Baldur's Gate 2. One of the best expansions ever. Like the main game, I can not fault it at all. Well, maybe a little, it could have been longer, but then again I could say that about any great game. Throne of Bhaal just adds and gives us more, and if anyone is a devote fan of the first game as I am, that is a very good thing. Overall: Throne of Bhaal is a fantastic expansion to an already fantastic game.. A very good add-in to a magnificent game. While the 'Watcher's Keep' part is a stand-alone plot concerning yet another ancient evil to be bested, the main part of the game is the conclusion of the Child of Bhaal story. Apart from all the goodness we know from the predecessors, 'Throne of Bhaal' introduces a number of improvements, eg. changes in the GUI or in the spell effects. The only thing I can complain about is linearity and too strong emphasis on combat. Nonetheless, a memorable experience.. Too much combat, linearity and not enough exploration, the pacing has gotten worse for the expansion pack. The ending, and story itself, are great though and bring a much needed conclusion to the fate of the children of bhaal, and the new dungeon, shrouded in mystery, Watcher's Keep, is one of the greatest addition to the franchise, much like Durlag's Tower for Baldur's Gate 1.. A good addon to one of the best 2D Dungeons and Dragons RPGs ever made. If you like the genre and you think you can overlook the slightly outdated 2D graphics (Just look at some screenshots or videos) than you should really give it a try. Its simply brilliant.. Conclusion to one of the most epic RPG tales ever. Compared to today's graphics the game is obviously very lacking, but like its predecessor the art itself is beautiful. Gameplay and mechanics is complicated, but like its predecessor the story, world, and basic exploration properties overcome this. Did I like it? Yes!. Let's face it, BG2 was a (extremely brilliant) side issue as far as the plot of this saga goes. This is why this game should have developed the main story more, and Bioware, at the time, were the masters of doing just this. Supposedly they ran out of time on it (more than likely due to KoTOR) and it shows somewhat. But hey, all the fantastic things in BG2 are still there. Amazing high level abilities, interesting and varied armour, weapons and spells, a great new joinable NPC, some very tough enemies, romances, party banter, a great new dungeon and all the other small things which sometimes are the most important. The ending could easily have been a big let down but definitely wasn't (shivers and spine come to mind) but I think they could have handled the major villain a bit better. It could be argued that this game could never live up to its predecessor, but most of us were probably enjoying ourselves too much to care. A fitting end to the best thing ever to come off a collection of small circular discs.. MORE BG2?... Give it to me :P It is an expansion pack, which is probably the only problem. I would much rather have seen a BG3 instead of an expansion pack... But, it is still ""MORE BG2"" and I can't get enough. Some fights will frustrate you, especially if you, like me, completed BG2 with a solo sorcerer, going to the ending of the expansion with level 18 companions is, well, rather tough :P. The conclusion to the Baldur's Gate saga, this expansion pack to Baldur's Gate 2 really ought to have been made and sold as a standalone Baldur's Gate 3. As it is, it feels compressed: a somewhat rushed conclusion to the Bhaalspawn saga, plus a huge dungeon in the style of Durlag's Tower: Watcher's Keep. Throne of Bhaal takes the style of the BG series and turns it up to 11: everything is bigger, flashier, explodier, with multiple dragons. Some annoying difficulty spikes -- notably the encounter at the Throne itself (I just want to see the ending, not reload multiple times!!). Still, the essential conclusion to the saga.. Ah, the Throne of Bhaal. Like BG 2 SOA, it is fun, immersive and challenging. While a great expansion, it isn't exactly on the same level of BG 2, but you can't go wrong here, especially if you want to see how the Bhaal saga unfolds.. While certainly a fantastic RPG when compared to others, it didn't live up to Shadows of Amn. It is a very linear adventure, but the dungeon crawling is fun at least. Watcher's Keep is a great addon for a fantastic and colossal dungeon experience. The story is just as fantastic and masterfully written as ever, even at the very end, but again, it is no SoA.","the story felt like a rushed Highlander movie, overall it is my least favorite BG game . there is a lot of content and the most important thing is that it gives a truly satisfying conclusion . the strength of all Baldurs Gate games are the excellent characters ."
642.Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge,"Probably the best flight simulator of all time. I remember the graphics blowing my mind on Xbox 20 years ago but it still looks nice and the controls and game play are still so fun.. One of the best flying game that I have ever played. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay make this a classic.. Very enjoyable game. Setting is amaizing and levels are very different. I wish only missions were more varied as well.. This game was way ahead of it's time. Featuring excellent flight and dogfight controls, solid graphics, and a competent length, not to mention the amazing Xbox Live multiplayer that was booming back in the day. Make an effort to play this game, whether it be in the upcoming Xbox One port, or on the original Xbox.. Sure 100% fast and artistically punched action ! Epic game ;O , Even arcade version has FAST MOVING aggressive seat ****﻿. The planes in this game are a joy to fly, the characters are badass and the story is a blast! The graphics are amazing for an original XBOX too. Everything has a surprising amount of detail, the worlds are aesthetically pleasing and the water especially is stunning. It looks even better on the XBOX 360, where it runs in HD with a smooth framerate. Simply put, the best game you can get for the original XBOX, even though XBOX Live is no longer supported for it. Pick it up. It's well worth the $10 it'll cost you.","Probably the best flight simulator of all time . great graphics, sound, and gameplay make this a classic .

643.HYPER DEMON,"There is no other game which managed to make my eyes bleed as much as Devil Daggers. I have spend hundreds of hours glued to my monitor on a game which almost could not be simpler. Hyper Demon breaks that simplicity and in my opinion it does not make the game any better. More complexity does not mean better game. There is a limit, which Hyper Demon crossed over and suffers for it. Although it is visually stunning and fixes few issues that I had with Devil Daggers, I could not help but feel disappointed once I finished it.. Hyper Demon is, without a doubt it my mind, one of THE greatest of games to show your skill in shooters. Cerebral Art direction, with a fantastic gameplay loop that has kept me satisfied since i purchased. Definitely the best of Sorath's Work.. Can't believe how such a trash, garbage joke gets 89?? While a game with stunning graphics, and creative gameplay such as Scorn gets 71? Gamespot is the trashy video game website that gave Scorn a score of 4, while gave this garbage 8. Well, it's clear and obvious, garbage graphics, gameplay, and sound gets attention from trash critics such as IGN, GameSpot, and so on. Well, wohooo as if they saying let's be different.. HYPER DEMON is more a sport than a traditional game. Think of skateboarding: you take the time to learn a trick - it's painful and strenuous, your ankles hurt and you **** your palms and knees - but as it becomes second nature, the reward is like no other. You now have a new tool to resolve a tricky situation or to simply express yourself. As you become more and more comfortable with the game environment, you gain confidence not just in defeating enemies, but in self expression - your identity comes through in your playstyle, and you gain the desire to show off your signature dance and swagger on the leaderboards. The scoring is there to push you out of the birds nest, to force you to build the confidence to become the god of the arena. Whereas in Devil Daggers you were the prey, slowly being ground to dust, in HYPER DEMON you are the predator, a Demon fighting its way out of the hyper plane. To dominate you need to push yourself to your limits. If your score is low, you're not pushing yourself hard enough. If you die too easily, you're pushing yourself too much. Find the right balance for your current skill level, and err on the side of pushing too hard. Here's a tip: don't worry about your score. Focus on learning the skateboard, the feel of the glide and momentum, the ollies and grinds. Become comfortable with the arena and the enemies, and take the time to learn tricks and fail over and over again. As you gain confidence your score will naturally ascend. Watch the replays of top scorers and get inspired. This game is far more immersive and visceral than VR games - when I stopped playing I was depleted of adrenaline and left with a warped perception of time and space. You may experience Hyper Sickness - symptoms include headache, tense muscles, cramps, dizziness, and fatigue. Be sure to take breaks, hydrate, sit back from your monitor, and loosen your grip. HYPER DEMON is a difficult sport but it's more accessible than it might look, if you have the right attitude. Learn the fundamentals and express yourself. If you want a high score, just know that to even come close to the top scorers, to taste just a drop of their immortal blood, you will die a thousand deaths.. Hyper Demon is a remarkable work of ludological purity, a tour de force not just exploring but liberating the joy of movement to new levels. it is a celebration of classic arcade action, a glimmering jewel of precisely tuned mechanics, all presented in a brave, daring design that commands attention and defies comparison. it shares rank with games like Geometry Wars or Quake, games that take the foundation of action as an artform and elevate them to dizzying new heights. The minimalist goal of climbing a leaderboard might not be quite enough for some, and the visuals are certainly bold enough to offend certain tastes, however if a fiercely challenging, psychedelic hellstorm of fluid yet sharp mechanics is something that piques your interest in the slightest: run as fast as you can to purchase this absolute work of art. final note: may cause excessive bleeding of the eyes (it's a good thing).","'hyper demon' is one of THE greatest games to show your skill in shooters . graphics, gameplay, and sound get attention from trash critics such as IGN, GameSpot and so on ."
644.Cave Story Plus,"Don't understand why it's rated that high, finished the game in a few hours on normal, it was a drag. Story I'm a fan of metroidvania and other platformers but this is subpar, it's way below the best in the genre. It doesn't feel good to play. The character is ""floaty"". It's frustrating and not fair. specially bosses. Usually, the save points are not too far but far enough that you have to do some not enjoyable platforming and kill some enemies before you fight the boss again. Dialogues cannot be skipped, so you have to listen again before the fight. I gave up at Monster X. You get stuck on the wheels and cannot move after having lost huge amount of life. with projectiles everywhere you cannot see anything. Even if you manage to avoid the wheels. I realized I didn't have much fun playing it. If the game is so punishing it should at least feel good playing and have a good story. So far the story can be summarized in few lines. I am having more fun writing this review. I go back enjoying some other Metroidvanias.. I played Cave Story recently, and it ranks as one of my favorites of all time. I absolutely loved the story, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the difficulty, basically everything. Many label it as a Metroidvania, which I would say it's not (it's actually quite linear). One man (under the name Pixel) created this game (it took him 5 years to do it) and this has got me curious about other single-person creations, like Axiom Verge, Iconoclasts, etc. You can technically still play it for free on PC (it has always been available for free), but then you're missing out on a bunch of cool extras. Go play it!. Currently, this is the most definitive version of Cave Story that you can play. This is basically the Steam version but with added content and quality-of-life fixes such as stacking Jenka's puppies instead of carrying them one by one. Also there are multiple OSTs to pick from with each giving the game a unique vibe! Though, the Steam version can probably mod that stuff in. If you just want to pick up the game and play it, I would recommend this version over the Steam version! This is also my favorite game of all time since I first played it on the Wii :). great platformer with a really cool universe really entertaining boss fights and all aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I played a ton of Cave Story when I was younger, and I was fully expecting to have a rollicking good time revisiting it on Switch, but I can't help feel like some of the soul is missing with this release. Perhaps it was due to Nicalis' meddling, or maybe I'm just getting old and jaded, but I can't see myself recommending this game to many people when there are so many other great action platformers out there nowadays. Also, this is definitely my age showing, but the original soundtrack is the way to go.. This game is the very first Indie game I've played. I wish I played it back in 2004 when I was 11 years old but I played it 5 years later. It felt so nostalgic due to the music and the gameplay is very good. It was one of those times where I felt like I was a kid in elementary school again racing home to watch tv or play that very addicting video game. I like how the story is alittle dark. However some of the sad moments I didn't like so I felt more of the need to finish it. I love how even though the game is a metroidvania, it's more linear than the usual ones. I also like how the level up system works. It rewards you for being good at the game. With the controls, I honestly felt like it could've been a gameboy advance game. The game has gone through many versions and the best new thing about this version is that you can change the music to metal versions.. The best Metroidvania I've ever played, the third-best Indie game of all time, worth every penny and every minute.. Favorite indie game of all time, own it on almost every platform. Buy at your own addiction risk.. I really don't understand high notes for this game. The worst for me is that just hi scores motivated me to buy this game. It was mistake. Great music? Maybe I got different version of this game? It's just set of very dull 8bit clicks. It's awful. Please, just compare to Octopath Traveler to see what does it really mean good music in video game before using that term. Truth to be told, if not by music, perhaps it would score 5 or even 6/10. In terms of story it's very immature (in terms of ""script"", not 18+stuff of course). Not that I have something to this crazy story. It's just constant feeling like if author made all of this without deeper idea. Graphics is OK - given what sort of game it is. The best would be to compare this game to other of the like. Axiom Verge is very good comparison to Cave Story+: also made by one person, also 8bit metroidvania. But Axiom is just far, far, far better in all aspects: story (especially story), gameplay & music. In terms of ""metroidvania"" Cave Story+ is rather average representative of genre, that didn't live up to my expectations.. So a single guy made this game over 15 years ago. And today you can play it handheld on the Nintendo Switch! I’ve played about 50 games on the switch and this was one of few that I was completely drawn into right away, and played every day until I beat it. Gameplay reminds me of megaman games for the NES, but with a better story and some rpg elements. Oh, and there are multiple endings, and you can see them all in the same run! I do wish there was always a save point before all bosses. That’s my only beef. Great game. 9/10. Not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, just very forgettable. It's extremely annoying at times. You sometimes need to do very long stretches of the game over and over if you die - which is fine in games where you feel you learn something by doing it again and again - but in this one it just felt like a grind most of the time. Controls are a bit floaty, and although a lot of the enemies are cool, the level designs aren't particularly interesting, in my opinion. Overall, I felt a lot more frustrated than satisfied with this game.. There are some one-person-made games that have attained a lot of praise but to me, the most noteworthy might be Cave Story, it has an irresistible charm in every aspect imaginable, and when you hit the credits cutscene you'll be prompted to start a new game+ right away. Cave Story has stellar and commendable gameplay, it blends platforming and shooting beautifully, always giving you balanced challenge and rewarding jumps. It's structured like a Metroidvania type of game borrowing a little the shooting and platforming aspects from Metroid and a similar narrative structure from Castlevania, although it is its own thing. Story-wise, I was hooked immediately with the art direction and music, the script is great and has an unbelievable and seamless tone shift between whimsical, comedic and often darker moments, its simply brilliant. Speaking of its length, its a relatively short experience, it took me roughly 5.30 hours to complete but having several endings and combinations, it is a positive thing, which makes it more replayable. The music is also incredible, and it hits the right notes to set the mood in each area, and sometimes it cuts abruptly to make a moment more dramatic. This edition comes with a little soundtrack cd and an instruction manual with some cool artwork and hints in it, it also has a co-op local mode which I couldn't try, and you can shift freely between original graphics or remastered, is it also possible to change the style of music in 4 variations; original, remastered, rock instrumental (?) and a one that sounds more chiptune than the others, it's not necessary but it makes your replays more enjoyable. There's not a big issue within this game, some bosses are way too easy and the last boss can be a little frustrating but that's all, it doesn't ruin your experience at all, maybe the jumping physics are a little hard to grasp at the beginning but nothing too bothersome. Overall I'll recommend this game to anyone who owns a Switch and especially those Metroidvania fans, it has a balanced challenge and interesting story that is kind of hard to put the control down.. My favorite game of all time i fell in love with the gameplay story and the soundtrack everything about this game is well done and the fact that this was made just by one person is absolutely fantastic. Great indie game! The music, story and retro graphics are pretty good. The ""only"" problem for me is that it was a little bit short, but anyway if you have the opportunity to play it, you should!. I have always heard how much **** game Cave Story is, so I decided to pick up Cave Story+ and see if it lived up to its praise; and, it definitely does. Cave Story+ has some very crisp pixel art, fantastic music, weird but adorable characters, and a vague story. The gameplay consists of precise platforming and shooting enemies with various weapons you will find throughout your journey that has an interesting mechanic of collecting experience to level up your weapon. The game is linear in the sense that you won't have to discover areas and instead move through one level to another. The bosses are interesting and fun, but won't offer much of a challenge. There are multiple endings you can go for, but just be warned that if you want the best ending, be prepared to work for it. My criticisms are that the length is incredibly short and you could probably beat it in one sitting, and that the $30 price tag is a bit much for a digital purchase, so I recommend picking up the physical version. Cave Story+ is such an enjoyable experience throughout, and I see why it garnered the praise that it has over the years. I highly recommend it, and you should definitely pick this one up!. Game **** ass platforming in this game is just ridiculous and the fact that when you get hit by a enemy and you lose a level of the weapon **** the soundtrack is good but the game is not this makes cave story one of the worst games i've ever played. If there is ever a hall of fame for indie games, Cave Story will be in the inaugural class. It's still hard to believe this game was designed, written, composed, programmed, and published by a single person. Pixel's labor of love is a wonderful and charming adventure with elements of Metroid, Mega Man, Kid Icarus, and Spelunky. It will stay with you long after you complete the relatively short but challenging campaign.. Rather overrated game. Sure, it's a remake and that's fine but it cannot score similar to, say, Hollow Knight. Cons: combat is pretty lackluster, especially boss fights; controls are laggy and jumping has lots of inertia and ****; visuals are okey -- not great like some make you believe -- and the showing the damage every time anybody gets hit sticks out like a sore thumb Pros: the story and its delivery are actually good. This game is worth every cent you used to buy it with. It has a great story, memorable characters, fun game play, and great level design. Also there is a lot of extra content from 5 ost's to a alternate story featuring Curly Brace.. Slightly overrated in my opinion. The story is great, and the characters are cute, but thats about as far as it goes for my pros. the combat system is meh at best, not a fan of four direction shooting, and the enemies are not memorable except for that cute little robot, but maybe thats just cause hes my keychain now. I guess to each their own. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is fantastic. However, do not play it on hard mode. Ever. Music is fantastic, the game looks good, it plays well (and is very fun), has the perfect difficulty, fantastic level design, and has multiple endings (get the normal ending before the best one). Only downside is the MASSIVE difficulty spike near the ending (if you want to get the best one), and the fact that the best ending is pretty much impossible to figure out on your own.. I liked few hours that I spend in this game, but I can't really see anything special, I'm stil impressed that it was created by one person. It's just solid 2d platformer.. This game is awesome. Catchy music, fantastic looking retro-pixel art style, good story (with different endings according to how you play), perfect controlls (I prefer using the pro controller) and new two player simultaneous couch coop. The game itself is a metroidvania style game which means you can explore the dungeons, get better items & weapons to reach new areas, where you can find upgrades for life and missiles. I recommend this game to every switch owner, because its one of the best 2D platformers ever made. The original of this game was developed by Daisuke Amaya and was able to download for free on PC. If you've never played cave story you missed a great game. The switch version is the best up to now (imho), because of the added 2 player mode, playing it portable, and all the settings (i.e. different music mixes for the game). The switch version comes with a full coloured manual (with beautiful artworks) and the soundtrack on mini disc. Some retailers (gamestop) have a pouch and a keychain added as well.. I've played this game for an incredibly long amount of time. I have gotten both endings for this game in normal mode so I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to write this review. This video game was made out of compassion as the creator spent over 5 years making it in this spare time, and boy does all that time and effort really show. This game is a classic in my eyes, some people may say it's too short and some people may say it's too hard when your trying to get the best ending. But in my opinion, this video game is perfect for all ages. (Though I have to agree that the hard mode is ridiculously difficult and I would not recommend it whatsoever, but that still doesn't stop this game from being a true masterpiece). I had never played that game and decided to buy it for the Switch! I had to say I was impressed, but not VERY much like others. The game is fairly simple and easy in general (standard difficulty), but interesting. The gameplay mechanics are well done and the story is good. The graphics are very nice as the songs.. I had never played Cave Story prior to CS+. Although it was a quick play, I classify it as the best game I've played this year. The way the game goes it really prods for multiple play throughs. If you've yet to play Cave Story I would recommend this over any other switch game except for maybe MK8D.. + Initially a very intriguing premise + Unique gun / battle system + Soundtrack + Super Metroid like cave system, but you'll never feel lost - The story doesn't fulfill earlier expectations - The spike in difficulty on the final boss is a little much - Jumping platforming at first is a little rough. I'm a huge fan of Metroid 2D series. So, obviously, I love Cave Story a lot. I did play this game first time for DSiWare and again for 3DS. I still find the game very enjoyable. CV+ looks stunningly gorgeous on Nintendo Switch's screen. The game box comes with a miniCD music + a manual. I think Nicalis did a good job with the packaging. The art for the cover is awesome. The manual looks beautiful. The miniCD is a nice addition to the whole package. Of course, you can buy this game at a much cheaper price at Steam. But the nice box makes it well worth the $30 price tag *it is $40 for us here in Canada*. I should point out that the whole original game was made by a single man A must have for Cave Story original and Metroidvania fans.. great game for the Switch. cool story, nice art style, good challenge, great music, etc. it's all there. Get the physical version though, digital is just not worth 30 bucks for a game that you can play for free online. My only criticism is the how the game kinda ""tricks"" you to **** up one of the requirements for the best ending, but to be fair, I think it is recommended that you get the normal ending first. note - do not play endgame while tripping balls. you die a lot and you will get frustrated, which isn't recommended while tripping.. I adore Cave Story. This is my first time playing it, and I can say that this doesn't feel like the 13 year old game it is. It feels like a fresh, modern indie game that takes the best of games like Metroid and Master Blaster and blends them with gorgeous visuals, expert level design, and an amazing well-paced story to create a retro game experience unlike any other.","it's subpar, it's way below the best in the genre . the character is ""floaty"" it's frustrating and not fair. especially bosses . this is the most definitive version of Cave Story that you can play ."
645.Dark Age of Camelot,"Its has been 22 years and still no other game came close, its just a masterpiece. The only down side, its just too complicated to casual players. I have so many great memories of this game. Soloing, grinding, dungeons, PVP, and climbing the castle walls. Only game I ever had a second account to have a cleric auto follow me around. I saw some people are still playing. Tempting.. I have played on and off since 2002 and back then this game was one of the best MMO ever created. When EA acquired this game it started to go downhill. The population started to decline, patches started to become sparser and sparser with content in them as well. Now under the guidance of broadsword, we are lucky to get an update a quarter with a few things that are well thought. Many of the updates now are for the elite small man group. as well as the last few updates tend to favor 2 of the 3 realms. I would not recommend this game to anyone at this point. I keep coming back due to the die-hards friends that still play this game, NOT THE GAME itself.. This was the greatest RvR MMORPG ever made. I only hope that one day another game is made that brings back the same spirit of this classic but with modern day graphics. Wouldn't that be nice.. Very fun and addicting MMORPG. I actually had to put the game down to focus on RL. Had great times playing on my Midgard warrior. One of the few MMORPGs to deliver the three faction warfare system. The game had a huge population in the early years. The crafted system was ok. Not easy to get used to at first, but immensely valuable once you learned a crafting trade. It could also have been more meaningful and take less time to achieve Legendary status. While RVR was extremely fun, classes have remained unbalanced for the most part, especially since the inception of TOA. There's either no log in timer now, or a very short one enabling realm hoppers to easily bounce back and forth between realms. Players use this to earn more rps on their toons when one realm holds the advantage therefore destroying all meaning of realm loyalty. I fear the most recent changes to the frontiers may finish the game off as it was already suffering from a dwindling population. Many of my friends have quit, retired, or have gone to other games.. Best MMO ever. WoW is not even close to this. Best PvP, RvR, crafting, outstanding PvE, Quests. The devs started to ruin it at the end unfortunately; making gear obsolete, totally destroying ToA, and complicating with too many gear items etc. Still, if the servers had population I would consider returning.. Oh DAOC, if i could go back in time and enjoy you again I would. You were everything an MMO and PVP MMO should be if you can merge in the Public Quests and other small advances we have made. Damn you Mythic and Damn you EABioware. Warhammer could have been so good as DAOC2. Q.Q. DAoC is the greatest MMORPG i grew up playing this game from the age of 11 back in 2002 till now. the graphics for one yes it compared to newer games that have come out its dull to few but it was the realistic of the graphics that made it feel real, the storie line the charcters the classes all schyronized well with the historical time this game was based off of. not to mention the RvR no game out there can compare to camelot in PvP combat running around with 50+ taking towers/castles/relics fighting one realm and all of a sudden the 3rd realm comes in and interferes and its a total chaos but fun you could also solo if u knew your way around the map, even the PvE was great you could group together and raid farm or just solo quests or kill to gain experiance in daoc u didnt have to do quests to level u could just run around and kill and honestly gain more xp from that thats something you dont see in these newer games and its kind of dragging to just do quest after quest. now threw the years ive tried other games like WoW WAR hammer rift but ive always came back to daoc and i would still play if it had a population to enjoy the game with like it used to be. and people who've played this game know what im talking about. but hands down not only was this the best MMORPG ive ever played. It is a game that sets the standards for how a MMORPG should be. with that being said i hope the camelot unchained will bring a success in rebirthing this gameplay type.. Best MMO ever created. If it had the attention it deserved and had not been bought out and ignored by EA, this would still be the best MMO around. The best Player vs Player experience ever created on an online game, but only as long as you had friends to join you in battle.. i wish that i could have been playing this game since start, but while i was giving SWG its chances i was totally not doing anything in DAOC, now i totally noticed this now and would like to start playing it, but is it too late?. Good, solid MMO. I felt it was a bit of a mixture of UO and Everquest when it came out, and it was quite enjoyable. I never was drawn into it as deeply as I was with UO and Everquest, but I did play it for a year or two and leveled 2 or 3 characters to 50. World of Warcraft is very similar to Daoc, you could say it's a slightly improved version of that game in many ways.. This game has been a defining and life-changing experience for me. No game in creation rivals the depth and complexity of the PvP system of DAoC. An absolute masterpiece of game design!","it's been 22 years and still no other game came close, its just a masterpiece . when EA acquired this game it started to go downhill . many of the updates now are for the elite small man group ."
646.NASCAR Thunder 2004,"Best EA Sports NASCAR game of all time. Wish ea could make nascar games like this again!. 20 Years Later... Still THE Greatest NASCAR Console Game to date! Sad that this is the peak so far 9/10. Probably one of the best simcade racers out there still. Great career mode, fun but easy to understand physics, and other various features makes this great. The only reason why this isn't a 10 is due to a handful of bugs that are sometimes unavoidable (ex: have a caution come out while pitting on a 10% race on a plate track, and see how the AI like it).. This game gets a solid 10/10. The physics, the graphics, the features, the soundtrack, and also the driver roster is pretty solid for a game that's way ahead of it's time.. This game probably is the best EA sports Nascar game, with fun gameplay great graphics, 4 players local co-op , an amazing carrer mode and the lighting challenge mode with is still amazing today. This game is probably one of the better NASCAR games in terms of difficulty and just how much fun it is. It might not be for the intended purpose but wrecking your opponents going the wrong way around the track is very fun and addicting. This game got me into NASCAR when I was younger.","20 Years Later... Still THE Greatest NASCAR Console Game to date!

647.Owlboy,"Though it's been a while, I can't recall all the specifics, but I do remember having a great time playing this game. It had a nostalgic charm that reminded me of classic titles, even though I can't quite pinpoint which ones. The storyline was easy to follow yet intriguing, and the gameplay was satisfactory. The challenging boss fights provided a thrilling experience, and overall, I had a lot of fun with this game. I would definitely recommend it!. Owlboy captures what gaming is all about - being immersed in another world. It harkens back to the golden days of getting cosy and playing Zelda.. great start bad ending game starts with a really cool story and great art i was hyped to see the ending but the game makes 2 fatal mistakes 1.ending is somewhat not good since i was expecting a better and more complex story it get predictable in the **** gameplay gets boring late game it was ok in the begging but it the late game it is really boring(not bad boring)puzzles are easy the only good thing about it was boss fights those were fun overall what makes this game good is it's art it ROCKS and the main reason i gave it 8 not 7. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolutely beautiful graphics, but the gameplay just didn't do it for me, got bored pretty quickly. Would be absolutely forgettable if not for the art direction.. The plot is nice as it is the gameplay but never revolutionary or noteworthy, it's a short story full with puzzle and platforming, which are never challeging but always rewarding, the bosses are not the best part of the game but at least they are not annoying. It is a 7/10 surely not more than that.. Owlboy is a story adventure taking place in cloudy world with cave systems. Story 4.5/5 From the small owl we have a teacher who has despised us, soon enough the first problems appear and we'll coop with one of our friends. There are some surprising parts of story, turns and we'll get engaged with well done characters. It's not only serious and there are some funny moments. Lastly very interesting history of owls and enemies. Gameplay 4.5/5 It has pretty big world, however there's no map in game. We'll be using 3 different companions and encounter challenging bosses who act in patterns. We'll have 4 different weapons or tools to beat various opponents and bosses, at some point we'll need each of them at once. There's a bonus level for finding lost creatures. Replay value 3/5 This bonus mini game is quite challenging. We'll be collecting coins for special items and content which we can do after finishing main game. As mentioned, enemies are predictable once we figure out their patterns but they pose challenge at first encounter. Graphics 3.5/5 Characters and environments are lively. There are traps and dangerous objects. How many hours? 10-19. Hardware requirements? Low gaming. How difficult? Hard. Games similar to Owlboy? Gameplay: Yoku’s Island Express Graphically: Keep Me Burning Verdict 8/10 Interesting story-driven adventure. It has really cool characters and dialogues, though not voiced. Going through various cages and overcoming challenges is fun. Boss fights are hard at first, but every enemy is moving in same patterns. We are using our friends for solving certain puzzles or getting rid of different enemy types and obstacles. It is very well done.. I would like to express my gratitude to this game studio for the OwlBoy. This game was the first in which I played, acquiring a gamepad for my PC. For me, it was a great revelation that a simple graphics platform could turn out to be a beautiful atmospheric world with a deep and interesting plot. OwlBoy gave the first impression of this genre of games. I would like to tell for people that made this game ""Thank you very much for this generous gift to me as a player"".. Owlboy is a fantastic platform adventure game. The game is really unusual experience. An awesome platform game which leads us into a vast and rich world. It's a ""breath of fresh air"" in the genre and it has a very peculiar art style. The history is nice and the soundtrack is also pretty good. But what I like most was the awesome ""retro"" pixel graphic looks. Overall it's a ""must have"" to any fan of the platform games genre.. I really wanted to like this game. But as for many others the main sellingpoint was the gorgeous pixel art. The things that made me to not recommend this game was: * The gamedesign: Boring puzzles and leveldesign. * To much dialogue: Don´t get me wrong, I love when the charaters is giving some personality, but not when I have to pause time after time to wait for the characters to say something none important stuffs when I am right in a good flow. * To much effects on the screen. Lovely pixel effects and animations but to much, makes the combat to messy. Weapons that makes the whole screen red. * The hit system. When the player is hit he usully hits the ground and looses so much flow in the gameplay that its just gets annoying.. The biggest misleading advertisement I've fallen into. Seriously ... so much propaganda, so many positive comments ... for a simple game, annoying, boring and short. Idiot characters, even for children, history too ... bah, there are many games that are much better than this, what a regret. BUT THE WORST OF EVERYTHING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK FOR ANALYSIS OF THE GAME, SAY IT'S GOOD ... IN GOOD, IT'S NOT GOOD NO.. Owlboy was released recently for XBox and PS4, which made me go search in my game library to see if I already own it. I found it and spent 10 hours delighted with the game. Simply gorgeous. I think the introduction says it all, but I suspect you're expecting to listen a few more lines. Owlboy has been in development for almost 10 years and went almost unnoticed when it was released on PC. It is a puzzle platformer in which we solve some relatively easy puzzles to advance. Otus, our main character, sees his land attacked by pirates and creates a group of friends, consisting of characters once devalued by their peers, to try to save their world. It has to be said that it is a very well written story, with well characterized characters, each one with its own history, more or less detailed to the point that we sincerely care about all of them. Even some of the side characters or villains are extremely well represented. It's a linear story, with a small twist at the end, but very well set and explained. My only problem with the story, and not wanting to spoil it, is the final battle. In addition some of the dialogues become rather extense, although I believe that little or nothing could be excluded from the final product. Graphically the game was a surprise. I expected a Shovel Knight-like artstyle but the way they used the pixelart in this game, combining it with high-resolution graphics, immense details on the movements and expressions. The construction of worlds and scenarios goes far beyond the games that try emulate retro games. For example Otus does not speak but the facial and body expressions details are more than enough to perceive all their emotions and we can even imagine a whole dialogue just with them. Recently I spoke about the attention given to detail in Sea of Thieves and Owlboy is another great example of how to build a world and how to use art to do something well made. The game soundtrack does not disappoint and remarkably follows the tone of each. When we are quietly exploring the world the music is calm and relaxing, and when we are in a fighting section or when we need to do fast movements the music becomes more intense and dynamic. I liked the sound effects for each one of the movements and actions of the characters and even the sounds for the dialog boxes, and although nothing is extraordinary, undoubtedly a competent job was made. How do you play this? I tried to play it as a twin stick shooter, but at one point I got tired of it because it's so much easier to simply use keyboard and mouse. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the configuration of the controller, but when the game reached a difficulty spike, I did not have enough skill to overcome a boss or a more demanding section, so I choose for the easier solution... change the controller. In this game we control Otus which as a standalone character does very little. He flies, twirls, and spins. The secret and charm of the game is that he can pick up any of his three friends and take advantage of their different abilities to progress through levels or areas that we would not have access to without them. Although the amount of enemies is not great, combat rarely seems repetitive because the way they appear, leads us to use different techniques to overcome them in each of those moments. The puzzles are relatively simple and often obvious, which means that you have the feeling that boss battles have a remarkable difficulty spike and required me numerous attempts to outcome most of them. The fact that the controls were somewhat confusing, which made me do multiple mistakes also did not help. In sections where we have time to think there was no big problem other than the frequent annoyance of picking up the friend rather than picking up an item or picking the wrong character, but during quick sequences a mistake ruins everything and in those times it becomes frequent. There are lots of collectibles and hidden areas that reward both exploration and the repetition of some of the areas when we gain access to new characters. Defeating enemies in a certain way also gives you access to new items. In a nutshell the game is this. A lovely world with characters with whom we can easily create a relationship. Graphically it managed to impress me by the way they included so many detail in the pixel art. A very engaging story. A game and also an experience that I highly recommend. Now available on all platforms, if you have the opportunity to play it do not discard this game.. Owlboy ridiculous heart Youre a young mute owl that everybody underestimates reguarded as unworthy and a disappointment by your villiage but you set out to prove yourself with your best friend geddy and take down the pirates that are out here tryna collect some relics and use their power for evil Owlboy is a very unique 12 hour long platformer like game wit ha ridiculous amount of heart put into it. There is so much charm and care put into the pixilated annimations, in the characters you meet throughout your journey both in their personality and their diolog… this is basically a platformer where youll be flying and shooting instead of jumping.. at first you have your best friend geddy with you.. you can carry him and use him to help you shoot through obstacles and shoot enemies in your way as you make it through this games different levels, doing small puzzles and throwing switches, collecting as many coins as you can to spend on upgrades.. and as the game goes on youll unlock more characters to handle other obstacles, and you can switch through these characters freely, The level design here starts out really charming but for me I liked the game less and less as it went on.. levels stopped feeling like a treat to get through and more like a chore… they just drag on forever.. all of them containing multiple boss fights which are the most frustrating but most satisfying aspect of this game.. regular enemies are challenging enough.. though there are fruits you can grab to refill your health.. in boss fights theres no fruit grabbing, you gotta beat them with the health that you have at that point… all of them taking multiple tries for me to defeat… some of them making me want to stop the game.. but at the same time fair enough to make me feel like im losing because of me.. its my fault,, I can get back in there and beat this boss and once I did it was a great feeling of relief getting to continue through the level or go onto the next… The charm of the characters and the challenge of the boss fights waiting for me is what really pulled me through this game as after about the 2nd level things started to feel like your pretty standard platforming levels… I felt the heart draining the deeper the game got and I feel it over stays its welcome a bit… my biggest issue with this game though is its current stability problems… the game crashed on me more than 5 times.. theres one spot towards the end where if you die in that spot the game crashes every time without fail, but the most heartbreaking crash was after a hard boss fight that I was on like try number 12, I finnaly beat the boss trophy pops and crash, I have to do it all over again.. having beat them before beating them again was nothing.. but it was still annoying.. Owlboy is worth pushing through its crashes and late game level design just for the heart put into its story characters and world… it’s a shame I stopped having fun playing the game.. but I never stopped enjoying it… I give Owlboy an 8/10. I wanted so much to like this game, I tried so hard. I am so sorry but sincerely I couldn't bring myself to even finish it. Beautiful graphics don't necessarily make a good game. I really can't say why I didn't like this game exactly, but it was a mix of everything. First of all: Characters, most of them are boring stereotypes which would be fine if you had something to drive my attention towards so I wouldn't care about that too much. Then the game-play; it felt bland, boring, just not what I expected I guess. I don't know how to fix this game, and that is what bothers me the most. Please do not think that because I didn't enjoy it, you won't. But it is true that this could have been so much more. The potential was there, it just falls way too short to be actually good. Maybe just not my cup of tea.. I can't believe how beautiful this game is !!! On top of that, the adventure is just so sweet to do. It's never boring, always things are happening and the story goes on. Characters are really well designed and there are tons of beautiful and expressive animations. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the story is also good and original. To me this is definitely the best adventure platformer of 2016.. The art is beautiful, but you may find it boring if you're used to playing action loaded games. The gameplay is a bit lacking, it's not hard, not interesting, neither is it new. it feels like it's just there to have something to do while looking at the beautiful graphics and enjoying the music.. I really loved this game. The graphics are great, the OST is one of the best I've heard in a while, and the characters are excellent. My only criticism is that I never truly felt like I was able to master the controls - it never felt 100% intuitive in the way that a game like hollow knight or transistor does.. Such a wonderful time playing this game. Like a lot of reviewers are saying, its a nostalgia trip. The controls are so delightful, the story so warm hearted. My only problem with it is kinda of short, but probably not a bad thing, it gives me the sensation of ""i want it more"".. I gave this game 3 out of ten for good reason. The game may be beautiful, but it's painful to play. Literally and figuratively. My hands hurt and the **** game-play is no fun at all. The characters blend to well into their backgrounds so much that it's often hard to see what is happening, and that just get's WORSE. When a game leaves you as angry after playing it as this did, its time to toss it in the garbage and never play it again.. Owlboy is a masterpiece. I started thinking this around 3-4 hours in. The pacing is fantastic, the environments are varied and never get stale. The story is deep enough and dialogue isn't drawn out so the action is never bogged down. There is also quite a bit of humor with the little penguin henchmen who work for the shopkeep. Had me laughing more than most games. Combat for the first few hours of the game wasn't very difficult though it was still very enjoyable and from then on it ramps up in difficulty. The gradual difficulty curve I found to be very smooth so no fight ever really felt out of place. There are zones where you can't just rush through or you will be punished for sure (enemies chase you outside of their screen). My only gripe is the ""twist"" in the very end is a bit silly and left me thinking a majority of this conflict could have been resolved much earlier if the characters would have communicated better. Great game, I played through it in one day which is very uncommon for me. The last game I spent a whole Sunday playing was Breath of the Wild and before that... who knows.. A nice platformer with fun flying mechanics. The graphics looks nice and the sound is also good. But I had the feeling that the story could have been deeper and more characters could have been further developed throughout the game. Other than that, I recommend this title.. Owlboy has a gentle story (I mean boring)! But there is something make me disappointed. The graphics were made to be pixelated, but there is no Changing Resolution Option for big Monitor. Game-play is just normal and poor from start to end. It does not have much tool, skill or ability to mesh with. You know... I've just play the game once and do not want to replay it anymore.. A gorgeous nod to the 16 bit era of games. Fun Platformer that made me smile. the 8bit track is amazing and adds to the gameplay. Story was interesting enough to keep my attention. Could of used more variety in level design and enemies. I played this on PC and finished within 8-9 hours. You should definitely pick this up if you grew up in the 90s and need a hit of nostalgia or if you just enjoy great gaming.. TIER 3 + Simply and obviously beautiful, with a unique world and style. ? Simple mechanics that are serviceable but don't feel particularly well-executed or fun. - Severe lack of compelling gameplay, short, and with a lot of tedious elements. - Massive focus on collectibles, but doesn't make back-tracking easy a lot of the time.. Wonderful game with a beautiful nostalgic look. If you enjoy games like Fez and Shovel Knight you'll love this game! I wish there were a map, that's my only gripe about this game. Besides that, it's a great game. Very relaxing and enjoyable.. Unforgettable adventure and will definetely remain a cult classic. Graphically, it's the best looking hi-bit game to date. It's gorgeous and it's soundtrack really fits it's visuals both in in terms of setting an atmosphere for the gorgeous world and in quality. Gameplay : Flying is extremely fun, level design fits the gameplay and is not cheap at all. For a metroidvania, there really isn't that much exploration but it's nonetheless fun to explore. It's the really open ended levels that stand out. There are usually lots of ways to tackle a screen, at certain places your path is blocked by enemies and at others by dangerous stage hazards like thorns. You decide how you will overcome the screen. The friend mechanic is really good and fun to use. Quickly shifting between friends and dashing across the screen because your character's pretty fast can be really fun.. Pixel art gem, but mechanically and dynamically so un-intuitive, cumbersome and clumsy, it just cannot work for me ever. I will always put gameplay first and unfortunately among those amazing animations, parallaxes and vistas, there wasn't much of that fun and enjoyable gameplay to be found.. Beautifully drawn pixel art style and great soundtrack. A likable cast of characters give the story surprising emotional depth. Gameplay is solid though a bit short. The game feels hand crafted, lots of work and attention to detail went into it.. ""testuser-1"" has been spent making this game visually gorgeous, with an impeccable pixel art design. Mechanically, it's OK too - solid controls on offer with varied and somewhat unique ideas. The problem is the game forgets to be the one thing any game NEEDS to be at its' core to be a success - and that is actually fun to play. Too many levels are the same thing - pick up a friend, shoot a few things or whatever, and solve puzzles. The combat barely ever changes, and the puzzles all seem samey with each stage having one puzzle that sets it out, but you then do that like ten times in the space of fifteen minutes. Everything just feels far too confined - there's only one way to do anything in the whole game, and you do it over and over again. It reminds me strongly at the faults in Final Fantasy 13 - one massive, visually impressive corridor that you trundle along doing the same things time and time again.. Highly overrated. I signed up for a metacritic account just to review overhyped game. Everybody seems to rave about it, but as someone who's played video games for 30 years, aside from pretty pixel art graphics,I find that the game has twitchy, annoying controls, a big, empty world to explore, overly easy and boring puzzles, a lackluster upgrade system, unengaging characters, and horribly inconsistent difficulty that ranges from a walk in the park to frustrating as hell. After breezing through the first 80% of the game, I found the last couple areas of the game suddenly no longer give any health powerups, and there are a few sections that are downright irritating. There's no sense of wonder in exploring the game's world like you'd find in any Metroid/Castlevania style game. Oooh, I can collect coins. Wheee. The only reason I'm giving this game even a 5 is because the graphics and especially music are superb. If you like exploration games, this isn't for you. If you like even challenge, stay clear of this game. If you like tight, precise controls, forget it. I was highly disappointed with this title.. Owl Boy is great looking (if you appreciate pixel art), you can see a lot of effort went into this side of the game. The story is fine with an minimalist style and some good characters. As a platform game Owl Boy requires very little skill or brain power to sus out the few puzzles or traverse the levels. Owl Boy is great if you don#t want to think too much about what you are doing. Great looking, good story, not hard enough for my liking. I prefer both Unepic and Ori but worth a look.. PROS: -Great characters and story -Nice art style and charming tone. -Great boss fights. Seriously, some of the most fun boss fights I have had in a long time. OKS!: -Your 3 ""weapons"" that are acually people you carry aren't as interesting or game changing ast hey could have been. You have a pistol, a shotgun, and a guy who can sling you across obstacles. The sling guy is utilized well in boss fights but in the levels not so much. -A few times I questioned the design choices for instance in one scene you are riding something (not gonna give it away) and you control the vehicle only using up and down but the camera angle keeps changing and the controls don't so you are constantly having to readjust mentally. It was a small part but eh, I didn't care for it. -7 hours long. I like that personally but just something I figure people should know CONS!: -None really. Conclusion: Boss fights and the charm of the characters and story really drive it home for me and make the game great even if I have criticisms.. It's too short, the sense of exploration you get early on is quickly canned, the side characters are very underdone, and the story is a bit weak in a lot of places (Advent especially). Nonetheless, it looks great, sounds great, plays great, has mostly good level design, and fantastic bosses. It's good, but not as great as it could have been with a bit more innovation and care.. Imagine: - a Metroidvania with a straight, linear, structure - a platform without challenging screens - an adventure without puzzles - a walking simulator without a compelling story put those all together, and there you go, you have Owlboy. for the first 4/5 minutes of the game, the only thing you do is: - click space for 50/60 times - walk around one screen on the right while listening to a cliched and depressing story about the main character being a complete disaster. This game will probably appeal the same audience who likes typical Disney stories of loser-turns-hero, and/or maybe those ones who feel warm and fuzzy when they see pixelated graphics; the problem is that there are much much better games for every single genre you can frame this game to be. Owlboy fails to be anything, because it doesn't try to be be anything. It's definitely one of the most overrated games I've ever played.. I had so much fun with this game. The platforming action has the perfect pace for my taste, and I really dig the flying twist, and the art style is just lovely.. So much time and attention has been spent making this game visually gorgeous, with an impeccable pixel art design. Mechanically, it's OK too - solid controls on offer with varied and somewhat unique ideas. The problem is the game forgets to be the one thing any game NEEDS to be at its' core to be a success - and that is actually fun to play. Too many levels are the same thing - pick up a friend, shoot a few things or whatever, and solve puzzles. The combat barely ever changes, and the puzzles all seem samey with each stage having one puzzle that sets it out, but you then do that like ten times in the space of fifteen minutes. Everything just feels far too confined - there's only one way to do anything in the whole game, and you do it over and over again. It reminds me strongly at the faults in Final Fantasy 13 - one massive, visually impressive corridor that you trundle along doing the same things time and time again. It's irritating too, as I really wanted to like this title. As it stands, it's one of those that's worth a punt if it ever drops down to around a fiver at most.. Game is, overall, pretty good. The graphic style is absolutely wonderful, ut's gorgeous and a feast for the eyes. One of the best pixel arts I've seen in those last years. The main character is adorable, the story and setting very interesting. Too bad it falls short on the gameplay part. First of all, the flying mechanic isn't really great on a metroidvania. Makes exploration too simplicistic and it's not really fun overall. Should have been better with classic platform mechanics... but, well, he's an owlboy, after all. Keyboard controls are thight and responsive, and THANK GOD you can rebind every single key, a feature too often overlooked by bad games with terrible UIs, but there are too many actions bound to a single key. The right mouse click can: grab something, let you fall from flying, use/read... which means that you'll often fall by mistake or do the wrong action by mistake. It's really, really annoying. Why not allow us to bind those actions to different keys? Combat is meh. Shooting isn't very precise and the ""spin"" attack is horrible: no range, too much inertia. Basically unusable. Also, why the throw trajectory is different from the actual throw? It's dumb. The cutscenes. Oh god. Probably the worst flaw. They interrupt the gameplay CONSTANTLY and they often last too long without adding any meaningful information. Let me play, goddammit, stop interrupting me! Overall a pretty decent game who fall short on stupid, easily avoidable, issues. I really hope for a sequel to fix the problems.. Owlboy is a nice little game. It has a good story, focused on friendship and simple genuine values. It will make you smile and sometimes get a little emotional. The music is very good, almost one of the best sides of the game. The game itself is rather simple, gameplay wise there isn't really much to praise, it doesn't have any personalization/rpg elements that, in my opinion, would have greatly improved the game. The graphics are for nostalgic pixel lovers. Honestly I think they are terrible, there is nothing attractive there and are purposely forced to look like a game from 30 years ago. There are better indie (and non indie) platform games that managed to create awesome graphics (Inside, Limbo, Ori and the B.F., Child of Light, etc.) on a 2D gameplay. For me not really worth the price.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game plays well and is mechanically consistent, and the graphics are superb. The main problem with this game is the action is stopped far too much to watch boring dialogue and in-game cut-scenes. The game holds your hand too much, and it is too linear. There's a lot of running to new locations killing some enemies on the way, then stopping to watch boring cut-scene, repeat over and over.. There are cool boss fights, but they're not exciting enough to merit all of the forced dialogue you have to slog through. The story is alright but the characters are not interesting. There's too much story and not enough actual game. The developer designed a game for people that like story-driven experiences with minimal effort to complete. Owlboy is exactly what I do not want my 2D games to play like, too easy and boring. If you grew up on Nes/Snes/Genesis games, and you like games like Super Metroid and Castlevania: SOTN, chances are you're gonna be bored. It looks pretty, and some people (casual gamers) are going to love it _because_ it's easy and hand-held, but I personally want to play games, not watch them.. Very well made story driven adventure game. Whether the game is at full price or on sale snatch it up and give it a run. Recommended to those that could use an old school type game in a modernized package.. The individual elements of the game are well done, but ultimately the game just isn't very fun. There are maybe two spots that feel legitimately challenging, one stretch which is frustratingly annoying (due to fighting with the controls rather than demonstrating a mastery of them to overcome the challenge) and the rest which is ultimately just moving from point A to point B. One of the things that interested me at the outset was the idea that you carry a companion with a weapon instead of using one yourself. The mechanic ends up underutilized and generally plays as if you just carried a weapon yourself. It might have been cool if companions had health and could fend for themselves or they couldn't just teleport to your location or you couldn't switch between them so easily. Anything to make the experience more than just swapping through an equipped weapon. But as it's implemented, the companions have little character and end up just feeling like weapons that talk and occasionally leave your inventory. The pixel art is well done. The music is very well made but occasionally feels off and sets the wrong feeling for the scene. Overall, not bad, but not great. Not worth the $25 sticker price in my opinion.. I really wanted to like this game. I remember loving The Legend of Zelda and Metroid and I hoped it would be a similar experience, but it’s not. In my opinion, Owlboy barely qualifies as a game. It feels more like an interactive story that leads you around by the nose through various set pieces. I’m about half-way through and there's been no more than one or two fun scenes. It’s too easy –as an example, it’s almost impossible to take a wrong turn. When you’re finished with an area the game often literally closes a door behind you as if to say there's nothing you missed, just keep moving – way to kill the mystery. The puzzles are simple and the clues to solving them are telegraphed. The retro Art and Music are great but the gameplay is boring.. Unfortunately, Owlboy didn't deliver as much as I hoped it would based on the hype. I have completed the game, including collecting the three owl medallions. My verdict? The graphics are definitely top class, but otherwise the game has many issues. For starters, let's talk about stability. The game crashed twice, and soft-locked once... For a game that lasts around 10 hours to complete all the way through, that's not very good. The steam achievements are also buggy, locking me out of tasks that I clearly completed. Now, the controls. While I can't comment on the game when played with a controller, I can s","the storyline was easy to follow yet intriguing, and the gameplay was satisfactory . the challenging boss fights provided a thrilling experience, and overall, i had a lot of fun with this game . it harkens back to the golden days of getting cosy and playing ."
648.The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition,"Amazing game. I’m late to the party but I decided to play this before I got to the sequel and I have no idea how this game escaped me for so long. Brilliant philosophical game that challenges your mind with not only its puzzles, but its narrative as well. Fantastic soundtrack to go along with it too! Don’t miss out if you haven’t played it yet. 9/10, but I’m giving it a 10/10to bump that Metacritic score up more, it deserves it!. Only by playing this game can you feel what I would like to describe about it, something like living in yourself in a video game, without knowing if it is you, learning to think thoughts for others already thought. Genius made art.. Dont buy it,it has the worst options i have ever seen,15 minutes in and im already motion sicked. What a pity,i wanted so bad to play it. One of my favorite games of all time - the philosophical story and puzzles were an absolute thrill.. Surprisingly awesome puzzle game, and not easy. Some levels seem impossible & then when you nail it it's really satisfying. Totally different but reminds me of the Swapper in terms of being a series of brain benders. Highly recommend. Congratulations to the developers and writers. To me this is the best game ever, hands down, second to none (and I been playing videgames for a while, born in 1973). I loved the puzzles, they are interesting and put your brain to work. I loved even more, the story and how you interact with the other ""characters"" in the game. So many major themes in human history, so many beautiful remarks -as the Barnum/Forer effect when they evaluate your profile- pure gold. And there is more to it, graphics are really nice and the sound track is also excellent. My kid played the game alone and he did not like it at first (because he was skipping all the reading parts), then we played together and he loved the game too. I had many many hours of pure fun with this master piece. My only regret- I played on PS4 and there is no VR version for consoles.. Starts great but soul crushingly repetitive and goes on for too long with too little reward. I could only make it halfway through before I found I was forcing myself to go on. Deleted it shortly after that. Maybe put something more interesting in there in between the puzzles or something? Because it felt like never ending tedium. Actually, yeah that's exactly what it is. soul crushing, never-ending, repetitive as all hell tedium.. One of the best games I have ever played. The puzzle are really clever, and the philosophy behind it is incredible.. An amazing game that challenges the player in both traditional and non-traditional ways. Be prepared for all around logical gameplay. The music, design, and overall atmosphere are terrific and honestly I can state this is one of my favorite games of all time.. Best puzzle game, period. It is brilliant, well designed, and never gets boring. Your intelligence and patience will be tested in this game. It's the best puzzler since Portal 2 in my opinion.. The Talos Principle is a very engaging game that respects the intelligence of the player. Pros: Great puzzles that build off of previous knowledge, Thought provoking narrative, Rewarding pay off for committed players, Quality of life options Cons: 100% Completion has some unfair challenges, some of the dialogue is reiterative, Early puzzles were too easy There are three worlds each with sub-areas containing puzzle rooms. Puzzles are good, a little too easy at first but ramp to difficult puzzles with many different interacting pieces. These were the most enthralling to me. Where all the rules were understood and smart solutions had to be found. This was not the case with the extra stars that are hidden in each sub-area, while some of the realizations to get these are amazing, more than a few felt unfair and not sign posted well enough. If puzzles were all that there was to this game I think it would be a solid game, but there is another aspect that this game does well, a narrative. I never would have expected the people who make Serious Sam to be good at writing a deeply person exploration of the player's feelings towards humanity. While the dialogue can range from thought provoking to esoteric, it all fits within the narrative, and holds significant weight. The topics covered are done well, for the most part, so that almost every person who plays this game can understand. I have some minor gripes with this game, but this is outweighed by what it does correctly. I think this is a great puzzle game for those who enjoy that experience, and I am anticipating the sequel that has been announced. More could have been done with the project and there is still so much potential.. An incredibly fun puzzle game that makes you think in more ways than one! I found myself having a great time throughout this entire game, even during incredibly difficult trials. The story of the game was also incredibly interesting as well! Highly recommend!. Absolutely one of the best games ever made. And certainly best in terms of story. Sure, there are many superb games out there. But what other game could possibly bring you intellectual feast of this level? What other game could really give you ""something"" to your real life instead of being just another product to consume? This is just what games are really about (or should be). A gem... no - opus magnum.. A very clever game with top-notch puzzle gameplay and a fantastic presentation and concept. Almost deserves a 10/10, but ultimately it's not super inventive with the gameplay (Braid is an example of super inventive).. A special puzzle game that stays in your mind long after you have finished it. I've played through the main game 3 times now and beaten it twice. I also enjoyed the dlc's extra hard difficulty. An excellent game when you are in the puzzle mood. I feel like this game will be remembered as one of the best puzzle games in gaming history.. This game hooked me immediately, but unfortunately by the end of the game this had transitioned into boredom and resentment. The graphics are excellent and the environments are visually immersive just to walk around. On the downside, some of the levels have limited options for exploration. The gameplay and story are where this became a massive love/hate relationship between myself and the game. I absolutely loved the existential themes and philosophical questioning of areas such as morals, reasoning and consciousness, and it is these that give the game three stars for me. The two missing stars are a result of the gameplay, which perhaps ultimately suffered from a lack of pacing. The sheer volume of puzzles at first makes the game look heavy in content, yet the repetitiveness and frustration to be found within make me wish there was actually less content. The puzzles became tedious for me around halfway through the game, and I spent the last quarter of them looking up online video demonstrations just to speed up my progress through the game so I could find the ending. POTENTIAL SPOILERS: The ending/s is where I was also very disappointed. Two options are obvious, but my biggest gripe was that the game restarted after I witnessed one ending, meaning I'd have to replay the entire game to watch a different ending. Again, thank God for online videos, but I had no motivation to replay any of the game, and when I discovered the expansion looked to be more of the same, I decided to give that a miss, too. If you're a die-hard puzzle fan with even a slight interest in philosophy, then this game could be 5 stars for you. The concepts and visuals are excellent, but the repetition and monotony spoiled the experience for me somewhat. Also, I shopped around and got it for less than £15.. Intricate puzzles, an interesting narrative exploring philosophical and religious questions, a beautiful world desgin and an enchanting soundtrack make The Talos Prinicple a masterpiece.. The Talos Principle is a story driven first person puzzle game that tasks the player with completing a series of challenges in order to collect the puzzle pieces required to progress through the game. The puzzles themselves, obviously the most important element in this genre, are (with a couple of exceptions) more logical than many other similar titles I’ve played but by about the half-way point virtually all the new elements had been introduced and they started to become a little repetitive. Fortunately the central story, which I won’t spoil here, is interesting and told in a non-intrusive way that allows the player to delve as into it as much or as little as they want and this helped keep me playing to the end when I might have otherwise given up. The Talos principle is certainly no Portal beater but if you’re a fan of the puzzle genre this is well worth checking out.. Super mind f**uc**ker. I went straight to options and turned the brightness up to give it more daylight feel and helped with the motion feel. Turned the music down to one notch. Vibration OFF! This game is up there with Portal 2. I do like the outside atmosphere, makes me feel like I'm outside enjoying a sunny day, while I'm locked in a dark room. Buy this game, the price is more than good. PS4 version is very adequate.. The graphics are nothing special, and as Portal seems to be often referenced in previous reviews, I'd say that game (even on an older console) looked much better than this one. The booming god voice left me cold, and the repetitive conversations with the little computer screens became quickly irritating, so I ignored that part of the game. But the puzzles I liked a lot, which I guess is the point. So, 10 out of 10 for the puzzle creators. 3 out of 10 for the rest of it (graphics, sound, story etc.). Meet those two somewhere in the middle with a 7 overall.. I enjoyed the puzzles, atmosphere, and music. I didn't focus on the story. The graphics was great. The game reminds me of portal and I would love to see more games like this.. I wasn't too sure about this game, even after seeing trailers, but after 5 minutes I was convinced that this game would have me hooked. My first playing session I had my eyes glued to the screen, intrigued with the art style, the philosophical undertones, and the mystery that lay waiting for me. Each puzzle feels unique and rewarding, and the amazing soundtrack wraps it all up in a bow.. Do you have some time? Are you a bit bend towards the philsophical in the first place? And do you like games and/or fables? If you have two of the three, then pick this up. If you have three of the three, you're already behind the curve. (As I was). There is still time to catch up hah. Long I wait. Looking for the thought-provoking bits... Here is one. You don't play this, you experience it. But only if you have eyes to see and ears to hear.. I made an account on this site just to say that this game is awesome :) I introduced two of my friends to it, and they loved it as well. It has great scenery, great story, music, and whenever you pass a hard puzzle, you get a feeling of self-content.. There does not seem to be any real storyline and the puzzles are repetitive. I lost interest after a few hours. If they had more story (like the Portal games) I would have given a higher rating. Also: I would have preferred story with some animation and sound, rather than reading everything.. God I honestly don't know what to say about this game, all I can say is its one of my favourite games of all time and is truly worth a 10. The puzzles as well as the story and philosohpy involved are all very intriguing and it is a wonderful experience. Would HIGHLY recommend.. One of my favorite games. Love the puzzles, story, atmosphere. It's very well done. If you enjoyed Portal, this is a must. I don't platinum very many games, but this is one I am working on.. One of the best games I have played in a long while. It is difficult to comment on this game without spoiling some parts of it, but rest assured, your money would be well spent on this first person puzzle. The story is great. Puzzles are great and progressively more difficult. Controls work like a charm. Just play it.... This is a game of the Mind and the Spirit. Even though I'm indisposed by its strongly transhuman agenda of reducing consciousness to a machine, it is the richest game I have ever played in terms of philosophical and mind-expanding insights. If you've graduated in the social sciences or any branch of philosophy, you will LOVE this game. The sense of Mystery and Discovery is there. It's been a while since a game really registered on an emotional level ; this one will keep you thinking on it far after you've shut the console. A reflexion on humanity, consciousness, meaning, existence - with FANTASTIC graphics set in old civilizations. BUY IT!. The Talos Principle is one of the finest puzzle games that I've played. From the first few moments I knew I was onto something special and I found the game only improved as I progressed. I really value the simple formula that Croteam give the gamer in terms of the 'tools' needed to tackle each puzzle. The puzzles themselves are beautifully crafted and will provide many a headscratching moment, but as they get progressively more difficult, so does the sense of achievement when you crack them - the learning curve in this game is excellently judged. Croteam place a lot of faith in the gamer in that the storyline isnt fed through a series of cutscenes at predetermined checkpoints; rather, the gamer must dig into the depths of the archives to unravel the many philosophical, religious and human layers of the plot. This is by no means a requirement to finish the game, but I found the experience all the more enriching for doing so. Thanks to games like Diablo and Tomb Raider I'm the type that must painstakingly collect everything there is to collect, so rooting through the archives was enjoyable for me. I can apprieciate, however, that this will not suit everyone and could be deemed quite tedious if the plot doesnt grab you straight away. Everything else I have to say will only serve as spoilers so i'll leave it there, but I just want to reiterate what a beautiful, rewarding game this is (archives or not). I cannot recommend it highly enough for the gameplay, environment and storyline, but at the very least it is an excellent brain training tool for problem solving and logic.. This game made me to register an account and come here to write that I highly recommend it. This is not a review I still have the excitement of playing it (just finished Road to Gehenna dlc) . It would be a straight 10/10 but some puzzles at the end especially on the dlc are impossible to beat even for the most experienced puzzle gamer. Portal series difficulty is nothing compared to Talos. Even a robot can't do it without help. Dear Croteam thank you for this amazing game.. You like the puzzles at first, but the poor graphics and background music makes it hard to play for few hours. The gaming sessions are shoert as you get easily bored. Original concept tho.. Great game. Well generated effective enviroments and a good narrative behind it. The puzzles are challenging and don't normally require highly skilled use of the controller once you worked out how to do it. So this should suit a wide variety of users with different skill levels. In summary a great game, highly recommended!. The game is alright but there is no need to be giving it 10/10. To be honest I found the game got quite boring after a while of playing. Different people have different opinions though -_-. One of the best games I've ever played. Unfortunately, everything is a spoiler, so I'm going to skip the awesome story, music and atmosphere and will concentrate on the technical state of the game on the PS4. I've played both PC and PS4 version of the game for more than 100 hours. The good news is - the PS4 version is on par with details and resolution with the PC version, it also has a decent amount of AA and not the most terrible FOV as well. The bad news - the PS4's framerate needs improvement badly. I hope this get addressed. Other than that - I have no issues whatsoever. In summary, I'd like to say something which is more likely directed towards the developers instead of the game, but since I consider it very important in this day and age, I'd like to point it out. The game and the expansion are now sold for less than $50. Very good price for the content IMO. And lastly, the game was NOT available for preorder which is a huge point earned in my eyes by Croteam. It revived that long forgotten sense than not everything is about the money. Keep up the great work! Strongly recommended!. The game so awesome and beautiful graphics, game-play is different from other puzzle game with unbeatable features, thanks for giving an open world feature and thanks Croteam for that.. Nothing to say about this game. I had played the PC version. But didn't play the Deluxe edition. I played the deluxe on PS4 and it felt awesome. The sound and graphics of the game is just awesome . This is the only puzzle game I've ever played which gives me to explore its huge world. Which gives me to roam freely in the open world. Which drives me deep inside the story. Really Fantastic. AWESOME. as the best puzzle game I've ever played and as a game from my favorite game developer Croteam which develops my favorite FPS game Serious Sam , I will give it a 10/10.. The game has really great gameplay, great graphics and a interesting Story. But I noticed some performance issues which hopefully will be fixed. Also the DLC is included which is nice.","brilliant philosophical game that challenges your mind with not only its puzzles, but its narrative as well . to me this is the best game ever, hands down, second to none . started great but soul crushingly repetitive and goes on for too long with too little reward ."
649.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam,"A great Vietnam-themed expansion to ""Bad Company 2"". Some new weapons and modes were great additions. However, the satisfying of unlocking of them is gone since everything is available from the start. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.8 out of 10.. There are more planes in the ocean than submarines in the sky %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%. One of the best Games of the Series and a true cornerstone to the Battlefield Franchise! Buy!. I love BC2, but I could have lived without this expansion. Its more maps and more guns, and its worth the money but I dont care for the guns or the maps. So this was a waste of money for me personally.. Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam is the only big expansion released for Bad Company 2 and is priced at 800 Microsoft Points. The expansion includes new achievements, new weapons, new vehicles, new maps and a new era, plus a flamethrower. Vietnam has a grainy look to it, but it fits the Vietnam setting. With the expansion you'll find some classic Vietnam weapons like the M16A1, AK-47, M40A1, SVD and M60. A couple of the weapons you'll find here were also in the base Bad Company 2, like the M60, 870 MCS, M60 and Uzi, however, they are not just copies, they have new looks as well as modified stats to fit Vietnam's new damage model. And yes, in Vietnam, the weapon damage has been increased, in just about everything except the snipers which still require a headshot to kill (and are still overpowered as hell in hardcore). To fit with the Vietnam setting, some specs like pretty much all the sights except the 12X scope, and the coaxial LMG(replaced with a coazial flamethrower) have been removed. The Flamethrower (primary weapon) is really good and seems to be balanced, and lets you torch your enemies and your surroundings. The new vehicles are pretty basic, couple jeeps, couple tanks, couple helicopers (all of which have much weaker armour than in the base game), and the game includes 5 maps, all of which are available for use in all game modes. Now, consider all of this for $10, then consider the $15 COD maps maps (for 5 maps, some of which are reused from previous titles). Is Bad Company 2 Vietnam worth it? 5 maps, almost 10 new vehicles, about 15 new weapons, and the whole new era, absolutely. If you enjoyed Bad Company 2, so long as you don't have a problem with Vietnam, you should definitely take 10 of those 15 bucks you were going to spend on the new COD maps and get some more Bad Company 2 content for a much better deal.. I don't know why an expansion has to mean less weapons and less new stuff. It's nothing impressive. It's funny but DICE could have done it better. The Vietnam atmosphere is great anyways... but it has nothing to do with his big brother ""Bad Company 2"". This expansion is fine, but I expected much more from Battlefield.. Bad Company 2 takes the FPS genre and brings some refreshing changes into the mix, especially with its multiplayer component. The campaign is fun, the story isn't fantastic but there are some interesting sections to play through and the characters have some mildly amusing dialogue, although not as much as the first game. The online multiplayer is where this game really impresses. There are only 3 modes, squad death match is where 4 teams of 4 players go around the map and try to reach 40 kills before any other. Rush involves one team of 12 attempting to destroy two points before advancing, up to five times depending on the map, and doing so again. Conquest is the classic Battlefield game type where 12v12 teams attempt to gain control of flags and elimate all enemy respawn tickets (250 each I think); the more flags you hold, the easier is it to deplete their tickets. There are four combat classes, assault where you get access to many assault rifles, and have the ability to resupply comrades with ammunition to earn extra points. Engineer has access to silenced SMGs and RPGs, as well as the ability to repair friendly vehicles, or hi-jacked enemy ones. The Medic class can revive recently killed team mates, as well as supply health packs to those who have been badly wounded in a gunfight; this class can use machine guns. The Recon class has access to sniper rifles, and can stay back from the main fight a spot enemies (all players can spot, but recon class can spot from a distance and pick off enemies). Recon can call in mortar strikes on a position. The maps are huge and destructible, virtually every building and tree can be razed to the ground and huge craters appear in the ground where mortar fire rains down. You can play with 4-squad mates, whom you can chat with, and you can respawn on them if they're in trouble or safe, depending on how daring you are. Respawning is the best of any online shooter, you only get killed on spawning if you spawn on a squadmate in imminent danger. You can spawn quite safely in the team's base. Vehicles play a huge part, with different kinds of choppers and tanks and others to take the attack to the enemies. The guns looks and sound fantastic, and with the volume turned up and 'War Tapes' sound setting on, it really immerses you into a proper battle. Be warned, if you're used to playing Call of Duty, there is a steep learning curve to get used to the heavier feel of the game, but once you get through it, there is no game better at making you feel like part of a battle or part of a team. It's the best online shooter out there, so give it a go.. Overall: 9/10 This is a sick game people. If you are as tired as i am playing cod and are looking for something fresh try out bc2. In my opinion by far better than the call of duty series anyways.. Out of this great multiplayer expansion, I lament only two things: Lack of weapons and the Huey has the armor of a soda can. Maps are good, but Cao Son Temple and Phu Bai Valley are camper's paradise. The lack of weapons really hurt this game, and if there were even just two more weapons in each class, and you had to unlock them, this would easily be a 10. But Hill 137, however, is.... I can't even describe how gorgeous and amazing this map is. If you complain about PBR boats, your just sitting out in the open! And, one final word and complaint. The Huey. Its powerful, but it gets shot down WAY to easily. The Blackhawk in BC2 never got shot down this easily... I was expecting some ass-kicking missle launching armored death! But, I get a poorly armored, Powerful, But only the missles are good. I can't recall being more disappointed in a gameplay feature. If my two complaints were solved, this would be 2985492845984305893284590284390532905809283290523 googloplex times 3 million. Vietnam is just like the crappy multiplayer from the regular game, only this is with crappier older guns. It's barely playable for me. I played it for achievements. STRICTLY achievements.. Well worth the money, especially when compared to the garbage cod usually comes out with. The overall expirience is well balanced and this provides a nice change of pace from the original bfbc 2.. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was not a game I use to like because Modern Warfare 2 was my favourite game, but when I got Black Ops I was getting tired of Call of Duty. Now that I played the game it is my Call of Duty Killer. The online is fantastic and with Vietnam is just outstanding, Vietnam is a new and fresh experience with new weapons from the Vietnam era which has totally balanced the classes. The maps are well designed and I have discovered no bugs or glitches on 360 or even PC, but some say they have and I've never found any or they were patched up. The environments are nice and big, no campers, boosters won't survive thanks to the destructible environments which change the map's experience so that you feel it's not just the same thing over and over. But will it last? The expansion pack contains 5 maps and in my opinion it's not enough, sure its worth 1200 Microsoft Points (Â£10/$15 on PSN or PC). A good price, better then Black Ops First strike. But if your going to buy it for the first time in 2011 then you'll have a blast! But if you don't like old shooter types then you shouldn't buy it. But BattleField 3 won't be out for quite some time until the Beta comes out on September. But this expansion pack is going to last a lifetime, it has some bad sides but minor ones. But if your bored of Call of Duty and need a new FPS, you have bought the right game. A must buy.. Very solid DLC. Each class gets 3 new weapons, plus the M2 Flamethrower is available for all classes. New maps, new vehicles, and music from the period blasting from vehicle speakers. Generally, this expansion pack is lighter on vehicle combat than the core game, which is either good or bad depending on what you want in a Battlefield experience. Operation Hastings and Phu Bai Valley should have enough vehicles to keep you happy, whereas Kao Son Temple, Hill 137, and Vantage Point play out as more of an infantry meatgrinder.. Best DLC of last year. Easily worth the 1200MS points. More of Battlefield's unique brand of strategy and mayhem. The graphics seem to look better than in the original game. The sounds and soundtrack are fantastic. 5 maps, of which two are outstanding (only one poor one in my opinion). If you like Battlefield get this now.. I am disappointed, in this expansion. Only 4 maps (with many glitch spots on each) and very limited weapons (3 per class) left me wanting more. The only difference between this and the (much better) game is the lack of optics. I say pass unless you have achieved everything you want in the original game.. Battlefield Bad Company series is my second favourite shooter behind Gears of War, and this add on pretty good. However the Vietnam setting and weaponry is so frustrating at times, as all the foliage has turned it into a campers paradise. Also the US soldiers are far more heavily armed than the N.V.A, and leveling up of weapons is a mystery! If it was 800 points then I would have given it an eight, but there isn't enough for me to justify buying it for 1200 points. Good but not great, went back to playing the normal Bad Company multiplayer after a few days.. I have been playing battlefield since 1942 came out and since then the franchise has lost a bit of its luster in my eyes. Battlefield 2142 was a sham and battlefield 2 had an extremely short lifespan thanks to COD 4 (online multiplayer wise). Even Battlefield BFBC2 felt a bit rehashed. With Vietnam all my angst has been washed away. I have a blast every time I play. From Fortunate Son blasting from the choppers to the dirt on my M-16 this game gets the Vietnam atmosphere spot on. I would have thought that having everything unlocked from the get-go and having no attachments would take away from the joy, but it does nothing but enhance it. With downgraded weaponry, fire discipline becomes paramount and decides who wins a firefight, not who has unlocked the better scope and the upgraded ammo. The maps are fun even after hours of playing them over and over. The Hill ### (forgot which 3 numbers go there) map blew me away and by far is the best I've played in any battlefield game to date.. Fantastic maps, great atmosphere, and authentic battle chatter on each side make for one great expansion that is not to be missed. Worth every penny! I just wish you could call in napalm strikes! Maybe for Bad Company 3? Close air support, A10's and such? Wink, wink, nudge, nudge;). Just received the game for X-mas. I am a long time gamer since the start of gaming, seen it all. Played a bit of the campaign but mostly on X-box live. Lets start with the graphics that everybody is saying so great. My TV is 53"" 6 year old HD projection (witch weren't that great to start with) so the graphics look like sh** and I have trouble seeing enemies and tanks even close up some times, you have to look for motion for something to stand out. Especially with all the constant smoke and dust obscuring visibility. You shoot an enemy up and a cloud of smoke obstructs further aiming. Not knowing where your enemies are is very realistic but it seems like most of the times you die you never see it coming, sometime the radar will light up enemies when they are shooting at you but allot of times it doesn't which is very frustrating because you can't rely on it. They are trying to take 3D life where you have your 6 senses working 360 degrees and peripheral vision - and then translate it to 2D which doesn't work. They have to give you alternate senses to rely on to replace the ones lost. Allot of times it ends up being just a free fraul off killing and deaths unless you are on a drastically winning team or are on a private chat with 3 other friends to coordinate attacks and expose enemies by sacrificing your own. The ability to respawn on your own personal and bases makes dying only a minor inconvenience adding to the free fraul. In conquest respawning only at home base would solve this plus being made to take bases in order and the game ending when you posses all the bases would eliminate the craziness and late game home base blood baths creating a straight forward goal based battle. The next biggest frustration with the game is getting stuck on you surroundings either waking or driving. When walking anything over 6 inches tall (step height) stops you dead forcing you to jump as well as hills you think you should be able to climb up stop you and you sit there jumping like an idiot trying to get up. You will end up pulling your hair out because of this. When driving a tank you get stuck on almost everything. There is not much that can stop a tank in real life but when you get stuck on a wooden fence or building it's frustrating. Some things come down easy an others do not - very frustrating You should be able to flatten the grass/bamboo/tin huts in the Vietnam version without even slowing down. Some will break with effort but by then you are dead from enemy fire that you can't locate it's origin . Next is the weapons capabilities, as you build rand they give you more weapons not necessarily better ones. As you scroll thought the list of weapons you can't compare them directly, you find two you like at opposite ends of the list and by the time you scroll from one to the other you can't hardly remember where the bar was - to solve this give the power / accuracy / range bars a numerical value. As well the ability to only use one spec in each of the three spec columns is a piss off. You put hundreds of hours into the game to earn this stuff and only get to use 3. They make you choose between armor or ammo, targeting systems or speedy reloading **** feels like all the time and progress is futile. You should be able to use them all, you put the time in you reap the benefits. If it gives you to much of an advantage make them harder to get or set up games where your entrance depends on ability. Low rank players play with other low rankers ect... Another thing that is frustrating is the aiming ability, whenever you hit the button it seems like I am always pointing at the enemies feet. If you set the sensitivity low it moves to slow and you end up dead, too fast and you over shoot the target every time, I can't seem to find a happy middle ground. Always liked some sort of mild auto aiming. Lastly the gun sights projected out in front of you whether walking or driving are either white or lighted red or blue. The white being the worst, you have a hard time seeing them especially when going though like back ground colours or smoke. Half the time you can't tell where you are aiming. The 4x red dot scope is a great spec but you have to pass up other good specs to use it. I should have waited for version 3. I hope they address all the problems with #2 and fire all their testers and hire some that know what they are doing and have some balls to say that the game isn't ready yet!â. Total waste of money. If I could I would return the game in two seconds. I love BF BC2, but this is a whack expansion. The games never last long enough to have fun, the maps are small, chopper gets shot down way to quickly to have any fun. Save your money for Battlefield 3, this game is enjoyable for about 1 week and then it just gets frustrating to play.. Great game, great expansion. If you have ever played 1942 you will love this. Has a really classic battlefield feel to it mixed with BFBC2, the maps are great too. Loads of authentic music which adds real character, and the gun skins are ten times better than black ops. Well worth the 10quid or so to add hours more playability to battlefield a must buy for all BFBC2 fans!. Graphics: 10 - Same BC2 graphics that are amazing and destructible. They eat up all the system resources at 720p and deserve nothing less than a 10. Playability: 10 - Easily playable, Control scheme is nice, and everything works as intended. Sounds: 10 - Amazing guns sounds, and now 40 Vietnam era songs that play in vehicles. Value: 9 - You get 4 (5 with the community challenge) large maps, 15 new guns, 6 new vehicles, 40 songs, Vietnam settings, and all for $15. Replayability: 9 - Everything seems perfect, my only gripe is that once ingame, you feel like you lack weaponry. Most weapons are unlocked from the start, and you only get about 3 choices with each class (excluding allkits). There is only the RPG, no M72 Law, and you can't fire smoke grenades (a dire need on a couple maps for rush). Conclusion: 9.4 - Since this a multilayer only expansion, the total score is heavily based on the value and replayability. I have seen very few expansions that are this good and are this cheap.. Where the onslaught expansion failed to bring long lasting fun and value, Vietnam more than makes up for it. You can enjoy a fully new multiplayer experience with realistic, original and authentic radio voices and music as well as be stunned by the new maps (with a new one promised very soon by DICE). If you were a massive fan of the multiplayer of BC2, then this is highly recommended as the experience is the same at heart yet feels like something completely new - and the end product is amazing! If however, you are a CoD regular, and never quite understood Bad company 2, then save your money for the later to be released ""black ops map packs"" being released next year. In conclusion, it is definitely better value for money than onslaught, the new maps are simply stunning, the battlefield feeling is still there but brought into a new package","""Bad Company 2: Vietnam"" is the only big expansion released for the game . it includes new achievements, new weapons, new vehicles, new maps and a new era . the game includes 5 maps, all of which are available for use in all game modes ."
65.Sid Meier's Civilization II,"Civilization II isn’t just a game to me—it’s a portal to another world. With over a thousand hours poured into it, it has become more than entertainment; it’s a cornerstone of my life and personal growth. The ability to immerse myself in building an entire civilization, shaping its history, and tackling unique challenges offers a creative freedom that remains unmatched even **** game’s system for managing cities and units is a masterpiece of design—complex, deep, and still unrivaled. Every turn feels like a blend of strategy and improvisation, where decisions ripple through centuries of gameplay, from constructing wonders to maneuvering units in the heat of conflict. That level of strategic freedom is one of the reasons why Civilization II will always stand, for me, as one of the greatest games of all time. And then there are the mods. They completely redefine the experience, adding layers of challenge, fresh scenarios, and even reshaping the original game’s boundaries. Each mod is like rediscovering something I already love but through a brand-new lens. They breathe life into a game that already feels infinite in its possibilities.More than just a game, Civilization II has been a learning tool. It’s taught me history, planning, and even patience. It shaped how I think about cultural interactions, long-term strategy, and the beauty of interconnected systems. At a time when gaming freedom often felt limited, Civilization II offered an entire universe, waiting to be explored with every new **** some, it’s just another classic title. But to me, it’s a personal milestone—an experience that goes far beyond just playing. Civilization II is, without a doubt, a timeless masterpiece and a pillar of my journey as both a player and a person.. I remember last time I played Civ II. It was late night/early morning. I opened the CD-tray, took out the Civ II CD-ROM and snapped it in half. Only way to stop playing. Ahhh, good times.. Hasn't aged well. Civ 4 is better in every way despite having countless problems.. Okay, this one is a legendary game, maybe the most influential strategy game ever. Its really a great concept **** in the first place and it is masterfully done in Civ2, from the humble start as a singular settler to the continental empires and colossal civilizations made later in the game, it is a journey that challenge the player to think about every decision, from trying to focus on diplomacy, technology or military, there are plenty of ways to make to beat the game. Also, for the time, it had good graphics and sound design, and very few bugs for a complex game. Even to this day, its my favorite Strategy game to play, one that guarentees hundreds of hours of fun, and with the current mods and customization avaliable, it makes even better to play nowadays, this is simply the kind of game that will never get old.. The game should be renamed Civilization Zombies, because the AI is ****. They will send siege units to battle your infantry, they'll suicide their army on battles they can't win, they'll build settlers while you're in the middle of taking their city. Of course to make up for it they have huge bonuses and numerous cheats, such as full map vision and walking on water. Don't get me wrong - the core game itself is excellent, and much better than the recent games. But unless you have 6 partners to play with, don't bother. When playing against the AI Civ 2 is addicting, yes, but it isn't fun. There's a difference.. The best strategy game ever, no doubt! I fellow in love with the series ever since Civ2 was released. 1. CIV2 2. Civ III 3. Civ V 4. Colonization & Civ 1. A cult classic and frequent contender in best games of all times lists. The Civilization franchise is a well know series of turn based strategy games. Civilizations 2 is considered as one of the best games in the franchise in regard to its time. You pick a nationality with appropriate leader like for example George Washington for the USA or Gandhi for India and start 4000 years before Christ with just the knowledge of roads and a settler (Rarely it can be 2 settlers and this is a mayor bonus). You are developing your society by building cities, building structures, research new inventions, taxes and warfare. It has a lot of depth as you have diplomacy, political ideologies, a satisfaction value for citizens, resources, units and a lot of tactics to chose. The mechanics are interwoven. With each new technology you have new options. Be it new units, buildings or ideologies. Of cause you also unlock follow up research options. Settlers are used to create cities or build roads and irrigate the ground. Both help your city grow and roads allow faster travel. Military units are for scouting (fog of war to uncover) and fighting. During the game you will develop a lot of different units. For the cities location is everything. Rivers are nice and there are also special resources on the map you should prioritize. You can build a lot of buildings in your city that help getting more resources or more research done per round. There are also world wonders which are extremely expensive but have great benefits. There are also ideologies which give also benefits and you should appease your citizens as they will riot if you fail them. There is of cause warfare as you can simply conquer your way to victory. I end here with this set up. The game itself is really good and addicting. You have so much options to develop your civilization and multiple win scenarios. Be it conquering all opponents, colonize Alpha Centauri or be the most develop nation at the end (There is a rating system). For each game or playthrough you have a randomly created map you can adjust for your preferences before creation like size, number of other nations or structure of the world (more oceans, more land, climate etc.). This give a lot of replay value. It is one of the strategy games you will play for hours while saying just another turn before I quit. The AI works well for its time on higher difficulty. On the lower I had no problems but I preferred larger maps which gives even with a full roaster of other nations more time to develop. I had no bugs and glitches in my playtime. Overall this is a classic and rightfully praised for its time. It still works well and I still recommend it.. This is maybe the best game I ever played, in terms of game mechanics and rules. Newer versions added more complexity and modern visuals, but all the fun was already there, game time was just right.. total classic. although outdated and superseded by civ IV it is still fan to play there is nothing to say about this game as all turn based fans out there should know about it. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 4/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 10/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 6/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay Value - 10/10 I remember buying this from a Car Boot Sale on PS1 and playing it and thinking 'what the hell is this garbage' and not playing it again for a few months. Then one day when I was bored I gave it a second chance and as soon as I understood the game it became one if my favourites. Still probably my favourite in the franchise. Any game as simple as this that can captivate a 10 year old must be pretty spectacular.. This is the game that got me into strategy games in the first place and thought me about the importance of technology and progress.. I love this game! I loved Civilization one too. I wish Sid Meier was still active! Because he is a great game designer. We are in need of him because lately all new games are crap!. When the game came out, it took up so much of my time. The repeatability was unending. Civilization series created an entire genre and is the reason for 4X games today. Even though this game is old now, it is still fun to go back and relive some battles, maps, etc.... I still play this 22 years after release. I think that says it all, really.. For a game developed in 1996 it was a real revolution. I have played many scenarios as many countries and enjoyed the game. New versions really need those strong scenarios. There were lots of wars around the world in this game.. I have just discovered the magnificence of the Civilization series as I wasn't a big fan of strategy games before I decided to give Civilization a shot. I played them briefly before, but never seemed to get into them. That was until I played Civilization II! I watched some game play footage on YouTube and bought the game immediately soon after! When I completed the tutorial given to you in the manual and started my first game, I played from 10:00pm till 4:00am! You really do keep saying ""one more turn!"" This is where that motto started! This was the start of the legacy Civilization now has! Civilization was the first game, but it didn't get deep and defined until the sequel. Yes, I am hooked! It's such a deep game and you're always learning something new each time you play! There's an immense amount of strategies you can implement and the clever AI and random elements really keep the game fresh! I recommend this game to anyone! You should give this game chance! Especially if you love board games, strategy games, RPG games or even simulation games!. Civilization II is probably the best game I have ever played. I have played it at least hundreds of hours - maybe thousands of hours. All new strategy games will always be compared to this classic masterpiece. The most current game of the series - Civilization V - has very nice graphics but it isn't as addictive as Civ II.. Flat out: One of the best computer games of all time. Great gameplay, excellent modding, outstanding 2D graphics. Civ II Multiplayer Gold is the best version (5.04). Although Brian Reynolds could have improved certain programming aspects which hinder high-level playing. For example (technical terms coming!), he assumed that no player could generate more than 32,767 science beakers per turn... which means if you earn the 32,768th beaker, your science suddenly ""drops"" to -32768 and begins counting ""up"" again!! That is because he chose to store science as a two's-complement, 16-bit variable... the most significant bit (the 16th bit) is used to indicate negative values, and 2^16 =32,768 (the binary value of the 16th bit is 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 **32768**), which means 1000000000000000 binary and -32768 in binary two's complement. So in effect, earning 1 beaker reduces your science by -65,536 !!! The pathfinding, and the programming Brian took to make the game run so well on machines that and 1,000 to 100,000 times less powerful than today's is not perfect, but has aged well. Today's games, especially including AAA+ games, have (from a customer's point of view) often not improved substantially in 20 years. Witness the debacle of September 2013's Rome II Total War, with Romans jumping off siege engines, barbarians running in circles (mosh pits? lol), and cavalry charging through pikemen. The isometric game view, the 2-D graphics, the acting (yes real humans!) and voices, and of course front and center the Gameplay. One of the true top five PC games, of any genre, of all time. And it continues to stand the Test of Time!. An excellent 4x strategy game which improved everything Civilization 1 had. Civ 2 system was then even further improved by the same development team in Alpha Centauri, yet even Civ 2 by itself offers great experience and huge replay value. I've played hundreds of campaigns in it for maybe 10 years. Compared to later sequels Civ 2 feels a pretty hard game on Deity level, mostly due to very powerful barbarians appearing in the beginning of the game, and a somewhat too random outcomes of battles. Democracy is also a seriously overpowered government due to huge population boosts while you have >50% happy citizens (and all others content) in cities, making it best even for war-time. If you find Diety too easy (which it is), try playing it extra-hard by making your starting settlers sleep for 100 turns. Or restart the game until you get a map where you appear on the North or South pole. Or play with 1 city only (the OCC challenge which was later added as game feature in Civ 4 or 5). Or you can edit the rules of the game by opening the txt file in the game's installation folder - it's that easy. I've played all the games in Civ series and must say that apart from Alpha Centauri, Civ 2 still remains the best in the series. After Alpha Centauri polished the model to almost complete perfection, the later sequels were just money grabs done by random people trying to squeeze yet even more from the fans and adding questionable changes for changes' sake. If you are too young to have seen Civ 2 or Alpha Centauri, resist your revulsion with their obsolete graphics and get some patience to dig thru the rules which sadly aren't well explained by today's standards. Civ 2 and AC are truly gaming classics which inspired a whole generation of gamers.. Absolutely incredible - this game is proof that gameplay trumps hollow graphics. Honestly one of the best games ever made, even though it's almost 2 decades old. It's a shame even the ports are all but obsolete too. The future will be missing a classic of gaming if this disappears.. I have very very cheerfully given hours of my life to this game. The 'just another turn' aspect is, for me, the standard by which all other games are judged. The balance of elements, the surprises (i found some after over a year of playing!), the range of difficulties from casual up was effective as a training approach and the strategy you use at the easiest level often wont work at the highest level (I still hate those Zulus!) all adds to the game for me.. Civilization II is an excellent turn-based strategy game, one that probably set goalposts for the genre. Even though it is an old game, it has an ageless quality which will keep it relevant for years to come.. One of the best games ever. Can consume thousands of hours. Civ V is a better game but it takes ages to play, leaving it much less rewarding. If only the AI wasn't quite so stupid when it came to automated settlers, refusal to play a diplomatic game and a few other things.. This is definitely good game. But not excellent. I am fan of Civilization series, played a lot even Civilization I (which, in my opinion is slightly better than this). And I'll try to explain, why. Despite so addictive gameplay, graphics could be better (at least more user friendly, more readable). Also when your civilization is big enough there are too many unnecessary clicks at the endgame dealing with cities micromanagement. Barbarian spawning is not logical. And unhappy people in the cities at the endgame are too annoying and again not so logical too. City management interface could be better. For example when you are in the city mode, you cannot see amount of maintenance cost.. 17 years on and Civ II is one of the greats. For anyone willing to invest a few hours to learn the game mechanics, they will find a world that is as immersive, expansive, and definitely addictive as any modern game. Plus you get to learn about history! The graphics for the time were excellent, as was the sound design(!). I personally sunk many hundreds of hours into this one as a teenager... time well spent!. This is the second best computer game I have ever played. And I played it nearly continuously for a period of six years. I could not recommend it more strongly. Civ 3 didn't cut it, though Civ 4 is also very good. (The best game ever? Hearts of Iron 2). If I even hear the music to this game I'm glued to the screen for the next 9 hours. Very addictive and just a down right glorious game. This game captivated me from the very beginning, and looking back its still in my top 5 All Time Favorite games.. An extremely addictive and well-rounded turn-based strategy game with long-lasting appeal. I found the WWII scenario to be delightfully challenging and fun. Even though Civ V is now available, Civ II still maintains a level of enjoyment that makes it worth going back to again and again.. I spent the best part of my childhood playing this game and it taught me a tremendous amount about how the world developed over a series of years. It is still worth picking up, particularly if you like this turn based expansionist games. The second best Civilization game made to date. Leaves Civ IV, the worst in the series, in the dust and gives Civ V a run for its money. Civ II is a fun strategy game with astounding scenarios even in the Vanilla game. Definitely a solid game with great gameplay.. My 2nd favorite game while I was in college 1997-1999 (Master of Orion II was 1st). Modding is in text files, but still understandable by non-coder season users.. This is the BEST all time Civilization game bar none. It is better than Civ III and definitely better than Civ V (which is the worst of the series). Civ IV gives it a close challenge but II is still the best and most challenging. Pay no attention to that FOOL who says it's the worst game ever he's just mad cause his pew pew game didn't get 1st place in something. If you love strategy you will love CIV II.. i played civ three first so i will probubly underestemate this game but here i go. this game is very fun and addictive. i like the gameplay and basicly alot about it. it is far to simple to be given a nine but it sure is better than 4.. Like wine it gets better with age. my all time favorite game . fun, deep , smart.. My fondest memories of this game were creating death trap scenarios for my friend in high school. The only dislike I had for this game were the epic voyages caravans had to take, sometimes spanning thousands of years. Other than that, pure awesome.","with over a thousand hours poured into it, it's a cornerstone of my life and personal growth . every turn feels like a blend of strategy and improvisation . each mod is like rediscovering something i already love but through a brand-new lens ."
650.MULLET MADJACK,"The independent game Mullet **** a captivating and entertaining first-person shooter experience reminiscent of classic titles like Doom. The game’s narrative revolves around rescuing an influencer princess from a billionaire robot, a mission rewarded with a pair of shoes.From the outset, the game’s playful narrative and humor establish a lighthearted tone. However, the game’s inherent violence creates a compelling contrast. Drawing inspiration from fast-paced and brutal first-person shooters like Doom, Mullet Madjack delivers thrilling gameplay where speed and precision are paramount.Beyond its Doom influences, Mullet Madjack draws inspiration from 1990s anime, notably Cowboy Bebop. This artful blend creates a unique and memorable gaming **** addictive gameplay challenges players to ascend a billionaire robot’s building within a strict time limit of 10 seconds per floor. Players gain extra time by eliminating enemies and utilizing available items. At the end of each floor, three random items are offered, one of which is a weapon. The weapons are well-designed and each provides a distinct feel.While the game boasts impressive visuals, the level design might feel repetitive. However, this repetition is mitigated by the introduction of new traps and enemies as the game progresses. The enemy variety and design are commendable, presenting increasingly challenging encounters. The boss fights, though well-designed with engaging combat mechanics, could benefit from a higher difficulty. While the game offers various difficulty settings, their inclusion seems unnecessary; a consistently higher difficulty would enhance the challenge.Among the game’s shortcomings is its brevity. Despite its positive aspects—from its environment and graphics to its fluid gameplay—the game could have benefitted from a more substantial and engaging narrative. Additionally, increased humor and more diverse levels would have further enhanced the overall **** conclusion, Mullet Madjack is a unique and commendable title that blends nostalgic elements, thrilling action, and witty humor to deliver a memorable gaming experience.. Starts chaotic, but you get used to it. Pros: +Fun action +Good tension with the countdown. +Nice artstyle +Cutscenes are funny and has a cool artstyle Cons; -Mostly, first level and the last levels is the same, bosses are a little different, some enemies are added later in the levels, but it is the same mostly. -For re-runs, it should be optional to play tutorial levels, skip some story elements etc. Re-runs for the achievements feels a drag.. YT: @Federock Delightful, beautiful, excited. You gotta click click click click.... One of the best games I ever played, and probably the best FPS. It's frenetic, colorful, fun! It's everything but boring. This game captured my attention the second I saw it. I perfected all the steam achievements and I still Can’t stop thinking about how addicting the gameplay was, really charming package all around and awesome gunplay with endless side content if you’re into endless shooters. Give this game a shot if you love anime and charming games that feel super personal. Give this a 10/10.. This Beautiful game with its 80s Anime style and Synthwave theme and music, really gave me a brain orgasm. If you wish to feel the same, BUY THIS GAME. Even if you HATE rogue-like games or fps games, you will LOVE this game.. its colorful and it feels like an arcade game. I do recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of doom, mad max games.. Ultra fast paced twitch shooter meets Akira, what more could you ask for? Only complaint are its short story and easy bosses.. Amazing aesthetics and refreshing gameplay every level, music and artwork is top notch, perfect 80s and synthwave vibes aswell as very fresh gameplay every playthrough, the game randomly mixes up the levels and upgrades so it doesnt become stale at all.. If you like FPS like DOOM and Quake, the 80s/90s aesthetic and synthwave music, this game is for you!. Nailed the aesthetics and soundtrack, no doubt. The game kind of blows it's load in the first 10-20 minutes, though, as you've already seen basically everything the game has to offer. I became bored about halfway through the first level and uninstalled after I died on the second. I guess it's meant to appeal to the audience it's mocking.. The game is awesome, one of the best of this year, hope it gets to the consoles soon, so everyone can play!. Insanely high quality and fast paced and stylish shooter. Sadly even on higher difficulties it's rather short other then the endless mode.. Overrated game on one hour length, worse than neon white or hotline Miami lol. One of the best games of this year! very addictive and super fun! LETS KILL SOME ROBOTS!. Very good game! Awes some if you are an anime fan especially! Finally a good anime game!. This game is TOO good. I need to play this in short sessions otherwise i get overloaded with dopamine!. waited for this since june of last year. did not dissapoint AT ALL. everything from the artwork to the gameplay to the cutscenes is one big love letter to the beauty that is VHS media from the 90's.. This game blows my mind. Splendid artwork and very fun core loop. This game is a must play.. It's pure adrenaline. Absolute Chaos. As difficult as you need it to be, and It doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's a perfectly balanced blast with an incredibly satisfying ending and gorgeous animations and music. The Chapters are JUST the right length for someone who doesn't have a lot of time. And the endless mode will satisfy the insatiable. OH and if you are a speed runner, They have tuned some elements to be more accommodating. The Devs are active in the Discord and really great at interacting with the community. This game feels like it was made for me. I love it so much and my one biggest desire is that they make a physical edition big box copy of the game! But until then, they included a Virtual Big Box UNBOXING experience in the game, complete with full color user manual. The scope of the game is perfectly executed. Cons: It is on the shorter side I'm FIRMLY in the camp that 20 buks for a WELL crafted 4-6 hour experience is money EXTREMELY WELL spent!If you prefer long, boring 30+ hour grind games then THIS is not for you! You've been warned.","the game's narrative revolves around rescuing an influencer princess from a billionaire robot . the game's inherent violence creates a compelling contrast . despite its positive aspects, the game could have benefitted from a more substantial and engaging narrative ."
651.Night in the Woods,"Night in the Woods is one of those games that just feels special, it isn’t just a cozy small-town exploration game, it also slowly dips into unsettling, Lovecraftian territory. As Mae, a college dropout, reconnects with her hometown, things start to feel off, with strange occurrences and a growing sense of unease. I spent both times hanging out with Bea. Their relationship felt real to me, there’s this mix of awkwardness and unspoken feelings that makes it hit hard. I didn’t really spend time with Gregg, but Bea’s story was enough to make me feel connected. The soundtrack by Alec Holowka was just the best... The blend of weird, unexplainable events and deep, emotional storytelling gives Night in the Woods a unique, haunting vibe that sticks with you long after you finish it.. The art style is generally the best feature of this game. The actual game part is still and underwhelming with an unlikable protag that didn’t grow up past middle school and character dialogue written by someone who is also just as developmentally arrested. It seems this is written from the perspective of someone who had no friends or social life growing up imagining what it would be like to have these things but completely missing the mark. I’m giving it a 2 for the art but honestly it still feels too high.. Beautiful graphics and art style. Good music. Fun mini games. The story is extremely boring in the beginning and very underwhelming and makes no sense in the ending. It was very disappointing in general. I was expecting a game that tackled a more profound experience , and that would elaborate more about the main character's mental health problems, but that is not the case. It completely ignores explaining anything about the main protagonist hard time with their mental state and focus just on the characters just talking nonsense the majority of time.. cat talking and walking on 2 legs simulator, story, and art style are good anything else is super boring, just watch on YT you can skip the walking part which is the 70% of the game. even though the game takes place in a society with animals instead of humans, it just feels so human. the game works more as a visual novel, where choices *sort of* matter. this game absolutely made me cry at the end, because i SO wanted to do that last band practice. GREGG RULZ OK. The story and setting hit close to home for me and everything about the characters is amazing. The art style, while being simplistic, gets the point across and the music is phenomenal. Definitely my favorite game of all time.. As another user mentioned, if you like the story you're going to like the game. I personally did not feel any connection with the story and all it left me was more questions than answers at the end. I think in terms of game play, there really isn't much to praise about. The only good game play was from the mini games on the computer which I wanted to finish but was not given the option to once the game ends. I don't really think there is much replayability. I do however have good praises for the characters and the aura that the developer set to establish as I think the characters were pretty unique with their neat set of dialogs, though some might find cringe nowadays. I also think that the atmosphere for certain parts of the game was on point and really drove home what they were trying to preach essentially. Overall, I think if you're into slow, narrative type of games, I think you should give this one a try.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you were a fan of story-driven games like Life Is Strange (and Furry Anthros). Then this video game choices matter game is worth giving a try. Night In The Woods is absolutely an amazing story game that follows our protagonist Mae Borowski living life and returning to Possum Springs. But aside from Mae, she is also with her other friends who are also bandmates such as Bae Santello, Gregg Lee, and Angus Delaney. For a simple platform game that has no points to earn or doing something platform thing like Mario. The game focuses on the story so much that it is what makes a work of art and most importantly the game even has the most recognizable characters. But mostly almost everything in Possum Springs is interactable too. But the best part of this game is its minigame called Demontower. Rather than having that minigame treated like a simple plain game, it's a minigame that has been treated like an actual game that I forget the fact it's still Night In The Woods. The best part is that this game even includes additional two games such as Longest Night and Lost Constellation. But Lost Constellation is my favorite kind of extra game to play with. But the thing I like about the game is the replay value. I couldn't sleep the fact that not just I wanted to know Bae's route but even Gregg's route too as well. This game is something that I would remember on what is like on absolutely great no matter what. And a perfect game for mostly the furry fandom.. This game made me ball in tears. From the characters to environment to the story this game is incredible, I originally found this game way back in 2017 and every day on my birthday I play this game and each time I find myself crying more and enjoying the story telling evens more each time. The game does not feel drawn out or ridiculously long. The characters are phenomenal each one having their own personality and real life issues with its world building could not be anymore important. If you love story based games this will be your best option.. Wonderful story. Simple, yet great artstyle. All extremely likeable characters. Goth crocodile girl? Count me in. The game starts off a bit slow, but I really can't complain after finishing the game. It's all so beautifully psychological, and also has plenty of genuinely funny moments.. A cute, slow, chill game. I didn't finished it, because it starts being very slow, but the gameplay is very detailed and the conversation is very great.. I honestly don't know how else to describe this game aside from feeling real. The characters, their town, the dialogue, it all feels like I actually came back from a failed attempt at college and I'm truly stuck there. The way the game places strong importance to talking to people, and having a day to day dialogue with the townsfolk is truly something special. While the game never really demands much from you to began with, it does offer a hard look at life, and gives a narrative that hits home to anyone that has felt stuck or that something is wrong with them. The dark themes of the plot aren't really about any problem, but how society as a whole creates problems for the people it should be serving. There is a big underlining capitalism bad, and other themes of socialism agenda that are mostly told through sad animal characters dealing with common issues that most people in the modern day have, and honestly delivers such ideas through realistic dialogue compared to the usual pandering of spelling it out for the player. Overall Night In the Woods is a good game about character interactions with a strong theme of socialism.. Fun game. But after several hours of playing, I got tired of waiting for something to happen in the game. A game for those who want to relax and unwind.. I enjoyed this game very much. Game had very good art style and environment. Best story game i played i recommend everyone to play this. This game feels all over the place. Sometimes I feel it helps the overall profundity and evocative passion of the plot and encompassing narrative; other times it feels messy and jarring, but overall, I personally really loved and enjoyed this game and story. With its occasional funny one-liners, which I thought were fitting and risible, to the relatability of some of the struggles and characters with all of their own personal foibles and deep resentments, and the vicarious nature of the whole game, which for most seems and is probably expected to be a turn-off. I've felt some minor ennui throughout this game, too, but this game works way more fluidly and palatably with this motif of gameplay, with it mostly being about spectating from the lens of someone who can be at times relatable with average and prevalent straits, vices, and struggles, but at times seen solemn, abstract, and despondent at their worst, and how we all are like that, and that we are all weird and have troubles, and that life can get bad, and that we should be more thankful and understanding about the things around us because we might never have it again. One day we will wake up but not be able to open our eyes. All of the pain, toil, and love are gone in the moment. Did I mention how existential this game gets? Anyways, I think that this game can, or at least has been very successful at, epitomizing or capturing the vision of relatability, especially one of a teenager or young adult. As one myself, I can definitely develop strong sentiments heavily brought up in most of the game, like how we value or prioritize specific, somewhat kitschy things in others eyes and make so much sentimental appreciation for the little and ephemeral things, or how things just happen and we make the most of them and hope we live to see tomorrow, and how angst just comes naturally at that time. So many things and so many drifting too fast to truly grasp and process them internally because life is just like this game, very dynamic in where it shines but banausic in where it dives, but that's all okay in the end, because everything is already done, and you only probably perceive or acknowledge the ones that meant the most to you; after all, this was your story, the game is only a game, and life is more than that and you will ever know. This game was ebullient and stygian all at the same time and collides to construct something inchoate and personal, even when you can't relate. It has characters and concepts that feel more alive and ambiguous and open-ended than a game can fully replicate. It has moods and ambiance that immerse you into your own most visceral cognizance. So, yes, I very do recommend this game and its structural formula. Also, who the f**k is Germ xd 8.5/10. The best game of my life! Although it is a little disappointing or boring, the game expresses the fun interaction between the main character and the characters, the background and story of the characters, and the process of solving them in a very beautiful and brilliant way. It also expressed the theme of nihilism well in the game and seemed to play a fairy tale for teenagers who became adults due to their unique drawing style. It's a really good game!. I noticed Night in the Woods because of the knife fight mini-game, and the cute fair-tale-book style made me think this is a warm lovely story. The overall playthrough was so smooth that I didn't even feel much like playing a puzzle game. Rather than saying I was surprised by the dramatic turn in the story, I was shocked by how much fear this game can give me even if everything was drawn as simple colorful 2D shapes. I would definitely recommend everyone who is interested in good narrative design to play this game at least once.. This game has been out for far too long and I've missed it for far too long for what it's trying to tell. My wife and I played Night in the Woods for Christmas 2022, I knew it was a story game but didn't expect anything. What I got back was a reflection of my life, my dreams, I was able to reflect on the lives of others and how difficult they have it at times and I trample on my happiness. I cried several times in the game, felt caught up, felt like I was back in my school days and had an insane amount of friends that grew on me and most importantly, I learned a lot about myself and my career and that no matter what you do, the most important thing is that you get together with the right people. Night in the Woods has an incredible storytelling that is both playful and serious. The only thing that disturbed me in between, attention small spoiler! was the dreams where you had to constantly run back and forth which felt to me like you were just trying to stretch out the game time. I will play through the game countless times and make it my October game, come what may every October in the year this game is unpacked again, cried, rejoiced and reflected again on their own lives!. This game does not deserve rating higher than zero, as it fundamentally contradicts what its developers were. The game pays a lot of attention and meaning to friendship and support... indeed, how great they supported the creator of the game when rivers of mud and false accusations flowed on him.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Quite possibly the worse game I have ever played. How is a night in the woods even considered a game when the game consists of boring walking from place to place, boring talking to characters, and boring overall story. The only part where the game is actually a game is when you play rejected Mario Party mini games that aren't even fun. Anyone who gives this game above a 5 has never experienced an actual good game and its honestly kinda sad. Please don't get this game, there are so many other games that are masterpieces and have so much love and care put into them unlike the failure that is a night in the woods. This is a a 2D platformer, but it's got a strong story focus (a coming of age story) and most of the gameplay is walking around and talking to people. In addition, there are two major mini-games: playing music like in Rock Band, and a fairly simple, but extremely difficult old-school 2D isometric action platformer. I enjoyed the game enough to play through the whole story, but I can't say I loved it. THE GOOD: - The characters are interesting - The dialog is quite good - The story's themes are very topical and relevant to any ordinary working-age person alive nowadays - I like how areas changed subtly from day to day. There was always something different going on. - I enjoyed the mini-games for the most part, although Demontower and the last song were both too hard for me. - I enjoyed the art style. - Very woke THE BAD: - The game is very slow. You walk slowly. You have to walk back and forth over the same areas over and over. The areas evolve a bit each day, so it's not as terrible as it might sound, but it's not that great either. - I won't spoil it for you, but I found the overall plot to be kind of weird and not make a lot of sense... More below in the MINOR SPOILERS and MAJOR SPOILERS sections. - The story touches on some really interesting themes, but I can't say it grabs them in any really compelling way. It merely nods to the themes. ""These things are important,"" it says. But the story doesn't give any juicy insights or takeaways to think about. - It's a coming of age story. There must be some people that believe these are High Art, but I'm not one of them. - The pacing was off. The story evolves very, very, slowly. You have to wait a very long time to sate your curiosity about what happened a week before the start of the story, and then WHAM! the answer is more confusing than satisfactory, and the game ends. The ending is too rushed to have any good debate or answer to the story's themes. THE UGLY: - I did not encounter any bugs or crashes, which is a good thing. - Depending on the exact moment you save your game and exit, you might have to re-play some of the story. However, this was never a major issue for me. MINOR SPOILERS: - I thought for a long time that the story was surely about the main character's descent into schizophrenia. It isn't... and that is extra weird. - Magic, psychic powers, angels, and demons, are an unsatisfying addition to a game that is set in an analogue of the real world. MAJOR SPOILERS: - Late at night, in the dark, someone can't recognize you instantly (I'm talking to you, masked bad guy!) - It doesn't make any sense that a secret cult of murderers can exist for a long time, in secret, in a small town. - If a mine collapses, and a dozen people are killed, it will be noticed! It causes an earthquake, you know. And when a dozen members of a small town disappear overnight, people will kind of be freaking out the next day. It will not be a regular day in town.. I liked the story, but if you don't, you aren't going to like this game, considering that the only other gameplay is light platforming and short minigames. There is Demontower, though, which is just about the only replayability that the game has, sadly, unless you have forgotten the story. Also, if you plan on playing the songs you collect and getting perfect on them, you should do that before you finish the epilogue, because after that it deletes your save. Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10.. A warm, moving tale of alienation and redemption in the era of late stage capitalism.. The story begins quite slowly, but as it passes, a powerful narrative is seen, where the truly good are the characters and their backgrounds in a town that is slowly dying.. Night in the Woods is an amazing game. I just loved the dialogue writing and the way it tackles big and not-so-openly discussed topics like mental health, responsibility, and relationships. It was the first time in a very long time that I didn't want a game to end. I had so much fun roaming around the city with Mae's friends and wrecking stuff, along with interacting with the people of the town. This game may not be perfect but it is definitely recommended! Full review at: ****/post/night-in-the-woods. This game is cute, charming, the story is good, but not as good as THE CHARACTERS, every single one of the characters in this game is a joy to talk to, even the people on the streets, they are all interesting. I personaly think that this game is awesome, its a bit short, but I love it. #teamBea. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good, sometimes very good dialogues, which are constantly interrupted by repetetive and boring walking/platform sequences. Imagine Persona 5 in which you have to actually walk to the school every day without any dialogue etc. you just waste your time moving from a location A to B every in-game day (NITW has similar day cycle).. Best visual. Best atmosphere. Amazing game setting. Real life dialogues and story. Characters, familiar from the real live. Cozy and wonderful music. Cute style and animation. All this is buried under the giant and nasty thing – tolerastia. No, not even tolerastia, but **** How can I love the story of this beautiful game, if a quarter of characters f*** each other in their a****? Why? Why you just killed all game accomplishments with this?.. Humanity is rotten.. Pay no mind to this comment, I intend to write a proper review soon enough. For now, just trust this score.. This is a masterpiece in writing! Like, a REAL story FOR ADULTS! Gets a bit mysterious near end, but oh my, the relationships between characters and their dialogues is top notch! Vector graphics is nice, memorable characters. Get's a bit dark sometimes, but that's the mood of this game. Definitely 10 out of 10!!!. What I think is the greatest fiction and writing and created; held together with perfectly fleshed out and developed characters, gorgeous graphics, masterfully crafted music and every functionality done to perfection. I really wanted to like this game. The art is wonderful, and there's some great music here as well. The gameplay, however, is pretty much nonexistent. At times it felt more like I was clicking through a powerpoint presentation than playing an actual game, and as something that seemed to advertise itself as a platformer I was more than a bit disappointed. I have mixed feelings about the story too. I feel like it's technically well-written, but the characters did come across as a bit whiny, and it seems like it's geared towards a late teens, early twenties crowd, so not really something I personally found very relatable. I also think the pacing was totally off. The first part of the game is sort of a mix of walking around town and chatting with people, with random one-off outings with friends. Most of the meat of the story happens in the last part, which also has pretty much no gameplay other than walking back and forth. It just felt a little uneven to me, like I would have enjoyed it better if there was more plot in the beginning, or more consistent gameplay throughout. Anyway. I could maybe see why some people really like this game, but overall I just found it a bit boring.. This the kind of game that I had to play during the day, otherwise I'd just fall asleep. It's boring. The focus of the game is the story and it isn't even that good. The lack of voice acting and expressions also don't help. There are better walking simulators than this, even Life is Strange, a game I don't like that much is more interesting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. NOTE: Please note that this is surprisingly my opinion, so of course don't expect to agree with anything that I say since I will be talking about my personal experience with the game. I started Night in the Woods thinking I would like it for one reason and ended up loving it for a completely different one. What really got me into the game was the main story line, the premise of uncovering the mysteries of a town and a character. And by starting the game with this mindset, that was exactly what I expected to experience: a character solving mysteries and having self-development. In my first hours, all I wanted was to rush to the main quests and discover what was going on, write down my conclusions and finish it as soon as possible, get to that final plot twist moment where I wanted to say ""I knew it!"". However, the more I got into the game, the less I wanted to do that. At some point, it just felt so boring to keep doing the same routine in the game, jumping around the town, following the story line. There was no gameplay, there was no mystery, just a bunch of characters talking to each other about life problems with no real depth or anything like that. But when I started to feel this boredom, I finally understood what the magic of the game was. Since the main plot just felt useless to me, I started to explore the world on my own, trying to look for secrets myself, meeting side characters and looking for collectibles or side quests. And then, as weird as that may seem, that felt amazing. This game has SO much more than it seems. There's secrets everywhere, characters to be met in every corner, small things for you to discover. And when I started to spend hours in a part of the game that was supposed to last a few minutes, when I started to try and do the most that I could without actually progressing the story, when I was about to leave my house but then straight up come back because I noticed I hadn't said good morning to my mother, then I noticed why this game is so special. This is a game about boredom. And it is so amazing, at least for me, for that reason. We live for such a short time and everything that surrounds us seems so boring, so useless that we sometimes just decide to do everything as fast as possible hoping that it's going to get better someday, but we can make things better whenever we want just by deciding to go somewhere we never did and maybe discovering something amazing there. Playing this game just for the main plot is a pain. If you start it and decide to ignore everything, just head straight up to the main quests and progress the story to beat the game as fast as possible, you will probably have one of the worst experiences in a videogame. But if you truly dive into this world, if you decide to explore everything you can, if you sometimes even miss something important but you don't look it up just because you're exploring this on your own, then you'll notice that a part of you will forever stay in Possum Springs. Apart from that, the game has an amazing OST and great art style. It could use some more complexity in gameplay, since most of the experience is dialogue and the main story itself has a slow start, heats up a lot halfway through and has a pretty OK ending as far as mystery solving is concerned. There's a lot of well written characters and each one of them gives their own perspective about the world. Night in the Woods was an incredible experience that showed me a new way of looking at life. It is a well deserved 10/10 game, even if it lacks on a few technical aspects.. I've played a ton of walking simulators, and this is the first one that almost put me to sleep multiple times. It's so boring. Even sleep-inducing games like Abzu and Gone Home were more exciting than this. MC is a complete screw up who is unrelatable and uncomfortably awkward. There's no good lesson or meaning to be found in this game.. Incredibly cozy and full of rich characters in a beautifully realized world. Quirky and random gameplay elements with a comfortable 1 hour per day pacing. Great vibes, sounds, and style all around! Overall a fairly simple game, with not much impact or thought-input from the player which is what ultimately brings it down a bit. Still, I'm not regretting playing it!. Night in the woods is an artsy point&click. The story is attractive, even sometimes boring.. Don't have worlds to say how much i loved this game, everything about this game is amazing. 3 things I love about this video game: - Adorable visual - Concise dialogues - Attractive storytelling. Nothing to say, maybe the best adventure game I'd ever played, the story is fantastic, it's so dynamic and fluid especially the dialogues.. holy jesus this game is great, i have bought 3 coppies to date and plan on buying more it is so good. I got bored playing this myself - I mean it FELT like it was trying to say something about mental illness and life with it and so on... but it was taking a hell of a long time to do so! So I started watching a Let's Play to see if watching someone else would make it better. Nope, nope, nope, NOPE NOPE, a thousand times worse. See, it continues to be slow and boring, and in the end the game DOESN'T say anything about mental illness. It turns into a nonsensical paranormal/conspiracy theory **** resolution. And in the meantime, the LPer I chose to watch was making some really, truly ignorant comments about MI which, because the game doesn't actually care about educating people on MI, their comments never got challenged in any way. They just kept thinking the very wrong things about the characters along the lines of ""they have a MI and therefore they are "". And this is why I really despise storytellers that use mental illness as some kind of half baked ""look at how DEEP our story is!"" cheat code. Shoving a mental illness onto a character in order to explain their behavior is not character development, and is not representation, and is not something I appreciate seeing in something I paid good money for.. The game is amazing and captivating, i have spent some amazing time on it. The characters are well developed throught history and make you like them just like the history. The art of the game is another thing that makes the game so amazing. I Love it and i enjoy it. Thoroughly enjoyable character dialogue, nice slow burn / reveal of the main story elements, plenty of secrets to be discovered in multiple replays, and one HELL of a climax. The finale blends macroscopic and microscopic themes into one cohesive narrative, which gives the player one of the most astounding ""ah-ha!"" moments when everything falls into place. There are a few trite / sophomoric lines here and there, but that can be forgiven in light of the craftsmanship, care, and humor put into the story.. Emotional, mature, and honest, Night In The Woods is an exploration of adulthood, maturity, religion, mental health and personal relationships in a very unique way wrapped around a good light horror and cosmic horror packaging. Scary when it needs to be and emotional all the time, this might have been one of the most touching games I've ever played and I can identify with every character's very much human and tri-dimensional struggle because life can be crappy, whether or not you have to deal with ghosts.. While you might not expect it from a game with such a cute aesthetic, Night in the Woods isn't afraid to tackle heavy issues, such as mental health, existential dread, and the decay of America's rural towns. Some of the game's highlights include its entertainingly witty dialogue, delightful art style, and believable characters. Even if your own background differs from that of the protagonist Mae, you may find yourself relating to her if you've ever struggled with social anxiety or low self-worth, or simply felt lost. Her signature snarkiness is also welcome as it brings some comic relief to some of the game's darker moments. Scenes with Mae's colorful cast of friends make for some of Night in the Woods' best moments. It's difficult to choose between wild child Gregg and sarcastic, down-to-earth Bea. If you want to experience all of the scenes with each character, you'll have to go back for a second playthrough. For all its charms, Night in the Woods isn't without flaws. For a game with an already slow pace, some of the platforming can get a little tedious, particularly in the dream sequences, which, while beautifully rendered, can start to feel like a bit of a chore, particularly toward the end of the game. Gameplay also involves a lot of wandering around the world. This can feel aimless at times due to the lack of a clear goal or path to take, but does make sense considering the game's story and themes. There's also plenty to see in Possom Springs, and completionists will enjoy chatting with the many periphery characters inhabiting the game's world and powering through plentiful mini-games, including the challenging yet strangely addictive game-within-a-game Demon Tower. Night in the Woods will take you for an emotional ride, and its anthropomorphic characters can sometimes feel more human than real people. It's one of those games that stays with you long after you've finished playing it.. This game is absolutely terrible. it lacks any game play what so ever so the only thing it relies on is the dialogue and story and needless to say both are horrendous . your choices have practically 0 effect on the story and no one talks like real people. I've seen many people praise this game for how natural the dialogue is but it all boils down to the words ""like"" or ""ugh"" with many text boxes only containing 1 of those 2 words, or lol random xD middle school humor, you know when a kid says ""lol muffinz"" thats as deep as the humor gets . if you think this is how real 20 year old acts you've probably spent all of high school and middle school writing fan fiction. The story itself is nothing, you walk around at a snails pace reading the most boring or unfunny dialogue until the last hour of this around 9 hour snooze fest when they try to force a crappy murder mystery down your throat. the story has no setup aside from someone mentioning a murder off hand like twice and it does not connect at all to the rest of the game nor does it make any sense. As much as game theory wants you to think this game is a metaphor for something all kids go through theres just no deeper meaning here. its just unrealistic characters doing and saying mundane things. theres no game play aside from walking at .2 mph(and like 2 terrible minigames) and theres no story that you cant get from scrolling down tumblr in 2012 its just a complete waste of 9 hours.. One of my all time favourites. Night In The Woods is an amazing storytelling game with great funny characters and interesting plot. Every person is unique and interesting to come around and talk to. The music is next-level and probably is as amazing as in Undertale (or even better!). But, they left a huge plot hole and, a","as Mae reconnects with her hometown, things start to feel off, with strange occurrences and a growing sense of unease . the blend of weird, unexplainable events and deep, emotional storytelling gives Night in the Woods a unique, haunting vibe that sticks with you long after you finish it . the actual game part is still and underwhelming with an unlikable protag that didn’t grow up past middle school and character dialogue"
652.Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,"Fun game with great cars and car sounds The cons for me: no customization, story is just non existent, and the hot pursuit races are not just hard, no… they are completely annoying and tedious to the point where it is not fun at all.. (Sorry i Wrote a Review on a Wrong Console) After 14 years, i'm really excited to playing this game. A long year i waited a day months and years, today i build a pc gaming from my hardwork! So now, i'm gonna playing this Masterpiece, since kid i haven't play this game before. My dream becomes true! Really comes true! I've playing this game since december 2024,i can imagine how really happy i am and being so excited. It's so fun!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best racing game ever created. Period. Had 900 hrs on the PS3 version and an additional 1060 hrs on the PS4 Remastered version. And now I'm still playing this game on the PS5 with 4K 60fps. Best feeling of pure speed I've ever experienced. I don't think a racing game can ever top this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Need for speed hot pursuit are best 5 Need for speed of all time with new game playing. Need for Speed is my all-time favorite racing game. It was my first experience with the franchise and I loved the thrill of being chased while playing. The game also features references to popular movies and TV shows that car enthusiasts can enjoy.. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a really good racing game with great graphics and gameplay. The only flaw is that there is no opportunity to tune your car like in Need for Speed Underground 2. Personally I don't like the whole ""cops against racers"" theme but this game managed to pull it off well. The most exciting thing in racing games in my opinion is the car customization, and unfortunately this game doesn't have car customization at all, which is a shame because everything else about it is pretty good. The gameplay is fun and I liked the power-ups. I also think the fact that you can play as a cop is pretty cool. The graphics are ahead of their time, this game looks absolutely great even for todays standards. And lastly, there's a decent amount of cars but the progression system is a mess. Final Rating: ""Decent"" ~ 6/10.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 6 Total: 7.33. The most exciting thing in racing games in my opinion, is the car customization, and unfortunately this game doesn't have car customization at all... at least it's actually a fun game to play, the graphics hold up pretty well and I like how there is an option to play as a cop car hunting down racers.. I have not enjoyed a NFS game as much as I did with this one in many years.. This is a fun arcade racing game. For the hardcore NFS fans, this game does break that NFS feel that was there in the past entries. This game is nothing like Need for Speed 3 or Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2. The car lineup in this game is nice. A mix of Japanese tuners to the heavy hypercars, including the McLaren F1. The game is visually stunning, especially given the year that this game was made and published. This is a game made for fun at high speeds. Playing both as racer and cop was fun and the modes with the weapons were awesome. The solo career is a little short but it is still fun to go back to perfect the times with. Fun racing game.. Hot Pursuit is an enthralling racer that allows you to play as both the Police and the Racers. The diverse selection of cars and beautiful graphics transport you to this world. While the open world feels pointless, it is nice to have the ability to free roam. The actual pursuits however are really well crafted, with beautiful high speed chases that ramp the excitement. A fantastic racer.. It's a good game to fill your empty hours and it's fun. But it could be a lot better. it's very limited and that's bad but also good at some points. in sum, it's a fine game, but not what you expect from this franchise.. I didn't take to this at first but with everything unlocked, it's my favourite game of all time. (The DLC makes it even better). The cars and environments are superbly rendered and still look great on my 64"" plasma 6 years on – not to mention the awesome slo-mo crashes. More importantly, the car handling and gameplay is tight and finely orchestrated. It's not meant to be realistic – just fun – and succeeds on that level like no other racer I have ever played. Criterion in its prime.. NFS Hot Pursuit is my personal favourite of the franchise,think a mix of Burnout style handling with real cars,mixed in with tech like EMP blasts and spike strips. The gameplay is a mix of NFS and **** is NFS due to chases etc.,but the game feels very similar to Burnout,that's not a bad thing though,as the cars are **** inclusion of high-tech weapons like EMP blasts and spike strips changes up the game significantly. The graphics are gorgeous,and the framerate is solid The sound effects and soundtrack are INCREDIBLE. Hot Pursuit's only real downfalls are long loading times and rubberbanding AI,which will really frustrate you later in the game. Overall,Need For Speed Hot Pursuit is an incredible arcade racer,that everyone should play.. Decent game, kinda plays like an older burnout game with cops. Sounds pretty cool right? Well the execution doesn't quite match up with the concept. The biggest complaint, in my opinion, is the way the game plays compared to the original. In my opinion Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 was the perfect model for a racing game with cops. Simple yet fun, balanced cars, somewhat realistic-somewhat arcade like feel. This game failed to live up to that model, the game takes all the skill out of driving. Want to take a corner at 200+ mph? No problem, just hit the e-brake then nitro out the other side, and don't even get me started on the power ups. The whole game is more about ""EMPing"" people than trying to catch up and actually out drive them. Really good concept, just too overdone for it's own good. Overall 6/10 still can be fun to play, but doesn't live up to expectations.,. From someone who never thoroughly cared much about the NFS franchise to begin with I will say its a pleasant surprise. Sure, its still not what I want but I can see the NFS heritage in this game given its own identity. With this being a criterion game I was surprised that it felt more like a NFS game than a burnout one, but I feel it has more in common with the racers of the 90's like porsche challenge in that its about racing exotic cars around pretty environments while police sirens crop up occasionally. This isnt a bad thing seeing as this form of racing has been absent in a while so seeing it make a return is nice. Controls are simple, the difficulty is just challenging enough to need replying when making mistakes, and its far from a true simulation, but nothing will be too hard for racers of all levels. I feel those looking for in depth customization or controls will be disappointed by the game, just a warning. as an arcade racer though, its not half bad and is good fun, though it can grind at the later half of the career.. It seems that the Need for Speed franchise is a dying franchise, weined from the interest's of EA's profit margins, so why should they need to give a damn about making the one game that everybody should had been anticipated for. For all the commentary about 4-player local coop and 8-player system link, customization tools and the returned joy of being the pursuee, HOT Pursuit is a very bad excuse in the shadow of the original. There is no customization whatsoever, you can't even choose which car you want to drive for particular events, choosen randomly with a very limited set of colors. I know the original Hot Pursuit had this, but this game came out in 2010! We know of the varied customization abilities tried and true in the Original Most Wanted and Underground series, so why exclude it from here? It seems the overall affect of this game's success was the neat little graphics, but how do graphics keep a person's interest if they can't bother to play the game for 2 hours to try some sliver of fun, besides the wreck of online play that they jam into your ear for the very first 20 minutes of starting the game. There is also no need to freeroam either, as you can't really enjoy driving the car you want to, especially since all the cars handle like a tank trying to hit a 180 at 400 miles per hour: meaning, horribly. Also, the stats of each cars are contextually inept, mentioning torque and weight for some unknown reason, rather than giving the simplified stats that most gamers could understand: Speed, Acceleration and Handling. So I hope that EA thinks that any kind of game that would limit their profit margins even by a half of a percent is too much of a risk to them, because this was the game that made me hate EA and stop buying their crap from here on out. They told me what they thought of the customers, so I fought back.. The online mode is a lot of fun, especially with friends. But the solo modes are nothing but a bunch of awfully boring and tedious time trials. The game just feels empty and lifeless. Also, there is no split-screen multiplayer, which is disappointing.. Great game, great graphics, great soundtrack, great fun. Being a gamer who has been gaming since gaming began i can tell you that as you get older games no longer have the ability to make you wake up early jump out of bed and play them like when you were a kid, however, this was the first game to make me do that in years. I just kept wanting one more try, another try to better my score and get the gold medals. It was a lot of fun.. Those of you put off by the 'Need for Speed' name thanks to years of mediocre efforts by EA should think again. Coming from the makers of 'Burnout: Paradise', Hot Pursuit sees the NFS franchise return to its routes, namely high speed police pursuits in all manner of sports and super cars and it is certainly much improved. Hot Pursuit is a good game in single player but you really need to find friends to play against if you are to get the most from it. On-line you can play as racer (reach the objective without being caught by the cops) or the cops (take out the racer before they reach the objective) as well as competing against each other’s best times over a series of different events. Worth buying even if you are not usually a fan of racing games.. An absolute insult to the Need for Speed franchise, as this entry holds NOTHING that made the original Hot Pursuits so great. First off, the handling system is beyond broken: it's delayed as hell and you're forced to drift even in the slightest corners it tries so hard, but oh so hard to be NFS4:HS and fails miserably. The tracks are insanely shallow, they're all sprints (no circuits afaik) there's practically no challenge aside from a few corners that even a five year old could drive around and you're going so fast, with a graphics engine so awful that you just cannot see what the hell's ahead and you're just bound to slam into a wall because of the garbage steering which every car seems to have (to tell you the truth, the only difference between certain cars are the abuse they can take and their speed, nothing more). The inclusion of weapons is also another thing I don't understand okay sure, HP2 also had weapons, but they weren't nearly as ridiculous. First of all, racers shouldn't have weaponry, and they sure as hell shouldn't have EMP cannons and Spike Strips. That's just dumb and a VERY pitiful excuse for ""game balance"". The roadblocks are pointless since they all have an opening which is stupid. The Spike Strips in this game are ungodly annoying aswell, they activate immediately which makes split-streaming other racers/cops practically impossible. Not only that, whenever you're hit by one of these weapons or god forbid, hit a wall or get TAKEN DOWN (LOL BURNOUT CTRL+C CTRL+V) you have to watch an annoying as heck screen of the likes of ""SPIKED!"" or ""CRASHED!"" and then just speed away as if nothing happened apart from losing a bit of health. Yeah, ok. That's exactly how I expected a Hot Pursuit game to work: to bust racers, you have to take them down a ton of times until they're finally arrested. No, sorry, this is not how a NFS game should work. If I wanted to play Road Rage online, I'd go play Burnout 3 or something. This game is the ultimate proof that by this time EA was just cashing in on ""new"" games by just rehashing and fusing old concepts into a mish-mash that cries out for the apocalypse; an absolute disaster, you can see the exact same thing happening on Most Wanted 2012, that game is a copypaste of Burnout Paradise. The superb fun that was the Hot Pursuit game mode in NFS4 and Hot Pursuit 2 in... NFS Hot Pursuit 2 was completely ruined by this game, and it only set a bar for the worse which were the future EA titles. Also, did I mention that this doesn't have split-screen either? Wait, the insanity doesn't stop there: it takes as long as it takes to load a new race as it does to RESTARTING A RACE. So, you screwed up? Oh, no problem, we'll just make you WAIT HALF A MINUTE FOR THE WHOLE THING TO LOAD. And another thing, you don't even get to ""start"" the race, the game just drops you with the race already a bit in progress, followed by a nearly-unskippable cutscene (it has an option to skip it but you'll in fact just skip like 2 or 3 seconds of it). I agree, it's nitpicking but it's these little details that make the game so much more frustrating than it should be. There's also an incredibly shallow free roam mode which blatantly looks unfinished. You can't do anything in it aside from driving and accessing the pause menu. What a joke.. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is one of my favorite racing games of this generation, Developed by the creators of the Burnout series Criterion delivers a great arcade racer about cops and racers. It's fast, fun and intense. Cars may not handle realistically, but they are not designed to. This is about driving fast cars at crazy speeds, Need for Speed has had some pretty bad releases in recent times with Need for Speed The Run and some of the ones coming before Hot Pursuit, So this is a great return to form for the Need for Speed series. If you are just looking for a fun racing game that doesn't go for realistic handling then this is for you, If you want realistic driving then avoid this one. There are some issues with the game, the biggest being that there is absolutely no local multiplayer and the online multiplayer is pretty empty now, How a racing game can not include local multiplayer is beyond me, But either way it's still a fun game.. No story.... Waaah!! Cars don't handle realistically.... Boo Hoo!! Not enough variety.... Sob!! .........To all the red score detractors I say three words..... BLOODY GOOD FUN !!!! After a break of many, many month's I loaded NFS: Hot Pursuit and spent an afternoon of rapture and (old) boy racer joy. As a quick fix adrenalin rush, this can't be beat. Short, point to point race's (on either sides of the law) at lightning fast speed and awe inspired drifting is arcade heaven. Not every game needs a story, realistic handling and lots of variety. Not every game needs to be played for eight hours at a time (not that there's anything wrong with that)......... There are games that I buy, play then on-sell. And there are games I hold onto because they are keepers. This game is a keeper.. I am proud to say Criterion did an excellent job with this game and it completely lives up to how great Need for Speed was in the past. This game is a reboot of an older NFS game and succeeds in capturing the sense of entertainment that was seen before. The first thing that stands out is how outstanding the graphics are, and even though I do not really care about graphics I have to praise them. Next is the soundtrack, the main theme being Edge of the Earth by 30 Seconds to Mars which I loved listening to. The rest of the songs have a rap and pop feel to it, and some really stand out while you are driving and having epic moments. Next is the gameplay, it is extremely fun with a less realistic and more arcade feel, adding a lot of fun to this game. The ability to be a cop or racer is what is crucial in an NFS game since the missions play differently and you get to see different stuff with each. The amount of events in single-player may not seem like much to some, but it will when they get deeper in the game since the later events will get really difficult and will include some really crazy driving. The car selection in this game is incredible, with 5 divisions of the car classes from sports to hyper there is a really good amount of them, and you will feel difference with every car you drive. Online in this game is a blast, with racers and cops chasing them online it feels great, and I rarely felt I was at a disadvantage regarding player experience, it will keep you entertained for a good while. The only flaws this game has is a few weak songs in the soundtrack (maybe its the great songs that belittle them) and a really high difficulty in the time challenges making it very difficult to progress. The NFS franchise had a great comeback and it is interesting to see what it has to offer in the future, this game is a total recommend and it will be for a while.. Great game. Great if not amazing details, missions, and cars. Arguably the best Need For Speed game ever made and in the top 2 in challenging for the Need For Speed Series. Take Need for Speed's beautiful exotic cars, the Hot Pursuit series' signature stunning locales, full Cop and Racer campaigns and Criterion's mastery of arcade-racing controls and what do you get? One of the best racing games ever made. I have a few minor gripes like how the Hyper series selection is of lower quality compared to the other series and the level 3 weapons can get pretty ridiculous, especially the nearly impossible to avoid lvl 3 roadblocks. However, they're a microscopic blemish on an otherwise perfect racing game.. If you are looking for a reboot of the Hot Pursuit series, then don't look here. If you are looking for an upgrade to the Burnout series (the game the creators made before this), then don't look here. If you are looking for some sort of hybrid between the Hot Pursuit series and the Burnout series that tries to be both but turns into neither, then this is your game. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a game with all the bells and whistles to attract any racing gamer but with none of the depth to make it worth-while. So let me just start in with Single Player. There's no story, no substance like any of the previous Need for Speed games and, after about 5 hours, you'll find yourself droning on between the different races because there's just not a lot of interesting to do. It also doesn't have the flare of driving to each race track that Burnout Paradise had, which would have been fabulous considering its a driving game so I like to spend the game... driving. And then you might be thinking that at least it must have killer races, except most of the racers are time trials and you will spend literally the first 10 hours of gameplay trying to just get some stupid gold medal for no reason. It's not worth it. Basically, Single Player will not hold you over and it's beyond boring. So then I swapped over to Multiplayer. It's amazingly flawed. First of all, you can't play anything online unless you've unlocked one car for either racer or cop in the single player. Whomever designed that system, it's really bad and stupid. But I thought meh, I'll earn more for being good. Except the game not only rewards having the highest level, but gives you a HUGE boost for being the highest level in the game. So a level 7 vs a level 20 is not an even match. How did that slip by the creators? Still, I let that roll off my shoulder and decided to at least try. The multiplayer feels exactly like the single player, bland and flawed. I think my favorite flaw is that racers can drive backwards and go behind the cops and wait. Why the hell is that even allowed? But wait, it gets better. They also call this a dog chasing a rabbit type of game (No joke, that's almost a direct quote from before the game came out), except it's like being a dog with absolutely no teeth. Seriously, I could catch up to the racers but I couldn't do anything to them as a cop. On the other side, being a racer isn't about racing anymore, but more about swiveling in circles around the cop. I think the creators need to really retool and refocus this game so that it's more towards what it's supposed to be about. Racing. If a racer stops, give him a few seconds before he's disqualified for running away. That way they have a reason to always be moving forwards. Also, racers need to know that they are still in a race, where first place is the only winner, not this ""group win"" crap where even if you get disqualified for holding the cops up you are a winner. It should be racers against racers and cops and cops teamed up to take down the racers. Not racers vs cops. That's I think the largest flaw with the online. And on the other side, cops shouldn't be able to hurt each other as easily as it is in this game. Seriously, I launched an EMP and it decided to latch onto the cop to the let instead of the racer right in front of me. That's bad programming and it ruins the game. Last, the online felt... dated to say the least. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend.. The game is very easy, there's no leaderboards and absolutely zero skill involved in the driving. It isn't a bad experience, but no-one can take this seriously as a racing game. The online race is actually more addicting than the cops & robbers, which have perks/powerups. The graphics are great, and the cars are decent. But all of the feel the same to drive, with VERY subtle differences in handling, but performance is pretty much the same. It's enjoyable and fun while it lasts, but it doesn't last for long. Getting to level 20 cop and racer and playing all the online events until it becomes incredibly boring took me 58 hours. That's to do everything, including all achievements. For NFS nowadays it's quite long, but for an average racing game, it's not long enough. And the reason for this is because the gameplay is so repetitive and there's no real precision involved. However, the game is remarkably very good for what it is. It has a fantastic set of cars to choose from, even if it is very small and all of them feel similar handling-wise. There are only slight differences between cars in the same category/class, but no matter which you pick, you are not disadvantaged, so in a way it is balanced. The graphics, smooth frate, solid controls, beautiful environments and cars coupled with the almost lag-free multiplayer matchmaking and innovative modes make this game a must experience. Drifting is extremely fun, the normal race mode is addicting and overall, Criterion have pulled it off. It's a game which has no barriers to entry. You can just jump in and play it. But, by some miracle, if you're good at this almost skill-less game you can still beat inexperienced player even if you take the same route and don't crash. If you want serious racing look elsewhere. If you want something arcade and fun this is definitely worth playing.. If you like repetitive arcade racers that look good, but have terrible collision detection and AI that can pull turns on a dime, this is the game for you. Honestly, this game looks great and sounds great, but I cannot let the collision and AI problems go unnoticed considering this entire game is predicated on the concept of stopping racers or not being stopped by the cops. I have, on too many occasions, watched the AI blow through a called in road block, literally bumping the cop car out of the way, take no damage and keep going at full speed when it SHOULD have resulted in significant damage and slow down. I have, on too many occasions, t-boned a drifting car at top speed, as a police officer, only for the AI to take no damage and actually get bumped ahead. The AI never misses a shortcut or a drift, and can magically avoid traffic or simply glance off them (whereas if the player tries glancing off the car, it's damage and slow down). Multiplayer is equally a mess, with the collision detection problems magnified by lag. Maybe worth picking up now that it's in the greatest hits bin, but only if you like playing, essentially, the same tired things over and over with significant amounts of frustration. ||| @BillGR17: Sorry, I can't let this slide... This is NOT ""the real Need for Speed"". Go back and play the original NFS: Hot Pursuit on PC then come back and play this garbage. The difference is night and day. There was so much more to do in the original Hot Pursuit, and skill played a much larger factor. Not like this one where you have to be LUCKY to get in a position to outsmart the AI who can maneuver in ways you can't, regardless of control scheme. This game is absolutely bland compared to the original Hot Pursuit which, even though that game had its AI issues, was much closer to the ORIGINAL Need for Speed than this mess. This is Burnout Light with better graphics.. Finally the old style need for speed is back ! The first need for speed that i had was Need for Speed 3 : Hot Pursuit ! yes there is many ppl saying WTF happen with Need for Speed well those are ppl who didnt know what was the real Need For Speed so i like it even if it was hard when i start it i think its easy to master it so this was good deal for me coz i saw it on sales for 20 Euro so it was a good deal for a racing game and it the game that it will make u have a good time with friends and a lot good gameplay on single and on multiplayer ! BUT this game has online pass so u cant activate it in another account to play it online !!! that wasnt good at all. I love this game. It is not a simulator but ""arcade racer"" is probably most accurate. While it plays very fast and loose, it is arcade in the sense that it is easy to just pick up and play once you adjust. Drifts are long and the nitrous is plentiful. The cars you get are all dream cars, which is great considering those are the cars I want to drive, not some s2000 or Honda fit that I'm forced to drive to get to the Koenigseggs and Paganis. An online pass is required to play online. Online is really great especially if you race with friends. ""Autolog"" is addicting as well, beating a friend's time and boasting about it feels pretty great. A personal high point for me is the sound, the engine and exhaust noise is exaggerated and makes driving fast more engaging. Minor annoyances however: The balance between cars is sometimes questionable mainly because of the boost, but that makes the races interesting. Takedowns also provide frustration at times, if you are in front of a car, don't try and stop so they hit you, it does nothing; again probably to prevent cheap wins but still annoying. Free Drive is pretty pointless, but still fun to pass time occasionally. Music is bad. 2/3 DLC packs are worth getting. Lamborghini pack is great but easy. Super Sports Pack is a necessity for those that want challenge, a great set of super-exotics and really challenging/fast-paced races. Porsche Pack is pointless unless you really need more Porsche. Overall: A great game, fun to play if you want something fun and fairly easy to get into once you adjust to the loose controls. Great for that 15-30 minutes of adrenaline a day after you beat it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. When the game was released, I was sceptical about it and if it would match up to NFS Undercover (which I really liked). I only decided to buy the game 2 months ago from my local 2nd hand video game and DVD shop. It' had so much potential but it just didn't deliver for me, the car handling was slow and sluggish and differed massivly from the usual arcade style NFS car handling. The whole concept of it was good, but the game let it self down really badly with poor car handling and too many races and not enough other types of events e.g. road rage and pursuits. Back in the day, Need for Speed was a good series that, coincidentally, released a Hot Pursuit for the PC. Fool that I am, I thought that EA had remade that old winner, added some cars, built new tracks, and fixed some of the mistakes that they'd made, like the cheating AI. They did add cars. They built a pseudo-open world. But they managed to take a game that was fun and turn it into something guaranteed to give you stress-induced heart trouble. It has been part of the EA ethos for ages that if the player is winning, the AI is not only allowed to cheat, but cheat horribly. Never has that been more apparent than in this game. Playing as a cop, you will quickly start cursing your fellow officers as they hit new levels of incompetence. Letting a speeder by is a mistake, but being spike-stripped by your fellow officers is maddening. AI cars can stop and turn on a dime, you slide around like a drunken air-hockey puck. Handling is so poor as to be nearly unmanageable at times (if it's raining, you better be driving like a senior citizen, because anything over 40 miles per hour and you'll be trading paint with oak trees). The cheating continues on the other side of the game. Amazingly, as soon as you take to being a racer, the police force is suddenly staffed by telepathic snipers who can drop a spike strip exactly where you intended to be microseconds before being there. Roadblocks are established with lightning speed in perfect locations, and EMPs can hit you from another planet. Jump back to being a cop, and the super troopers have gone to bed, leaving the Keystone Kops you were working with before back on duty. There are some pluses to the game, of course. The graphics are beautiful (if you have an HDTV...forget using standard def), the crash animations -- which you'll see often -- stunning, and some of the roads are rather well laid-out. You can freedrive as a cop, which is also cool, not to mention vital as practice. If you're freedriving or driving with your buddies, you'll have fun. Against the AI? It's clear the ESRB rating doesn't govern gamer responses; your language will definitely rate M as the AI appears out of nowhere to trash your ride.. The Game has the best Need for speed graphics to date, the cars handle great (Arcade Style) and the landscapes look amazing. When you step into a chase race, you really feel the music and the adrenaline that comes with it. Its the most rewarding cops and robbers car chase game there is. The matches work simple, you log in to the HUB where you see all your new and old matches waiting for you to click on. You can either be a Regular Racing Punk, or a Cop. You vehicle upgrades as well, the upgrading system does not work like NFS Most wanted. It upgrades with the time line of your matches that you've completed. There are plenty of cars to race with and plenty of matches to chase people. When you Step into a high level car chase on any of the sides (cops/punks) you are in for the ride of your Life. For the price of 30$ new this is well worth your money if you were looking for a new racing game and didn't get what you wanted from NFS THE RUN. Pick this game up. Its beautiful and riveting ------ Cons No Open World Chases EA Pass needed to play Online.. Absolutely brilliant online game modes, great fun to play with your mates and extremely reliable server. one downfall the career is random, doesn't have a story line and is very repetitive.. Love this game for what it is, childish smashing and crashing fun. It's not a game that takes itself seriously, it is not a sim. It's an old school arcade game and knows it, you new kids don't get it and that's cool but I'm old and remember games like this one and it is a dying breed of just pick up and play with non gamer friends and enjoy.. ",need for speed: hot pursuit is a really good racing game with great graphics and gameplay . the only flaw is that there is no opportunity to tune your car like in Need for Speed Underground 2 . the gameplay is fun and i liked the power-ups .
653.Ridge Racer,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Complete bullcrap. Literally zero handling ,car slips on the road like a Bugatti on an ice lake. I literally got 4 360° spins after braking while turning on a simple corner. And when not braking, the doesn't even turn slightly when you want it to.. An extremely slick and attractive arcade racer but the lack of traffic and damage and its rather over-simplified handling makes it slightly short on thrills. A good, solid racing game though.. I never played a Ridge Racer game prior to playing this one, so I have no history to look back on in regards to the series, so my review won’t touch on any sort of comparisons. With that said, even 15 years later, the game still looks and plays fantastic! You could tell Namco went all-out for this title and, remembering this was a launch title for the PSP, it made quite the statement on what the little handheld could do. Visually, the game is stunning. Cars, lighting, backgrounds…they all look impressive and are very detailed. The game is also really fast with zero framerate issues which gives you a tremendous sensation of speed as you’re playing. The sound is good with a few exceptions (i.e. hitting the wall or another car) and the soundtrack is noteworthy (even though that style of music is not my thing). I realize Ridge Racer is an arcade racer, but where it falls short sometimes is the physics. For one, running into another car yields an unsatisfying knock sound and nothing resembling what would really happen…the other car doesn’t slide or spin out, nothing happens to your car other than slowing down, etc. I can live with the fact there’s no visible damage, but if I hit a car in the rear quarter panel, I’d expect it to slide out of the way. The other instance where the physics fails is in the drifting. If you do it right, it’s quite the sensation and is very satisfying. However, if you start to drift the wrong way (i.e. the turn is to the right but you misjudge it and start to turn/drift to the left), you will still drift in around the turn even though you’re facing the wrong way! That takes you out of the game for a moment. Otherwise, the controls are good and the game is a lot of fun…up to a point. As you progress, the game gets harder and harder until you reach a point where you feel like you have to run a perfect 3-lap race with absolutely zero mistakes to win. Keep in mind, you start every race in last place so you have to pass 11 other cars while also negotiating the track without ever slipping up. That standard of perfection becomes frustrating after a while and takes away from the enjoyment and the desire to keep playing. But Ridge Racer is still a phenomenal game and one that proved that console-level gaming could be had on the go!. Classic game for PSP that everyone had tried at least one time! Maybe an IA more calibrated would be the game perfect, but this is only a detail compares the incredible work made by Namco !!!. I really like this game and i rated this game 9.0/10.I like the graphics,cars,challenges,courses and the **** can also unlock new cars,courses and other challenges as well but this game is very good for me to play at home and i finish this game 3 times.. I picked up this at the same time I bought my PSP 1000, and at the first glance... this game is IMMENSE! Since the PS1 release of the first Ridge racer, I have been a fan of the series and it is always interesting at how each newer version of the game changes radically from the last. The main talking point at the release of the PSP / and this game was its graphics and the speed that this small portable system can put out - and rightly so... no problems at all in that court. Being an arcade game, there are little to no instructions- race, drift around the corners to increase your boost bar, and then use the turbo to go ... faster.... Controls are fairly decent, until you drift around a corner. The most remarkable thing in the RR world is when you can drift around a left corner... whilst TURNING RIGHT! ... I dont mean like that scene in the pixar movie, ""Cars""- but... you can, drift around a left corner, skidding to the right?!? - the drifting in the game unfortunately seems to be based on a ""roller coaster"" so little to no feeling is apparent. - until you actually realise this, the game is damn fun though! - it is a shame though, and it looses points for some race-lovers who like to race normally by using brakes and a grippy tire system (as done in the early RR series) There are many stages in the game, or ""series of races"". each comprising of around 3-5 races. There is only a small number of tracks, taken from other versions (from PS1, PS2, Xbox360 etc) and they are flipped, reversed, and so on. As soon as you complete a stage you automatically get awarded a set of cars... which seem to be almost identical to the car you were just racing. It ended up becoming a chore just watching these segments in the end (similar to a loading screen) Verdict: On the whole, this is a very entertaining game, until you realise that you are just repeating yourself by playing the same tracks over and over. - oh and until you see the ""rollercoaster"" drifting system at work... ...Oh, and ... If you have a choice between this and the PS3 version... GET THE PS3 ONE!!! Pros: Fast Nice graphics A lot stages to beat! Cons: Lack of feeling whilst drifting Win a car after every race, ... (yawn!) Feels like its stretched out too thin, game pace issues","the lack of traffic and damage and its rather over-simplified handling makes it slightly short on thrills . the game is also really fast with zero framerate issues which gives you a tremendous sensation of speed as you’re playing . if you do it right, it’s quite the sensation and is very satisfying ."
654.Nex Machina: Death Machine,"A fun twin stick shooter...very fast paced and very enjoyable. When it is on sale...a decent buy.. This is such a great game. My only problem is some of the lasers are hard to see. I just started playing but so far I love it. I will update this review when Im done. Note: Im playing on easy and it's starting to get hard.. Fabulous tribute to Eugene Jarvis and Robotron 2084, a game of utterly spellbinding visuals, incredibly smooth gameplay, and pure fun. Everything about it is all so polished, complete and glorious, you can see they really went out to work with Eugene to create some kind of peak-level experience for a twin-stick arcade blast-up; even the music is sublime. I watched the documentary ""The Name of The Game"" which was utterly fascinating and made me appreciate Housemarque even more; what a story. This game is a straight 10 for me, it's absolutely marvellous and just massively entertaining and enjoyable in so many ways.. The more you play, the more you see the flaws. I put 40h into the game and got the platinum trophy and also beat the very last boss, Nex Machina. So let me tell you that the game is actually an excellent twin-stick shooter but unfortunately it is very short (45 mins). It is so quick-paced I don't even remember what the enemies look like because you shoot them on sight and after one hit they perish. There is also one totally abusable mechanic - it's called ""dash explosion"", with that you can dispose of enemies right after they spawn giving the no time to attack. This'll end up as your primary weapon for killing non-one-hit foes. They normály have up to three phases but you get to see none of them since you execute them before they have a chance to breathe. But don't get me wrong, the game is in other aspects absolutely wonderful - exciting and smooth game-play, good soundtrack, challenging bullet-hell, nice design, etc. It is truly a shame that it's so short. I would give this 7.5 but since the user score is lower than 8 I opted for 7.. Nex Machina is another excellent game from Housemarque, the masters of the modern arcade games genre. In designing Nex Machina, they have collaborated with the legendary Eugene Jarvis (creator of such arcade classics as Defender and Robotron: 2084). Nex Machina is a hardcore twin-stick shooter with bullet hell elements. Even at the easiest difficulty, prepare for lots of deaths. It features 6 worlds, each split into mini-stages which have to be cleared before facing a boss. If you lose a life you have to replay the same level (not the world), with all enemies and humans respawning. There is the ""save the humans"" mechanic granting bonus points and multipliers for those chasing high scores. Other than the arcade mode and single world mode, there are a few challenges and local co-op, but sadly there is nothing else. Nex Machina's arcade mode is masterfully crafted, but the lack of additional modes hurts the game's longevity. On the technical side, Nex Machina utilizes the same voxel graphics technology from Resogun, where enemies and parts of the scenery can be destroyed into small cubes. The soundtrack is terrific, as well as the sound FX. Nex Machina is a great arcade game but unfortunately it's the last of its kind made from Housemarque. They have abandoned the arcade genre due to poor sales of their games despite them being well-reviewed, in favor of making a Battle Royale game. If you are a fan of arcade twin-stick shooters, you have to play Nex Machina and check Housemarque's catalogue of arcade games.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 8.5 Sound/Music: 8.5 Graphics/Art: 8 Story/Atmosphere: 7.5 OVERALL: 8.1/10. I like the gameplay but I wish the campaign was more fleshed out and felt more substantial. There isn't much incentive to play after you beat each level.. If you have any intrest at all in this genre, you should give this game a try. Im not a game criticer or anything but what i can say is i dont remember having this much fun at any game i've ever played in my life. This game is perfect in my opinion.. The moment you hit that Start button you're off to the races. Everything about this game screams arcade. Whether it's the the vibrant colored bullett hell, the bleeping sounds or the fantastic soundtrack - this game will entrance you while you're shooting and dashing your way through countless enemies and stages.. Barnstormer **** - it ebs and flows and whilst can look chaotic to an outsider, when you pick-up that controller you are immersed. There is nothing better than co-op mode bedlam, the manic, psychedelic game-play draws you into a trance-like state where the game-play you produce and moments of ""wowza"" achieved as you traverse a difficult section where enemies are closing in and your last human needs saving will leave you breathless. Has had some seriously play, graphically beautiful, a brilliant flow, short ... but very, VERY sweet! As close as a 9 rating can get to 10 without quite hitting that perfect score (where could it have gained that final ping - i'd say it could have been a touch longer, or maybe a slightly larger level layout with smaller passages leading to larger rooms ? Either way, it's a damned good game this one)!. Nex Machina: Death Machine is a twin stick shootem up in where you blast everything on screen that wants you dead. The game includes power-ups and weapon abilities that give an edge in your scourge against the machine menace. Their really is no story, aside from machines have taken over and you must save humans while destroying everything in your path. Let me now discuss my thoughts on the different topics that this game has: Visuals and Levels: Extremely vibrant and colorful environments that go by a cyberpunk voxel art design. I was impressed but also hampered by the color shifts whenever enemies used their different abilities for me to dodge. The amount of enemies on screen posed an issue whenever I was trying to keep a step ahead of them and sometimes got caught on objects and then killed. The enemy designs themselves are cool but all pose a uniform color model of red that makes it hard at times to tell what even is coming at me. The retro arcade bit style of things being destroyed is a neat little touch. The levels themselves are short in duration but range on size and setting, each having their own challenge to them that feels fresh and yet familiar that doesn't comprise the simplicity of the game. Each area is comprised of about 15+ plus levels and can be cleared usually in about 8-10 minutes (depending on difficulty mode). Gameplay: High intensity as you would expect from a twin stick bullet hell like game. Enemies by the hordes will zero right in on your ass and you will shoot and destroy every single one of them to clear a level. Along the way you can also save humans, secret humans, destroy certain robots to get more points and obtain secret levels and more. it's too cryptic with how you learn the secrets at all. Considering the game is fast paced and meant to make you move constantly and think on your feet, it feels counterproductive to do this way in this game in my opinion. The power ups include shields, triple dashes (dashing allows you to avoid damage and move through enemies with invulnerable frames), extra lives, increased multipliers, etc and they all have good usage that do not go underutilized. The weapons are mostly good; the sword is the weakest weapon with too small a radius to hit enemies, the laser is great at destroying hordes down narrow areas but at the unfortunate cost of slowness that could spell death if you hold it for too long, the rocket launcher shoots a wider line and has a surprisingly small blast radius, the detonator shoots a bomb that you remotely explode that is great against enemies behind ones you can shoot at the moment and so on. Despite this being a twin stick shooter, it feels like there should be more creativity with the weapons in not just visuals (which they all mostly look great) but have more tactical play that evolves the game's strategy. Enemies and Bosses: They range from little spider like bots to giant bombs that release shockwaves that forces you to dodge. The variety feels good and as you progress newer units change the priorities a bit and make the game far more interesting. The bosses kick ass, they have great move sets to them that makes them a challenge and joy to engage in. Only the final boss feels lacking and that is where I have to make a statement I feel is justified but might be disliked... Length and Duration: I was shocked by how short the game is. To make sure I was not crazy, I went through and beat it again on a stepped up difficulty to make sure I was dreaming. It took me about an hour and half to beat the game twice. When I beat the final boss I thought I was I would be about a third of the way done with the game, but when I saw a cutscene and the credits, I was in disbelief. Sure, what was already coming along was good, but it felt like there was such a waste of potential here that it pains me to see it be this way. Even if the game would have 10 to my idea of 15 areas at least it would be far more laden with challenge. The bosses and level designs are very well done, but the shortness of the game is the game's fatal flaw and I can't grasp how this was acceptable by the dev team. I am all for shorter more precise games but a game like this should have more clever designs. Had it had 10 areas instead of 6 I would have been more forgiving, but that is too much for me. Other things: Co-op can be done couch play style, but not online which is bizarre. The challenges feel retreading with no unique hook or modifier that makes it interesting. The difficulty is too punishing on higher modes and feels artificial than creative. The music is excellent and very well done. I feel this belongs to a very certain type of genre fan who will enjoy its designs, but I ultimately felt disappointed by the potential it threw away. $20 feels a bit much so I would say wait for a sale for this one. Good overall but feels odd on a console and would be something I would have played in a arcade instead.. If there’s an arcade genre that has stood the test of time as fun, it’s the twin-stick shooter. You know the games: Robotron, Smash TV, Asteroids. While developer Housemarque has been creating THE twin-stick shooter experiences since the 90s, it wasn’t until the HD version of Super **** that people really started to take note. While they’ve put out some other fantastic games like Outland and Dead Nation, the next game that really took the genre to the next level was Resogun. Housemarque is here to redefine the genre once again. Nex Machina was created with Eugene Jarvis as a creative consultant. If that name means nothing to you, note that he worked on several of the aforementioned titles, in addition to the likes of NARC, Total Carnage, and the Cruis’n series. Put simply, it’s hard to think of someone more attuned to the nature of arcade games. Pairing him with Housemarque is a dream come true. The game at first glance is strikingly beautiful, with an enhanced engine that was used for Resogun. While both are great looking games, Nex Machina stands well above the other. From the set pieces to the character models, and even the explosions of voxels, everything here is improved. Saving the humans is back, which creates a sense of urgency in each room as you introduce the enemies to your arsenal weapons. Of course, saving them is optional, but as is typically the case with an arcade game, you’re playing for the high score, and every little bit counts. In addition to the normal movement and shooting you’d expect, you also have secondary weapons in the form of pickups and a dash button. Dashing allows for movement without being damaged, which is useful as one hit will kill you unless you have a shield. And with a seemingly endless supply of enemies in certain rooms, on top of the near bullet-hell type gameplay, that dash is necessary for avoiding death. In addition to the shield that you can pick up, you will also find enhancements to your bullet spread, rocket launchers, swords, bombs, lasers and more. The difficulties are steep, although they are certainly fair. If you absolutely need to beat the game, but really struggle with deaths, the easiest difficulty has an unlimited amount of continues. The normal difficulty offers 99, while the hard only provides 10. Of course, beating the game without any is an option as well, but that will take the most dedicated of players. If you die in a room, you can learn from your past mistakes, as the AI will play out in a similar manner. Naturally, the way you approach it will change the way they interact. And humans are always top priority depending on the enemy, so you may want to take advantage of them being distracted before picking up the squishy life-forms. In addition to the obvious objectives of humans, killing all the enemies including the level’s boss, and not dying, there are many secrets to discover. And with the sheer amount of things going on in each room of the levels, they are easy to miss. You’ll be playing levels over and over to find everything the developers have hidden, and quite honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way. It provides more reason to go back to previously played levels other than beating your friends’ high scores, which is already plenty of reason in a game like this. Speaking of friends, if you have someone you like to play things with, this offers local co-op. If you think the screen is insane by yourself, just add a whole other person shooting bullets to the mix. Note that the co-op is limited to local, and it’s really no wonder as any amount of lag could lead to disastrous results. Even with a solid internet connection there are hiccups, and honestly, most people don’t have their systems hardwired to a high speed connection. It’s awesome that the option is available, and smart that they stuck with the couch. While the arcade mode is the game’s obvious focus, there’s also an arena mode that will task the player with beating levels under different conditions. Think of games that add certain handicaps while expecting you to still beat it. You will find many challenges in the trophy list, and they add so much to an already content rich game. The only thing left to sweeten the deal is the music. Ari Pulkkinen lays down some very heavy, trance like beats, which is par for the course with him. While it is what you’d expect, it doesn’t make the soundtrack any less mesmerizing. As always, Housemarque delivers with a game that is not only simple, but fun beyond compare. It’s rare that a developer is able to create new IPs that are consistently described as something that you’ll be addicted to the moment you play them, but that is undoubtedly the case here. Nex Machina is sitting at the top of my list for not only Housemarque games, but PS4 titles available right now. Strap in, get your thumbs ready, and make some voxels go boom.. As intense and well put together as Resogun. 10/10. The more you play this game the more you get out of it. A bargain for only 17 quid. I would have paid 5 times that.. As a Geometry Wars fan, this was on my radar. I played it a while and the graphics are much better than Alienation for me. I came back to it, and my gosh is it good. So much variety, so much to do. This is amazing, the music is well worth mentioning too. But it's the gameplay that keeps me coming back time and again. Perfection personified.. I've loved all of Housemarque games, but this one feels a little less solid. The environments are a bit too busy and distracting, but the gameplay itself is as stellar as always. A bit more clarity on what weapons can upgrade to (SSD HD style) and it'd give it more. Well worth trying though!. If you loved RESOGUN, you have to get this game. It's a fast-paced shooter with dazzling graphics, tight controls, and a killer soundtrack! The arcade campaign is short, but it's GREAT fun - lots of replay value. The developer, Housemarque, has created an outstanding game! My only complaint is that there isn't online co-op play, just local co-op.. I really like this game a lot. Beautiful and fun. However it doesn't really do that much new. More awesome Housemarque gameplay we have seen before. Feels a bit pricey at $20 for the content but I keep playing it trying to get a better score.. Amazing game, brilliant pacing, fantastic graphics and it's as hard as a game like this deserves to be. The lack of online coop in a game like this is almost a crime, though! 9/10 (10/10 if it had online coop).. This game is pure arcade goodness. It's fast paced and oh so crispy. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat as you chase that new high score. It maintains a classic feels while washing your eyes in orgasmic color schemes. A lot of fun.. A twin stick shooter from the makers of Resogun. It has much of the same graphical style, most of the same game modes, but none of the same magic. Its well made, but rudderless as you fly through a rapid succession of meaningless stages which end with an undecipherable formula and a score that feels empty. Like **** Ultra or Resogun, i guess you are supposed to continue to replay the 5ish stages for higher scores ---then on more difficult settings for a more intense challenge, but its all so similar and missing a worthwhile end goal.....i just dont get why you would. There is so little opportunity for alternate play styles or strategies, it ends up being an almost identical experience each time. There are some achievements called ""feats"", and some slight customization you can unlock by grinding currency from certain **** again, why? Do you care if your barely visible character has a slightly different highlight shade to his white outfit. I was looking forward to this game and preordered it, but after 10 minutes i was bored. I thought i had missed something. I played through each mode more than a couple times, hoping the game would grow on **** didnt. It steals virtually all its enemy and even stage boss mechanics from Resogun, making it feel very derivative. In a sentence, Its Resogun without the novelty, PS4 launch limited competition, and charm. It will probably be a PS+ game by Xmas....save your money.. crazy fun experience. As an older gamer, this title bring back some good nostalgic feelings with modern graphics. loads of features and tight controls. The non stop action and smooth game play makes this a must buy. A solid arcade experience. Has a bit of a smash TV feel to it. absolutely love this game. Highly recommended.. This is an incredible arcade shooter. Resogun is already a great arcade shooter bust with Nex Machina Housemarque sets a new level. It's so fun to play and I promise you: If you are into such kind of games then you'll be hooked. ; ). An ode to the old arcade style games, Nex Machina is a reminder you don't need to be a AAA title or have an insane amount of features to be a blast. Simple yet challenging, linear yet in-depth, its a raging time for anyone who simply wants to jump into the action and get to the point. Like many older games, the unfortunate part of the game is the short length and for that, it does get dinged a point. However, given that it is an arcade style game, the replay value is high because you aren't going for a specific story, you are going for the highest score and most efficient win. This is a fun title for the price tag and is an awesome game in itself if not at least an awesome time killer game. If you like the typical arcade style top down shooters, nostalgia, or just like to get to the point of shooting and blowing up things, this is a must own game.. Nex is a pure arcade experience, the latest Housemarque gem. No frame rate drops or stutters while playing on my C-chassis base Ps4, explosive fast paced action, typical Housemarque mechanics, beautiful colours, responsive controls and much more! Absolutely recommended!. Nex machina is an incredible game , the action , graphics If your a fan of the genre you should definitely buy this game , even people who hate the genre , no even people who poop on the genre should play this game Honestly this was one of the best experiences i had in 2017 The reason that I am not giving it a 10 is because its pretty short, I am almost at the end of the game before I knew it( still need to play a little bit) Buy this game or else I will buy it for you. This is one hell **** it take every thing we play back in the arcade area. It has lots of good nostalgic memories like smash tv or other bullet hell shooter and this take the the cake of glory.","a fun twin stick shooter...very fast paced and very enjoyable . fantastic tribute to Eugene Jarvis and Robotron 2084 . the more you play, the more you see the flaws . but unfortunately it is very short (45 mins)"
655.Nioh,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good game, good graphics, Ninja Gaiden style, with very difficult bosses at the end.. In the current dark age of gaming, during the reign of soulless Ubisoft-like open world tower-capture simulators... This game is a shining ray of hope! A masterpiece! Something actually worth your time and cash! Love it! Embrace it! Accept the challenge!. This game has very good and variable battle system, when you can handle different weapons in a specific way. All other aspects are good and nothing outstanding. The critical moment is clunky animations, which deliver dificulty simply by the fact your enemies have quicker animations than you. Another negative point is boring level design - almost all locations seem identical, however boss design is somewhat an achievement. Sound, music, story, characters are average or inferior. I have completed the game with almost all side missions.. An incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo. This game has a lot to offer: - Durability: You can spend a lot of hours by completing the campaign which is huge with plenty submissions and is very challenging. - The possibilities to build your character are incredible huge.. greater game ever made. fantastic combat and story. Great graphic and map queality. Best souls like ever made.. Japan mythology inspired story content with strong gameplaymechanics @ animation, rigs, physics, artsyle, graphics, excellently gameplay experience with 60FPS performance mode. The fast-paced natively action balanced for casual and pro players combat system with varied weapons martialartstyles, precise and amazing playability with the responsive, fluid animations and physics contribute excellent gaming experience in diverse and varied level designs decent complexity engaging situations challanges provide to embark on a solo journey or cooperative play with AI companions and / or with other online players.. It s kind of a souls game, but very repetitive and same enemies throughout. Still had a good time, but wouldn t return to it a second time.. Another miserable game from Team Ninja held back by being imbalanced and slow with poor pacing. The control scheme is weird with no option to make O dodge instead of X... which alone ruins the experience for me. A LOT of grinding needed to progress, but not enough to keep me interested.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great to play, less to challenge. An incredible art design and an unusual choice, for the time, of giving the possibility to switch between quality and frame rate, created a nice feeling whitin the gameplay. The looting system is extremely satisfying and the combat system offers a huge variety of weapons, movesets, spells and techniques. The difficulty is definitely the least successful part of the game: during the plot missions the problem is not felt, but since the secondary ones are quite important for leveling up, we tend to do them, and some of them, especially on the last island, are artificially complex. Team Ninja's mentality was to put mid bosses or bosses togheter, whitout giving them a coherent alternation of attacks, but rather enormously increasing their hp and their damage output. Unfortunately this lack of the game almost completely ruins the various new game pluses present after the story. However, it must be said that the general experience is very enjoyable, also thanks to the wonderful soundtrack, and Nioh is one of the most successful souls-likes. Approved. The best souls like to date.. Story is kinda mediocre, but combat is amazing and challenging. There are various methods to customize your build, so replayability is pretty high. There has been many developers trying to create games with Soulslike mechanics, but I think Nioh is one of the very few prime examples that managed to do it right in a unique way.. Best souls game ever played. Failed to deliver what i was expecting it to. I tried many times to like it but i guess its just a matter of taste. By 0/10 I am saying it was a waste of my money. Not that others wouldn't enjoy it. It's the controls I found annoying. I'm facing an enemy, why do I need to push the thumb stick to lock on? Seems a bit obvious what I want to hit. The sword - swipe swipe swipe then suddenly no swipe. Why? Did I just magically lose all my strength for a couple of seconds for no reason. I like to push a button and have a response. King of Fighters, Ys Origin, Hollow Knight, all examples. All different games, all respond. I just really can't be bothered playing a game that is so slow to respond. Makes it feel sluggish.. I don't have any criticism against this game. This title is a must play for any souls-like enjoyer. I did it 100% with pride.. What an epic game. I enjoyed this game. This game is underrated. Got the plat.. I had a blast with Nioh 2, i thought to give a retry to the first one. Omg so crappy. Can't see anything, builds are meh, leveldesign is vicious. Can't believe i played this without the yokai counterattack. Unavoidable grabs from the mobs really.. Sure, it feels like Dark Souls, except DS was perfectly balanced. . And they know it was crap , since all the bs mechanics disappeared from the second. Just don't try it now. As loath as I am to veer far from what I think most people have experienced with Nioh, I found that the game could not hold my attention for long enough to get me invested. While perfectly fine on a mechanical level, I found it to be a bit complex for my liking, and struggled to stay invested past my first few hours with it. Nioh may hold some value for those willing to push past what felt like a cumbersome introduction to me - as such, I encourage anyone reading to this to consider other reviews on this site in tandem with this one in order to get a good grasp on how much they might enjoy it.. + super fluid, responsive and satisfying combat + weapons types make for very diverse fighting styles each with their own moves, combos and skills + wide range of builds (armor/abilities/items/skills/) result in very different play styles + very deep and rewarding loot system + challenging without feeling cheap + great use of japanese lore + memorable boss fights - repetitive enemies - story is average. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm already discouraged with it, first let's talk about expectations if you expect to find a dark souls style game you should find some elements of the series like rpg style progression through save points like bonfires. However I would say that Nioh has elements of the souls series but it's not a souls like, at the heart of the game we have combat that is very dynamic and has several mechanics reminding me more onimusha than the souls series, the enemies and level design is a bit how repetitive making the grind tiring. Despite my dismay, give the game a chance if possible it has several positives like a very creative boss design, a nice art direction and a decent story I see nioh as the beginning of a promising series that is worth knowing and waiting for a sequence that can improve even more. Nioh was a game like bloodborne I gave up on very quickly. After I played the soulsbourne games, I gave Nioh a try. Boy, this game is nearly as good as all the souls games. I've been playing this game non-stop. Nioh is not only addictive because of the difficulty, the challenging bosses, leveling up but the loot gathering is so satisfying. Selling, choosing, getting the right weapon, armor, charm. I love it. Also, the story is pretty good. At first, I wasn't that interested, but you become in love with the period, the culture, the characters. The DLC's are worth the money. With hard bosses beautiful landscapes, very interesting, compelling characters. Way of strong is mighty hard but never dull. It's great. It's the best game I've ever seen. The picture is exquisite, the movement is smooth, and the design is exquisite.. To be fair it's 9/10, the dlc content is just very overpowered and kinda annoying to get at. Otherwise a great game. Acceptable, the gameplay could be better, the design of the bosses is good, but a lot of recycling. I just finished Nioh yesterday and wow ! What a ride ! I completed the base game after a 119 hours playthrough. I completed all the main and side missions (except the twilight missions and post-game content). Nioh is a souls-like that is really difficult and challenging. The learning curve is steep but the feeling of satisfaction after you beat a tough boss is huge ! The game is super fun and engaging. The combat system is really deep and the ki system is a really nice implementation. Nioh has a lot of content. It is not a short game by any means. I think an experienced gamer in the soul-like genre may complete this game in the 50-60 hours range but for me, as a pretty average skilled gamer, I needed more than 100 hours which is fine for me because I enjoyed most of my time with Nioh However, after a certain point in the game, I felt exhausted and I needed to take a break. For 10 days, I switched to another game (Shadow of the Tomb Raider) which I completed easily. While I was playing the other game, I was already missing Nioh's super fun combat system. After, I continued my journey in Nioh really fresh and I spent a big part of my Christmas holidays completing the remaining missions until I beated the final boss yesterday after a few tries. So, in terms of pacing, it's possible that you find the game too intense (a lot of boss, some difficult side missions). The level design can be quite average and repetitive also... Nioh is a game that made me felt I was in a love & hate relationship with someone with a lot of passion. In 2022, that was the game I've felt the more engaged and passioned about even though that was not my game of the year. why nobody told me that the game is actual garbage ? why nobody told me that the game is actual garbage ? why nobody told me that the game is actual garbage ? why nobody told me that the game is actual garbage ?. nioh is garbage souls like ripp off that does everything worst -trash bosses -trash level design -trash plot -trash graphics. such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash such a **** trash. The popularity of Dark Souls spawned a ton of 'souls-likes' and nioh is considered one of the best. Unfortunately, Dark Souls has become associated with two things - difficulty, and lots of combat. The thing is, Dark Souls is more than just that. It has great lore. It has great atmosphere. It has amazing level design. Its somewhat philosophical. Nioh is none of these things. You could say its close to the later Soulsborne games, but even these have higher polish, better lore, better level design.. It's not Dark Souls, but it's the best soulslike game on the market together with Nioh 2. It took me a lot of time to get hooked to it, the first 3 times I tried I left it there. But once I got hooked, it's very fun and rewarding.. I'd give it 7/10 if the boss designs wouldn't be so cheesy so I give it 5/10. People call it challenging and I agree this title gives a good challenge. However, the most challenging in the game how long can you endure the cheesy boss fights. Those who have played this through know what I'm talking about. If you have any display lag prepare to die a lot. Most boss fights are basically doable in a few tries at least if you have levels and gear set right but some are just utterly stupid. You can many of them easier by using magic and ninjutsu skills but seriously, games that have so small dodge/block/parry windows that display lag can f up your experience are just not good for me. And character development is just putting points in obvious places and gathering obvious gear to mach. BUT this and nioh 2 has its own audience so I'd encourage you to try and see for yourself if it's for you. If you like Bloodborne, Darksouls and such you might like this also. I just refuse to give good review to what's mediocre stuff to me.. Very steep learning curve. Once you learn it the game becomes very enjoyable and not too hard anymore.. Good game, it does enough to different itself from souls series. The only problem for me is that is way way harder then what it should be. Endgame it becomes easier as you make good builds, but the early game is a nightmare. I took 4 hours in the first main missions and only got the third boss with coop help.. the leveling is **** terrible and this is the first game to have ever make me scream until I can't **** speak anymore. don't waste your time.. The game closest to From Software games, but here the story is more drawn we play William who is an Irish sailor who travels which under certain circumstances ends up in Japan to save his dear Saoirse from alchemist Edward Kelley. First of all, this is a Dark Souls rip-off. It takes the core mechanics, but adds a new combat system. That's the good. The bad is that the game is super repettitve. 99% of enemies you fight are either: soldiers (with 1 of 10 weapons), zombies (1 type), demons (8 types). That's it. Some levels have dogs, some have spiders, and 2 have weird jelly blobs, but 99% of the game is fighting the same 3 enemies. This could be fine if the game were 10 hours long, but it is 80 hours with 28 main missions and almost a hunderd side missions. All are linear. And if you try skipping the side missions, you'll end up like me - 100 levels down by the end (from recommended level 250). It's a grind fest and not worth is unless you really love playing Dark Souls.. Souls-like game. Nice combat, nice music. Mediocre story. The game forces you to build your character all around cause essential upgrades like potion max number or backstab belong to different categories of skill trees. That means your character will struggle killing even minor enemies after mid game. The stages are repetitive with minor changes. The recommended stage level is a joke, you get destroyed even in stages where you are 10 levels above. The items and equipment are obtained by drops, which means luck is essential for collecting sets. Bad and overrated game, I regret purchasing it 100%. Nioh is easily the best of the FromSoftware Souls imitators. It doesn't offer quite the same level of quality boss fights as FromSoft's classic, but its combat system is fast paced and challenging, with some high quality level and enemy design. It also features a more robust co-op mode than Souls games, which makes it a far more engaging game to play with a friend. However, Nioh's greatest flaw is its inventory system. Nioh's action is constantly being interrupted by incrementally better loot drops and dull menuing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Looks worse than part 2 but is fairer. As a beginner you get the hang of it faster and get over the first opponents without dying 50 times.. An epic souls like samurai experience that's full of content. It doesn't really make much sense to me how the protagonist speaks English while everyone else speaks Japanese. But that's just a nitpick. The game still has a lot to offer with it's brutal combat and epic bosses and side missions.. An incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo. This game has a lot to offer: - Durability: You can spend a lot of hours by completing the campaign which is huge with plenty submissions and is very challenging. - The possibilities to build your character are incredible huge. You have a lot of melee weapon types to choose from like Katanas, Odachis, Tonfas, Spears, Axes, Dual Swords, Kusarigama and ranged weapons like bows, rifles and cannos. Plenty of ninja skills like bombs, poisons, smoke bombs, shurikens, kunais, ninja scrolls which make you invisible, etc. Also you can use magic like elemental projectiles as fireballs, magic that cripple your enemies, attack with elemental damage, etc. And last but not least you have a Guardian Spirit that provides you with some special attacks, status and use it as a Living Weapon that improve your combat skills for a limited time. The possiblities are almost endless and they are overwhelming at first, but if you persevere you will learn the game mechanics and Runs at 60 fps, very smooth, the combat is very fast, you will need to use your reflexes a lot to avoid your enemies and to connect your attacks and that is a difference from other action rpgs like Diablo where you only click and click. In this game you have to think very fast prepare very well for battles, need to be very prudent (this is my best advice). The set of the game is great and very original. Your character, William is an european samurai who fights japanese demons, so you will invest a lot of time fighting in temples, japanese villages, caves, etc. The only negative aspect of the game is that it recycles some elements and makes it a little bit repetitive. For example, you can fight the first boss Onryoki several times in different missions...I have fought with the guy like 4-5 times in different missions. NIOH is a great game, I have spent about 60 hrs and the game is worth every penny invested because is very addictive and the combat is complex and very spectacular. I higly recommend to buy this game, As a player and person this game has changed my life for good be because I learned to be a more patient, prudent and more determined person.. The critics score is somehow higher than the sequel, but I think if this game was 88 Nioh 2 is like 93 and most people would agree that the sequel is better than the original. Both amazing games though.. Nioh follows the journey William Adams as he fights his way through a fictionalised version of 17th century Japan in order to put a stop to an ongoing war. The similarities to Dark Souls are immediate from the outset with the player having to kill enemies to collect amrati (souls) in order to level up, dying results in restarting from the last shrine (bonfire) whereby you’ll have one chance to collect the amrati before it is lost. It’s also a difficult game, and death can come quickly even at the hands of standard enemies should you make a mistake. The combat itself is, if anything, actually an improvement on Dark Souls with various stances, weapons and attacks to choose from. What Nioh doesn’t have however is Dark Souls labyrinth like worlds that make exploration enjoyable even when you’re many hours in. Instead Nioh plays almost like a loot based dungeon crawler with players selecting from various 30-60 minutes missions that often reward you with an overwhelming number of new items on top of the amrati for levelling up. With so few enemy types, and many missions playing out in very similar fashion this does all start to become repetitive after a while, and with a run time of at least 70 hours it simply goes on way too long.. You don’t HAVE to play this game. If you die in this game, you are FREE! The game itself says so.. I only played for less than an hour. Not my kind of game at all. I would have thought in continuing playing this game if you would reappear in the same place you die but it's not the case and I'm not that patient anymore.. The second one was definitely better, but this one is a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who are into hard action games.. The second game is better, but the first game is still great. One of the best soul-likes.. There's a lot of Darksidephill's in this review section. Even a dude complain about bosses being impossible to kill without glitches? Bro check youtube and see people do them all Level 1 Naked legit. The only thing bad with this game is the uninspired locations and the absolute trash music it has. Other than that, it's flawless. And the best thing is, it only gets better in the sequel.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pros: Controls, gameplay and level design. Quite challenging and online co-op is fun too. Cons: Very boring and uninteresting story that's overly cartoonish. Also too many recycled enemies and levels. Some very unfair 2-on-1 boss fights.. I honestly think the second game is better than this one, but the part 1 is great game as well.. It's so difficult that it's unplayable. I played Souls and Sekiro, but this is on another level. This people are really making fun of me. At least it was free with PsPlus.. I was happy to come across this Samurai gem on the PS4. I really enjoyed the combat and game mechanics, and world building was top notch. I absolutely hated the boss format. A hard game is fine, but unbeatable bosses take away from the whole experience for me. The inventory system was a nightmare too. I spent more time working on my stats then I ever wanted too. Brilliant game that desperately needs a story mode. When games are this hard, I think its great that it provides hardcore gamers the challenge they are looking for, however I believe a large majority of us though would like a ""boss skip"" button.. Nioh was my first ""Souls-like"" game, and it had me hooked very early. For a newcomer, the difficulty rating is ""off the chart"", as I REALLY struggled with the first level. If you're new to this kind of game, you have to throw away everything you know about gaming - ""not getting hit"" becomes your new goal in life. Healing is very limited and savepoints are few and far between - with even minor enemies doing huge amounts of damage to you. With this in mind, I can understand anyone who gets frustrated and gives up - maybe even writing a bad review of the game. If you can get by the extreme learning curve, you'll find a masterpiece ****. You can learn what enemies do, and can predict their behaviour (though fighting groups of enemies is never advisable!). Boss fights are, pretty much, all unique and are all difficult in their own way. If you go into boss fights ""blind"", it's always a challenge to win without at least one death! Still, as mentioned, that's how you learn! The graphics are dark and forboding, but do look good throughout. The story is decent, though not overly gripping - I doubt you'll end up caring too much about the main character, throughout. Voice acting is done well enough, though nothing exceptional to report here. Game performance was great, I experienced no performance issues and no bugs worth mentioning. Overall, this starts as a frustrating game which evolves into a truly amazing experience, if you stick with it!. Graphics 7/10 Playability 8/10 Entertainment 8/10 Overall 8/10 I was not able to finish the game but I enjoyed it.. This game is gonna hit for some and miss for others. I really like the stance system with different specialties, as well as the ki pulse system as a quick stamina recovery and a way to combat zones made by yokai. From there its standard Soulsborne fare in mechanics and whatnot. Beyond that it's very Diablo-esque with its need for number crunching and grinding for loot. Your mileage is definitely gonna vary on that aspect alike. I personally enjoyed it very much, from its setting, combat mechanics and and its multitude of bosses that all provide a fantastic challenge. One of them 'git gud' games. Unlike a lot of souls games, it's nice to look at. Exciting and challenging gameplay. Weird having a white guy as a protagonist in feudal(?) Japan.. Perfect for masochists who cannot get a partner but own a PS4. 10/10 for masochists. As for everyone else, what you will find here is a bland, boring experience. PS3 level graphics, uninspired audio, an incredibly small variety of ennemies and absolutely 0 originality. Team Ninja simply threw a LITTLE bit of japanese folklore into Dark Souls. There really is nothing to see here. And that's without even mentionning the BS difficulty too. This game is a grind fest. Ennemies all have stats miles above yours. That's it. That's the difficulty. There is no getting good here, just getting better stats to raise your chances of victory, dodging the same repetitive ennemy attacks over and over. At some point, you get bored, you lose focus, you get hit twice and you die. You then repawn at a shrine. Doesn't sound too bad, right? Well, think again, because when you die, you lose ALL of the EXP you gained. You have to spend it at the shrines to raise 1 stat at a time by ONE. Die before you spend your exp, lose it. So, it could have redeemed itself by being a cool grinding game in which you see your character getting stronger and stronger, but it fails at that too. Really, there's nothing here. Well, unless you're a lonely masochist. Have fun, masochists!. Phenomenal game the story is so good the characters are all great you learn a lot about the Japanese culture the fluid responsive combat switching stances making builds all the guardian spirits are awesome with this game tons of replayability diablo loot style hack slash with the dark souls bloodborne formula team ninja did a great job the smithing all the crafting options are great i feel like the guardian spirits where very op in Nioh 1 so they kinda toned that down a bit in Nioh 2 and added yokai abilities and transformation to compensate for that the enemies where repetitive the boss fights where not that great the music wasn't the best the game provides great challenge and it's a great action game to play i suggest you pick up the Nioh Remastered collector edition on PS5 it's major fun and the pvp is not that bad either in Nioh 1. I didn't like this game. Bad fight systems, terrible save system, when praying, all the rivals appear again, this is the most worse idea that you could think of. Unsuccessful locations of some battles. I do not recommend the game.. Loved it new gameplay fast action hack and slash good story difficulty is increasing but possible to play. This game has many design problems. Some maps and boss are REALLY terrible and NOT fun, not satisfying. And other problem is this game has fun problem.. Simply put this is the best soulslike not made by FromSoftware. Although I have a lot to **** about it I really liked Nioh experience and already put the second game in my queue. Even though this is Dark Souls set in an Onimusha-esque world, Nioh differs in some key aspects. First of all: stats don’t really mean much in the long run, most people tell you to put every stat at level 20 first and then you specialize your build since the weapon scaling is not very strong. The caveat is to prioritize the stats required for the type of armor you’ll be using since Nioh is all about armor. Each piece of equipment has some random perks. Let’s say you’re using the Brawler Armor Helmet with a “Toughness +2” perk, you kill an enemy that drops the same equipment however his is 4 levels higher and comes with “Omnyo Magic +10,7% (for the Fire Shot Talisman)” and “Damage against electrified enemies +5,3%”; this happens constantly and by the end of each level it’s mandatory to go through your equipment list and sort what to keep and what not because there is a limit. I f*cking hate this mechanic! Leave this **** for Diablo or something! The looting is way too much; is not uncommon for a regular enemy to drop 4 or 5 items and 90% of them are pure garbage! Oh and for the effects used as examples: I’m not making those up, this is how specific they are; needless to say most of them are useless, just keep an eye for the more general damage buffs. Imagine equating all those perks (midgame gear can have 6 perks per piece alone) for 5 pieces of armor plus the 2 melee weapons and the 2 ranged, the Spirit buffs and the useless statuses (I don’t know wtf is Tenacity and I couldn’t care less)… it makes up for a deranged math game. The only sane thing to do is ignore everything except the chosen few effects that matter, namely Close Combat increase. It sure is a mouthful and getting your ass kicked left and right surely doesn’t help. The beginning of the game is freaking insanely hard, bosses are absolute sponges and 4 out of the first 6 have a one shot kill move (Nue’s lighting storm OHKs… so much fun!). You’ll bang your head against the wall until you reach Region 2 and gain easy access to breaking the game with the Bonus Set Armors. These armors gain passive boosts most of the good ones give you flat out 20% attack boost for 4 pieces equipped; so it’s a no brainer! There is absolutely no reason to wear a non-bonus set armor, throw 90% of game’s equipment in the trash right away. Warriors of the West is prominent in Region 2, giving you f*cking 25% close combat damage increase for the full set; you can easily use it to beat the game only shifting the pieces to the higher leveled ones you end up looting along the way. Nioh revamped the Bloodstain mechanic from Souls (AKA let’s see how this idiot died) letting you summon the dude to fight him as an NPC, succeeding yearn the chance for looting his equipment and since everybody and their grandma is using the aforementioned Warriors you’ll easily complete the set. The game also shoots itself in the foot by favoring the most popular playstyle, you’re more likely to fight Katana phantoms than Axe ones for example. Katana is heavily favored offline too since most bonus sets and special weapons are for Katanas. With Bonus Set Armors by my side and better understanding of the Guardians the game becomes a breeze and I defeated most bosses first try. I had little to no trouble until the final boss but it never felt like I became a helluva lot better as a player (as it happens in Dark Souls) but rather I was proper geared. The repetitive nature of the game doesn’t help either. There are only 22 different enemies in a 40-50 hours long game for NG alone. Yes, tongued Yokai was hard but after dealing with him 50 times I kind know his tells. Most sub-missions happen in a section of a main mission map; maps used solely for sub-quests are reused further on in other sub-missions even though you are in another geographic region. The game is repetitive. Period. After **** this much I must say: I loved the game. The flow of the combat with the amazing Stance Change mechanic that cleverly synergizes with the Stamina Recovery move is fantastic! Weapons have different skills for purchase, there are only five yes (plus 2 more types in the DLC) but they feel very different and there is a lot of thought with each one. You can make a mage ranged build specialized in Omnyo Magic, a Glock build (guns and bows are powerful af) or the lackluster Ninja one. There is even the journalist mode abusing the Sloth Talisman but we don’t talk about that; “I pLaY GaMeS fOr tHe sToRy” players item only. What really seals the deal is the atmosphere. The graphics are so beautiful and so colored playing through most main levels is a joy. Despite its problems Nioh is way worth it for soulslike aficionados.. This game is awesome on everything, the story, graphics,music,length and of course the gameplay. you can’t judge it from the 1st play throughout, as you play the DLC and NG pluses you’ll have more and more fun and addiction to it.. Amazing gameplay, probably even better than Dark Souls in that regard.(Not for level design, lore ecc though). I love me some Soulslikes, and for the most part, I really dug this game. However, there are like 3 bosses that were so ridiculously fast and overpowered, I found myself taking multiple months-long breaks before beating it. Now, this is in large part because of my refusal to go through all of the intricacies of menus, items, and skills that you have in your arsenal. I beat the majority of the game solely with combat and struggled despite having strong weapons, armor, and levels. The three tough bosses (Hino-Enma, Yuki-Onna, and Shima Sakon) seemed to go against everything the game teaches the player about combat - though, later, when I actually learned about talismans, like the Sloth talismans, later game bosses that initially gave me similar levels of frustration became jokes. I guess it's on me for not taking t","clunky animations deliver dificulty simply by the fact your enemies have quicker animations than you . boring level design - almost all locations seem identical, however boss design is somewhat an achievement . incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo ."
656.Animal Crossing: New Leaf,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I believe this is the best made animal crossing game. It feels humble and welcoming and is structured in a way that lets the player adventure on there own and make the game feel very rewarding.. The best Animal Crossing. The villagers are fun to talk to, Tortimer Island is fun to play with friends (I wish I had friends). You have the perfect amount of town customization. You can place Buildings and other Public Works Projects, but the town layout is the same. Because you live in this town, you don't control it (coughs in New Horizons). The whole vibe is on point.. this game is fantastic i remember getting this as my first game for my ds at a garage sale the game has so much to unpack and is extremely fun. best animal crossing so far besides wild world!. New Leaf is an Animal Crossing game that goes above and beyond compared to other installment changes. Everything in New Leaf is a bit newer, a bit bigger, a bit cooler, and a lot more customizable. New Leaf takes expressing yourself in a game to a whole new level and in its own way, making any given town different to any other town out there. New Leaf probably won't get those that hated Animal Crossing before to turn heads, but for those that got bored too easily in the older AC games will find a lot more to do in New Leaf. New Leaf is easily the best in the series, and one of my all time favorite games, and while I have experienced a lot of game, I still have so much more to do still.. The best Animal Crossing imo. Perfect map, character-interactions, and gameplay. Wish it had some of the quality-of-life features that New Horizons had tho.. Well... Maybe I just personally don't like animal crossing. It is too slow and grindy for me.Aside from the excessive grind it's a fun game.. This game was awesome it was my childhood game and I just get chills while a listen to the soundtracks 10/10. The game is amazing! Calm and fun, where you aren't forced to do anything. The characters are lovable, the music fits perfectly, and it's a fun calm game at general.. I think to this day it’s the best animal crossing game there is. Much was added compared to the previous versions, town was lively and interesting, multiplayer was casual and fun. Only downsides are it can get quite repetitive but thats kinda animal crossing in a nutshell.. FINALLY THEY GOT FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA TO DIRECT AN ANIMAL CROSSING GAME! He made 'em an offer they couldn't refuse and got his spot in the director's seat for the first time since the Godfather Part III (although I've never seen that movie). His influence shines through in every part of the game. First of all, the weeds of Wild World are massively toned down since this game came out 8 years later, meaning there hasn't been as much time for weeds to accumulate in my town. But also, Tom Nook is clearly inspired by crime boss Michael Corleone. Nook's corruption peaks in this entry, as he scams the player with really expensive houses. They also made him have a more sinister personality which I really appreciated. My only problem with this game is that it lost some of the charm that the other games had, but it's still a masterpiece in my eyes.. My favorite 3DS game, and most favorite animal crossing game (other then original)! If you have a 3DS, I definitely recommend playing it!. 45/100 Animal Crossing New Leaf is an immersive experience full of warmth, where the relaxing rhythm of everyday life lulls the player into a state of quietly fulfilling, mundane bliss, surrounded by friendly faces in a charmingly peaceful setting. The villagers are endearingly vibrant and unique thanks to various personality types, even though their presence starts to feel hollow after some time, mainly due to the lack of many meaningful ways to interact with them and a somewhat disappointing amount of lines of dialogue. Nonetheless, the game partially makes up for it through its astonishingly rich customization options. An immense catalogue of clothes to change your appearance, but also countless furniture and hundreds of items to decorate the interior of your house and the landscape of the town as well, not only through the growth of various kinds of trees and flowers, but also projects that vary from small fountains to new facilities hosting new activities. As time passes, new shops and locals will open allowing the player to shop more, access new features and meet new characters. Slowly but surely, players will discover the incredible richness of the decorative and self-expression options the game has to offer, making for a gratifying long-lasting experience. However, as much as it offers an astounding amount of content and a unique atmosphere, the overly simplistic and excruciatingly repetitive nature of the few available activities, namely fishing and catching bugs, leaves New Leaf thriving more off of ambience than actual content.. An absolute masterpiece ****, it has everything an animal crossing game has ever needed, it isn’t watered down like New Horizons, I would say NL is the most balanced in then series feature wise. The music is simply outstanding like 5pm, 7pm, and even the main street theme! Only complaints are grass deterioration, and the lack of other minor special npcs like Frillard, or Serena but that’s pretty much it. If you have to play only one game in the series it has to be New Leaf.. The game was very addicting. I played it for two hours or more a day, everyday, for months. After a while, it gets really repetitive, so I dropped it. But the time I spent on the island was magical, a really great experience.. To be honest its better than new horizons because of the villagers they have more emotion in this game than the villagers in new horizons but you can't build outside allthough there are items that would look better placed outside but okay I always wanted a steamroller inside my house.. While I may sound like pretty much everyone in the Animal Crossing community, I think this is one of the best AC games, I think the mechanic of being the mayor is one of the best ideas, it really changes the gameplay compared to the games before it. The character customization is great with tons of different options for clothing and tons of new hairstyles (with some of them not even appearing in New Horizons to this day). The UI is easy and simple to understand for new players, and also has that Animal Crossing charm to it of course. The special NPCs are very charming and unique (my personal favorite being Digby), the music is great, and the online is fun. If your thinking about getting an Animal Crossing game soon would 100% recommend you to pick up a cheap 3DS or 2DS and get this game because it is one of my favorite video games of all time, and I think you should play this if you are interested in playing life simulation games, but speaking of life simulation games, I just want to say Animal Crossing is absolutely nothing like Tomodachi Life, they are completely different games with completely different art styles, gameplay, UI, and controls.. 89/100 This game has so much charm and is so incredibly relaxing. Animal Crossing is unique in the gaming industry and you need to play it to understand it. At the beginning you might not understand it, but the more you play it the more you enjoy it. My Score: (9) - Great! -------------------------------------------------------------------------. truly one of the best games on the 3Ds, i remember when i first picked this game up in 2013 i continued playing consistently for almost 5 years and i still find myself checking in on my villagers!. Even though Animal Crossing: New Leaf is not a perfect game, I think it has way more personality, more things to do, and more life compared to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and is the closest you can get to perfection. When I was playing the game for two to three months, I really got board of the game because there wasn't anything to keep me interested. As of now, there are less buildings, shops and other places you can visit, villager dialogue is far more repetitive, there are less special characters to interact with, and most of the ""new"" features added into the game are honestly nothing special. Sure, teraforming gives the more creative players more freedom when designing their town, but for the interactive players, myself included, are held back by these selling points of the game. Also, the updates in that game are re-adding things from New Leaf that were already in the game at-launch and were spread out monthly to pad out development time and adding things in the game so that they can give the developers more time to implement things at their own pace. Sure, in New Leaf, there was only one update, but it added substantial amounts of content. And in that game, the execution was so much better because of how they envisioned the game. And taking your mark as mayor sure helped to change the conventions of the franchise and gave players more freedom with what they can do. And in this game, there are far more special characters, lots of fun mini-games to play with yourself, or with friends, and much, much more. And since New Horizons was held back by a global pandemic, it was stopped from being the best it could be. And since New Leaf was developed when there was any compromises, they didn't have to worry about delaying content implementation. And New Leaf just is much more special to me, and I will continue playing it for many years to come.. Amazing! Amazing! And Amazing! The only thing is that the music in the OG GCN game is better, but in place, it puts you as mayor on a town.. Animal Crossing: New Leaf kept me interested until the end. It's a very good and interesting game. If you want engaging material, then look no further. With Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you become a mayor of a town. I would recommend Animal Crossing: New Leaf to any fan of the genre.. This game.... Its quite powerful, To Anyone who has never played it before you need to, the game itself is great but there's something else that is just really amazing. It has this memorable spark of nostalgia after a few months of playing and that never goes away. Which is why this game is a 10 out of 10!. I love this game its really fun its a lot (in my opinion) the best one in the series, better than ""New Horizons"". [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really fun, one of, if not the best 3ds game. I have put 100's of hours in and it still has something new to offer every single day. Every villager has so much character, which I can not say about new horizons, in my opinion the best game in the series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I understand why so many people love this game, but to me, it feels like an app I have to check on every day for an hour and do nothing gameplay.. A very soulful and memorable game, whose virtual world, every sound and every melody remains in the heart for life. Thanks for this miracle!. the pinnacle of the series, and one of my all time favourite games. i've sunk so many hours into this game for a reason. i'll always love the memories i made with it.. New Leaf brought animal crossing to a whole new generation with marvelous splendor and arguably perfected the gameplay loop. Incredible game anyone can enjoy, however derivative it is of its previous entries.. What can be said about this game? On paper, the game sounds like it should be fun. You become a mayor of a town in which you move in, you get control of designing the inside of your house and eventually the outside, and you are in charge of beefing up the town and bringing in new residents. It seems almost like it should be a Sims or SimCity type game. But then you start playing. First, you’re provided with a tent as you’re told you need to have a down payment of 10,000 bells for them to get you a one-room shack as though you just moved out west. Then once you finally get your house, Tom frickin’ Nook has the nerve to say you now owe 39,800 bells for the place and you can’t upgrade the house at all until you pay it off. Oh and don’t worry those expansions will be even more exorbitant fees. It would be okay if in like the Sims you had real ways of making money but oh wait, you don’t. You have to shake trees for fruit, go digging for fossils, pick up shells, some of the most mundane tasks imaginable and then the shop offers you a couple hundred bells if you’re lucky. And don’t forget that while you’re collecting things you have limited inventory! So after you pick up a couple items (your required tools count as pocket space) you have to run over to immediately sell or plant your items, hopefully it’s the right time of day and they’re open! As for upgrading the town itself, your assistant tells you a few Public Works Projects you can set in motion, but oh wait those cost hundreds of thousands of bells, that you’re pretty much expected to come up with out of your own pocket. You can set up a fund for the community to pitch in but they either don’t even notice that this is going on or they’ll give you 2 bells. Wow am I on my way now! The villagers are pretty annoying, many of them, especially the people at the stores that you have to interact with constantly, will say the same few lines over and over again, and you can’t speed through the lines of text! And sometimes you’re tasked with finding certain villagers but they’re not always at home, they’re busy wandering around the place at the same time you are so you’re most likely going to go through town several times before coming across them. Oh and then the real question. Why are you the only human in this town? And you’re not even given the option to be a different creature, you can just choose human boy/human girl. Time in-game is real time, there is no speeding up. You want nighttime? Well you better be playing at night. You have a contest during the day? Too bad if you’re not home to play. Time and day randomize the store items for you to buy as well. So if you want that fishing pole or butterfly net you have to check the store each day, crossing your fingers that it’s in stock today. And then there’s hardly anything to ever buy in store. What is the point?! Not to mention the awful clothing choices, where if you’re playing as a boy you can still be offered skirts and dresses?, where you can tell the only real reason those are still being sold is to cover up their lack of choices in that department. And not only that but you can also use your wallpaper colors and patterns to change your clothing patterns, like what?! At the beginning, you think this game is kinda fun until you get several hours in and realize that you’re expected to do the same thing day in and day out, it never changes. And you realize that you don’t have any real power in this town as mayor. The loan-shark Tom Nook has more power in this town than you. This game is just a major time-waster where you can do real world chores digitally. I don’t see the appeal of this series and I’d rather spend my time playing a game that has meaning, a story, and is FUN! (Or doing my chores in the real world, thank you very much.) This is more a game for little kids, people who don’t want anything out ****, or hardcore Nintendo fans.. Best Animal Crossing game of all time, or maybe even one the best games of all time. The 4th installment of the Animal Crossing franchise is an endless experience that can allow hundreds of hours of open-ended gameplay. New Leaf is something I'd recommend for many people. ****/NOaSdO5H91M this game **** its just a mario party wanna be.. Is July 2020. While everyone is playing AC new Horizons, I had the crazy idea of buying New Leaf for my 3ds. never played any Animal Crossing game before and I thought, why not. ? lets see whats all about. I Still love my 3ds so one more game to play on it. An oh, boy ..! I get it now ! Im obsessed trying to make my town the best I can. this is a 10/10 game. One day ill buy the switch version, but for now I think I have years of fun on my 3ds. Great game for sure! it relaxes me. is peaceful and calm. is a pleasure to pay your loan and to get money for town development,. Is someone by any chance is reading this and still on 2020, want to buy this game, let me tell you is absolutely worth it. And maybe even more than New horizons, as this one is compete and all content is there. no need to wait for more content updates. The entire game with all items, bugs, fishes, etc is here and I love that as a retro gamer.. It's a great relaxing game with few faults on its own. It could be better in a lot of ways however. Music, ambiance, exploration, better dialogue. They took a lot of the challenge out of the series with this game and I think it would have been better if people had to work harder for bells and rare items. Getting rare valuable bugs and fish on the island should was game breaking and removed the need for every other bell making method in the game. Animal behavior was too repetitive and should be more like the previous titles or better.. I had a lot of fun with this game. The chracters have charm, the gameplay will never be boring, the grafic is nice and the soundtrack too.. Thank you, loyal citizens of my town, for donating a combined total of 5 bells towards a new trash can while I spend hundreds of thousands of bells in order to complete it. Truly, if it weren't for your help, we'd never be able to throw away our garbage.. About eight years ago, Nintendo released this beautiful masterpiece with very few flaws to criticize over. There are native fruits and island fruits, which seems the island fruits have disappeared from the next title: New Horizons. I have enjoyed the role of mayor and because I just got the game a month ago, I decided to time travel backwards to its release date to experience everything, event for event. I have enjoyed minigames, decorating my town with every fruit (some I got from Harvest Day), and using features like Dream Suites. This game however, is not perfect and some things did bother me, such as why an putdoor bench could not be placed outside after buying it from Nook Emporium? However, this added charm to the house interior because no longer did I see a house as a house, but each room for its own story. I was sad when I realized island minigames, island fruits, Gracie, Brewster did not make it to our island adventure practically foretold by tortimer island. I saw there was also a campsite where I vould buy stuff, a flea market where I could put stuff for sale for any villager to consider...this was a charm in New Leaf that sadly never moved forward. How does pocket camp, a mobile game, have more fruits than a Switch title (not that all fruit and vegetables came to New Leaf either)? Nintendo should consider making New Horizons a superior title, combing all of what Animal Vrossing games have and could offer. I am thankful for this experience, and I wish New Leaf wasn't superior to New Horizons in my experience, but until all of this could be incorporated there, I prefer my town compared to my island.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is unbeatable. There’s so many things to do everyday. The shops are really cool and upgradable. The characters have really fun personalities. The holiday events are something to look out to every year. All the easter eggs in this game are unbelievable. I have played this game for 6 years straight and even the day before ACNH came out, i found new info about this game. A straight 10.. Animal Crossing: New Leaf may very well be the king of casual gaming. Having arrived in your new town by train, the local residents mistake you for the mayor. Despite your pleas to the contrary, they are completely convinced, and you hilariously end up taking upon the role. The quirky, humorous charm of the game starts here and pervades every facet of the adorable world you’ll be a part of. The goal of the game is simple but open-ended: expand your town and furnish your house. If the game has one shortcoming, it’s that the various activities you can take part in gradually unlock as you progress through the game. The first few days in particular give you very little to do besides catching bugs and fishing, but after that, there is a massive amount of content that awaits. Massive is no understatement: yes, the main activities include fishing, catching bugs, planting and harvesting fruit, buying and selling items and furniture, and doing favors for residents, but there’s so much more here. You can inflate prices of items and convince residents to buy them on the flea market, shake beehives out of trees and carefully swipe the bees for a generous profit (this can be tricky at first to do without getting stung), acquire a golden shovel that allows you to literally plant money trees, open a coffee shop that you can work at, and even travel to a tropical island that has extremely valuable bugs, fish, and a slew of mini-games that provide you with medals to buy special items (not to mention exotic fruit you can swipe mid-game). Making money (or “bells” in this series) is a central part of Animal Crossing: New Leaf. You’ll take out loans to expand your house, which you’ll pay back with large sums of bells. Public works projects (e.g. bridges, police station, coffee shop) cost bells, as well as items, tools, and furniture. The great thing about the game is that most activities are very viable for making bells. There are extremely valuable fish and bugs, as well as fossils that sell for very good prices. Shaking trees often results in items and bells falling out, not to mention the aforementioned valuable bees. Even hitting rocks with your shovel will occasionally result in valuable ore or again, a ton of bells. There’s even a sort of stock market with turnips in the game that can yield incredible profits. Even more impressive is the fact that the game world is constantly changing without you even doing anything. The game plays out in real time, so if you are playing at night, it’s night in the game, which means you can do certain things like attend nightclub shows that you couldn’t do during the day. As the seasons change in real life, the seasons change in Animal Crossing, which affects the availability of bugs and fish, the look of the town, and what events take place. Special events keep the game exciting. On April Fool’s day, a character will show up in your town and impersonate villagers, and you are tasked with figuring out who the impostor is. Every so often, fishing tournaments are held. A fun spin on trick-or-treating takes place every Halloween. Overall, New Leaf is pretty close to being the ultimate casual video game. There’s an astounding amount of content here, and one could easily spend hundreds of hours exploring all of it.. Figured I'd put a review up for New Leaf as I had signed up for metacritic to review the new game (New Horizons). New Leaf is aguably the definitive animal crossing. There's a few things missing from previous games, but nothing major. And the additions make it well worth the purchase. The game is absolutely jam packed with content, and improves upon the previous games in every way. They also went and made a huge downloadable update that gives tons of new content in the game, including fully playable minigames; with the return of a new entry in the puzzle league series which is amazing @.@. Only nit-pick: the public works projects are really slow and kinda annoying to get going as you have to hope you randomly get one from the npcs, and then it's fairly expensive to get it set up. I never ended up getting certain major buildings in the game. All in all, New Leaf is the animal crossing game I'd point people to when they ask which version they should play. And is one of the few games I've spent hundreds of hours in.. This is exactly the sort of game that I would love. I spent months being excited for the release of this game. I had never played animal crossing before and was excited to experience everything the game offered. Unfortunately, the game is poorly designed and there is only one island PER SWITCH. So while I was working, my girlfriend got the mesume and the shops on her profile. But because we share the same island, when I went to play all of those tasks had already been completed. I don't get to play significant portions of the game, it is as simple as that. The game progresses when I am not playing. It is an awful system that makes my girlfriend feel bad for playing and me feel bad for not playing. The gameplay is good, but I have lost all interest from the fact that so much was done without me. I don't know how this game company thought for a second this was an okay thing to do. This is good game that is unnecessarily ruined by an awful decision. I do not recommend this game.. This game is very innovative and fresh due to the role of the mayor and new features and content they added. Must play.. I love the game, but I think the graphic quality is improvable and more things could have been added to the video game. But if you want it for a small console, honestly it's fine!. wow! i love this game! it's cute, addictive, funny and warm thing!! the best part of AC. This new game in the animal crossing series made multiple leaps for the series as a whole. To me, it was my first animal crossing game and is what got me into the series as a whole. I highly await the new animal crossing game coming out in March. I would recommend this to parents who want to have a fun time and also for kids learning things such as city management and paying off things and having to work for your money. These things are why I believe this game is amazing for everyone.. I wanted to love this game. Its pretty, the characters are... nice, the music is amazing, and it had a lot of effort put into it. I love this game for these reasons, and i think it is a good game, but its just not for me. I dont find much of what you do entertaining, as it can get repetitive, the characters are all the same and quite bland, and, for me at least, there's not much to do.. This game is super good, even when it's over 6 years old. The game is super adorable, it's super addictive, and is one of the most engaging Animal Crossing games. Even though it is super addictive, you can't play for more than 2 hours a day because there are only some things you can do. But this doesn't impact the rating because the pros overpower the cons by 5 times.. It’s Animal Crossing. Always 10/10! But to elaborate, the games puts you in the position of mayor. You can change ordinances and build ships. You can even construct public works projects. This game is all around amazing!. I love this game. Such a huge stepup from the previous games while retaining that animal crossing charm.. I do not understand this game, i literally do not understand why people like it, why would i want to send cards to my own villagers, i can put horrible things about them and they would say they love it and is kawaii, seriously wtf maybe is because in my country people dont have 3ds because are very expensive and i dont have any friend with the game.... but the game should still stand on it's own without online, and it doesnt, this game is literally ""why didnt i buy **** valley or a harvest moon game, is the same **** thing with better characters and actual fun things to do not just collecting and selling the same fruit everyday"" EDIT: BTW i have +50 hours in the game dont tell me i didnt try. I have a 312 hour save file for this game, as I still play it regularly after 6 years. This game is the true pinnacle of the life simulation genre and I don't think a better game in this genre will ever be released.. New Leaf is designed to be played in small chunks, every day, over a very long period of time, and stresses this fact by slowly unwinding events in real-time. Yet it is apparent from only a comparably short time — as opposed to months and years — spent with the game that Nintendo has done a great deal to address the complaints of its Wii predecessor, and provided plenty of exciting new features and buildings to enjoy. Taking on the role of Mayor is a great innovation to the series, finally giving the player a real reason to keep coming back time and time again. It's a shame that powers of the Mayor are slightly limited to installing benches, instating pre-designated laws and occasionally building bigger venues, however the vibrant visuals and delightful gameplay of New Leaf stop this from ever becoming too much of a problem, making New Leaf the latest essential member of your 3DS collection.. I think that the Animal Crossing games just might not be for me. I find the gameplay kind of boring and a little bit pointless seeing as there is no end to the game.. Incredibly engaging gameplay. I feel like there's always something I can do - whether it be working to make a new project, collect bugs/fish/etc, plant, design, or just hang around with the villagers. My favorite aspect is that it runs on a true to time feature so that each new in life day there's new content.. Animal Crossing: New Leaf isn’t just a game – it’s a whole new world full of lovable characters and insurmountable charm. A world where you'll sometimes find a Metroid or a Triforce in a fortune cookie, where you can arrange your surroundings to perfectly suit your tastes, and where the Mayor still chips in at the local coffee joint. Every day feels different from the last, like you’re living out a separate (and wonderful) life with your wacky villagers. There’s always something to work toward, something to look forward to, something to be proud of or to remember fondly. New Leaf is a truly magical game, one that you can easily expect to invest hundreds of hours in over the course of years. Anyone with access to a 3DS should absolutely give this game a try - just be prepared to kiss your “real” life goodbye.. I have been playing this game at least 15 hours a month since 2012. Sometimes I get bored and play only around 10, but months I love it get to 50 or more hours. This game is amazing. It is the only game I can play for years and still be my favorite game. Do not get in to this game thinking you'll be playing hours a day, because you won't. You can do small tasks every day like fishing or catching bugs for the museum or money, picking fruit for money, finding fossils for the museum or money, and talking to villagers. These tasks can range from 30 minutes going fast, to hours long taking your time and having fun. You can also do tasks like picking fruit, fishing, catching bugs or trading items with villagers. These may seem like boring tasks but are really fun. The music for this game is also amazing and makes you super relaxed. Amazing game and only 20$?! Defiantly should be one of your first 2/3DS pickups.. The best life simulation out there so far. Makes significant improvements from previous games including seemingly small quality of life changes like donating multiple things to the museum, switching tools with the D pad instead of bringing up your inventory constantly, Being able to stack items like fruits in your inventory, etc. One of the biggest additions are Public Works Projects which can be used to improve your town, these are mostly aesthetic but some Projects have their own uses. You will find yourself grinding for money even more than in other games due to the works projects giving you another thing to pay off. The dialogue is not as interesting as the GameCube original but that's the one thing the original has over this game. The Welcome Amiibo update also adds Happy Home Designer style touchscreen furniture moving which is very convenient.. It's a good relaxing time, and fun to keep up with. For about 5 months, which is a long time for a videogame. Nothing that will wow you, but still a great game.. With impressive visuals, tons of fre","the game feels humble and welcoming and is structured in a way that lets the player adventure on their own and make the game feel very rewarding . because you live in this town, you don't control it (coughs in New Horizons). the game is amazing! Calm and fun, where you aren't forced to do anything."
657.Diablo II,"Dungeon crawling at its best. Many have tried, and many have failed to recreate the magic this game brings.. Phenomenal, Timeless Production The best Hack & Slash in the history of video games. what can i say, literally a classic! A King of h'n's games. I have propably 6k+ hours in this game and every year at the end of december i'm coming back and play this masterpiece!. This is what makes Diablo an important IP. Despite its age, Diablo II is still fun to play and have much more depth than Diablo III and IV. It is true, since I still feel the same joy when playing this game, just like when I played it for the first time at the age of 5.. I'm probably the only person I know who prefer Diablo 1, but D2 is pretty good still. The sheer fact that Diablo 2 Resurrected is one of the best ARPGs one can play today is a great showcase to how solid Diablo 2 mechanics were.. if only we knew what we had at the time. nothing but downhill from here...... best H&S, not perfect, but dam this game is still awsome in 2023. need more words but. Yes this game is a top 10 ever for me it's a must play for **** my god the childhood memories I had with this game. Fantastic game with a lot of replayability, great itemization and trading is vital to the game. Not perfect, but an excellent game. In case you are tired of the base game definitely check out the mod called Median XL, which adds so much AAA quality stuff it is just crazy.. Epic! Nothing more is needed to say. There was nothing like this game before, and unfortunetlly, there probably will never be game like that in the future.. Hands down the best game ever made. The father of all ARPGs. Infinite replayability. It's a game that will be talked and played for centuries.. During my time in the army, I had a hard time holding back my desire to play Diablo 2. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Not only for year 2000, maybe one of the best games of 21st century. A definitive example of how a hack & slash ARPG shall be. All I can say is this game gave me first carpal tunnel syndrome when I was 14 in summer of 2000.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I started diablo games with this game. I love this game...I think its best diablo game.... What's there to say!? It's THE ledgenday Diablo 2, from the time when Blizzard was the best game studio in the world.. One of my most favorite games. The game is fun, builds are fun to play around with. There are many of different characters to choose from.. Who can name all items when you see them? That is the definition of love, you knew it.. Masterpice! this game is one of the best game i've ever played! Story is God. Combat is intresting. Gameplay is very very good. I can not discribe! After 22 year this game still wonderfull. play it to find out what am i say! Every thing are nice. you can enjoy it. Thank you of my friend. He told me about this game.. The game is good, classic, you don't need many words to describe Diablo. But damn it, what kind of necessary mechanics were there, with inventory and stamina.. very addictive very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. An improved version of Diablo with tons of content a game that can be played forever. Played on Xbox Series X - I played through Diablo III multiple times with my friend and decided to play through Diablo II: Resurrected. Have to say, I see why everyone loves this game so much. It really is the perfect balance of loot grinding, gameplay, aesthetics, and all that sweet RPG goodness. Perfect time to get into the game if you have not played it before, try out Diablo III too.. What to say about this game? The king! The main reason I started to play video games back in the day. My all time favorite.... This is an amazing 2020 game, I play it in single player and online. It has a lot of nice things like the gear you can find, and the design was pretty cool for its time. It's just good and better than all of the last 10 years. If only they would remaster this, but keep the game as it was. I mean, back in the day I played the **** out of D2, but with today's displays, it's not really playable anymore. 20 years ago, solid 10. Now? I guess 11, compared to the recent remaster? (even the old servers are more stable then the remaster servers, nuff said?). Wonderfull graphics. Gratz VV. Please, bring more quality of life. More staches pages, more options for respec .... Bought and refunded the game. I'm one of the players affected by the AVX debacle. This is more of a critique on the tech aspects of the game and I find it very lackluster as well as Blizzard's policy of changing the system requirements at the 11th hour without clear notification to its player base. Such a disappointment.. Diablo 2 was the best ARPG ever made....Resurrected is even better. 100/100 masterpiece. 4k Ultra 60fps with controller support....plays perfect and looks incredible. The detail is just so well done. Worth every cent..I will be playing it for years.. Can’t lauch the game , beta was fine . Don’t buy for now if you have non avx processor. The nostalgic feeling I get form thinking about this RTS trend setter for so many games. Made me start getting into the genre I will never leave. Just epic.. I played DIablo 2 at original launch back in the 90s and remains one of my favorite games, but why do you think I'm giving it just a 5? Even though the remastered textures and graphics are good, and a few minor quality of life tweaks there remains significant issues and new issues that really hurt the overall experience. 1) The addition of controllers are making it waaay to easy for loot thief's to spam A to insta-pick up loot on boss runs, its basically just spam that button and grab loot, this is almost as bad as the auto-pick up hack back in the day, honestly ~ this is a major oversight. 2) Server instability is still a problem, many of the issues should not have happened considering this is the same engine, with just a few minor things removed like TCP/IP so the server problems shouldn't have been so bad, and still are causing issues joining/creating games even several days after launch. 3) Loot drops are still extremely bad, yes this is a loot grinder game but I don't remember it being this bad, my zon is level 55 right now and I'm STILL using level 9 - 27 gear and the loot level range drops are still fairly low level, this didn't happen as much in vanilla D2, sure even at level 60+ in HELL you could still get some low level drops but you would still find items mostly within your level range, in D2R I've seen mostly consistent low level drops even in higher difficulty modes. 4) They had a change to redesign and fix some of the worst issues with the game, such as the horrible Belial boss fight which is notoriously bad and some classes have a nearly impossible struggle to solo forcing them to group up just to beat the boss...same with several other bosses which for some classes really struggle, class balance has always been a bit of an issue, especially with Sorcs. 5) It's 3 days since launch, and already seeing hackers and even dupers meaning Blizz did not really increase security or anti-cheating detection really at all, several known DUPES are still a huge problem especially with Gems and Runes. In closing, Diablo 2 is a great OLD game with a fresh coat of paint and it looks great, and feels exactly like how I remember but these issues are holding it back from regaining it's crown as one of the best ARPGS.. Being a console player I never played this. Not only do I get to play this game that I hear/heard so much about, but I love when games include a way to switch the graphics. To hit a button and see how the original looked compared to what they did now. All in all. I might actually buy this for multiple consoles. Perfect? I don’t rate a game a 10 because nothing could ever be better. It’s just a fun game that allows a whole lot of replay value.. Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!! Thanks !!!. Imagine re-selling the same game for 40 meanwhile they **** to players who already have the game, do not make them able to play with the new players. In SC they did it, in w3 refunded they did it, here, no. They are evolving, just backwards.. Best RPG ever. The Father of all modern RPGs. If ppl here give 8,8/10 game a 0, well it tells more about them than a game itself right ;). Absolute trash. Braindead, monocellular gameplay that is only ""addicting"" because you grind for better RNG gear solely so the game goes by faster.. Its a classic. There isn't a game I've jumped though more hoops to just play than this one.. A masterpiece and a classic made in a time when making games was art. Still played to this day 20 years later. Waiting for the remaster now.. Diablo's 88 metascore is a bit weird because as far as i can remember this game is flawless and definitely better than the original Diablo. Maybe that's just my opinion.. This is one of the best sequels in videogame as it surpasses its predecessor in all categories. I often compare it to Terminator 2 in movies and it is not surprising that this game has still a great and loyal fanbase. There are frequent demands and rumors about a remake / remaster (A remaster is announced at the time of writing). It is much bigger, has more playable characters with unique abilities, better graphics and is one of the best loot porn hack and slash RPGs of its time. The story starts after the events of Diablo 1 were the hero of the first game had successfully defeated the menace. However it is not that easy to destroy such a powerful evil entity. After some strange events a new hero is on a journey to uncover the truth and experience an even greater adventure. You can chose 1 of 5 available characters which are: Barbarian (melee combat specialist), Sorceress (spell caster), Amazon (ranged combat), Paladin (melee with benefits) and Necromancer (summoner). These are just oversimplified descriptions. Each class has unique abilities and I played all of them at least to the final act. Each has their benefits and the playstyle differs. I will point out that a lot of thinking and care was made to make all character classes different but rewarding. If I had to chose my favorites I would go with Necromancer (and my summoned army:-) and Amazon (Death from afar;-). You gain experience points and at a level up you get 5 ability point to spend on strength, dexterity, vitality and energy and a skill point to learn a new or improve an already learned character skill. There are multiple builds and the character development depends on class (Example: Would not change the sorceress to melee). You can hire a soldier to help you in each act. The loot system is the bread and butter of the game. You are constantly on the hunt for better equipment to improve your character even further (in addition to leveling up). The game gives a good challenge and if you beat the game you unlock even harder challenges. There are also quest lines that develop the story and get you some good rewards. The story itself is good and satisfying. They did more than was necessary and it deserves credit. I like the twist and realization what really happened after Diablo 1 (Took me a while and I am baffled that I did not connect the dots sooner). The presentation was another strength at its time. The game looked and sounded amazing. The developers put a lot of care and hard work into the game. All these things together made it an incredible experience and it is no wonder that it is considered one of the most influential games of its time. The loot porn formula still works today in the Diablo games and other franchises like for example Borderlands. The constant challenge to get better equipment / a stronger character and developing the different classes kept me going for hour after hour. Overall this is close to being the perfect sequel and is still worth playing today. It is a classic game of its time a rightfully deserved its place in gaming history. Remark: The add on Lord of Destruction makes this game even better with 2 new classes (Druid and Assassin) a new arc and many smaller improvements. It is sold as bundle and should be rally cheap.. After all these years still one of the best lan games. Great graphics, sound and gameplay.. A very fun arpg with one of the best OST among all other games. Loving the sound designs too.. affixes of mobs unbalanced in damage and type. Painful end game bordering on ridicule. How this game can be considered a must today is laughable. a tank and spank for sissies. I never played the first game, but Diablo II is maybe the most played game of my childhood. Eh how many times I got in trouble because I skipped first hour of school to play just a little more.. Everything the first Diablo game made perfect, Diablo II improved it! I spent hundreds of hours playing this game, fighting through dungeons and leveling up. I only stopped, not because it became boring, but Diablo III came out. For me Diablo II is still the best entry in the franchise. The game is sheer fun, even 20 years after its release!. Plenty of enemies, weapons sets, but pretty take time to achieve full set. Graphic are just fine at year 2000 nothing special. Story is amazing, heart breaking with movie scenes on another level. Map is well managed and you can even have it still on while you are playing. Bosses are unique, but pretty bad to killing them again and again. They should be death at once. But, its good to XP in other way.... Main bosses doesnt show up again at least. There are many of the enemies, you can just pick. Many of the locations too, with specific lore about them. Spell system is acceptable, develolpers was creative, if you want to shoot in town, just you cant. ,Not in town, or ,not here, thats what hero will tell you. The have in the mind lots of things.... There are side quest too like every RPG. And many classes like paladin, deadly assasin..... And, there is one big plus, your own bank. You can just keep somenof your money in the bank, but its limited. Like stash for your armor and equipment. Good soundtrack, make it even deeper do enjoy ans play. For me, best is Rogue camp music. Exactly, the wilderness. Really peace of art there. RPG, action game is just good all the time. I can give full score. 10/10 well done Blizzard. Awesome and addictive. Maybe a bit lacking in content if you don't like the grind, but it works perfect as it is.. THIS HASN'T AGED WELL, BE WARNED. Your attack button is your move button so half the time you try to attack you move. Highlighting a target with your mouse and attacking does not guarantee that you are actually aimed properly [this is separate from your chance to hit stat]. You have verrrrry limited storage and you drop ALL YOUR GEAR when you die. Oh god it is a frustrating mess that doesn't deserve the hype, it's all nostalgia goggles except for the art design and atmosphere, which are excellent. this game has become the very standard of quarter-view action game and still the best of these in 2020. its rival is Path of Exile, Diablo 3, and god damn ai bots.. I don't think its possible to be bored of this game. While it might not be as dark and heavy in tone as the first one, it more than makes up for it with all the improvements it makes in gameplay. There is just something about it that really makes you wanna slash demons and loot stuff for hours.. In case you forgot. In 2020 it is still one of the best RPGs that has come out. Nothing more to say. Essential.. Played on PC. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. Is an amazing game that until now April 2020 i still play on single player and battle net. Have a lots of enjoyable thing such as gear u can find, and the design was pretty cool for its time. Just is good and better than all thing Blizzard has been making this last 10 years zz. A classic RPG. This is the quintessential Diablo experience where the world is falling apart and only a tiny sliver of hope remains. Gameplay is somewhat repetitive but the loot more than makes up for it.. Charming visuals and good atmosphere. Gameplay is decent enough but not particularly compelling.. Extremely weak game. The same locations and fully the same dungeons. Extra boring story with none of a really charismatic NPSs. It`s playable with friends, but with friends even to paint a wall would be interesting. Incomparable to a really decent rpg Divine divinity for example.. This game never **** me in... For me it's ok, but not a great one. Maybe it's not for me kind of game I think. Probably one of the games I've returned to the most, and put the most hours in. I've build every character to max level, farmed out the gear. Quit playing. Returned a few years later and redid it all over again. I've done this probably about 4-5 times now, because that's how good the game is. And after playing Diablo III, I'm due for another replay of Diablo II, for sure.. They don't make games like this anymore, and it's a damned shame. Diablo II is a masterclass on how a professional AAA game should be made. It expands upon the successful features of its predecessor while cementing seminal new mechanics like sockets, runewords, skill trees, and skill synergies. The gameplay is seamless, fluid, and intuitive. Easy to learn, difficult to master. With all of the hallmarks **** age Blizzard title represented in full force. Exceptional production values, the best voice acting I have ever heard, spare but pitch perfect writing, music that lavishes every scene with atmosphere, and the best itemization I have ever seen. All held together with addicting gameplay that keeps people coming back to this title after nearly twenty years. If you love RNG loot, theorycrafting, roguelikes, and fantasy roleplaying games, you are almost certainly going to love this game. If you enjoy co-op, trading, or PVP, the online lobby system and online gameplay is excellent. In fact, at the time of this writing, there are more people playing Diablo II online than are playing Diablo III. Diablo II has dozens of imitators, and after twenty years no one has managed to surpass it.. I've played this game many years ago. But it's still looking interesting for me. One of the best games of my childhood.. Diablo II is a really great Action-RPG, I actually played Diablo III before this one and I still enjoy this one! I haven't played all of the classes (I haven't even finished the entire game) but from what I have experienced, it's amazing. The Assassin uses powerful finishing moves; The barbarian can specialise on weapons; The druid uses nature on their side and can even turn into a werewolf! Despite all of these pros that makes this a good game, I can't say this game doesn't have its faults. If you're playing Diablo II on a newer OS ( I am), you're going to witness one of the worst frame rates you ever experienced. And if you're playing with a hardcore hero (Permadeath character) you might die from the terrible frame rate. In Act I of the game,I encountered a bug. The rogues that can be hired as allies may suddenly stop following you. Overall, the pros which I have stated heavily outweigh the cons. Final score: 9/10. Still one of the best RPGs of all time. Just love it. I find myself playing it again from time to time. There isn't much to say besides that this is one of the best hack-and-slash games ever made. The world, loot, combat are all amazing. At the time of release, it revolutionized the genre and made many people spend months on griding loot and levels. To this day, I regard this game as the king of hack-and-slash, yet to be dethroned.. Nice game is for 2000 year. It has exellent gameplay and graphic for that time. Diablo II is a classic of hack'n'slash, and one of the best videogame sequels of all time. A lot of people prefer it to modern titles of this genre and are playing it 17+ years after its release.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. I wish they'd never come out with diablo 3 and just did some updates to improve graphics. Diablo 2 was Much better than 3 and I miss playing it. I had at one time every set in the game I had tons of great stuff and even used d2jsp to trade. Game let you either focus on items or specific themes to champs. My favorite character I ever made was a kickassin. I had a few accounts with many different high level characters because it was fun to have and build different ones. The game wasn't about grinding a single character but allowed you to play for fun instead of just to grind.. Some would argue that it’s still the highest watermark of hack’slash action roleplaying, thanks in part to the more recent Diablo III being something of a fumble. Where D3 was the kill’n’loot treadmill as over-rehearsed science, D2 feels like more of an art. It’s strange, even discomfiting, of setting and not overtly mechanical to play, but still heavy on the whirlwinds of death and fountains of loot compulsion loops. Of course I feel it turned into an exact science after years of sustained play, but that doesn’t dim the eerie, high-speed pleasure it still offer. Despite being unapologetically hung around the inherent mindlessness of the sub-genre, Diablo II feels like a true journey where other recent ARPGs can feel like blood-splattered hamster wheels.. This is the definition of Hack and slash, the genre doesn't get any better than this. Great gameplay, great character development system, great storyline, great classes, graphically of course it's old but the talent that was involved on the creation of diablo II is something that's almost impossible to find in any other hack and slash or even in any other RPG. If you haven't played this game you had no childhood.. A new patch makes Diablo II playable on OS X, and thusly the first time since I've played it in 2002. It still holds up and is a tremendously better game than Diablo III. Tonally consistent, the music engages you like no other Western-style action RPG, and the brooding mood is infectious and immersive despite the 800 x 600 resolution graphics. Compared to D3, the portal systems (buying scrolls), punishment of death (retrieving a body and a removal of gold) gives adventures a tension and weight not usually felt in Diablo III excursions. **** is not working for me at the moment due to the just-released patch, but single player alone is worth the meager 10 bucks for this game.. I got a copy right when Diablo II came out. And i played it for 10 years after its release! Not 10 years streaght, of course - but it was like my every-third-game. I played the bejinkees out of it! Played alone, played with my friend, played it in my sleep. Oh, the fun we had. This is an exaplery application of game design. A superb example. Even though my copy is taking a break - i wouldn't hesitate for a moment to whip it out, install, and kick some monstrosities around. And it's 2016 almost! Sadly, my disappointment in Blizzard's latest developmental trends destroys all such desires.. Classic game so it may be a bit difficult for new gamers to enjoy, considering the dated graphics and comparatively slow gameplay to modern hack and slashers such as borderlands and Diablo III. That said, none do the genre justice compared to this gem. You have five classes, thirty skills per class, 100 levels to grind up, three difficulties, plus hardcore mode and a ranked Ladder mode, the replayability is endless. While you do end up specializing in only 5 skills but then end game, each class has several builds to play with.. LOL, I'm reviewing a 11 year old game. Does that tell you how amazing it is? 11 years ago this very week my friends and I played this game nonstop for a week at my house. Ah, memories.. I bought this game the day it came out. I still play it all the time. My only wish is that the D2 devs and blizzard north could've had their Diablo 3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A boring clickfest with unimaginative environments. It's just fighting and collecting stuff. The game is quite hard as well. There are better RPGs out there.. I didn't try multi-player, but I still think this review isn't beside the point. Diablo 2 is a great single-player game, I know every bitmap of it, and I would lay may hands on it anytime again - if it wouldn't take so much of my precious time. It has excellent sound and music, its own kind of beauty, and ""levels"" that are interesting every time you replay the game. I love the atmosphere and the almost perfect gameplay, with lots of interesting play styles available. Almost perfect, because: Even after lots of patches, the skill tree system is not beginner-friendly. Instead, to shape a successful character, you need to read guides on the web, learn from the experiences of others. Or you will lose very much time when you find out that your choices are punished by the game. Also, you cannot really NOT die in this game (although there is a hardcore mode). O, I will never forget these moments where everthink seemed fine - only to find myself hit by a nasty fiend with some weird combination of enchantments, taking all you life with one stroke... such a game cannot get a 10. Still, I know every bitmap of it.. Timeless classic. One of the few videogames that can be classified as ""endless"" in which you just can't get enough. I was immersed from the start in its dark atmosphere, with environmental sound and adult graphics, reminds a time when games takes itself seriously, not insulting the player's intelligence. Epic characters, randomly maps, great difficulty progression and rewarding drop encourage us to continue ""another run"". Even today still having decent graphics and with the Hi-Res mod you can play it in modern monitors on **** or even better LAN with friends. Diablo 1&2 were developed by Blizzard-North but Diablo 3 from the WoW team destroying the groundbreaking formula in favor to a kind of ""Linear MMO"" with nothing in common; if you want more from the original team is Torchlight in different shape, Path of Exile if you don't care about Offline, and Grim Dawn with, Online, LAN & Offline, and MODS.. First time playing it am completed entire game, but am unable to finish it second time. Its because am feel that only first act look good and then it going downhill. Diablo 1 and Torchlight 1 are best and am rather play them again than replay D2. Am actually played D1 several times and few times D2 its first part until desert. Its unable to keep me longer. Actually with Dungeon Siege 1 I have the same problem where first half of game was very interesting and then am pushed if forward bored like hell. That diversity in not necessary rather they should make more interesting dungeons in gothic atmosphere. Am actually have some slight plans to full replay D2 by new character as there is no better H&S there. By comparison to other I may tell that Diablo 2 is actually best game so my initial boring to it raise from 4/10 to 8/10 Its just not better H&S RPG than old good Diablo LOL. This was my first ARPG and I was so confused, coming from Baldur's Gate this can't be considerer an ""RPG"" but it has ""something"" that tucks me playing day by day. Its environment, music, and FEAR has no paragon with any other game. Later I've noticed about the term ""ARPG"", but that was because Diablo II has established the rules for it and all other ARPGs has copied those addictive mechanics. What can I say about my first ARPG and the ""King"" of ARPGs? Well 14 years after I still playing it time to time, which is much to say considering Diablo 3 is here and it was totally boring after finishing because the lack of stats, skill tree, deep, dark environment and all that the original saga has, if you want a REAL successor of Diablo 2 search it in Torchlight (the original creators of this saga), but Path of Exile has the real, real, real dark feeling in each pixel that can be considered the REAL successor of this game. IMO I choose Grim Dawn (from the creators of Titan Quest), that has all the feeling of Diablo 2, with modern 3D graphics and the offline mode and editor, it has all!. The graphics were great for the time the game was released and are still okay considering the game is 14 years old. The co op gets quite boring and you only go through it to unlock higher difficulties and to level up, other than that I don't think anybody actually plays co op. Once you hit the mid 90's most people PvP and that's really the only thing left to do for the game at that point, because everything else is too easy. Of course I would walk people through the game occasionally and level them up and what not, but PvP is where it's at. Now for the bad, every 6 months or so, or at least it was like that last time I played the game, they reset the ladder, so basically all your ladder stuff goes to non-ladder. You can play in non-ladder but it's filled with cheaters, so it's rather pointless to do. Then the bots that sit there and spam 24/7 has failed to be addressed for as long as I can remember, but of course why would Blizzard care about an older game anymore? I mean if you can get a copy really cheap then it's worth it, but otherwise I wouldn't invest too much into it. If they'd stop resetting the ladder then I would of rated the game higher.. So im writing a review for really old game because everybody is reffering to it when writing reviews for new instalments of Diablo series. Diablo II is a bit overrated. It was far worse than Diablo I back in the day of its release. It had way worse climat than previous one. It didnt included interresting story compared to D1 and its awesome ending. It had ugly graphics (i remember the shock when i first saw D2... i was just.. disgusted). It was detailed but .... SOOO UGLY. The gameplay was almost identical than the first Diablo which was a good thing. Verdict: The game back then deserved solid 8/10 and now i can give it almost same score which is fantastic achievement by a game this old.. The best game that I ever played in my life. It's a pillar of my gamer life, the style, the economic system inside the multiplayer. THe classes, the characterization, spell tree, WOW. The best hack 'n' slash created by the Blizzard.. Diablo II wasn't as dark and as atmospheric as the original Diablo, but it had much more content, much more variation in classes and different gameplay and skills and it was just so much fun. This is one of my most overplayed games of all time, I must have finished Diablo 2 like 30 times, all the different classes, higher difficulties, different runs, the replayability was extremely strong with this one, especially if you add local multiplayer to the mix, things were just getting insane and it's still fun to this day. I still prefer the first Diablo, but even this one has the moments, Kurast Jungle and especially the entire Desert Act 2 was fantastic. I usually don't care about cinematics, but the movie parts in this game were just incredible, still remember it until this day, the rise of Mephisto I got goosebumps every single time I saw that. The last good Diablo game, D3 was a joke compared to the previous 2. 10/10. An RPG game for the ages. Fun fast paced combat with a variety of different skills and items. Diablo II has a great story and a good dark atmosphere to go with it. As it is over 10 years old it has aged and has a few things that are outdated, but still it holds up after all these years. Amazing replay value.. I've tried and tried to get interested in Diablo and Diablo II after hearing so much about them for so much of my life, but I've picked up each about 5 times and both has simply failed to","despite its age, Diablo II is still fun to play and have much more depth than Diablo III and IV . the sheer fact that Diablo 2 Resurrected is one of the best ARPGs one can play today is a great showcase to how solid Diablo 2 mechanics were ."
658.Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus,"One of my favorite games when i was a kid. It was hard but fair, and i had so much fun beating it!. 9 Nothing else to say. The game is amazing, better than Oddysee. The gameplay is still simple but enhanced with new features. the ability to possess many more enemies is my favorite thing.. A larger, more open playing area and more forgiving difficulty level than the - occasionally infuriating - original while maintaining its interesting puzzles, quirky well animated graphics and amusingly twisted sense of humour make for a challenging and fun platform based puzzler.. Assembled over a mere period of 9 months, Abe's Exoddus takes the core principles which made its predecessor so special and pushes them even further, expanding upon the straightforward and yet compelling gamespeak, possession, and platforming mechanics to produce a sequel worthy of a place among the best of its genre! The environmental art and FMV cinematics are a triumph in worldbuilding and enrich Oddworld with a sense of scale that makes Abe's journey feel truly epic, meanwhile the addition of a much-needed quicksave option makes the challenge of this title far more accessible to new players.. Such a nice game. Brings back memories. I'm reviewing these games just to not forget them.. Abe's Exoddus is a real tribute to games like ""Another World"", ""Flashback"", ""Prince of Persia (1989)"" or ""Heart of Darkness"". It is an elaborate mix of the 2D platform genre with quite ingenious puzzles. Although it doesn't have the magic of ""Abe's Oddysee"" it expands the already established formula and adds more layers that make it more complex than the original. If you liked games like the mythical ""Lemmings"" where you must guide your companions to their salvation or doom... you will enjoy. Of course it also has slight hints of stealth, which will put us in tense situations and will make us go slowly with great caution. You can also manipulate your farts and use them as explosives, with Abe's mental power, xD. Ignore the haters and trolls... Abe 2 is a great game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very atmospheric and great Puzzle Plattformer with the most original ideas ever.. This is quite a masterpiece! Beautiful visuals, sound, level design and fun puzzles! I LOOOOVEEEEE how this game is a very unique platformer! If you are a person who likes strategy and adventure games, then this game is definitely for you (my recommendation)!. Lorne Lanning is a god, and he rules his Oddworld Inhabitants. In the 90s Oddworld Interactive was an ambitious collective of visionaries in an era where big name developers dominated the list of best games ever made. Suddenly we were whisked away to a new fantasy world where tension, strife, atmosphere, industry, and ecology were all well-represented and intricately woven. Never before in my gaming history had I been so enchanted by a world that was new to the table. Oddworld is dark comedy in video games at its finest. Sometimes you need to take a break from saving mudokons and cackle maniacally as you blindly lead a group of them into a meat grinder.. I LOVE this game. I want to thank Sherry McKenna e Lorne Lanning for creating this amazing World. I love every single aspect of it: the sadism, the adventure, the irony, the sound/music, the backgrounds, the fact that the player character can also possess other creatures, the fact that the player can kill **** of the best games ever. 10/10. Absolutely amazing game. Fixes the issue with the first one, the lack of saving points. But adds a lot of new features and puzzles. Again, the maps and everything in the game is beautifully finished. The art direction is amazing. True PSX classic.. One of the most loved games of my past is Oddworld. heavily puzzle based for a platform game yet they did it well! giving the option to possess and control your enemies is what made this game shine the most in my eyes. With the strange yet wonderful creatures of Oddworld, this bizzar world really stands out from other platform games. At times you will need to think fast on your feet or meet your demise while others take timing and patience. you have a choice to either save your brethren or leave them stranded or even dead. Although a direct sequel to the first, the second does not disappoint. new features adds a greater experience from the first. wonderful game and story over all.. This is one of my favorite games on the PlayStation. The content is original and really fun. Just the right amount of difficulty, great scenery, and mind-blowing character development makes this a game of the decade. I wish there was a rating for 11/10.","abe's exoddus expands upon the core principles which made its predecessor so special . the game is an elaborate mix of the 2D platform genre with quite ingenious puzzles . it doesn't have the magic of ""Abe's Oddysee"" but expands the already established formula ."
659.Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate,"In my opinion, this one is the best MK since MK9, and for me, one of the top MK, aside from the first three.. Gameplay 8/10: A good fighting game that delivers everything you expect from a MK title. When It comes to solo mode it gets predictable after some point even on higher levels of difficulty. The tower mode was fun but your enthusiasm won't last. Online VS was nice and challenging. Graphics 8/10: Good graphics and improved a lot compared to previous title. Fatalities show some disgusting details and that is very positive since you expect pure gore from a game like Mortal Kombat. Story & Characters 6/10: Huge variety of characters but you can see some core characters missing or being secondary to the main story. Story mode is fine but the finale of it points to a wrong direction.. Despite this being an extremely overdue review, Mortal Kombat 11 is easily one of the most broken and unbalanced online video games ever created. The online community is annoying which is to be expected with a game like Mortal Kombat. The characters are all fairly ugly which is incredibly unsurprising. The gameplay feels like everything we've seen before but toned down to pure un-enjoyable buggy mayhem. The cast also does a fairly mediocre job at voice acting for this game, with the best job being given to Jade and her voice actress (who is coincidentally my favorite character and my main). Thankfully, this game is no longer being supported if not barely supported by NRS who hardly did a good job at fixing anything pertaining to this game when it was in its prime. Just a few skins magically made the bugs, glitches and piss-poor balancing vanish. (Hint!: It did no such thing).. **** game, **** story, **** gameplay, **** online, **** fatal blows, **** meter burn, **** everything But Johnny Cage cool.. Another great entry into the MK series. While its not a ton different from X, its got a great roster continues to produces a good story and top notch online play.. Probably the best fighting game series out there, but replay ability is low unless you play online and compete- still fun to try as always for Mortal Kombat. Great graphics, but it seems to be like other mortal kombat games, I feel like it lacks a little more spice in the arcade and story mode, which are the modes that interest me.. Going out with a bang. NetherRealm closes one universe of Mortal Kombat with an ambitious blockbuster action movie finale. Classic Kombat with fine tuned game mechanics keep the old school feeling flawlessly while adding new characters. Story mode, Tower mode (with multiple character endings), online mode and Krypt exploration mode make up for a good time for any real Mortal Kombat fan. The lack of a few characters is a little annoying but the excessive customization options with all the buying options outside the completed game is a let down. All in all, another great entrance in the legendary series.. Mortal Kombat 11, the latest installment in the iconic fighting game series, brings a mix of excitement and reservations to the table. While some gameplay decisions may raise eyebrows, and the grind for character customization can feel excessive, Mortal Kombat 11 is undeniably a solid addition to the franchise, offering an impressive array of customization options and a satisfying amount of **** gameplay, though subject to some questionable decisions, largely retains the core Mortal Kombat experience that fans adore. The addition of the Fatal Blow and Krushing Blow mechanics injects a layer of strategy into the fights, providing opportunities for comebacks and dramatic turnarounds. However, the emphasis on crushing blows occasionally results in an imbalanced gameplay experience, potentially frustrating players seeking a more skill-based **** of the notable highlights of Mortal Kombat 11 is the extensive customization options. The game excels in allowing players to personalize their favorite fighters, from costumes and gear to special moves. The depth of the customization system adds a layer of personalization rarely seen in previous iterations, allowing players to truly make each character their own. This aspect significantly enhances player engagement and replayability.Despite the wealth of customization options, the game introduces a grind element that might be divisive. Unlocking certain features or items for specific characters can become a time-consuming endeavor, veering into the territory of excessive grinding. This decision could potentially frustrate players who prefer a more streamlined progression system. However, the grind does contribute to a sense of achievement when certain milestones are reached.Content-wise, Mortal Kombat 11 holds its own. The story mode, a staple in recent Mortal Kombat games, continues to deliver a cinematic and engaging narrative. The Towers of Time and Krypt modes offer additional avenues for gameplay, extending the overall playtime and providing variety beyond the standard versus matches. The game strikes a commendable balance between narrative-driven content and diverse gameplay **** conclusion, Mortal Kombat 11, while introducing some debatable gameplay decisions and a grind-heavy element for character customization, excels in key areas that make it a worthwhile addition to the series. The wealth of customization options allows players to create unique versions of their favorite fighters, and the game offers a commendable amount of content to explore. Mortal Kombat 11 may not be without its flaws, but its strengths outweigh the drawbacks, solidifying its status as a compelling and enjoyable installment in the iconic fighting game franchise.. really good game but a few of the characters are garbage, the dlc characters and story is epic, fire god liu kang skin is quitte epic also with its gamlbing system (the shrine), the boss kronika is kind of a dumb idea but i respect it. And i was filled with joy when noob saibot was mentioned. the absolute best mortal kombat game ever with amazing story mode! ed boon and netherrealm made best decision of all time rebooting the entire franchise! anybody calling this game mid or trash! you all wil be erased from existence by Liu kang himself! #mortalkombat4life. Absolutely awful on so many levels... The story is horrendous, but since this is a fighting game, it doesn't really matter that much. Gameplay-wise, it feels very slow, breakaways ****, fatal blow is cheap and it kills the flow of the gameplay because it's so long. The fact that you have to look at it 95% of the matches doesn't really help either. There's way too many wakeup options and you're constantly in a position where you have to back away from your opponent, in spite of being at an offensive advantage, because they might do a wake up attack or breakaway and pu ish you for punishing them. Who the the hell thought this is a good idea? There's like 4 or 5 in game currencies, the towers of time a is an annoying, boring, disgusting grindfest. So much so, that they even decided to put AI to fight for you. Almost as if they knew it **** so they gave a way to grind without having to play. The online experience is awful. Toxic community, crappy connection. There's no fun to be had in this game.. A true MK in the spirit of the MK universe. The vanilla game is not worth it because with the DLC players have to pay triple the price. Decent combat animations and mechanics still inferior to the Tekken franchise and not comparable but overall OK. Nice levels and character default skins. What is truly keeping it from being a true 8/10: locking fatalities, skins and features behind the crypt, towers mode and micro transactions. Making the players spend more playtime to grind online to increase the playtime metrics for shareholders. This is an a$$ move and doesn't go unnoticed by true gamers. Look noob kids are OK with anything that publishers shove down their throats but true old time gamers that have played the originals are not.. Great graphics and lots of characters. Only physics at a worse level. Too many currencies and boxes.. The story It's very good, all I have to do is clear the towers and the krypt, but otherwise the story and the game are very good.. Looking good, good soundtrack, history is not good enough but it’s ok. BROKEN CHARACTERS, BROKEN MECHANICS, FATAL BLOWS, KRUSHING BLOWS, TOO MANY WAKE UP OPTIONS.. a very great a & best fighting game to this date i love the mechanics and characters story is good enough and graphic looks insanely good.. Graphics is ok, but too many clown skins + lootboxes. If compare graphics with MK1 (2023) - it is the same.. For me, the MK 11 Ultimate is way better than the MK XL. The locations are stylistically better than the designs in Part 11. The interface is nicer. And in general, everything is better than 10 parts. Of course, Mortal Kombat will always be Mortal Kombat, and I like Part 10 more in terms of atmosphere, but stylistically, it's better than MK11.. For sure the best fighter, love the new mechanics, the game is very fluid and its got amazing graphics, but theres too many DLCs and theyre not cheap, specially when you get all of them, and I really dont like having to pay extra to continue the story.. Feels very bland, no original designs especially for the women. Story is very bad, and gameplay is the most boring thing ever. This franchise DIED ! Shame.. Storymode is very good, graphics good, online balancing characters are bad, there is a garbage(weak chars) and overpowered like Jacqui Briggs and Cetrion, overall i like Mortal Kombat Games cant wait for Mk1. because the graphics are really good for a fighting game. The story line is really good and you can tell they out some thought in it!. To be honest, as a newbie who just started to play Mortal Kombat, the tutorial seems to be very difficult to catch(maybe it is just me). I feel the game is only playable for those who have played the previous series and keep playing the new ones. For anyone who is new to it, I suggest you play it at someone's home and make sure you will like it before you buy it.. I have a up and down road with MK11 that turning into now one of the better PS5 ports. What started as a terrible Switch port, playing it on PS4 to not liking it as much as MKX to playing it on my PS5 and seeing the incredible graphics improve HEAVILY. Because of this version it is Mortal Kombat as it is with great gameplay, a fantastic soundtrack, great customization, a great story, but the ONE fatal flaw I have is micro transactions, but besides that overall, I have grown to appreciate so much more ever since I first played it in 2019.. I would say this is the best MK game overall. Story mode is fantastic, one of the best cinematic experiences in a game. I feel like they went above and beyond with it. Top-notch presentation, PS5 version is a lot sharper on my 4k screen than PS4 Pro was. Combat (sorry, kombat) is fluid and has lots of depth. Only complaints are the grind for loot. It's borderline ridiculous sometimes. I've spent almost 11 hours in the Krypt so far, spent hundreds of thousands of koins and I've only unlocked like 6 fatalities. Why go through all hard the work of developing intricate fatalities if barely anyone is going to end being able to use them? It would be nice if you could at least know what type of loot you're grinding for, instead of it all being completely random. So much of the loot is crap. Also the gap in CPU difficulty modes is a bit too much. Medium difficulty feels like a pushover and hard mode is pretty damn intense until you really learn the advanced techniques in the tutorials. It would be nice for some middle ground. Quibbles aside, MK 11 is still fantastic and I love it. The strengths of the game are huge and overall they nailed it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gud game. Unfortunately it's a 7 because it doesn't contain gay sex scenes.. For me as a casual mortal kombat player this was the best iteration of mortal kombat. Tons of custimization and content, loved espacially the character towers with cutscenes, brutalities and more to unlock for each individual character.. Okay presentation and gameplay are the main highlights but the story is just way too all over the place once you play aftermath.. Easily worst MK game in very long time, maybe even worse than 4. Costumes are awful, especially for female characters. And the character design itself is equally bad. Only character that looks good is Noob Saibot.. Roster is awesome DLC is cool story is mid and sub zero makes me want to hurt myself.. I'm not usually into fighting games but I must admit, I find the allure of Mortal Kombat hard to resist. Most fighting games barely have anything even resembling a story to them, whereas Mortal Kombat has an excellent, cinematic, fun and charming storyline. The gore is also excellent, bones breaking, organs being destroyed, parts being removed and fatalities that will make you wince. I only wish that each character had more than just 2 fatalities as that would have made me like the game even more. the combat itself is also extremely satisfying to play, everything has weight, and feels amazing when you start putting combos together, and the animations for the moves look really amazing. the graphics are another strong point, the game looks beautiful, with great use of shadows, lighting, reflections and light sources. the facial animations are really excellent too. they add a lot of charter to everyone, you can see their micro-expressions and the lip syncing is some of the best I've seen. All in all I love this game, I've Platinumed it on the PlayStation and 100% it on Steam.. This is easily 10/10 Mortal Kombat game. The level of detail and amount of content is insane.. The game is not bad, but **** you with your politics. Positive Review is not available in your region.. This game is so fu**ing amazing . Graphic, game play , and...... Best beat 'em up this gen and last and it will take some topping. Graphics are out of this world, smooth and simple gameplay as this genre should be, packed roster, exciting arenas and a very good campaign on top of it all. Crypt isn't up to much and the outfits could be better but overall a great game.. One of the Best mk games i dont know why there is people complaining anyways its fun. The game is good, but as a fighting game it's a fierce unbalanced trash. As a person who understands fighting games, I can say with confidence that if you want the best fighting game experience, then it is better to play street fighter or tekken. Of the advantages of MK is the plot. As a fighting game - the maximum you can play with friends or other nerds while drinking beer.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game on the PS5 is flat out a must own. It is an excellent fighting game, and online modes + the ability to customize characters is awesome. Controls are also extremely responsive on the ps5, graphics are excellent and sound design is great. Now the cons are that the game should have a bigger roster (Like MK Armageddon if anyone remembers). Even though the sound design is good, soundtrack should be more like the movies. Lastly I wish their studio would hire a proper writer for a comprehensive story, I really feel like MK can have a captivating story if done correctly. Overall, 4.7/5. I've played hours of this game since I bought it weeks ago. Please keep on adding DLC's!. Garbage game, redused to 0. Worst in the series. Story is crap, moves redused to minimum, speed droped, characters look like ****. is a great fight game, nice story, amazing fatalities, I have a fun time with it.. Most content is locked right out of the gate. Any skin has to be unlocked with towers meant to make sure you never advance far enough to get to the skin or item you want. The other skins are events and have no guarantee you can get any of them. Boss fight were made to make sure you don't finish the game or even get a chance at what ending you want. Characters already in the game like Sindel or Shao Khan are DLC and not even unlockable unless you pay up. Don't cross the picket fence and give WB permission to create more games like this.. Game is completely made for people who don’t know how to play. You can lose to anyone as long as they’re mashing some buttons, DON’T BUY THIS GAME; COMPLETE GARBAGE. Mortal Kombat as always, good game and they know to make a game... Well done.... Overall very disappointing sequel to MK X, idk why what happened but this is just bad.. This game somehow manages to be worse than MK4. MK4 at least had new cool characters, this game has nothing but ugly looking character that hardly look like their original versions.. One of the worst mortal kombat games of all time. 60fps and modern graphics doesn't automatically make game good. It has one of the worst looking characters out of any MK game. Awful costumes. Character roster is also weak. Where's Sektor, Cyrax and Smoke?. Mortal Kombat 11 provides that next gen itch whilst it satisfying that urge to rip your friends spinal cord out. The Mortal Kombat franchise has seen many different renditions however with Mortal Kombat 11 we finally get to see movie grade animations running at a smooth 60 frames per second in 4K which makes the game look stunning on any TV. The gameplay itself is like any other Mortal Kombat uppercuts,fatalities etc.. however the changes are with the inclusion of the new champions. They bring a host of freshness to the franchise. Master them up to achieve pure satisfaction. The only cons that I have with Mortal Kombat 11 were the overall price of each individual DLC which can cost upwards of up to $200 just to unlock a few particular characters. That and the fact that the second story line is yet again another DLC. As of now Mortal Kombat has become some what of a cash cow in the DLC space which is disappointing. I recall the days of having to grind and grind to unlock new characters those days are gone the thrill of seeking out achievements is gone. I’m not a fan of paying for things after paying for the game… really **** how we have become like this.. Nevertheless my conclusion is that Mortal Kombat 11 has some of the greatest graphics I’ve seen on the next gen consoles with superior and polished gameplay and for me that’s a massive Win Win.. a very good horary fighting game , get you back to the past with the new technology. These game is nothing less then perfect! The graphics are stunning, best fighting game of all time. I could literally play these game for hours a day. Would highly recommend purchasing these game to anyone.. Overpriced. Over hyped. Too many menus. Too much grinding. Too many load screens. Terrible menu navigation mechanics. Too many laggy effects on specific opponents or arenas. Weird network synced animations for online play. Awful (not funny, not over the top) storyline. Obnoxious boss fight. Unhelpful tutorials. Terrible customization options. Inaccessible tournament variations. Poor matchmaking. I’ve spent hours in this game, not because it was fun but because I thought I just needed to get better to enjoy it. Now I realize it’s just an atrocious game. The learning curve isn’t because of long combo strings and fast play, it’s because of poor player education, poor menu navigation, tons of load times, and low quality added content.. I love Mortal Kombat 11. Probably my favorite fighting game of all time. Only problems are with how expensive the Kombat Packs are.. Great graphics great mechanics but story mode is not good as MK X and MK 9.Also Noob Saibots voice is not good as MK 9.Other than everything is fine.. Definitely the best mortal kombat game played a lot of fighting games in my life this is definitely one of my top favorites story is amazing combat is the best in mortal kombat series the ultimate mortal kombat experience. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Lots of content and replayability here-I enjoyed the story mode (`10 hours) with a variation of characters to play as. Multiplayer can also be a blast-it can be a bit of a learning curve for newcomers to the series, but the payoff is definitely worth it. This is an overall great fighting game that I would recommend!. Dude this game has so much content and you get 12 new characters from mortal kombat universe and movies. Learning how to preform bight damaging kombos are fun to do. The story is insane and there so many skins in the game that you can earn.. I am in utter shock at how fantastic this game is!!! On the PS5 I have not seen anything like this and the game play is some of the best I have played in years. I want to mention I am not a Mortal Kombat player at all but after playing this I am lost for words. The only reason I got this is because i was told it has one of the best fighting campaigns ever made and I want to tell you.......Extrodinary!!! I want everyone to play this game and experience what I just did and how did this go under the radar. This is a AAA game at its best with all the bells and whistles. This game has everything you could ask for and more. I am now a full fan of Mortal Kombat because of this game alone!!! PLAY THIS GAME!!!. This Studio want to make their game unappealing to their main consumer base, men. MK11 had the worse character and armour design in any fighting game ever and the kombat get worse with every revision after 9.. Rereleaseing the game may help you change a score, but people dont forget.. Amazing graphics, nice game gameplay, soundtrack is like a injustice 2 but characters skins is poor and repetitive, broken servers, too much focus on competitive mode does not attract other types of players and always online with microtransations. 5/10. Simply THE BEST fighting game on PlayStation or XBOX consoles... content, fun, game modes, graphics, crossplay, no complaints.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Overall, Mortal Kombat 11's story is very well done with no confusion. It's one of my favorite fighting games. I love how Ed Boom keeps the classic MK fighters such as Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Kitana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Mileena, Johnny Cage, Sonya, Shang Tsung, Jax, Shao Kahn, etc. Playing multiplayer is a ok experience but the net code is not very well. I also like how there are LGBT characters in the game such as Mileena who is bisexual, and Tanya who is also bisexual. In most MK games, there are females who's breast is over sexulized and a little too much. 8/10 rating.. Money grab - half assed dlc that barely wirth it, and a collection that isnt ultimate . the base game was ok but adding crap dlc to milk money that iz a bad move. Worst story we've ever had in this franchise. Pathetic roster. Awful single player content and progression with god damn RNG and failed concept of towers of time (lol someone actually thought that consumables and modificators is a good idea lmao). AI battle (no comments. A mode for those who hate to play this game so much that they let it play for itself. And I thought I bought a full-fledged console game, not a freaking mobile crap). This game is one of the worst in a franchise right there with MK4 (just for different reasons). More than year passed since release of this **** yet the game is still unfinished bullcrap. I hate developers of this ****ass game with big passion. Mortal Kombat died back in 2006 with MK Armageddon and this game is **** in golden wrapper.. This game looks mindblowing on PS5, and it plays like a dream. The only downside is the horrible grind to get all the costume pieces. If you are a completionist this game will be your worst nightmare. If you can let go of needing everything, you will enjoy one of the prettiest and most satisfying fighters ever. Story mode is classic over the top ridiculousness, and it absorbed me in a way few fighters have. In my opinion, this is a must have to showcase the power of the ps5, along side demons souls and Spider-Man. A great MK and fighting game in general. Brings something very unique and fleshed out to the crowded fighting game genre. Production and online battles are top tier in quality. Although the most perfect MK to date, there are other things that are not as awesome. I wish it was not such a tiresome grind to unlock the excellent extras, such as skins and shifts to character balance. I also wish there were more of the MK characters as opposed to non MK characters. I prefer ermac, smoke or reptile to the 80s action movies characters. They are cool but a less important use of dev time imo.","despite this being an overdue review, Mortal Kombat 11 is easily one of the most broken and unbalanced online video games ever created . the online community is annoying which is to be expected with a game like Mortal Kombat . the cast also does a fairly mediocre job at voice acting for this game ."
66.Quake,"man i used to be so scared by this game as a kid, 20+ years later I still am as an adult - that's how you know they nailed the atmosphere.. I liked the game. But alas, time is endless. And the games have already moved to a new level. Worthy of attention in its time. Unfortunately, not in 2024.. this game litterally changed **** you know normal movement keys wasd? a pro player from quake was being ready for the tournament and the prize was the id software owners bugatti and this player thought using the arrow keys was annoying you have to play next to your mouse so he did a weird thing he used wasd and he dominated the competion and thats how wasd was invented in 1997. What most reviewers and indeed game designers don't get... Is the sheer athleticism of the the quake experience. While so many titles try so hard to emulate reality, Quake is a pure reaction-time, map knowledge in-ur-face game of kill quick or die. That's what makes it fun; it's not stupid vr, it's he who shoots first,... Wins.. A milestone in game development, but by 2024, all it has done, has been done better. Again and again.. It is an almost perfect game, although it was born as a copy of Doom, it improves it but is enhanced to 100, it is easy to handle, it is fast, it is not boring, it is fun, it has tons of action but it also has its dose of terror that feels real, of which You are on your computer playing and the big scare is already in the setting without a ridiculous ghost appearing, the way they animate the villains how they walk or how they move, how something you do to them affects them; the weapons, everything related especially to the audio is perfect, regarding the visual although it is not comparable with the best that exists at the moment, it does not feel old, its graphics are very good very very good even if it came out today. It is a game in which you really come to relieve your stress and have fun, not to give you more problems or stress you out more, as other games do, basically here what matters is the development of your skill in the game rather than spending thousands and thousands of hours deciphering maps or nonsense, without a DOUBT IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME, that perhaps to give it 110 I would remove a couple of villains that I don't like, I would add others, I would add some history and that's it.. To me, Quake is very special and one of my favorite fps of all time. I still play it, from time to time.. the gameplay aged a lot better then doom. its really fun to skip parts of levels white rocket jumps. in beat this game twice in my first playtrough the gane didnt save that i beat chapter 2 for some reason. Quake lives in my blood. This game is amazing. The guns feel nice to shoot, levels are pretty good and an awesome dark fantasy theme. to be honest, it's not mindlessly shooting. You have to think what weapons to use etc. Play it now.. Good game even for todays perspective. Game has good balance which allows to comfortable game expirience on every difficulty level. Concept when game is divided into squence of levels, and after death player respawns at the begining of the level is surprisingly good. Game levels is not too large and not too small, and all of them is pretty challenging. Game has unique estetics, good gameplay dynamics and balance, but no interesting plot. Game is good, genious for its time. 72/100 - from todays perspective, 100/100 from historic perspective. Highly recommend for gamers with short time window for gaming sessions like me.. This has polygons,,,,,,,,,,, also NiN???????????????????????????????? 10/10. OG Quake is a genre-defining FPS with fast-paced action, atmospheric levels, and multiplayer that changed online gaming forever. A classic masterpiece.. One of the best FPS games of all the time! The graphic is something incredible for 1996! The shooting is perfect never rude like doom or duke nukem's first games! A revolution for the videogames' world and for ID softworks that previously only produced doom clones.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. The next step up from Doom by ID, an engine that many would take and modify to make games such as Half-Life, truly shows the genius behind Quake and just as Doom was the grandfather of the FPS Genre, Quake would take it a step further into inspiring developers to take a shot at making their own games, with Quake being the foundation for those franchises.. An absolute legend from the past. Thanks to ID software for this masterpiece during my childhood.. I played this for the first time recently (nightdive remaster). For being the first 3D FPS this is also one of the best FPS games ever. The singleplayer is so fun. There is great music and enemy design. You are able to die quite easily and the level design tries to trap you in difficult encounters. The weapons are all timeless classics, except maybe for the DLC ones.. it was my first shooter game and I was playing it on PlayStation 1. I was just blown away by esthetics , graphics, music and what's most importantly - gunplay.. I had tons of fun with this classic in the late 90's. I liked the gritty, grimy, gloomy environment, the hectic kombat, the creepy music, and the loathsome monsters that popped into juicy, bouncy gibs before the wrath of my phallic rocket launcher. Quake recently received an update including Steam Achievements, plus the original two mission packs for free, plus two brand new mission packs on top of that! And if that weren't enough, check out mods like Quake 1.5, Arcane Dimensions, Seal of Nehahra, and Epsilon.. The peak of id Software. Best multiplayer and campaign to date. Grenade launcher and rockets are your friend.. one of the best shooters of all time enoughf sed. 1v1 me in quake. pew pew pew. I really liked the game Gameplay Dynamic and fun, the whole arsenal of weapons is used depending on the situation My favorite weapon in the game Shotgun: Double-barreled shotgun Shotgun - Double-barreled shotgun is suitable for fights with light enemies and they are quite fun to play with Grenade Launcher - Rocket Launcher Best used at medium to long range so as not to lose health from the explosion Nailgun - Super Nailgun Handy for all types of enemies but it quickly runs out of ammo, easier to use on huge ones with a lot of HP The shocker is mainly used against bosses due to the rarity of ammo, but on some maps also against easy enemies. Plot: Quite simply, we need to destroy the main boss that breeds monsters Level Design: Very good, Looks good and uses all the mechanics and innovations Traps and different types of doors, Levels are mostly completed in 1 - 5 minutes due to the well-designed design, because of which you intuitively find the silver key and golden key and the doors to them and the exit +Highest Dynamic +Cool Weapons +Interesting Levels +More Gore +Very FuNNy Gameplay +Very Good Design Monsters +COOL-Nice Design Weapons 10 Destroyed Quake is 10. english below Das Spiel ist sehr ähnlich (etwas nachgemacht) wie Doom. Ein grosser Unterschied ist, dass man in alle Richtungen zielen kann (also auch oben/unten), was natürlich mehr Skill benötigt. Die Waffen, Gegner und Levels sind alle gut, aber man kennt es schon von Doom. ________________ The game is very similar (somewhat imitated) to Doom. One big difference is that you can aim in all directions (including up/down), which of course requires more skill. The weapons, enemies and levels are all good, but you already know it from Doom.. Quake is forever and the remasters only 10$. Just buy it already. Its fun, action packed, well designed boomer shooter goodness. The single player and multiplayer are both great. The ambient soundtrack sounds really good. The atmosphere is solid. And its also an important piece of history. Like I said buy it. (Also the expansion packs are good too).. Quake was a great game when it released in 1996. And even in 2021, after the remaster, it still stands strong. It's the essence of what a FPS should be, stripped of all things that can get in the way of pure fun. If you're a fan of many many key binds, a good story, or if you're looking for realism: stay away ;). I just beat Quake on Steam and it was very, very good. The enemies, the crazy faces the player makes when you collect an item, the weapons, etc. The place looks like nothing from the outside world should be here. All of the levels look rusted and worn out, the haunting ambience composed by Trent Reznor. And the games namesake, Quake or ****. With him (or her) looks similar to the logo and that logo is plastered everywhere in all 4/5 chapters from shadows to buttons to the coloured glass in cathedrals. Over all 69/10 MASTAHPIECE.. Played in 2021. Perfect remaster, no complaints. Really. 7/10 cause the game itself is... well, old. I have wonderful memories of being scared to **** when I was 7-8, but nowadays the game is for couple hours at most. Still worth playing those couple hours :) Btw, the rhythm of the game still feels amazing!. To this day, I still think Quake 1 is the best online FPS gameplay (balance and fun) that has ever existed and compared to all other online FPS both current and old. Quake 1 is old, but other FPS owe more to Quake 1 than people think.. Quake made a splash and breakthrough in the world of the game industry, attracting a huge army of fans. Until now, I consider this game to be one of the best in its genre, and also a game that has given direction to other games. I definitely rate the game at 10 points. If we stop to assess each of its aspects it is perfect. Music, gameplay, my goodness the level design ... difficulty, base content and mods, game modes, crossplay ... also this remaster has remade 3D models but respecting the original art. Perfect.. A fun experience, but let's not talk about those anti-climatic boss battles.. Quake was probably id software's last great game. Don't get md wrong, there's nothing wrong with Quake II or III but id software's greatest strengths were always hidden in their innovations, Quake's satisfying bloody gameplay combined with perfect atmosphere made it one of the most immersive video games of all time. The complex level design was YEARS ahead of its time and it's still fun to play all over. Quake's multiplayer was satisfying and fun too, but the single-player was the thing that i found myself returning to. The Quake franchise is a weird one but for me the name QUAKE truly belongs to the first game. I highly recommend playing Quake, especially if you're a newcomer to the first-person shooter genre.. I love the game. Even though Quake 2 was much more iconic for me. Quake 1 is a game everyone should play to see what actually made the FPS industry. Quake was a step up, a huge step up. it was the foundation for Q2 and Q2 engine that helped many projects to evolve.. Quake wasn't as revolutionary as DOOM or Wolfenstein 3d but what made it worthwhile was its online multiplayer and graphics. The engine was more revolutionary than the game. But Quake is still a worthy title to play.. I still prefer the original DOOM games to Quake, because i think they had more soul and character in them but Quake's impact can't be ignored. Quake was another big step for id software, those guys basically created the first-person shooter genre and i think with Quake they established it for a lifetime. Quake in my opinion can be considered one of the last old-fashioned shooters that changed a whole industry but itself remained in the past.. Enemies are bullet sponge and guns feels weak. You waste your entire ammo and enemy still stands. Axe is useless. Most enemies are annoying and frustrating to fight.. Amazing game spawned the first real 3D shooter(sorry doom was not real 3D game it was amazing but not real 3D).. This is one of the most terrible games i have ever played. Zero thinking, just mindless shooting... No thank you. It was the first real 3D FPS (as far as i know) and has the same awesome gameplay as the Doom games. The story is virtually nonexistent so that won't be pushing you forward. The sound effects are great and on higher difficulties, it is fun to play. I would recommend you to play it. I just played Quake 1 recently and it's just one of the best shooters i have ever played.. The game has a very cool design. Even today, many levels look beautiful. Fantastic multiplayer. With a single player campaign, everything is a little more complicated: in the 90s it was very cool. Today is too simple at any level of difficulty. But this is the only game that I run at least once a year for the last 20 years to remember what action games we did before.. Quake is one of the best of the FPS genre, amazing atmosphere, awesome action and a fairly balanced game and extremely well balanced game in difficulty. Overall a game that is just all kinds of fun to play. Forever a piece of history that will never be forgotten and a game that will last forever.. Groundbreaking graphics for it time, but Doom was a bit more fun. Some minor things keep it from 10 in my opinion.. Really enjoyed it. Levels are fun and short, and there's lots of them. Movement is fast which I love. Had never played the first one so I'm glad I got to play through it.. A great fps game, which revolutionized Graphics. Tons of Guns and many missions. Has so many mods too.. For me it was a masterpiece in childhood. The very first shooter, the very first blood of evil aliens.. Quake represents a pivotal moment in the FPS genre when the games finally became truly 3D, rather than ""3Dish"" like the Doom and Build engines. Gone were the flat, lo-res sprites representing objects, weapons and characters replaced by truly 3D enemies, power-ups, weapons and props. However, in terms of gameplay, I'm going to go against conventional wisdom on this one. Quake is overrated. I remember being ridiculously excited for this game, especially the graphics, but it never quite captured my imagination like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. Quake was really just Doom with an improved engine. Was it still a fun and extremely playable game? Absolutely. Was it as truly groundbreaking as it should have been? No way.. When i looking some flash games on Y8, i saw this game quake flash it's amazing it looks the same as the PC version I like it.. To this day I thought that Duke Nukem 3D was the best FPS as of 1996. Sorry, Duke, but Quake have trembled me so strongly that I can't help but invalidate my point. Fully three-dimensional, chunky weapons, meaty sounds... It seems that Quake got named that for a reason. Nothing says ""I love you"" as much as nailing a fiend while quad damage is on. Regarding music: it's perfectly possible to make it play, at least with GoG version of the game. It's included with game files and it's just a matter of properly applying it (check GoG forum for more details). Now, are you gonna quit this game just like anything else? + simply glorious + giving a devil a shock treatment + skyboxes + sick music + sound effects + dark ambiance + no plot nonsense + meaty weapons + particle system + lighting gun + E4's brilliant design + an easy difficulty is not a nightmare in disguise - glitches (it might be on QuakeSpasm end, though). To this day, I still think Quake 1 is the best online FPS gameplay (balance and fun) that has ever existed and compared to all other online FPS both current and old. Quake 1 is old, but other FPS owe more to Quake 1 than people think.. Quake has no weak point ! Fast,Hard,Fun to play ! No Hard feelings you just grab the gun and go kick some ass !. I mostly don't like games that are older then me, never mind over five years older. But I still have a lot of fun on this game. I can clock hours of game time in this game a day and it's only games like Doom and the first FIFA games that are around the same age that I still like to play. One of the best FPS of the OpenGL time. Could not say any more. A must play at a time.. Quake is a living legend. The first “real 3D” first-person shooter, which was ahead of its time. The mechanics created in this game became a solid foundation for the hundreds of upcoming FPS games ever since. What else can be said - 21 years(!) has gone, and it’s still as captivating. If you love FPS genre, you really should pay some respect to this grandgranddaddy of shooters.. I play it on a daily basis for many years now. Its just the best game ever made. The atmosphere and gameplay is simply perfect. I highly recommend the community HD Texture and effect mods. It even looks better than most modern games that way.. Game: Quake Genre: First Person Shooter/Horror Publisher/Developer: Id Software System: Steam (PC) Total Score: 75/100 Value Score: 7.5/10 • Story: 7/10 • Characters: 7/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 7/10 • Sound: 7/10 • Music: 4/10 • Length: 8/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 8/10 Pros +Includes all 4 episodes (32 stages) and the final boss +Also includes 6 deathmatch levels +Includes expansions such as Winquake and support for further mods and expansions with great support +3 difficulty modes (Easy, Normal and Hard) with a Nightmare difficulty only unlocked by doing certain steps at the beginning of the game +Multiplayer support to co-op the single player mode or to play other types of matches Cons -No Music comes with the game, you have to use a mod to enable the music , the reason for that is because originally the music was on disc and you had to use the disc to listen to music while playing the game -Have to use patches to improve the visuals, since there are no graphic options. Quake is not a game is a classic positive memories in which even after years of holds and contains better gameplay than many new game. How not to look at the graphics and have not played this epic classic is always time to make up for it. There's not much I can say about Quake you haven't heard elsewhere. It's fun, it's dark, it's immersive, and it firmly established many of the conventions of FPS gaming we now take for granted. There would be no Team Fortress 2 without Quake, and that is why I wield the Original with pride. Id Software may have moved on to bigger things with Rage, but plans for Doom 4 make me believe that a new Quake may lurk somewhere beyond the horizon. It's important to know your roots in gaming, and while I got my online start in Starsiege: Tribes, my favorite singleplayer FPS of yore was probably Quake, if not Half-Life. Quake gave me my love of shotguns and grenade launchers and if an FPS cannot deliver me satisfying examples of such, then it does not measure up to my expectations for what constitutes adequate firepower. You can keep your assault rifles, throwing knives and tactical nukes. Give me a little buckshot and a little boom, and I will give you delicious interdimensional demon gibs.. A classic that will forever lie in history as the game that changed the game! This revolutionized the gaming industry and don't you forget it! If you have not played this game yet then what are you waiting for?. I first played this just after its release. At the time I think allot of people were treating this game as the spiritual successor to Doom. I had high expectations, which were let down. What allot of people now have forgotten is that at the time there were an ungodly amount of FPSers trying desperately to be the next **** me that's what it was another Doom wannabe and I quickly lost interest. Overall: In hindsight I have since developed a new respect for this game and can appreciate it more than I did. A good FPS that heralded the end of the age of Doom and opened the gaming community to the idea of new IPs outside of Doom.. The superior younger brother to Doom. Quake is legendary in how much it has revolutionized the FPS genre. So what's so good about this game? Let's start the review and you shall find out. Pros: -The graphics (while did not age well)certainly add to the creepy atmosphere of this game. When i was a kid i was scared **** by almost every monster that attacked me. They haven't aged well but that adds to the creepy factor. -The shoting and gunplay is pitch perfect. Every shot you fire hit's the mark right where it's suppose to. You feel the weight of the gun and it is awesome. Cons: -my little problem with this game is that there's no story to speak off. At least not a very good one. Granted this was fixed in Quake 2 but we're talking about the original here so... yeah. Well there you have it. Any FPS fan (hardcore or casual) should have the pleasure to experience this masterpiece. It's one of the best games ever made and you own it to yourself to play it.. Even in 2015, Quake remains one of my favourite games, utterly trumping CoD. Hey, CoD! Ever heard of **** FOV?! Anyway, Quake is a good game. Combined with the SUPERHOT engine, it becomes drastically better.. When i first played this game back in the day - i was shocked! :) well, i was shocked by quite a few games during 1997 :D it was a good year for innovative games destined to become all time classics, and Quake was not an exception. Yeah, if u never heard of the game, u'll probably not going to play it today. But this is one of those masterpieces that paved the road for many games to come. What i loved the most besides awesome weapons, adrenaline-pumping combat, and actual 3D models (i love u still, sprites and hand-painted backgrounds!) - was the Atmosphere! :) Dark, morbid, secluding, claustrophobic, terrifying! Now THAT'S some exemplary game development!. Opus magnum of Id software and whole FPS genre. Atmosphere, action, monsters, guns and rocket jumps. Great single campaign and multiplayer. This game have it all.. I have to give this game a 10 even though my favorite game ever is Quake 2. My first game ever as a kid was Wolfenstein 3d but the game that defined me the title of gamer was Quake. Quake is my all time favorite game, Quake 2 introduced me to the world of multiplayer such as deathmatch, ctf and clans. I was 13 at the time pretending to be 16 and actually ran a decent clan. Just nostalgic feelings, thats it.. Quake is a bit... odd. In principle it's fast paced shooter with loads of enemies and powerful guns. But that doesn't mean, that the game is ""flat"" or simplistic. At times it plays out like a Lovecraftian horror game set in candlelit castles, while the music incorporates sounds like cries, screams and grunts. The soundtrack is a full-fledged ambient mood-setter. When it comes to fighting there's much more than modern military pea-shooters: double-barrelled shotguns, rocket and grenade launchers and even lightning gun. Definitely one of classics in it's genre along with Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Still vey much playable and enjoyable almost 2 decades after it's release, not many games have it in them.. This game is something special! I remember playing it at a friends house in 1998 and I just recently installed it on my computer and I still love it! Runs very smooth, the game environment is clean, good sound, good interaction. In fact, this game could actually compete with todays first person shooter games and beat many them!. Jeez Nois a very daora game created by the father of John Romero fps awesome game good story good multiplayer gameplay dull and top demaiss recommend this play ai. The truth is that Quake, manages to keep you connected to the PC quite well, even though the game does not share a story. I think that is a good game, even for 1996, but for me, now when you play in 2015 seems a children's game.. An immortal FPS classic that wil never be dethroned. At the time it was the first shooter to use fully 3D models for the enemies as opposed to 2D sprites. Without the genius of John Carmacks Quake engine, we wouldn't have all the amazing FPS games that we have today. The first, the best, the eternal... Quake.. Avesome game. Frantic, climatic, perfection, id software at its best. Excellent multiplayer. You dont see shooters this good nowadays, quake games required true skill, there was no chance to get a single kill on good player by newbie which was really rewarding.... No game, ever achieved what Quake did for multiplayer. It is still today after 18 years the best multiplayer game made, and now with the mods, Quake still old its own in the graphics department.. Unrivaled awesomeness, the king of games, the granddaddy of them all, Quake says to other games ""Who's your daddy?"" and the other games say ""you are"". I used to attribute the greatness of Quake to Carmack, but Carmack stayed at Id and oversaw its downfall. No, the greatness of Quake was Romero and others that left Id after Quake 2. Romero wasn't able to run a game company himself, but as a designer he was a genius. Quake was high speed poker while everything after is electronic darts. Sadly electronic darts is popular because it requires no intelligence. Quake was from a time when games were works of art created by inspired geniuses, not cash grabs designed by a committee of marketeers to cater to the lowest common denominator of tastes. Quake predates the phrase ""casual gamer"" and ""casual friendly""... back then there were no casual gamers. Even Quake 3 with it's easy 'balanced' weapons is a joke compared to Quake 1 - Carmack said he wanted players to be able to kill better players some of the time instead of scores like 14 to -2 in Quake tournament finals, so he introduced a bunch of powerful easy kill hit scan and random spray weapons including the default gun, so you can get some lucky kills against better players and not feel so bad. But if we want randomness to make people not feel bad, then why are we playing at all? Why not just roll dice against each other... leading us to WoW and the hellish 'casual friendly' state of online games. Think of Quake as the anti-WoW. Quake World (exactly like Quake except for the net code) was the beginning of the end when the world decided that it wanted to be lied to, and instead of being able to feel and compensate for lag, we would just pretend there is no lag... but hiding the lag means you can't play around it, making a ping disadvantage into a permanent real disadvantage. WoW and almost everything else is like the state of schools now where people don't get F's and 0's anymore and sports that don't keep score... while in Quake 2nd place gets a negative score against 1st place (no kills and a bunch of accidental suicides). There's a term ""depth of skill"" used when analyzing games, it is the degree that skill matters... and Quake had it more than any other video game (and in non-video games Quake is rivaled only by Chess and Go).. A classic game in its own right. Not the best, most awesome in my opinion, but it's a nice fun shooter. A little fustrating, but what game isn't eh? I did play this on GL Quake via steam, and the archaic way of resizing the window was ****. Not for me. Also, remember +mlook before you begin! So, game play wise the controls are tight. Ranger moves pretty fast, and responds well to your controls. Every control is also customizable as well, and I do have a slight complaint that you can't go ""back"" when cycling weapons, only forward. The enemies were alright. Though I wasn't too fond of seeing the Ogre, a foe that launches grenades, all over the place. Them bombs get annoying. But I never honestly got tired of them. The weapons were okay as well. The shotgun, Super/Double Barreled Shotgun and Rocket Launcher all make a comeback from Good ol' Doom, and new weapons like the Thundergun (or was it LIghting gun?) grenade launcher and nail guns (My personal favorite was the Super Nail Gun). Game comes with plenty of levels, 4 episodes plus the final boss level, and I like how you navigate to each episode instead of going through a menu like in Doom. Helps it be more immersive. All in all, count me in as seeing how this one is a classic game, this coming from one of those gamers that didn't grow up with quake.. Almost 20 years later, Quake is still the superior game compared to other first person shooters of today. I can't help but giggle to myself when I hear today's FPS games marketed as ""revolutionary fast paced blah blah blah"". The run speed in this game is about 3-4x faster than any FPS made today (no exaggeration). Maps consist of maze-like arenas, which makes for a higher skill cap for non-casual players. Guns are more unique and interesting (you can also carry more than 2 at a time! Amazing!), the art design is even more interesting despite the technical aspects being comparatively ancient. In a lot of ways, Quake remains the pinnacle of the genre in terms of gameplay and appealing to non-casuals. Though no game is perfect, I have to score the game as a 10, since I only have the option of using integers. My real score is 9.7.. Quake is a hallmark of game design. Innovation, fast-paced in-your-face action, gore and ultra-violence, kick-ass weapons, and endless fun! Quake was the first truly 3D FPS game thanks to the genius intellect of John Carmack. Modern gaming wouldn't be the same without this game and the code behind it. Brilliant, unmatched and immortal! 10/10. This is by far the best FPS to ever be released. Ever. It's probably also the best overall game of all time. Great job id. you made a fast paced, kick ass experience ****.. Simply put, the most exciting, challenging and perfect TDM First-Person-Shooter ever created. Quake will probably continue to be the best game ever made well into the 22nd Century, seeing as nobody seems to even attempt to emulate it's obvious superiority.. My first Love! Quake is one of the better FPS I ever played the old boys of ID, was greatest masters in balancing all the main elements that make a good game. the better quality is that was the first game to in giving you the feeling of diving in gameplay turning my monitor in 3d display. But-but-but... there are no word to describe the perfection of multiplayer side. One of the best of all time!. There is no game till this day with a stronger atmosphere. I still play it (with modern mods). The Gameplay was simple and perfectly balanced. I love it and its sad that new games seem to need a story now while loosing the focus on the important simple things.. Best Single Player and Multi Player game ever. Fast, balanced is a perfect game who requires a lot of skills. Also Unreal Tournament and Serious Sam are good game but, Quake 1 is better.. I never finished the single player version of the game but I played it online for 6 years of addictive fun. ID revolutionised multiplayer FPS with this game and Quakeworld was even better. The game was incredibly versitile with things like rocket jumping, speed jumping, custom binding scripts etc. Then there were the TF and CTF mods that I played extensively too. The game revolutionised 3D FPS games too and the GL versions were a thing of beauty when I first beheld them. This is one of my favourite games of all time and I can't understand why people would ever give this a negative score.. One of the best FPSes ever made. I'm not sure what else there is to say about it! If you haven't played this and DOOM you are really missing out on the crown jewels of the innovators of the genre (id). My favorite numbered Quake game because of excellent map design, an exhilarating sense of speed and movement, and unique environments & enemies. My only grip is the fourth act is very dark to the point that you're often crawling down corridors and backpedalling when you run into something, unlike the almost racing game-pace of the rest of the game.. Epic game. A FPS which, with DOOM, has started a genre of games called FPS Arena. Technically excellent, as well as the gameplay. If you aren't very skilled with games, you won't like this, and that's why it's excellent: it is extremely challenging. Probably, one of the best games ever made.. Quake... In my childhood played this game all the time. It's addictive and fast paced if any of you didn't played it, try it out even if its old as hell.. After 2 decades, there is","quake is a pure reaction-time, map knowledge in-ur-face game of kill quick or die . it is easy to handle, it is fast, it is not boring, it is fun, it has tons of action but also has its dose of terror that feels real . it is an almost perfect game, although it was born as a copy of Doom, it improves it but is enhanced to 100 ."
660.Halls of Torment,"Halls of Torment is a complete waste of time, in every positive way. It’s the kind of game that fully embraces its role as a captivating time-waster, delivering endless hours of engaging gameplay without demanding too much from the player. Whether you're seeking a break from work or a casual companion while watching TV, this game provides a satisfying, low-pressure experience that keeps you coming back for more. It’s a masterclass in turning simple, repetitive gameplay into something unexpectedly addictive and enjoyable.. A perfect mix between Vampire Survivors and Diablo. If you like both of these games, then you will have a good time.. Diablo 1 aesthetic meets Vampire survivors, lots of fun for £4 and it's even had a content patch since I bought it.. Aesthetically consistent art style, excellent progression and pacing. Best in class.. Halls of Torment is a masterclass in gaming. With its nostalgic Diablo art style, satisfying gameplay, and commendable bosses, it leaves players eagerly awaiting updates.. A pleasant nostalgia game which combines the diablo combat and aesthetic. Some of the challenges were a right chore to complete though and felt like its being padded out.. This game is amazing, it combines the best aspect of Diablo and Vampire Survivor while having its unique play style. It gets more interesting the more you play it. The ability for players to have their own play styles and skills while improving on their respective character's stats based on their weapon or class of choice is a godsend, it reassures that every player has a different experience. You'll never get bored of this game and it will force you to play for longer just to win every boss battle and increase your stats. This game in of itself innovates the Bullet Hell, Roguelike & ARPG genre by taking certain aspects from past game successes and improving upon them. Rating -> 9.5/10 (Universally Acclaimed). Amazing game! Best of its kind. Has the old school diablo artstyle and it fits so well. Game feels satisfying and the bosses feel good as well. Cant wait for more updates!. I found this game to be very enjoyable for what it costs. It is nothing crazy and there are many aspects of the game that are simple but they work well. I do wish they would add more content. There only being 3 maps feels a bit restrictive and the difficulty drops off a lot after a few play-throughs. I do highly recommend trying this game.. It’s a more refined version of Vampire Survivors with the aesthetic of Diablo. The gameplay is as simple as Vampire Survivors, but with a few added layers of complexity. I personally found it more engaging, as it is a little bit more strategic, and you use one stick to control the character and the other to control your attack direction - it’s a minor change but it makes it more engaging. The ability to extract gear that you have to buy out of a shop adds a cool element of extraction and makes the grinding more fulfilling and less repetitive as it is in the other game. I really love the graphics and design, it really tapped into that 90s PC gaming look and perfected it. I much prefer this over Vampire Survivors, which got boring to me after a few rounds. Highly addictive game.. I do enjoy some bullet heaven games. I see this game is scratching some folks' itch, but I think it is ugly and too slow. I had issues with steam remote play.","halls of Torment is a masterclass in turning simple, repetitive gameplay into something unexpectedly addictive and enjoyable . with its nostalgic diablo art style, satisfying gameplay, and commendable bosses, it leaves players eagerly awaiting updates ."
661.NBA 2K13,"the controls are incredibly frustrating, the teammate rating system is unforgiving, the ai cheats, the difficulty on mycareer starts at pro mode instead of rookie, and the game is devoid of any sort of rewards. With improved graphics, modified and perfected controls, smoother and more numerous animations, an in-depth MyCAREER with endorsements, interviews, and realistic progression, the best soundtrack in NBA 2K history (I could listen to the songs for hours), competent AI, and no rubberbanding and ridiculous shot-making from the CPU in closing moments, NBA 2K13 is definitively the most memorable NBA 2K to date.. Despite all the negative reviews this game have on xbox 360 , i will graduate this game at 10 - just because this on of the best sport game of all time. Great action sport game , well... Sure it has some flaws but game itself is very addicting! its like you are watching a TV while playing . By the way Ost is awesome. So close to perfection! Everything is AMAZING except for AWFUL online when it was being played **** has an amazing soundtrack,fantastic balanced gameplay,and sensational graphics.. I like this game but it has a little bit of flaws. Like my mycareer is 99 Overall and he has Posterizer, Finisher, Highlight Film, Deadeye and Ankle Breaker and my player misses dunks and shots they should make the dunks like NBA2k14.. This game is SOOOOOOOOOO BAAADDD!!!!!! I cannot even begin to explain how annoying it is!!!!! It is so unrealistic! I've never played such a bad game in my life. The rebounding is absolutely ABSURD!!! I put in Shaquille Oneal and Roy Hibbert together and they were outrebounded by the Orlando Magic (they do not have Dwight Howard)!!!! I honestly think they might pay their critics to give them good reviews because I have never heard someone say a single good thing about it in person. This game ****!!!!!!!! Worst game I have EVER played!!!!. I didn't think 2k sports could do it, but they keep getting better with each and every installment. I'd still like to see a more open choice to skipping games in myCareer mode and I don't like the lack of multiple mycareer player appearances, but it's still a very well made and executed game. Everything about this game is worse than the last 2 except for the animations. The game does everything except what you want your player to actually do. If you are within 5metres of any player you will get flung like a magnet to them whilst your opponent runs free and rains three's. This even occurs running into your own players which is completely ridiculous and then you'll then get called with a foul when you knock over someone for running into them. It is virtually impossible to play D in my player mode and everything feels completely sluggish and broken compared to the previous games where your player could run fluently around the court and only get glued to players if there was a screen. Expect to get fouled out of the game a lot because steals are now non existent - you will get called every time you reach in hlwever the opponents will be able to steal the ball of you at will with no fouls which is great news for **** jay z layout of the game is terrible - your player stats don't show up in a neat graph anymore but you have to manually scroll down the screen with one stat displayed at a time with a number which is like 40 stats. The soundtrack **** - nearly every song is hip hop and there is absolutely no variety which is just a terrible decision because it gets old fast. The game is also impossible to play on xbox live - especially my player because you now have to sign your player up to 2k servers which basically means every time you click a menu button you'll have to wait about 3 minutes while the game connects to the servers for no reason!!! This game is a piece of junk and all the new ideas like shoe creator are wasted because the gameplay is so bad.. Let me start off by saying I'm not a fan of the sports in general or a fan of the franchise. With that said I give this boring game a 5. Its kinda cool starting out and doing interviews for scouts to get recruited to play on their team, after that its really lame. Who wants to sit and watch 50% of the game while your on the bench??? Not me, this game is more boring than a game on tv with teams your not interested in. Lame and boring, all around no replay-ablility. The soundtrack however, I did very much enjoy.. I really like 2k13 the game is fun great online play with some glitches. I really like association and regular gameplay has great graphics except for it is hard to block but I really like the pro stick and improved dribbling. NBA 2k13 is the ultimate basketball simulator. It allows for great competition between friends and online. The gameplay feels smooth and solid, and there are so many different modes to play in. There's even a shoe creator!. NBA 2K13 is an awesome game! Making your own player going through the NBA Draft and the Rookie Showcase and when your career takes off you get on magazine covers, billboards and get sponsors. This game gets a perfect 10.. This game ****! It's all about animations and sticking animations together fluently, instead of being able to be free with your movements. This... plain and simply... makes for a BAD basketball game. The menu music is horrible too!. I cant stand this game. Tried to play it for months with my friends and its just FAKE! No defense. All 3s if u drive good luck defending it. Players contour in the air. The my player takes forever just to be good even though i average 30 a game. Music was shut off after 2 mins of a bleeping kanyes mercy. Just get FIFA or the new live 14 coming out. 2k Sports did OK with this game. Everything about it is ok. They are all lazy, money eaters. My MyPlayer is rated a 99. His pass is a 95, but whenever I try to pass out of a double team, a big man comes out of the blue and intercepts the pass. He is a 6'2 point guard, and gets blocked by all of the other point guards. This really frustrates me. 2k really needs to step it up, because right now, I'm on the verge of buying NBA Live 14. Also, they need to improve the rating you get coming into the nba.. This game is really decent. It is good sometimes but horrible other times. In my team there are really bad calls and it glitches out. I think the best mode is. My career because you decide the fate not the computer like many modes. Black top is fun to play with friends.. This game is one of the worst 2k games. The players are to over powered online and it's really fake. Centers and power forwards miss rebounds that bounce off their faces. Contact layups are a basic automatic miss. 2k developers better step it up or they're going to lose another customer. This game is the best game I have ever played. My Favorite mode is the association mode. Also I Love to create players. Blacktop is really good besides that there is now fouls in it but it is good. Overall This game is my favorite game ever made. Celtics Rule. I don't play basketball nor do I even watch it, but I bought this game hoping to have something to do, and it somewhat succeeded in that. Although I'm not a huge fan of the game of basketball I did have fun playing this game. It did not last as long as I hoped, but for the time that I was really into it I quite enjoyed it. It takes a revolutionary step in the ""Career mode"" adding social media, sponsors, and one of my favorites the post game interview. THE VERDICT: I had never bought a NBA game before and I was somewhat satisfied with the purchase. If you enjoy the game of basketball you will probably enjoy this game a little more then I did. And in case you're wondering, I'm more of a hockey person;). 2k13 is the best basketball game ever made, that obvious. The gameplay is amazing, the devs keep the updates coming. I still want more though, minor things including: shooting the ball after the play has stopped, the ability to give a teammate a five in my career after a made bucket, etc. More options need to be added to My Career. I can't finish many seasons because it just gets too repetitive. 2k devs can add something else rather than post game press conferences after EVERY GAME. It really is a great game, I just can't help but thinking I want more.. One of the most dissapointing titles for me.. HUGE 2k fan.. Bought the Dynasty for this one.. MY PLAYER mode for me was RUINED.. MICROTRANSACTIONS and the VC points dropping into everything I do.. I do NOT play online nor should i be forced too to get my full VC points that i shouldof earned to get MY PLAYER guy to develop at a decent rate.. Complete fail on that part. Great game. They fixed the flaws from 2k12 (sluggish movement and bad contextual animations). If you are having trouble shooting with the new L2 + RS controls, just switch to the shot button for shooting - it works just as good. There are some issues, however...like the stopping catch animations, and ridiculous offensive rebounding by the CPU.. This game is good. everything feels more on point. everything is just how it should be, the only thing bad is the multiplayer. Its HORRIFICLY BAD in my opinion, i cant get somebody with a stable connection. Great game though, its produced by jay-z but lacks music, which is pretty unfortunate. this one is good for if you have friends over, and something to do when the game isnt on. Heat All Day.. As far as gameplay and graphics go, this is a carbon copy of last year's game. The only major difference this year is the inclusion of the right stick being for dribble moves and if you want to shoot you must now hold LT and then the right analog. The old school teams and dream teams are still a blast from the past to play with and rosters and associations are fun but unchanged. If you love basketball this is a tremendous game but for people like myself who aren't big basketball fans, it's simply above average at best with not a ton a replayability.. I bought this game hoping it would be better than the last few years... Every year I tell myself I won't buy it and I do and every year I'm disappointed at all the things they refuse to fix. Clunky/Unresponsive controls, clicking one button gets you stuck in a 3 second animation while the pc just walks past your defense, Your AI defense is so poor when the AI's defence is responsive, TL;DR Stop buying the same game with the same flaws with one new game mode with one new change. I can't believe all the lies I see I had to create a user just so I could write the truth. Let me be very clear this game is not I repeat NOT better then 2k12. the my player mode or as they call it in 2k13 my creator mode is crap. as a rookie your only given like 5 min or so to play in game that determines where you get drafted making it very hard to get picked higher then 10th. I almost forgot its much harder to level your person up unlike in 2k12 that if you got high enough in a drill you would not only get XP but you would get like +1 inside shot and so forth, not in 2k13 drills are almost useless even if you get gold you only get about 60 XP that's it no extra state for doing good. 2nd if you have multiple people using your gamer tag too bad you have to create one person and they are there forever so you can't have multiple my career modes with different people because if you try it will put that one person in every time. and it won't let you change the persons name. 3rd the playlist is so short you will get sick of it before you know it. the last problem I have is with the controls well others like the whole control stick thing I hatted it and sometimes you do a dribble move you never meant to, oh and if you where like me and never really used them in the first place it punishes you with great def all around. I almost forgot for those who got the All star DLC with the pre order don't bother its controls are so glitchy its not even worth it. so whats good about the game well they have included a lot more older teams and legends into the game which is a plus in my book. the graphics have also improved. if you don't have other people using your Gamer tag my career is a plus as far as looks you can go talk to the GM of your team just like in real life and it shows it. also you can buy apparel to change your players look when he is on the court getting to the arena and all that good stuff. oh and also in the off season your GM will ask you who you think they should try to sign taking a page out of MLB2k12. though at least in my case they went after no one I said they should so it felt like they really didn't care. Overall I am deeply saddened by NBA 2k this year I thought it would be better but it was a big disappointment do yourself a favor and keep 2k12 or re-buy it because 2k13 is just a shinny pile of crap. its going down the road of Madden and that's not a good thing. only reason its not getting a lower score is because well its not as good as 2k12 its still at times a decent game.. NBA 2K13 is good enough to render 2K12 obsolete. The NBA 2K Series is a series of great basketball games. It takes me about a month to get a great feel for the latest version, and at first I had reservations about this game. Most of my issues at first were with the Virtual Currency (VC) system. When you first start out VC seems like a ripoff, and most likely you are going to spend real money instead of waiting to have enough VC to create a competitive MyTeam or MyPlayer. Beyond the VC, this game is an improvement in every facet of the game. In 2K12 dribbling moves and breaking down the defender were only moderately effective. 2K13 revolutionizes dribbling controls to make this a much more enjoyable and exciting game. I like the Jay Z presentation and feel it is a real improvement, not everyone shares this opinion. (Guess it depends on whether or not you like Jay Z, I must.) One real presentation difference is the use of Music Videos during the intro to some games, also in MyPlayer the use of commercials versus all of the still billboards. The main new feature of this game is the MyTeam mode, which has you playing other real online oponents to move through a Playoff structure. I really like the new mode, but this is where you are going to spend real money to build a good team, instead of waiting until you have enough VC to pick up a couple of Superstars. Now, some players are abusing this mode in 1 of 2 different ways: 1) Building a team of all 3 Point shooters and launching away the entire game (completely unrealistic and could use patching) 2) Building a Superteam even though it is costing them real $ (Played a team with CP3, Wade, Lebron, Durant and Howard yesterday, again this should be patched to allow a maximum # of Superstars). Negative: If you do not have Xbox Live, you will not have access to about Half of the content in this game. All-in-all, NBA 2K13 is a major improvement where it counts - Gameplay, has improved Presentation and a fun online MyTeam mode. One last thing - 2K13 is far more ""explosive"" that 2K12.. What happened??? I only gave it a 2 because I liked the music, quality of the commentators, and Blacktop. Character creation and My Player is horrible, nothing kept me interested in playing this game. It feels like they took a great franchise and smashed it with a cinder block and took the remains and through them in a fire. I was a huge fan of 2K12, looked great, played great, felt right... ... This is not a good sign of things to come 2K. You really need to get back ""in the game"", before EA releases their title next year. Hear my full review on the show, ****. NBA2K13 is a great game hands down! This year the game has the best graphics to date certainly much improved better then 2k10,2k11,2k12! This is one of the most realistic NBA2K games ive ever played! This year there is a new move control stick that give players move controls to do moves while on the court using the right joystick, and now pressing X to shoot. Also the game music is all produced by Jay-Z and the game features real music. For all the crew lovers like myself CREW is not back in this game BUT there is MYplayer online. There is a new mode called myplayer blacktop online. You can play 3 vs 3 online with your myplayer guy and yet its def not crew it's certainly good enough to hold people off until nba2k14 and hopefully crew will return. Overall this game is a MUST BUY for any basketball/NBA fan it's the best 2K NBA game ever , and ive played them all going way back to even sega dreamcast!. This game is by far my favorite sports game to date. It could be the fact that I just love basketball, or the fact that I'm a huge fan of Jay-Z. Either way, this game is amazing. The controls are more fluid than ever and the signature animations are a sight to behold. It did take me at least 10 games to fully understand the control scheme, but once you get it down, there are endless possibilities. With the addition of the control stick, it does feel a little more like the NBA Live series, most recent being NBA Live 10. People are sure to nitpick, but as a 26 year old gamer, I can appreciate how far we've come. I get endless enjoyment out of playing as the Dream Team(complete with Barkley and Pippen) and also as the 2012 Olympic team. The classic teams are all here. With the exception of just a few I would have liked to see. But overall, I cannot stop playing. The animations are crisp and the gameplay is airtight. Keep in mind, I do not play sports game online. So my review is really for the offline gamers. Tons of fun. Scoop it if you can. Traded in Madden 13 to get it and could not be happier with my choice.. Too many glitches and bugs. The multiplayer is terrible and lags like crazy. The My Player mode is a joke because you still start out as a terrible player. Guys make 3's easier than lay-ups. Also, if you didn't pre-order the game, you don't get the All-Star Weekend which is something that has always been included throughout the history of sports games. 2K can **** it.. NBA 2K13, is a great game in almost every single aspect , in my career I complain because the intelligence of the machine is extremely stupid and has a lightning speed because no reason they do that, in everything else is fine, new moves, and more players actual gestures.. NBA 2K. Where amazing happens. Even online this year. Yes, Ladies and Gentleman, the greatest sports game ever made has the best online netcode the series has ever had in this years game. Finally. Finding matches is a breeze, lag is virtually non existent, and the experience is grand. The remarkably fluid gameplay (grabbing a rebound and taking off with Lebron happens instantaneously and flows like water, no canned animations, so life-like and real), impeccable commentary, and insanely good soundtrack immerse you into the game in ways that cannot be explained. Jay-Z's involvement is felt the moment the game boots up when and incredibly video compiling performance footage (of one of the greatest and most iconic songs of all time 'Public Service Announcement) from Jay-Z's concert with in game 2K footage is so sick. I watch every single time I boot the game up. And I probably always will. I love that track. But the truly amazing thing in this year's game to me, is the inclusion of Signature Skills. Which I think is laying the foundation for another revolution by 2K in the sports video game genre. There are like 50 Sig Skills. Players can possess multiple and the skills have varying ways to effect gameplay. For instance, Kobe, DWade, Durant have a Sig Skill called The Closer. In the 4th quarter, they get a ratings boost across the board and you can literally feel there intensity level go up in the final minutes. Its incredible. Lebron's iconic Chase Down Blocker is one of his Sig Skills and you can see him speed up to reach a fast breaking opponent to get the block. It's uncanny. Others include, Hustle Man, which gives the entire team and energy boost which someone with the skill makes hustle plays. Skills that give percentage boosts or drops depending on situation that can effect gameplay in ways only the deepest players will respect and love equally. For anyone who is a die hard b-ball fan and gamer this is an incredibly deep gameplay mechanic that can only get better over the years once its expanded on. The guys over at 2K Sports are collective enclave of brilliant minds and have the utmost respect of this gamer. This game is the holy grail of Sports Gaming. It gets no better. This is my Game of the Year.. Clearly an improvement over last years edition, the new button layout and physics makes this game nearly perfect. The presentation is on point, and with the addition of an expansive soundtrack, it's hard to ask for much more. Well done.. The game is ALMOST the same as last years version. There are a few Minor tweaks that make it a better game the control stick is one of them. In years past you had the same thing you just had to hold down the modifier button (LT) to use it. This year no need to hold down the (LT) button to use the contol stick.. To shoot however you do need to use the (LT) button as the modifier. I enjoy this cause also depending on how you flick the stick will depend on what type of Shooting move you do. A fade away, jumper, lean in, dunk, or under handed layup. It makes for a more realstic game play experiance. Also helping this out is the physics, If the defense switch and you have a bigger man on a point gaurd. You have a better shot of driving the lane. The Commentary is great the 3 man both does another great job and they added on to help the my player feel more relevant. If your into the shoe game the sneaker editor is totally insane and is a nice and welcome add on for me! What I dont like the menus, yes they are only menus but if you dont know what your doing they can be a pain to try and Nav. The fact i had to pre order the game from only certain stores to be able to get the All-star DLC. it should have already been in the game. All in All its up there with the best sports titles. 2K Sports tweaked just enough to get it just a step up from last yr. Which makes it a buy! Excuse me while I go and work on my control stick skills!. The game is great. The pick and roll works well this year. I love the animations. Everything seems closer to real basketball than ever before. I can't wait to play more online!!. This game is good, but not great. Some great things are the new MyTeam mode, new game intros, and of course, the game soundtrack. But there are no major fixes for screwed up player models and a hard to navigate menu.","the controls are incredibly frustrating, the difficulty on mycareer starts at rookie mode instead of rookie, and the game is devoid of any sort of rewards . despite all the negative reviews this game have on xbox 360 , i will graduate this game at 10 - just because this on of the best sport game of all time ."
662.Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit,This need for speed was the same as Need for speed se 2 in appeal and quality Vary consistent back then love the soundtrack And tracks have great memories with friends and family at about 4-8 years old unlocking cars using cheats and going the wrong way on the track flipping cops over with my car I won’t forget this game. I loved Need for speed III HOT pursuit with great car excellent stage and very good control,need for speed was the same as Need for speed se 2 in appeal and quality Vary consistent back then love the soundtrack And tracks have great memories with friends and family at about 4-8 years old .
663.Plants vs. Zombies,"Greatest mobile game of all time. so good its the only one I actually would have wanted to shill out money for to have ads stopped. thats it. and even then, I'd rather get it on PC but still. even then its worth the price comparatively. the most fun I can have with a game like this. truly well put together and well thought out. if anything though..... one of these days someone should make some remake of the second game, that fixes everything including its micro ****-made. the second game is fun when its not a money shill. 5 dollars for a plant in that game will get you a masterpiece of simple gameplay in the first game.. Most beautiful game ever. It feels like yesterday I was playing on the floor eatting cereal before school playing this game when I was 7 but now I'm older... I recently re played and yeah it wasn't as good as it was when I was young but I still enjoyed and had fun.. It's a tower defense game with plants and zombies. Nothing professional here, it's a fun classic game with fun plants. It's made for kids and no story is required for unique and zany visuals to kill time. Perfect kids game with the only flaw being how grinding coins is tedious, but it's easier with microtransactions which the game would make money off of. I just wish the second game wasn't owned by E.A and could live up to the level of this game.. An extremely fun tower-defense style puzzle strategy, it's a classic worth trying out.. this game very gore, when me die plant besad :( so i sad too :(zomby eat my plant very violin and theyscream help. This game very diasturbingand me cry when play. this game me havevery sad momentsi always cry when sun floer die. they eatit and i get no more sons to buy :(((. It's hard to put into words, but there's something special about the very first PvZ game that's stuck with me ever since I first played it. I could also say that about Pre-EA PopCap in general (like legit, one of my favorite dev teams of all time), but Plants vs Zombies is like a lightning rod for that specific flavor of gaming magic. It's absolutely bursting with personality from the art style, to the characters, to the music. All of it's iconic for a damn good reason. And that's just the vibes. The game itself is plenty of fun too. Easily one of my favorite tower defense games of all time. It's simple, but very engaging and fun. I just wish there was more of it to play. It **** so much that neither of this game's sequels really measured up to the original, the second one especially. But that's a topic for another day. For just five bucks on Steam, Plants vs Zombies is an absolute no-brainer for your library. I cannot recommend it enough.. Super fun game but it's pretty hard to replay considering the game is not very difficult and the game is generally pretty slow paced. Despite that, this is still an incredible game. The first playthrough is super fun and there's tons of post-game content to enjoy.. MY FAVORITE GAME!!!! The incredible history, the excellent gameplay, Incredible characters, all in this game are perfect!!!! I recommend and it worth it to buy this game!! And NOT have ads!!. While it is easy to beat, this game has the charm to amaze anyone! It is a very solid yet easy-to-learn tower defense game with a barrage of extra content like minigames and endless mode.. MELHO JOGO DE TODOS OS TEMPOS 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000%. Plants vs. Zombies 2 still is the better version of the whole set, so i recommend to play the 2nd version if you can.. Classic. I can turn this game on at any given time and have a great time. Very inventive gameplay and plenty of post game content. Perfect. I love the combat, the animations are amazing, this game is awsome,i love it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. How is a 2D game better than a zombie killing parkour game.(Dying **** lot are 5 years old and only play this you are delusional. the best tower defence game of all time, the artstyle, music, humor it all fits togheter and makes this game and unforgetable experience. I love how iconic this game is. There's nothing off here. Gameplay is addictive, with solid progression, level design variety, and great mechanics around balancing. There are also some mini-games that you often have to play, which bring new feelings between the ordinary levels. The soundtrack is so memorable. It matches the levels perfectly, and it's fun to the point where you find yourself listening to it on your music service now and then. Highly recommended.. ""the zombies are cuming"" true'r words have never been spoken since. Great game. Great life.. This game presents a very simple tower defence idea but it builds so much on it. the gameplay is amazing game good banger credits 10/10. Gameplay 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 replayability 10/10 characters 10/10 story although simple perfect 10/10. Possibly one of the best tower defense games out there, especially during the time of its release. Even if you finished adventure mode and unlocked all the plants, there are still tons of mini games, puzzle games, and especially the survival endless mode that will keep you playing for hours and hours. It is also this game that got me into gaming back then.. the best game I have played in 2010. 6/10. A very fun game with diverse gameplay. I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes strategy games.. The only game I can say is perfect. Despite this game not being my favourite or most played, it my highest rated because it has so much charm. I love the music the gameplay the art style the comedy. Am happy founding this game and seeing what franchise has turn into.. BANGER! i finish this game once every year such great game.. This game is a classic. It has some great gameplay and is very unique. This is one of the few games that has great longevity as well.. theres a zombie on the lawnnn. Plants vs. Zombies, released in 2009, is a charming and addictive tower defense game that pits an army of plants against waves of encroaching zombies. This seemingly simple concept evolves into a highly engaging and strategic experience that has captivated players of all ages. The premise of Plants vs. Zombies is as quirky as it is endearing. Players must strategically plant various types of vegetation, each with unique abilities, to fend off hordes of zombies with equally quirky traits. The combination of unconventional foes and the humorous design of the plants creates a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere. The game's progression is expertly balanced, introducing new plants and zombie types at a steady pace. Each level offers a new challenge, forcing players to adapt their strategies and choose the right plants for the job. The sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully defending against a particularly tough zombie onslaught is immensely satisfying. The level design is clever, with varying layouts and environmental hazards that keep players on their toes. Additionally, the game includes fun mini-games and puzzles that add variety to the overall experience. Plants vs. Zombies offers a wealth of content, including a campaign with numerous levels, a survival mode, and a delightful zen garden where players can grow and tend to their plants. This variety keeps players engaged and encourages replayability. The game's art style is both charming and iconic, with distinct designs for each plant and zombie. The soundtrack is catchy and adds to the game's whimsical atmosphere. While the core gameplay is accessible to players of all ages, there's a surprising depth of strategy for those who wish to tackle more challenging levels and achieve higher scores. The game's simplicity makes it easy for newcomers to pick up, but the strategy involved makes it rewarding for experienced players as well. One minor drawback is that some of the later levels can be quite challenging, potentially leading to frustration for more casual players. However, the sense of accomplishment upon completing these levels is well worth the effort. In conclusion, Plants vs. Zombies is a highly addictive and charming tower defense game that offers both casual and hardcore gamers a delightful experience. Its strategic depth, clever level design, and whimsical art style make it a standout title in the genre. Whether you're defending your lawn for the first time or revisiting it for the umpteenth time, this game remains a classic and enjoyable experience.. An irreplaceable soundtrack, has aged like wine, as excellent as the first time 2010. The game is very enjoyable. There is a lot of variety and it never gets boring.. It's a classic in my opinion, my only problem with it it's just to easy but for that I would just play survival endless.. Very nostalgic and very fun game. Honestly i recommend this game to any one who enjoys life.. Such a simple concept so well executed, so much fun. I cant believe how hard it is nowadays to find good simple games like this.. I just got attached to the game without explanation, it must be because of the simplicity and perfection of the game, I really don't know why.... I think this is the best tower defense game i've ever played. From the innovative idea to the art. The soundtrack has some of my personal favourite music and even this really goofy game has an iper hyped final boss fight. Good even in 2023.. what a hood classic, everything about it is perfect, playing it again as an adult and was never bored.. Plants vs. Zombies is a highly enjoyable tower defense game that combines addictive gameplay, strategic depth, and charming presentation. Its clever humor and accessible nature make it a great choice for both casual and dedicated gamers. If you're a fan of the genre or simply looking for a fun and engaging game, Plants vs. Zombies is definitely worth a try.. Plants vs. Zombies still holds up against other tower defense games, it's fun and well made. But the problem is that the PC version is just horrible! It's inferior to the console versions in every way.. Plants vs Zombies is by far one of the best ever, when it came out it was without a doubt an instant success and not without reason. The game at base value seems basic but it's anything but, you have an extensive amount of plants that you are able to use that all have their own pros and cons. This large amount of plants incorporate well with the all the different types of zombies and game modes that keep the game from becoming repetitive. The game also has a lot of replay ability despite its simple appearance. This game is differently worth the price and worth the time.. The best tower defense game ever made. Although it doesn't have the most content, the gameplay is excellent, the art is great, and the entire game is brimming with charm. It also has a very unique style of gameplay, and unlike most other tower defense games, the enemies feel like an active threat, rather than something that just goes by to see if you can deal enough damage. The ability to choose your plants also provides the levels with a lot of variety and replay value. It also has an absolutely legendary soundtrack by Laura Shigihara. Must play for literally anybody.. Plants vs. Zombies, developed by PopCap Games, is a delightful and addictive tower defense game that combines strategic gameplay with whimsical charm. With its clever mechanics, charming characters, and addictive progression, this game offers a unique and engaging experience that appeals to players of all ages.

The gameplay strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and depth, making it easy for newcomers to pick up while offering enough challenge to keep experienced players engaged. The progression system in Plants vs. Zombies is incredibly satisfying. As players advance through the levels, they unlock new plants with different abilities and gain access to additional gameplay modes and challenges.

The game's art style is vibrant and whimsical, with charming and memorable character designs for both the plants and zombies.

The attention to detail is evident in the variety of plant and zombie designs, each with its own personality and quirks. The delightful sound effects and catchy soundtrack further enhance the game's charm, making it a joy to experience. Plants vs. Zombies offers a wealth of content and replayability. The main Adventure mode provides a substantial campaign with multiple levels and increasingly challenging stages. The mini-games, puzzles, and survival modes offer additional variety and gameplay options. The inclusion of a Zen Garden, where players can grow and care for their plants, adds a relaxing and rewarding diversion from the main gameplay. The game's intuitive controls and user-friendly interface contribute to its accessibility. Whether playing on a computer or mobile device, the controls are simple and responsive, allowing players to focus on the strategic aspects of the game. The clear visual cues and helpful tutorials ensure that even novice players can quickly grasp the gameplay mechanics. While Plants vs. Zombies is a highly enjoyable experience, it does have a few minor limitations. The difficulty curve may feel uneven at times, with occasional spikes that may frustrate some players.

The game's accessible nature and universal appeal have garnered it a large and dedicated fan base. With its whimsical charm and addictive gameplay, Plants vs. Zombies is a must-play for anyone seeking a lighthearted and engaging gaming experience. It earns a well-deserved 9/10 rating for its enduring fun and replay value.. Solid strategy game. Pretty easy, but fun nontheless. After you beat the game there are also more challenging things you unlock.. I am by no means a strategy game guy, however this game is great and it's aged fantastically. GOTY with no doubt back then. Extremely simple but one of the most entertaining games you could ever find. Pure nostalgia with this game and playing it rn its still as fun as it was back then. All time classic! plants vs zombies innovated on the tower defense genre in a groundbreaking way. the opening of plants vs zombies is heavily tutorial based and shows you the ropes of the mechanics, in which mechanics are made to perfection, I can't think of a single flaw, PopCap also did a exceptional job at the pacing of this game, cards are earned every level and your given meaningful upgrades.. Fun and chill game. I played a lot as a kid. When I played it now, it was very easy, it doesn't make any sense hahaha.. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. The best tower defense game. Actually, it might be the best game of all time.. For its age this game holds up very well. It has a very unique style and charm that belongs almost solely to this game, although you can sense a somewhat shallower version of its charm in the other games in the franchise if you know what I mean. It's filled with unique and entertaining content that I still come back to after 10 years of playing, and a lot of replayability. The original PVZ has the best casual gameplay I've run into; it doesn't get boring but is never stressful. I also want to point out that this does not have any of the problems other tower defense games have, so much so that I didn't even realize it was one until around my 8th year of owning the game. Overall an amazing game, just short of a masterpiece (which I believe if the original release included multiplayer it could be considered a 10/10).. First game played on iPad. It was involved with heat, sweat, and the moist feelings of Guangzhou.. Reasons why PvZ is the best mobile game of all time: 1. The best soundtrack 2. Fun and addictive gameplay 3. A very charming experience. you just made my childhood. On ds, on xbox 360 and on phone, thank you Popcap. Recommended 39.4 hrs at review time 100% With all Achievements Gameplay 5/10 Music and sound 5/10 Screenplay 3/10 Technical 6/10. One of my all-time favorite games. Everything about this game is so replayable, and it's very cheap, I got the Steam version on sale for 2 bucks.. I used to play this with smartphone when I was younger and it's nice to see this on steam. Even if it comes easy now, I enjoyed thoroughly during my play time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This first game is the best of all, fun, with a great soundtrack, and good character design already 2,3,4 the characters are a downgrade of the first Not to mention Garden warfare which is a much traveled game. PVZ1 is simply an easy, simple and fun game. This game is amazing this title that interested me even more to pc gaming the artstyle is great the gameplay for some might be boring but for me its great. Plants vs Zombies is a game released on May 5th, 2009. the game is... well, basically the title of the game, you fight plants against zombies. recommend this game if you like tower defense games, Because this game is like a tower defense game, with loads of fun minigames. there are five worlds, and each of them has different gimmicks. the first one does not really have one actually, the night world has no sun falling from the sky, the pool world is world 1 but there's water in the middle 2 tiles, the fog world is night mixed with pool, but there's fog so you can't really see most of the map, and then the final one, you have to plant pots to plant plants on. I said plants at least 3 times in that sentence. also, you cant use plants like spike weed in the pots cuz, how the hell is that thing supposed to fit? anyways, there are a ton of memorable minigames like I. zombie, vase breaker, portal combat, combat, and especially last stand, and I haven't even gotten into the soundtrack in this game! the OST in this game is really good, especially the roof wave and pool wave for me. this is a 9/10 game for me.. this game is a classic that everyone should play. Really funny, the drawing style is great A game that makes you nostalgic and that keeps you glued to the screen. I am so addicted to this game when I was a kid and I feel like I can play this game from start to finish if I have time. That's how I love this game, I'll play it again for nostalgia reasons. How you feel the sense of accomplishment and achievement is the best. Planting in your zen garden, raising zombies in the aquarium, whacking zombies, forming strategies, real-time, and other unique forms of ideas are shown in this game. It is mainly planting and forming strategy but you know what's 's best? The music, sound fx, main background music, and the variety of different designed and constructed plants and zombies. That's your expansion of experience. Play this game dang it.. Good classic tower defense game. Gameplay is simple, Fair and balanced. Visuals still hold up years later. I recommend this game.. Masterpiece at it's **** game might seem repetitive at first howevet it does a great job at preventing that from happening by adding new game modes and plants to use!This game is an absolute icon.. Plants vs. Zombies is a 2009 tower defense video game developed and published by PopCap Games. The player takes the role of a homeowner amid a zombie apocalypse. As a horde of zombies approaches along several parallel lanes, the player must defend the home by putting down plants, which fire projectiles at the zombies or otherwise detrimentally affect them. The player collects a currency called sun to buy plants. If a zombie makes it to the house on any lane, the player loses and must restart the level.. The interface is wonderful. You have so much information immediately available to you. Google Maps always has a minimap in the lower left corner, which gives you a good overview of the area. Getting information about people gives you a clear, clear window. Hacking offers a menu with easily recognizable icons, so you always know what your button presses will do.. _in your head, zombie, zombie из песни слов не выкинешь, как и эту прекрасную игру. Вышедшая на чём угодно, как зомби - вирус заразила почти всё население, и тут же на трупах убиенных подобно растениям дала плоды другим не мало важным продуктам линейки Plants vs. Zombies _in your head, zombie, zombie. You can't throw words out of a song, just like this beautiful game. Released on anything, like a zombie, the virus infected almost the entire population, and immediately on the corpses of those killed, like plants, it gave rise to other important products of the Plants vs. Zombies. The only real way to describe this game is just that it's overall pretty good. Even though it holds your hand the whole way through, and there is not too much extra content, it is overall very charming and fun to waste a couple hours to try to beat this classic.. It's one of the best game I played when I was little :D. It's pretty fun to play.. An excellent game, lucidly engaging with exceptional humour and style manifested through the cartoonish zombies. The first levels are slightly dull, but the game ramps up in difficulty and intrigue with its new introduction of intrepid plants and diverse zombies that allows addictiveness. Despite the potential simplicity, there are vast challenges allowing sublime replayability, notably its mini-games. Nevertheless, the sequels are of decidedly lower quality attributed through EA.. I love this game. It is so fun to play and easy to play. Nice idea for Popcap, it is entertaining me when I was child until now.. so funny very funny game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. My scores for this game Story : 8/10 The logic of the game story is good, the zombies attack the house and the man defends his brain and we defend in the garden, then we go to the roof. Graphics : 5/10 The game graphics are old, the creators did not bother to make it at least HD so that we could play. Musics : 10/10 The songs of this game are still fresh and beautiful for me, full score. Details : 7/10 In this game, follow the details of today's games, it is excellent in its own style. Game play : 10/10 The gameplay of this game in my opinion has no rival TD style, but in 6 rows and in the whole game you need to plant all the plants. Variety : 10/10 The variety of games is so great that now I can play but I can not play. Plants vs Zombies are a greatest game i played in my childhood second is Angry Birds. The Gameplay is so much beautiful and fun, i defeated Dr. Zomboss several times, and watering plants in Zen Garden everytime, this game just hits my nostalgia.. one of my favorite games i played this game when i was 8 and i love this game if you didnt played this then play this now PLAY PVZ **** if u dont have money then play mobile version. I thought this game wasn't mean to be on PC because I first discovered it back then on iOS... I guess this is a great example of self-centeredness despite myself ! So this is officially the primary version of this tower-defense worldwide success. I don't get why it isn't considered as a 'Must-Play' in here. Story is funny especially with its terrific DAVE the neighbor character. Plants are funny, zombies are funny. The feeling of progression is terrific even if some strategies kind of ruin the play once you get to know them. It goes the same for upgrades : some really save your life when you need them to. Levels and environments are as varied as colorful. Mini-games offer different gameplays. Boss fights are amazing. Easter eggs are hilarious to find. The main story is still quite short (as you can see, 'Plants vs. Zombies' seems to have been designed to be a kind of mini-game itself) but after that, you can play it again in a more difficult mode ! Steam achivements are really hard and long to get. Also since a level lasts between 5 and 15 minutes it can feel truly repetitive, because all you have to do is a) plant sunflowers, b) collect enough sun and c) invest sun on defensive plants. Again and again until the boss appears. Clearly fun to play but well... Not more than something like 7 to 10 hours. (I only persevered in order to get the achievements of course.). Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. This game is one of the best the music the sprites the final boss the minigames the story I think umm. So addictive game even though it's simple, totally new idea, never played a game like this, and everyone loves it. This Game Was my Childhood, good design, no bugs, VERY GOD DAMN MUSIC! best mobile game of all time!. This game was a very big part of my childhood, I remember playing it on my first PC that my grandma gave give me. After quite a few playthroughs (on multiple devices), the PC version is clearly superior. This game definitely made the Tower Defense genre what it is today. I highly recommend it.. Still a really fun strategy game all these years later. EA really ruined this franchise before it even started, didn't they?. Its a fun game, its nothing too special and its really not a deep game at all, its a fun little tower defense with a really fun twist. There is enough content to warrant the price and the fun you get. Just don't expect a deep game, its almost a mobile game.. Fun and simple. Perhaps the difficulty level is not too high, but generally speaking it was quite enjoyable to play.. unstoppable nostalgic game that just hits you right when you get the game back, with a great fun purpose and system for the game, and always does it's best to make users have an enjoyment for the game itself! most of the features in this game just make the game as a whole when you get it, enjoyable.. Plants Vs Zombies is a great game! I love the idea of an army of plants defending their home versus a zombie force. The plants could use some balancing though. Some combos are OP and unable to be defeated. My biggest issue with the game is how easy it is. I usually like easy games but in this case it needs some challenges to overcome. Now for the positives... I love the sound design! It really fits in with the slightly cheap looking graphics. Not that the graphics are bad but it just looks a bit outdated for even 2009. Finally the levels are designed well but like I said earlier are just a bit too easy. So overall, I like Plants VS Zombies but there are a few flaws. 8/10. Interesting idea for a Tower Defence setting, but doesn't offer much more than that.. This is the only good game in the PVZ franchise, not that I've played all of them but from what I've seen, all the other games look and feel nothing like this gem. Please PopCap, please cancel the pay to win agreement with EA, don't work for them, and re-hire George Fan!. it's a real best strategy game and YOU also need to play this game and when you have nothing to do then this game will give a lot of good memories. Plants Vs. Zombies is an addictive tower defense game that is still loads of fun a decade later. The gameplay is simple. You use sun to create a defense that'll prevent zombies from reaching the house. At the back of every lane, there's a lawn mower. If a zombie touches a lawn mower, it'll clear the entire lane. You only have a single lawn mower per lane. There's a large variety of plants to choose from. There are over 50 fruits and veggies to annihilate the trespassing undead. Later on in this game, you'll unlock a garden, a shop, and an almanac. The garden is a place where you'll grow plants. You can sell the plants and get coins and diamonds. The shop is a van where you can buy minigames, plants, and much more. The almanac gives small descriptions about each plant and zombie which'll likely make you chuckle. Perhaps my favorite thing about this game is its personality. There's a load of character in every corner of this magnificent game. The dialogue is humorous and Crazy Dave is simply an amazing character. This game's music is spectacular and will certainly get stuck in your head. In conclusion, Plants Vs Zombies is an awesome tower defense experience that is certainly worth the price. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. Plants Vs. Zombies is a perfect game. No stupid DLC or Microtransactions, a great story mode, excellent humor, awesome split-screen, and great mini-games. This game is an amazing classic that at least everyone can have a good time playing a silly strategy game with you planting sunflowers and bombs against disco and jack-in-the-box zombies.. Best tower defense ever. Challenging but fair. With nice touches of humour. And the minigames and extra modes only make it better.. I really games like this on the app store. Too many games are adopting the free to play style with ads, micro transactions, and a quick hook which fades away after a week. Plants verse zombies is a simple game of tactics, which is paced very well and has aged very well aesthetically and even gameplay wise.. This is probably a 9.5. There is so much fun to be had and so many different things to do. There might be three legitimate complaints. If you do adventure mode a couple of times, it does feel like a chore. The game is probably too easy. Some of the mini games is very heavily luck based as are some of the endless puzzle boards. Otherwise, it is close to perfect. I spent a lot of time with this game, but unlike games I haveily invest in, it was almost always fun throughout.. Fun game to play during breaks. Lots of enemy classes keep things interesting. Multiple strategies can lead to victory.. Oh it feels great coming back to review this gem ****. (NO TLDR NEEDED) it's simple and does what its meant to, this game was a part of my childhood and for that, ill remember it forever. I came back to replay it and hell, it still has it. The end level and mini games are some of the most epic levels in a tower defense and the reward from the end level brought tears to my eyes. I will remember you in my heart and hope that you will be preserved in gaming forever. 10/10 classic and a must play. An absolute masterpiece (for casuals)! If only the games on phone were a bit more like this one.. As a puzzle games lover, this title make me play a lot of hours. The minimalist but awesome gameplay it's that make this game addictive, with charismatic characters and a crazy history.. So fun, so addictive, so creative and original. A must play for anyone who's looking a break from all those AAA shooters, RPGs and MMOs! By the way, if you're a WoW player, you need to play through this game. The only thing I can say without spoiling anything is go to Tarren Mill ;). I’ve never been a big tower defense guy but there is something about this game that I’ve always kind of liked. It’s probably a mixture of the strategy involved, the cartoony style and simplistic gameplay. This is a game that I’ve sat down and played many times but I’ve never actually beaten the game. It was on Steam, it was on sale so I picked it up. If you don’t know what Plants Vs Zombies is, it’s essentially you vs Zombies. What you use to defend yourself against Zombies with plants. You can ",the second game is fun when its not a money shill . it's a tower defense game with plants and zombies . perfect kids game with the only flaw being how grinding coins is tedious .
664.Rocksmith 2014 Edition,"There is no other game on the market, that would provide such training in your living room. Absolutely must own if you always wanted to learn how to play guitar.. I have been playing this for a week and it is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than its predecessor. The Kinect commands work really well, esp if you are using headphones while playing (so it can hear your voice better) and the mini games are actually a blast to play. Think Typing of the Dead fun. I have already learned to play some songs and I am way more comfortable navigating the guitar. My fingers are building up some nice calluses as they should be but I literally have never had this much fun using a video game to learn. Such an enormous song list and customization will ensure that I can be enjoying this for years to come. More video games should learn how to be educational as well as fun. I give it a 9 because it seems like ducks redux minigame is always a bit off on the E string. Also, I think that it should have different song areas that stay in the same key. It **** having to retune your guitar for specialty songs when you are just learning. Save special tunings for later on once you have the regular tuned songs down. Anyways- still tons of fun for those that want to learn.. Game totally ****, waste of money. How frustrating it is to try to learn guitar when a.) You know your guitar is in tune, but the game disagrees, and b.) it won't read half the notes you play, so it basically tells you you fail everything. waste of money. Use Youtube to learn guitar, or take lessons, but this is worthless.. The only reasons I take a point off the game is because the game still crashes more than I am comfortable with, and the note recognition, mostly in minigames, is still not quite perfect. Other that that, this game makes the origional rocksmith obsolete. Loading times are almost entirely gone. The guitarcade minigames are more complex, and have mini objectives to complete to level up and get higher score, making the game much more fun than the origional. Some of them are actually really fun to play. They even added a score attack game mode that has you playing songs like in a traditional music game. It has the songs broken down into difficulty levels and you are scored based on hitting the notes in succession and with good timing, like a guitar hero/dance dance revolution hybrid. Now also to keep you busy, the game provides you mission objectives. The game well give you missions that help you explore every aspect the game has to offer AS WELL as tutor you by pointing you tin the direction of things that can help you improve. All these things added to the game really make this product feel FUN, much as a game should be. The game constantly encourages you to keep busy, and more often then not, an active guitar player is a better guitar player. And for those who care nothing about these game/score aspects, the game has given extremely convenient and thorough access to the riff repeater, and allows you to easily set the mastery levels of songs. You don't have to gring anything that you don't want to, or waste time in loading screens. Lastly, session mode allows you to play with all your effects that you've created in a free jam with an assortment of other instruments of your choosing. There's a lot going on here, and unfortunately, I have a difficult time making any band setups sound the way I want them to. Perhaps someone with more musicality and knowledge of its parameters would have more success with it though. Overall, this game is everything and more that you could ever ask of a music game. BUY IT!!!!!. The Original Rocksmith was great! It's absolutely wonderful at teaching guitar if you don't have the time or money to afford lessons. Rocksmith 2014 is no different and it is better. There are two glaring downsides though. The first, if you buy online, via Steam or through Ubisoft then you need to order the proprietary cable separate. Second, regardless if you use Steam, you HAVE to use Ubisoft's Uplay in addition. Unfortunately that means an update is necessary every day, and that's when you want to start playing. If you have exactly an hour to play in the morning, then you better had left Uplay open the night before. Uplay is frustrating and slow and completely unnecessary.. First off, I love this game. You would think it odd that given this review. Let me explain. The first major hurdle you run into when playing this game are the frequent game freezes (or lock ups) that occur. At first, it was every other day, now I can't get through 3 songs without having the game lock up. This requires a mandatory reboot of the entire game. This can take 5 10 minutes to get all the way back online, logged in, and back to a song you want to play. I played for an hour yesterday, had 4 freezes that cost me about 15 minutes of my life. I talked with ubisoft tech support, each time they took 48 hours to get back to me. I have had other companies respond in hours. Their first response was unload all rocksmith files and installs from the xbox harddrive and re-install. This is turn your computer off and then on again support. An hour later not very surprised that their advice didn't work, but I suppose that may fix some issues. Then they ask to unplug all usb accessories. I do and no surprise it locks up again. I feel that this is as bad as it can get and just try to play through the pain because the game really did help me learn guitar and it is FUN. In non-stop play I hit ""skip song"" and get a message that, my file is corrupted, losing 122 hours of game play/ranking up in the songs. So as great a teacher and fun as it is the frustration level is through the roof! If you can deal with the constant freezes and an occasional complete loss of all achievements, and have to deal with a clueless and uncaring customer service department this is the game for you. BTW, they have been talking about a 'patch' for a few weeks now. Game has been out 3 weeks, no patch. No offer from company for free song dlc, partial refund or anything else. No, I did not ask for anything, but come on man. Here is tech support response today. Note no mention of a patch coming anytime soon: “I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Thank you for reporting this issue. I will be forwarding this issue up to the development team for further review. That is all I can do at this time, as we have no further information. If any additional information becomes available, it will be detailed on the game's official forum at **** and our Support Website (****).” So, basically stop emailing us.. This game is simply amazing. It is fun and teaches. I have never picked up a guitar. I purchased this game on release day and 7 days later after playing the game 1-3 hours a day. I just mastered my first song. This thing works! Now there are a few gripes with some of the systems in the game.. they do appear to be minor glitches, but they will rear there heads frequently.. If you are doing good on a song the game will sometimes hide the notes... This is fine if it is your 20th times playing the song, but it will often do this the very first timwe playing a song.. So they just need to modify that to not occur except under certain circumstances. This is called master mode and it can be disabled, but it is annoying none the less. The game does not recognize the strings perfectly.. it is really freaking good. But there are time when you strum the wrong notes and it thinks you got it correct. This is especially bad in the mini games where it will frequently not hear the notes properly.. It can make the games very frustrating when you are doing everything correctly, but the game thinks you are not. The lessons are very good, some are better than others, some lessons are worthless, but 95% are very good. However the Practice songs lakc ALL of the features of the standard game. If you fail a practice song so many times the game will slow down the song, but then youare stuck at that slow speed till you get it.. no way to make it slower or use riff repeater to allow you to study at your own rate.. This is not a huge deal the practice songs are VERY easy, but some are still a little tricky and not being able to learnt he practice songs the same way as all the other songs just seems odd. Overall you will spend most of your time playing the same song over and over again trying to hit each note, and master all the chords. And there is 1 more little gripe.. The difficulty levels are each VERY different from each other.. Difficulty levels 1-40 might have you plucking 1 string every 2-4 notes, but then suddenly difficulty level 50 throws 3 strings at a time at you.. so the difficulty scaling is pretty bad. BUT with that said, all it means is you kind of need to relearn the song a little and after a few play throughs you will have the new difficulty level down. If you want to learn guitar I HIGHLY recommend this game if you want to learn guitar AND play games. At first it may seem like nothing is happening, but then one day you blow through a song.. I played last night for 2 hours. (its release day). I bought it for my kids, but I was pretty sure I would use it too. It was so good I kept playing until my fingers were very sore. This 2014 version seemed more responsive than the first. When I hit the wrong note it seemed more obvious and when I hit the correct note it seemed amazing. I thought the product was so good I was prompted to write my first review.. It's true, this is the fastest way to learn guitar. I had the original Rocksmith and the new 2014 version improves in ALL the areas the original had flaws in. Before playing this game, I did not know how to play electric guitar. After playing this game, I can now feel confident with tabs I find online and jam with my friends in real life.. Rocksmith 2014 is a fantastic learning tool. Capitalizing on the learning aspect and laying aside the restrictive ""level up to better venues and whatnot,"" from the previous was a great move by Ubisoft. RS14 now allows the player/ aspiring muscian to choose the path they wish to pursue (rhythm, lead, bass) and guides them along a recommended path. Whether you go their route or choose your own method is entirely up to you. The biggest and most important changes to RS14 are the much needed fixing of riff repeater and the addition of session mode. Both modes will massively help new players in getting the basics of two important aspects of playing. With riff repeater, the player has far more control over the speed, difficulty and duration of what they wish to focus on. Want to do the pre-chorus at 60% speed and 75% difficulty? Done. Want to play the whole song that way? RS can do this too. As you correctly play through whatever section you choose, the game smartly ups the speed, while maintaining the difficulty Once you master said section, the speed decreases to the point you started, but adds more notes, until you are eventually playing the whole song, lick for lick, at full speed, and it feels Amazing. Next is session mode. For many players who play tabs or play along with music, but have never played freestyle and just cut loose, there is a lot to love. You pick the tempo, style, and back ups for your fake band, they keep the beat and you get to explore your sound. As talked about by other critics and users, the selection of music is a strong variety spanning decades. There is something for about everybody ranging from Bob Dylan to Slayer. Day one DLC had some suprising choices like brand new Queens of the Stoneage and Them Crooked Vultures (YES!). RS is smart about pointing one of their many Lessons to help recommend areas where the player could use brushing up, once again, if they feel the need to. Everything from chords 101 to special techniques like double tapping are covered. For people who are more interested in the gaming aspect, the guitarcade has many updated and actually fun games teaching fundamental skills which translate into skills you may not know need improvement. The big going theme of Rocksmith 2014 is easy of use and it's quick streamlined menu system. Long load times are not an issue. Setting up your system for play still requires a specific sort of set up, but can be done within five minutes. The lag issue is only present for those who do not take the time to properly set up their audio setup. If there are any complaints it is generally due to the player's laziness. Which brings us to the end of this review. Rocksmith 2014 is the best learning tool I've seen for people who do not have access to traditional methods of learning, and makes the process very approachable. Please keep in mind learning a musical instrument takes years of practice and patience. Rocksmith can start your path to improvement, and for many people like myself, who have no intention of trying to become Eddie Van Halen, it is exactly what we're was looking for. Highly recommended.. I'll keep it short and sweet: Pros/Changes: 1. Session mode is an awesome addition, there is a plethora of instruments to choose from and the band reacts accordingly to what you are playing, TONS OF FUN. 2. Mini-games are actually fun this time. 3. Interface is A MILLION times better than the original, clunky and unintuitive design. Cons: 1. This is not a substitute for guitar lessons, no matter what the ads tell you. You will at least need a couple of irl lessons to teach you proper picking, positioning etc... . 2. The session mode is a bit simplistic, in a sense that there will be ONE preset ABCDEFG chords that the band will play at a time. I personally haven't found anything that would top this in terms of being fun and simultaneously be educational.. The Original Rocksmith got me started. Rocksmith 2014 is leaps and bounds ahead! Seems to be Re-Written from ground up. On Xbox360 and PC versions I've had ZERO Lag. Very fast to get where I want to go. Songs that I played in Rocksmith 1 were brought over to the 2014 and there's even more to some of these songs, now that the new engine can recognized flourishes, chackas and other things that the original couldn't. Almost have to unlearn some of what I've learned prior to play even better. What blew me out of the park was playing ""Carry On My Wayward Son"". Having mastered it in RS1, the 2014 version was more indepth and the nuances I was missing from RS1 has arrived! PLUS it went from Distortion to Clean and back to Distortion RIGHT when it needed to without me having to do anything. OMG!! LOVE THIS GAME and GENRE!! MORE MORE MORE! Also, I can finally say I want Rythym, Solo or sometimes even a mix, instead of trying to cover all in different areas, which is what sorta irritated me with RS1. My perspective: Older guy, took a semester of acoustic guitar lessons years ago (and remember only a few open chords). This game is the real deal. I'm getting better, it's fun, there's tons of **** game is delivering on all cylinders. The session mode is pure fun--even if you're a beginner. The video lessons are short and to the point, but informative. Getting better at guitar takes practice (duh!), but RS2014 can make that practice more fun _and_ more efficient. One nitpick: The Kinect voice commands are pretty sensitive. You have to be careful what you (and any spectators) say in the room, or you'll accidentally have something paused or skipped because someone said something that sounded like ""accept"" or ""back"" at the wrong time. If you're by yourself, not a biggie. And it's not like you lose any progress or anything--just a momentary hitch in your rockin-ness.",the game is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than its predecessor . the game has a huge song list and customization . the only reason i take a point off the game is because the game crashes more than I am comfortable with .
665.Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition,"Guacamelee is a Metroidvania 2d Platformer Brawler Beat ‘em Up, all mixed together and wrapped with traditional Mexican culture and folklore theming. Guacamelee! Super Turbo Charge Edition was developed by DrinkBox Studios and released in 2014, Just a year after Guacamelee Gold Edition Release in 2013. Story: You play as Juan, a humble agave farmer who goes into town and bumps into his childhood friend and love interest “El Presidente's daughter”. He also ends up confronting the Antagonist Carlos Calaca, a once famous rodeo Horsman before he broke his arm and sold his soul to the Devil to have his arm healed in time for the rodeo match. But right after he finished the match the Devil Dragged him into hell. And now Carlos Calaca is out for blood, performing ceremonies to unite the worlds of the dead and the living to subject everyone under his rule… and only Juan the Luchador can stop him! Gameplay: In True Metroidvania style, you start out the game with basic movement, dodge, a punch and a throw. One of the things I’ve loved about going back to play Guacamelee for a second time, is just how well put together the game is! As you get abilities, each power will correspond to a color block you can destroy. Not only are these abilities usable to access new paths in the game and secrets, you can use them for combos in the Beat-Em-Up section of the game, and they can ALSO be used on the 2d platforming.From start to end you’re getting new abilities, beating up enemies for coins which can be used to purchase new skills, costumes, and power ups to your health, energy, and Intenso. You’ll often have the chance to detour from the main mission to work on a quest or parkour your way by using the abilities you’ve unlocked to get chests with power **** style and music have held up well over these years and will continue to hold up well for years to come. Be it year 2017, 2024, or 2050. Just like I enjoy going back to old NES 2d stylized video games, so too will Guacamelee remain timeless. What is New in Super Turbo Championship Edition? There are two new areas: Canal de las Flores and Pico de Gallo. There are two new abilities: El Intenso and Pollo-Bomba. A New Boss: trio de la Muerte. And you can now play with 4 players for complete and total chaos, it was crazy enough trying to play cooperatively, but now you can drag along two more friends for party night.Conclusion: Ay, Dios Mío, What a game! Guacamelee is a great game, I cannot recommend it enough to really anyone. The extra stuff you get from this version of the game is nice, but mostly peripheral. What makes Guacamelee excellent is the style, the theming, the colorful world, the music, the humor, the charm, the quirkiness, satisfying controls, platforming, and it doesn’t overstay its **** always I cover way more stuff in the video, so I’d suggest checking that out if you’d like to see gameplay and want a break from reading my lengthy wordy reviews. But thanks for reading! I appreciate it, and hope you enjoy Guacamelee as much as I have! …There's more to the review, but I'm out of Characters... If you want to know more, please check out my YouTube Video or Steam Review.. Great Metroidvania game. I love the cultural references and the gameplay is not boring at all.. Snappy gameplay and a setting that oozes style and character. This is just an excellent metroidvania that's a lot of fun to play through. The soundtrack games and gameplay, particularly traversal, is unexpectedly engaging. A simple story, with good plot. A simple gameplay with great progression. A lot of fun solo or in party.. Great setting and plenty of self awareness glibness in presentation. The game itself is pretty fun, though some of the move chains you need to navigate certain sections were more than a little but frustrating, but I usually did the old reliable walk away and come back the next day and got past those places. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind this style of game not taking itself seriously.. This is the very first metroidvania I played and I loved it. It does a fantastic job of being approachable while not being too simplistic.. I remember playing this game a few years ago and I have to say that it was a solid experience.. Easy 10. I didn’t think I could like a wrestling game so much but it really is a true “metroidvania”. #1: gorgeous looking game packed with vibrant environments, wonderful tracks, and hilarious characters. #2: combat is very fun and addictive. #3: switching between land of the living & the dead is really awesome and works very well. #4: sick platform jumping sections. #5: Two player co-op is an absolute riot! My girlfriend and I cannot stop playing Guacamelee! I’m an old school 80’s NES kid so I love these types of games. When I hear kids today saying they’re bored of this game after a few hours it’s pretty disconcerting. This is a classic bro.. A fun and charming metroidvania, Guacamelee engages players with a tried and tested formula and a creative coat of paint. It has aesthetic appeal and solid enough gameplay. However the combat and platforming can become a little tedious towards the end. The story comes off as generic as well.. If Hollow Knight is the best Metroidvania for it's world design and lore, Guacamelee might be best with the combat and powers. At the very beginning it feels pretty standard but the more abilities you unlock, the more genius you realize how well everything clicks together. All the fighting moves you obtain are not only insanely satisfying to chain together in combat, they also double as platforming techniques you use to further explore the world. It's a blast, easily one of the must-plays of the genre.. Astounding level design with an homage to the OG Super Mario Bros. This is one of a few games that made me scream frustratingly (and joyfully). Definitely one of the most well-crafted platformer I've ever played.. Guacamelee! is a Metroidvania game, starring a luchador fighter who wants to save his kidnapped girl from the evil Calaca. Gameplay-wise it's nothing extraordinary, innovative or even challenging (only in the final few stages is there any real sense of challenge) but it's still very fun to play. The Mexican themes, lore, music and colorful art style make Guacamelee! stand out from other games in the genre. On PS4 the game has been expanded relative to the original PS Vita version, hence the Capcom-like ""Super Turbo Championship Edition"" name. New additions are the multiplayer co-op for up to 4 players, a few new areas in the map to explore, and some challenges to complete. It's a little short (roughly 6 hours to complete the main story, with no challenges and just a little collectible hunting), but Guacamelee! doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a great little game.. GUACAMELEE! SUPER TURBO CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION The definitive guacamelee Guacamelee is a metroidvania meats brawler game where you play as a luchador that sets out to save the daughter of el president And the super turbo championship edition makes this must play classic even better, expanding its world, adding bosses, abilities story and adding in about 2 extra hours of gameplay So if you haven’t played guacamelee before, this is the version to get… This metroidvania took me around 6 and a half hours to complete and can be played with up to 4 player cooperatively… After hearing so many great things I as excited to go back and play this game before guacamelee 2 came out, and boy am I happy I did… admittedly guacamelee took so time to grow on me.. I didn’t instantly fall in love… at first I was a little confused why everyone loves it so much… sure the art style is nice and the game is full of humor.. But the gameplay, the platforming... it all felt super simple and button mashy… but as the game goes on it just gets better and better… no 2 hours of this game feels the same… the game slowly spoon feeds you new abilities that are mostly for traversing, allowing you to go back to past areas if you’d like for its collectables to help upgrade your health or endurance, but these also double as combat moves for the challenging and constantly engaging combat moments… the game increasingly gets challenging with both its platforming as well as with its enemies it introduces.. So you never feel like you’re just going through the motions... every minute of this game is engaging and keeps you hooked… there are costumes you can unlock to challenge you more or balance the character more towards your play style.. This is such a complete package from start to finish, a world that entices you to explore for its secrets, so many moments I would laugh out loud at the dialog, decently challenging bosses... I actually felt like bosses were more of the time to relax and breathe before you’re thrown back out into platforming through this world… guacamelee is wonderfully placed and is a must play game for platforming fans or metroidvania fans alike I give GUACAMELEE! SUPER TURBO CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION an 8.5/10. It's a fun complete edition of the great Vita game but it added a few whole sections, another boss, and unblockable attacks which, I think, fail at improving on a great game. It's still fun and fantastic but I'd say the Vita version is better.. Very fun, beautiful, cheap and cool game to play, playing it coop it's just a whole lot of fun, waaay more than alone, be sure to play it coop! If you want to have some fun with your friends, without having to play too much money, Guacamelee is a great option!. What starts as a bland beat em up during the first quarter- half way point of the game quickly turns into one of the most fun/challenging platforming beat-em up in recent memory for me. The fighting sequence also evolves as the game goes along, making smashing buttons turn into fun/ challenging combat. Add in diverse enemies, and this game evolves from a mindless beat em up to a rewarding challenge as the game goes along. Once you get all your core powers, the game really shines, especially in the platforming department. It was very fun to branch out just to look for chests, and the challenge of the fun platforming you need to get through to get to your reward. The story was meh, but this game is all about gameplay and exploring/platforming. The boss battles were fun and challenging, and the small side quests were unique and rewarding. You really can sink in a decent amount of hours for this game, and for the pirce of it, I say it is well worth it. If it wasn't for the slow start to this game, I probably would've given this a 10.. This game is brilliant with an outstanding art direction. The game is a not so innovative platformer, but has some clever solution and the execution it's impeccable. Good learning curve with interesting move and an interesting folkloristical story set in Mexico. The lonely downside I found is the button smashing fight that sometime hurt my finger muscle... but i'm not sure it's a really cons :) Conclusion: an indie title that you will love alone and with your friends.. I got to say this is an awesome game, I totally recommend it if you like metroidvanias. In my opinion, this is one of the best metroidvanias out there. The story is quite simple and it is not the strongest point of the game compared to other metroidvanias, although it is good enough and gives our hero an excuse to do what he does. The setting, music, graphics etc are simply great; it feels quirky, zany and very funny. The gameplay is perfect, it is easy to play and complete the main story, but hard to master (e.g. doing massively long combos) and get the 100%. Best of puzzling platforming metroidvania, if MV are your kind of thing you cannot let this one escape.. Guacamelee is a fun mashup of a platformer and a beat 'em up that plays much like a Metroid style game. It is a little too long and relies on back-tracking to much. Some of the boss attacks are also cheap, spreading damage across nearly the entire screen. On the whole, though, this game brought back that Nintendo feeling. The fantasy Mexico setting is full of video game in-jokes. The enemies are incredibly varied, especially the bosses. The attacks are easy enough to employ, and even I, a button masher through and through, could pull off a few combos. The back tracking and boss fights did bother me both from a practical standpoint and philosophically. Practically, I don't want to waste my time running around the game world. There are teleportation points on the map for faster travel, but this concession would be unnecessary if the game world was designed as linearly as the story. (I had the same complaint with the more impressive looking ""Dust: An Elysian Tale"".) Some of the boss fights also took too long. The bosses with timed, area of affect attacks are a throwback and work well with the retro-feel of Guacamelee. Some of the boss attacks, are too cheap and cover too much of the screen. The final boss battle is grueling, Maybe its my age showing, but I value the quality of the experience more than the quantity. Philosophically, I believe this game was made for the hard core gamer and those gamers are served well. For a casual gamer, such as my children, this game could be too frustratingly difficult. And it's not just the boss battles. Some of the platforming requires expert timing and precise button control. What will happen to this genre if all the games present a barrier to entry?. Excellent 2d platformer! It's got style, humor, interesting combo's system, level design and it's beautifully drawn. Difficulty levels are well-thought-out: it doesn't matter if you are a casual or a hardcore gamer - you'll find what's best for you. Completing all challenges and searching for every orb is tuff but rewarding (if you find all of them you'll have different ending), just remember that practice makes perfect. Definitely worth you time if you enjoy platformers.. Great art style, great sound work, great gameplay, great fun. If you've played Metroidvania games, you will know what to expect from this one, and it's fun when it comes down to playing it. The combat is responsive, and even when you feel overwhelmed it doesn't feel as if you can't complete it.. A genuinely decent platformer which excels as a couch co-op game. It has a nice theme and soundtrack; although there's no real story and the aesthetics could do with a bit more work. It is however, a wacky game with some comical moments. The gameplay is a nice mix of platforming and combat; with the mechanics being particularly refreshing. Despite the relatively large set of actions, it doesn't feel overwhelming. The dimension-swapping is used particularly well throughout the game. Its semi-open-world nature allows for some additional challenges, side quests and collectibles. The enemies aren't repetitive and are satisfying to fight against. Combat is simple and intuitive but has enough depth to avoid repetition - especially given the variety of enemies and the use of dimensions and shields which require special moves to break. However, the game falls short at times chiefly because of the way it handles two players on screen. If you are playing as a guest on a local system, Player 1 always has ""priority"" meaning that if the guest overcomes a platforming section whilst Player 1 fails, the game has a 3 second timer for which, regardless of where you may be, the guest is respawned back to where Player 1 is. The ""bubble"" used to spawn players is particularly annoying as having to navigate to where the other player is isn't always easy when the screen is cluttered with enemies. The game also has far too much combat relative to platforming; which is a shame given the excellent platforming mechanics which can only really be appreciated fully in the Infierno challenges. If the game had more of these challenges, it would be better. The character customisation is nice and simple but could allow for more options. It is often difficult to keep track of one's character during flashy combat sections with lots of enemies. For a PS4 game, it is definitely not a graphically pleasing game - it looks like a mobile game. However, given the small team that made it, the amount of content, quality and the price, I would definitely recommend it as an excellent co-operative game that almost anyone can enjoy.. It's probably the best game I played on PS4. It has a challenging gameplay, superb game design a fun plot and very satisfactory combat. It's an excellent metroidvania that renews the style. I mean, it's clearly inspired by metroid and castlevania, but it doesn't attempt to copy them, it has its own identity, plus the combat, with very diverse and, most important, useful combos is something unique. It's rare to find a game where everything you have at disposal is useful and there's not a feature (weapon, power, etc) that is unbalanced with the others (being too strong or too weak). Seriously, if like a challenging and well balanced game, try this one. Plus, the artstyle is beautiful and the puzzles are very nice.. I must say that this game really surprised me. I didn't expect for it to be this entertaining. ""Guacamelee"" is a very fun game to play. It is a bit challenging in certain parts but nothing is impossible. This game also has some very funny puns. The story is nice and so is the combat, but it can get repetitive.. This is a great game. its a bit difficult, harkening back to the days of old when video games didnt hold your hand so its not for everyone, but it's bright colors, catchy music and game play can absorb you if you give it a chance.. This game reminds me of my ex wife, in that it can be super confusing but I'm still drawn to it sexually. Unlike my ex wife, it is really funny and entertains for more than 10 minutes. There is about 10 hours of gameplay here. The combat can be repetitive, but who really cares if you're having fun. The main downside to this game are the ""puzzles"" you must solve to progress in the came. To be honest, I'm still stuck in the Water Temple from Ocarina of Time, so I'm not exactly a stud when it comes to puzzles in video games. Much like Forrest Gump, I am not a smart man. Unlike Forrest Gump, my wife doesn't have AIDS lolol.... because I don't have a wife anymore. Anyways, my 2-year-old stepson must be a friggin genius because he helped me through the puzzle parts of Guacamelee. In summation, this game is pretty good, but didn't hold my attention like it did for other individuals. It's probably a good thing because I need to get started on my taxes. Oh shoot, it's already June 17?! Oh wait, I have no income so it doesn't even matter. Hah! **** it IRS 6/10. Gameplay Guacamelee starts with an average Joe type of character turned into a super luchador after a series of unfortunate events. The combination of humor, great combat design, and a unique Mexican art style make for a great cohesive experience. Combat: The combat reminds me of a wrestling game mixed with a fighting game. There is so much satisfaction launching opponents into the air, getting a 3 hit combo, then transitioning into a bone crunching suplex. As the protagonist wears a luchador outfit, there is a strong emphasis on wrestling moves like the super frog splash. This game is the best thing to happen for wrestling fans and fighting games alike. As the game progressively gets more difficult, your moveset can be upgraded and larger combos can be generated. There are also more enemies on screen, which plays great into the ability to suplex or throw opponents into one another. Doing so can launch another opponent into the air that can be followed up with more combos and the following sequence can be repeated. Skilled players can easily get 200 hit combos, the largest I got was 117. Progression: Staying true to the theme of the game, the user acquires Pesos based on enemies defeated, treasures found, and the length of the combos during battles. Upgrades are pretty expensive, so the player is forced to decide what exactly they want to build out. You are not forced to grind at any point, but you do have the freedom to go back and defeat more enemies for more Pesos if you wish. There did not seem to be a limit on upgrades, and from some footage I've seen online there were people that had far more life and stamina than I did. I was able to complete the game without having to go back at any point though. Defeating bosses gives you sliver coins, which are used to buy skins or outfits. Buying outfits usually consist of a trade off, for example ""hits drain life of enemies, but player has 50% normal health"". You can switch outfits at any checkpoint though, so its fun to try out different outfits and see what suits your play style. Story The story emulates Super Mario. Superboss has your love, you chase them through the game, and you defeat a bunch of sub-bosses along the way. At one point, there is even a tribute to Mario during a boss battle, which was awesome. The dialogue stayed true to the Mexican theme throughout the entire experience. Characters periodically speak Spanish, and names of characters are slang Spanish (Mexican) which brings authenticity and humor to the dialogue. I could not believe the people that made this game were from Canada. The writing is funny and keeps you engaged, but the focus of the game is gameplay. I was happy the story was written concise and dense enough to allow for quick, purposeful dialogue that allowed me to get back into the action. Art Environment: There is a clear influence on the art that resides with Mexico itself. The color palette is very festive and bright, and I think I've seen every major color in this game. Even the dead dimension has neon incorporated within it, making everything feel very alive and fast paced. It makes for a very pleasing look that never seems to let up. There are details and works of art in every corner of the game. From the skeletons that resemble the known day of the dead art style to the design of the villages, each element of this game was carefully thought out and executed cleanly. Animation: With the amount of enemy types and NPC characters I was surprised I did not feel like there were shortcuts taken with animation. It seemed each enemy had their own thing going on and nobody shared moves or animations. With 2D games often times there are things that get re-used and it is easily identified. I appreciated the fact that this was either hidden very well or not done at all. Along with the rest of the art style, animation was flawless and there isn't much else to say than that. Conclusion A must have. The game is accessible to people of all ages. It is friendly enough for kids yet mature enough for a hardcore gamer myself. It reminds me of watching a Pixar movie where hidden jokes are added that only adults understand. When I was done playing, all I wanted to do was play more. The combat system is the star of this game because it is so addicting, but supported very well by the art style and authentic Mexican folklore that is both educational and fun to experience.. Great sense of style and humour. Combat can get repetitive, as with most brawlers, and the platforming offers the only real challenge in the game, as boss battles are all quite easy. Offers some clever platforming mechanics, but somewhat broken combat mechanics, which hurts the enjoy-ability of the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'll be honest. I hate this new style of HD indie, they look more lack a sharp looking flash game. They seem to lack any fine detail which to me makes the game dull. Guacamelee had me bored after around 3-4 minutes. The graphics were so boring and lifeless I couldn't bare to play anymore. The text boxes and story I skipped after reading a few badly written sentences then after trying to use the sluggish controls to walk from one NPC to another in this crude, badly animated world I turned it off, uninstalled and will never play again. Avoid at all costs even for free this month, bad choice yet again PS+.. This game is great, Although it's not a very ambitious project, it's put together very well. The visuals and music are good, but probably the combat mechanics and how your character progresses learning new tricks are its best aspects. I also liked the number of different enemies (although it's not that big, enemies evolve too, becoming more tough) and the boss battles, which are as hard as they need to be. You can add up to 3 more players to your party, what's brings additional fun. I played with my girlfriend and we have a great time. Unfortunately, it relies a lot on the comical element and if you don't speak Spanish (and if you're not familiar with Mexican slang) you'll miss much of the fun.. I had a lot of fun playing this game. It's easy, but also challenging. If you want to complete it at 100%, you need at least 15 hours (the first time :D). The two different switching worlds are a great idea. I'm so close to the platinum trophy!. Loved the fun and zany atmosphere and art style. Also liked the puzzle platforming. The combat was okay, but got repetitive in the long run...I enjoyed the game for a couple hours, but that was it before I got tired of the game.. Charming and funny story. Beautiful design. Great combat and mechanics. Got it for free of PSPlus so I may be biased. Sticking to walls while platforming is a pain in 1 or 2 occasions but otherwise fine. It achieved what it set out to accomplish, a funny metroidvania game, 9/10 for me.. A dull game not worth the money, there was nothing in particular about this game the made me happy I played it let alone invested $8 on it. The graphics are average, nothing even close to making me go wow, and the brawling just seems cheap. There's something off w timing & enemies can interrupt your attacks/ attack you from the dead world but you cannot hurt them unless you specifically change to the dead world even typing this sentence made me realize what a fk around it is. Every enemy can attack you regardless of the dead/ living world the game design is based on, even though a massive portion of the game is tied to switching to living/ dead world to attack/ avoid enemies, which is just lazy game design. Fk this game, I hate it yo. This game is great for what it is. The way i put it is, i never expect much out of it and it always exceeds **** funny. Platforming is good and challenging, could use a little more leeway in the landing zones though. Combat is about as challenging as it needs 2 be.Like the addition of grapple, rather than just melee.Only complaint really is the blocky level design. But any complaints go out the window, caz in my 3 decade history of gaming, i have never played as a luchador. Now thats awesome and funny. Well i might be wrong think thars been sum in fighting games ive played. Either way,haha ole!. This is my game of the year I absolutely loved it... It gives great props in the form of chozo statues from Metroid to get your power-ups and gives suttle references to a lot of other retro games. I can't wait for a part 2. I really liked everything about this game. My only complaint was how quickly I passed it because i got hooked! I liked the customization of costumes except it took me a while to actually get the ones I wanted. I guess this forced me to play more though. Although, once you pass the game, there are still more things to do that made this easy. Still, my favorite part is just how simple it was. You run around beating the crap out of skeletons while also figuring out some pretty challenging obstacles. the simple addition of adding another dimension (the land of the dead) made the world twice as big and also forced you to think about each encounter. Really impressed with the artwork too, although since I'm Mexican I was naturally bias :). A really fun game and a great way to spend a few hours. Its simple to get into, but the game play will keep you entertained. I think its still free (at this time) one xbone, so if you looking for a good game check it out.. Guacamelee is a side scroll beat em up game that may capture peoples experiences in different ways. I unfortunately, was not one of those people. This game was fun in the beginning but lost its allure fast. I choose very carefully which game I buy, and I will say I am happy this is free!. Buy this game now. This metroidvania-brawler is absolutely loaded. I played it first with the original version on PS3 and PS Vita and was worried that the amount of new content promised would be minimal however it is not. There are references left, right and centre with smooth brawling. This is also a magnificent platformer using various melee attacks to traverse puzzling terrain. It has beautiful music and the art style is gorgeous. As for the new features there are two incredibly large areas to explore with new ever-annoying enemies to provide an increased challenge. If you are into platformers, 2D side scrolling brawlers or even just unique game mechanics; you will not be disappointed.. Guacamelee super turbo championship edition is a re-release of the exceptional plat-former/beat-them-up which impressed both critics and consumers alike last year. The game is now on the PS4 with new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement. To put it simply, this is everything a game of the year edition should be. The Playstation 4 edition retains both the fun combat and challenging platforming that we loved last year and adds minor gameplay improvements to enhance the experience, such as the enemies now having health bars in addition to being able to choose costumes which alter health and stamina. These minor refinements only improve upon an already solid core game. The most obvious new addition to the game is the Intenso ability which is a standard rage mode, it works similarly to Batman’s shock gloves in Arkham Origins. The Intenso ability definitely makes the game easier but to balance that out, new elite enemies have been added to the latter stages of the game. For gamers interested in a challenge there’s still the Hard mode and also a new Shadow mode which makes enemies which shields much harder to defeat. Co-op also returns but it’s really nothing more than an afterthought as platforming which tele-porters and multiple dimensions is also impossible with two people. The new content for Guacamelee is interesting as unlike other story DLC such as The Last of Us left behind and Batman Arkham Origins Mr Freeze DLC which take place either completely before or after the core game, the new additions for Guacamelee have been woven into the core story with new levels and bosses taking place in parts around the middle of the game. This approach may annoy some Guacamelee veterans who just want to play through the new levels. But no matter how experienced you are at Guacamelee, the new DLC will add an extra 30% of playtime to the game, solving the issue of the original releases problem of being too short. Graphically there are only minor improvements to an already good looking game. The frame-rate is the most welcome improvement as it perfectly complements the slick fast paced action. The higher resolution is hardly noticeable, the increased amount of objects in the foreground however can be irritating as both Juan and enemies can become harder to see, this only happened occasionally but it was worth mentioning. Overall Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition is an excellent example **** of the year edition as it gives more content, includes all the original DLC and maintains the strong original experience, for those reasons it gets an A-grade. I strongly recommend the PS4 edition to anyone who hasn’t played the original game as it is the definitive version and I also recommend it to people who have already played the game, only if you live in the EU though, your probably thinking that’s a very strange requirement but the reason is because if you already own the","Guacamelee! Super Turbo Charge Edition was developed by DrinkBox Studios and released in 2014, just a year after Guacamelee Gold Edition in 2013 ."
666.DOOM 3,"It's a boring game, it doesn't satisfy me at all as a woman and it has a lot of bugs, the mechanics are heavy, I don't recommend it.. Scary, fun, and challenging, with a high degree of tweakability. In 2024, my personal favorite way to run this is Dhewm3 with D3HDP for improved widescreen, textures, and shaders. But DrBeef's VR port is also excellent if you run it on Quest 3 and disable all the texture/normal/specular downsize options and enable s_alHrtf. Well-written, gorgeous, tense, and expertly paced, although the boss fights often run you out of ammo, requiring the use of multiple savegames.. A classic of it’s time. Great scares and incredible lighting effects. Just play it already!. I decided to go through all the new parts of doom and did not bypass doom 3. I played the game a long time ago, but I stopped because my childish psyche could not cope with the fear that, as it seemed to me then, emanated from Doom Three. But after finishing the game now my opinion has changed. I will evaluate the game as it is now, and not as it was 20 years ago, because I also play now, and not 20 years ago. The graphics of this game did not cause me any discomfort, although they are not important to me at all, but still not the best, I don’t think that when playing this game you will admire the visuals of this game. In general, there is nothing to admire there, because the locations here are as boring and the same type as possible. Technically, this game has problems only with the resolution, which will have to be set through commands, otherwise everything is fine. I was disappointed by the sound in the game, not only is it bad, but the soundtrack was not delivered. The atmosphere in the game was highly praised, but honestly I didn’t see anything like that. The plot here is below average, and it’s not deep, there’s almost no lore, and the characters are nonsense. But the most important thing in a shooter is the gameplay, in fact, here it is an average shooter of those years, I won’t say that it’s bad, but there’s nothing unusual here, the bosses in the game weren’t particularly good either, especially the final one. Maybe at the realise it was 7/10, but now it’s only 5/10. Great game! People don't seem to understand this game was simply a different take on DOOM.. this game took a while to beat, its fun but generic also for the record, I killed every single friendly npc possible Super Turbo Turkey Punch Was Epic. the engine and character models are great: the graphics are still impressive even today - the gameplay however is the dissapointment of the century - a half baked half life clone, annoying sounds, enemies with simpler ai than doom1 and 2, useless guns that just don't feel right - the list goes on. When I play doom its seem cool killing the demons.Start is awesome.There are demons that are so annoying for me:Commando,cherub,trite. played on ps3, not as good other doom games. Doom 3 | 2021 | VR | Played for: 11h Barely remembering Doom 3 from when it was released, this VR standalone play-through in Quest 2 was very immersive and surprisingly smooth. The story is simple, setting and design of the game is superb, graphics are worthy of appraisal even 20 years later. Experiencing old titles in VR gives you, beside the nostalgia shot, a new perspective and appreciation for the game/level/artwork design. Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 9,5/10 Graphics/Physics: 9,5/10 Music/Sound: 9,5/10 Final Score: 9,05/10"". When I tried to play it when I was a kid, I gave up because I was too scared. When I started playing it many years later, I realized that it wasn't that scary, but the game really tries too hard to be unnecessarily scary. It's like the whole game is just jumpscare. Extremely dark places and enemies jumping out to attack you. It's annoying because they spread it throughout the whole game. The Doom series is all about action. Only in this game they tried to be a horror game and failed. Another annoying part is the attacks by armed enemy soldiers. If you give them the chance, they can kill you in an endless cycle of bullets without even giving you a chance to attack. This game needs a remastered version. BFG version is no different from the original game. The game is sadly too old to be played.. Looks pretty but the movement is painfully slow. A bit of a frustrating experience. Enemies can spawn out of cleared corridors, which feels odd.. Doom 3 has aged remarkably well. Even today, it retains a relatively pleasing visual appeal. Its ambient sounds and atmosphere are truly exceptional. Despite having completed it numerous times over the years since its release, I still find myself startled and experiencing unsettling sensations at night while wearing headphones. (Something that modern horror games struggle to achieve.) The level design was crafted by a genius; believable maps like these are a rarity even in the present day. One genuinely feels as though they are navigating through a functional facility. If hell truly exists, then within it, Dr. Betruger will be haunting you with his eerie laughter.. Doom 3 is a terrifying, atmospheric horror game with stunning graphics, immersive sound design, and intense gameplay. A modern classic.. The best DooM ever created. The best sound in the videogame industry (Trent Reznor soundpack, if you want even more). Top notch horror, top notch shooter, the last masterpiece from ID software. SHOTGUN FIX MOD is strongly RECOMMENDED! Flashlight mod too, but do not use the flashlight all the time and do not use the SoulCube, guys. Gameplay: combat mechanics 10/10 combat logic 6/10 atmosphere 10/10 Gameplay as immersive horror 10/10 Story 6/10 Graphics 10/10 Sounds & music 10/10 [great RU localization] . I can't believe you cut the horrifying cut-scenes of ""Pinky"" from the release version, devs! This could be the greatest horror game of all time!. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. This is the best Doom experience. Dark, creepy, fun, slow burning tension, and lots of Horror in a sci-fi setting. The story is simple but not bad, and thanks to the graphic style everything has a certain... ""weight"", a certain presence, that makes you feel like if you were trapped there, surrounded by monsters, lonelier with each passing second. Brutal.. I disliked its story[-0.5] just a little bit. To this day, I still see common clichés in storytelling and whatnot. For the most part though, that's not the main focus in this series, is it? Sound designs are decent *except* for some weapons[-1.5]. More specifically, the overall SFX of Submachine Gun and Handgun don't appeal much to me. I do have mixed feelings about the jumpscares. They started to feel like overkill not after a long duration of my single player expericence. Then again, when I came back to this game recently, I was somehow pleasantly surprised, simply because I wasn't expecting some of 'em. In general, a textbook horror game. Pretty spooky.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No matter how much time passes or how people try to warp their perception of what this game is, do not listen to them. Doom 3 was a massive mistake which completely killed the series for 12 years. Doom was an industry leader and they didn't make another one for 12 years, so don't pretend like this game was ever good. Doom is supposed to be fast, fun, quick, and supposed to make you make a decision every second, with your back up against the wall with you versus 30+ demons in the room. ""Puzzles"" involve either choosing hallways or finding keys, both of which are easy, fun, quick, and fit in with the fast paced game style. This game has none of that whatsoever and instead shoves its head completely up its own ---. You move slow as a snail, the whole game is just ammo management. Not being able to have your flashlight out at the same time, in Doom 3, perhaps the game with the least light in it in the history of time, was a stupid mistake. If you see anyone saying this was a good idea, you need to immediately disregard their opinion. When they re-released this game they had a feature where the flashlight is on your suit so you can have it on... but it has a battery so you can only have it on for 30 seconds or so. Which means you just stop and wait for it to re-charge. Nothing can save this game, just nothing. The Shotgun This is quite literally the game that started the meme of useless video game shotguns. The shotgun. DOES NO DAMAGE. AFTER 2 FEET. You NEED to move up to them until you get blocked by their body, then shoot. It is THAT useless, and the game expects you to use it for the first 2 hours. Most players give up and switch back to the pistol which, is harder and annoying. Of course, when zombies use the gun, it's GOOD for them against YOU! Zombies playing dead gets old Literally every single room has a zombie on the floor or a chair. This scares you the first time, after that it literally becomes a checklist item where you shoot them with 1 pistol round to see if they are alive or not. Oh wow, sure let's stop every 2 minutes and check if the zombie was alive. Oh wow it was. Amazing. The PDA and Lockers Do you want to sit there and listen to some guy who's dead now talk for literally 3 minutes as they try to inject a fake background story about life on the base, just for the 5 second part where he says the door code or locker code with a key in it you need? All they did was hire some voice actors to have an excuse to make you waste probably a combined total of 4 hours or so. NO, these are NOT optional and do NOT have text you can speed-read through. Look forward to opening multiple e-mail chains to find door codes as well. LITERALLY every game ever made, even ones at the time, just do it the good way which is ""you picked up the thing, you have the code now, go open the door and it will be used automatically"". Martian Buddy website is gone - Several lockers can't be opened anymore unless you google the code from other sites. They had a cute little website as a joke, which worked but it's gone now, and it shows how much they care about this game. Forced puzzles They have a crane puzzle where you completely stop the game and sit there for 5 minutes while you ---- around with a crane. They re-use it a bunch of times. There's a bunch of useless puzzles like this. Bosses - There aren't any except the Cyberdemon, and you defeat him in the most p---y way ever. Story - Forced, garbage, barely there. Not expected to be in a Doom game, but they tried and failed. Air - Pointless limitation when you are outside. WHY is this in the game? Demons look nothing like anything else. They are HR Geiger ""inspired"" and it doesn't work. The Cacodemon in particular looks awful. Soul Cube - Once you get it you basically can't be killed unless you want to be. Double Barreled Shotgun is only in the expansion which nobody played. Come on seriously? What is Doom without the double barreled shotgun? How could they mess that up? Platforming - There's platforming in HeII, this is as terrible as you think because of how slow you are. Lots and lots of cheap deaths. They didn't even get the helmet right. HOW COULD YOU MESS THAT UP? They made him go without his helmet to seem more ""vulnerable"". Obviously, the graphics were mind blowing at the time and held up for 5 years, and still look ahead of their time even now. That doesn't help the game nearly enough. Doom is about gameplay. Doom 2016 is the real Doom 3. 2016 is incredibly fast, fun, basically.... modern Doom. Again, if you see anyone saying 2016 was bad, disregard their opinion. IF YOU THINK DOOM 3 IS A GOOD GAME YOU ARE EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS INDUSTRY. IF YOU THINK DOOM 2016 WAS BAD YOU ARE EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS INDUSTRY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, STOP RUINING SHOOTERS AND GO PLAY A TURN BASED RPG.. It's not a bad game. Yes, it is different from the previous parts. But it has a good atmosphere. Yes, the level design is confusing and stern. But in some places it's scary and it's nice to shoot.. Doom 3 is really great game. This game for me is big nostalgia and kinda changed me. I know that some people think this game is boring. But there always was reasons why this game was so good for me. 1)Atmosphere. Just perfect. You always have feeling that someone near you. By the way I'm never get that people, who think that making flashlight not endless, but working with any weapons in remaster Doom 3 BFG Edition is great idea. Yeah it makes game easier and how I know it was made, because of consoles, but still on my opinion this kinda ruins atmosphere 2)Monsters. They just great all monsters and demons look scary and dangerous, You even sometimes thinking to hide, but not to attack. 3)Story. Yeah story in doom game. In first two Doom had plot, but it was feeling like it was only to explain why we kills demons. But in Doom 3 really got interesting plot. 4)Graphics and sounds. It kinda for atmosphere, but I wanted to make point on it. Game have really awesome graphic for this time and really great, scary and atmosphere sounds. So yeah Doom 3 is great game, that always gonna be in my heart. The way you feel like you really on mars is really great. This game kinda changed me. Before compliting this game I kinda liked horrors and this atmosphere, but wasn't that much interested in this. I wasn't even watched any famous horror movies, but this game just changed me. After compliting it I'm since this time really loves horrors, scary atmosphere and etc. So I'm definetly gonna say that Doom 3 is awesome game!. Doom 3 was actually solid horror game, especially by 2004 standards. Graphically it was outstanding at the time and lots of horror fans loved this game. I always liked doom 1 and 2, but by 2004 i was already on board with horror games, so doom 3 taking horror approach was just perfect. I think lots of people who's first doom was 2016 doom, will never understand greatness of doom 3, but it's their loss i guess. Doom 3 is great game and no complaining will change that.. Whereas the previous Doom games were pure action against hordes of demons, ID Software decided to present DOOM 3 as a hybrid of action and survival-horror. The graphics, sound, and environment in this game are top-tier for 2004. The story is also surprisingly detailed for a DOOM game. There are lots of quality mods to download for this game as well, most notably Redux, Phobos, Last Man Standing, and Classic Doom 3. Since I especially enjoy mods that are funny, I also recommend Infernal Death Orgy, Duck Nukem, Bubba Lego-Tep, X-Mass, and Damnatio Memoriae (ep. 1 and 2).. the enemies are far too tanky. there is no indication of spread for the shotgun. engagements are in small corridors and give no room for positioning. auto saves are far too infrequent. there is a lot of flinch upon being shot. the game has low visibility and makes the game more tedious by adding a flashlight mechanic where the flashlight is both ugly and has a very limited battery. it is tedious because the flashlight is very limited in battery. fear has flashlight required moments with unlimited flashlight battery. health regen is lackluster. deaths feel frustrating. Story: 60/100 Gameplay: 80/100 Graphics: 90/100 Music/Soundtrack: 80/100 Main Character(s): ?/100 Side Characters: 60/100 Regular Enemies: 90/100 Bosses/Boss fights: 100/100 World/Level Design: 90/100 Playability (Bugs and optimization after patches): 100/100 Would I Play It Again?: Yes Where Does It Rank In My Top 500 Video Games of All Time List?: 13 Rating: 90/100. The great return of a terrific incomplete saga. I see that many people enjoyed it. Unfortunately it is not my case. Obviously it was a big leap for id Software to leave this old-school range to propose a brand new content to players around the world. Graphics are bad to me. Not terrible but wow bad : poor textures, no colours, terrible effects, and everything is dark. Like boys, it's too much. We can't see a thing from beginning to end here ! Cinematics are a nightmare. Sound design and effects are okay. Weapons are unimpressive and particularly uneffective even against basic opponents. Interacting with codes and PDAs is really intuitive and well thought out. In general, the gameplay is really boring. You only have to follow long and empty halls and corridors. Progressing through levels is a pain in the neck, especially for the five first hours. Five hours : do you realize how long it is ? Enemies sometimes pop here and there but we are miles away from the intensity I knew for DOOM the 1st and II. Multiplayer is a big mess. AI is awful. The story is dull. Nothing to dream about for sure. Don't waste your time here.. Doom 3. The first game i've ever finished it has very special place on my heart back in 2006 or 2007 can't remember the exact date, the graphics was amazing back in the days well actually it is still beautiful in ultra setting with advanced graphics setting are on Play this before you die. This is one of the creepiest and most atmospheric games I've played. But, this game is not fun sometimes. Because you get stuck a lot and guns are not fun to use. But yeah I still recommend it, probably play it once and never again.. Not as fun as the original DOOM. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not a Doom game but a GREAT HORROR GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Graphics - 10/10 (by 2004 standard) Story - 7/10 Variety of enemies - 9/10 Amount of meaningful bosses with cool design - 8.5/10 Game's length - 9/10 Gameplay - 8.8/10 Variety of weapons - 9/10 General world design - 9/10 Fun factor - 10/10 Main/Pause menu music - 10/10 Sound/Music - 8/10 How many times i have finished it - 10 Where does it stand in my top ""1000 video games of all time"" list - 16. Doom 3 seems so underrated, but for a game that came out in 2004, it's actually really well made. I like the horror aspect and i understand, if some fans don't, but i really like this game. I would almost consider it a classic.. I was somewhat dissapointed that they pushed Graphics beyond Gameplay. Sure it was nice to see familiar monsters with great textures. But the tight/tiny corridor feeling just wasnt Doom. 90s run and shoot action game turned into 20s stealth horror game. Remember when you pumped your shotgun into the monsters body thus screaming in agony and falling into the ground? Not anymore. They simply fall and vanish. Remember the kick ass music that got your adrenaline pumped? Well you dont need any music in this just listen to voice records, thats your music what you get ****! Remember the chain gun and rocket launcher where you could go rambo? Well now you reload reload reload. Remember the DoomGuy that could fall from an **** and dont feel a thing? Well this is a Marine that brakes his legs when jumping off from an two feet ladder. And the Cyberdemon only killable with an artifact... Untill you discover you can actually put console commands into the game that speed up the gameplay and the game becomes an new experience more like the first two games. pm_runspeed 450 pm_walkspeed 280 pm_jumpheight 80. Back in 2004 it was a revolutional title in terms of graphics but the gameplay is the biggest problem of the game. If it was called anything else, it would be great but it's Doom and players expect a certain kind of experience from it. Now what is there is good but it doesn't have the same feeling and although i still liked it a lot and i enjoyed the horror atmosphere it never reaches the point where you get all the big guns and a bunch of large monsters to fight at the same time The only point where it feels like old school doom is in a couple of the last levels but that's just not enough. Even then, you can use an artifact to make it a lot easier - something a huge fan of the series like me just won't do because i want to blast away with my BFG. The last boss is a part of the problem above and is laughably easy. The fight could have been handled better if the additional monsters in the arena were of the larger, more dangerous variety but we got an overall disappointment. The game has a very slow start and the tempo never quite reaches a satisfying high point. As mentioned above, there are a couple of levels towards the end that are great and one a bit after the halfway mark of the game, otherwise it's a slog that only Doom fans will voluntarily go through today.. One of the best horror games ever made. Yeah it's not fast paced and thank god, because 2016 doom is just awful.. I know every games has their own stupid **** but when I compare Doom 3 with Quake 4, I much more prefer Quake 4. Why? This game is kinda **** Unlike Quake 4, Doom 3 flashlight is only usable if you equip the flashlight, meaning you can't shoot demon **** while you using the flashlight! The ammo and medkits are REALLY hard to find in this game so you'll always having critical health. There are less friendlies in this game because they're so **** stupid to survive, even the little spider robots can survive better! One more thing, if you wanna look at the objectives, you need to wait until the UAC-PDA loads! In Quake 4 however, you just need to hit the tab button and you can see objective. Yeah, Doom 3 is a ****ty game, but it's not the worst.. The game came out too late. Compared to 2004 games, doom was worse. But still a very solid shooter.. Doom 3 was a very good game, but its abrupt transition to the horror genre confused many. But I think this is one of the best FPS Horror games. Doom 3 is a masterpiece a truly one of a kind game awesome gameplay and atmosphere and everything is just passionately crafted the only game that comes close to this is the original F.E.A.R which is also a masterpiece. Furthermore, i can't express enough how much i love this game and its probably my favorite game of all time.. So i just replayed this game on Switch in 2020 and i can tell that this game is not that great. Probably at the time of the release some of the stuff was a breakthrough but gemaplaywise its very repetitive non intuitive corridor shooter with cool weapons.. Such a true masterpiece. This game is perfect, for being a 2004's game it's brutal, amaizing environments. Also, it is my favourite game. Gold. If you're looking for a fun, linear FPS, Doom 3 still, just about, holds up. Level design is fantastic. Lighting is good. Sound design works wonders. All of these aspects come together to create a far more tense doom game. It plays with your expectations throughout. As soon as you feel you've come to terms with all the game's tricks, it offers something new. You get used to looking around every corner, and then you have to get used to looking behind you, then you have to get used to examining even the wall panels. You never feel safe and this makes the game thrilling to play throughout. Despite the fact i can look past the outdated graphics, the outdated mechanics are a touch more difficult to handle. Swapping between weapons is particularly awkward. The bosses are laughably easy to beat. Somehow, the least satisfying weapon to use is the shotgun. There are lots of tiny issues that are likely even more prominent now because i'm playing the game so long after realise. Even so, its a fun game, that's still incredibly fast paced playing today. Most importantly, the tension the game sets out to achieve still holds up.. A real masterpiece of horror and the most impresive game of 2004. ID tech 4 brings you to hell witt amaizing shadows and dynamic lights. 10/10. Good stuff, but my least fav DOOM game out there. Still, check it out. Pickens approves!. Its not Doom but that doesnt make it a bad game. It tries to experiment a little bit more and set the game as this half life like horror shooter. Sadly gameplay is kind of meh and story is eeeh ok. Atmosphere is what they were going for i guess and its good.. Doom 3 is an great game. I know that is not like the original doom or the incredible Doom 2016 reboot, but god damn it is a great horror and action game. I found incredible how they make all the classic enemies scary and the game play was great. Doom 3 might not be the classic hardcore experience that Doom is know for, but Doom 3 it is a great horror game and an awesome game. Blood, guts and meat of demons... Immortal classics and the founder of the entire history of shooters with it's 1st and 2nd parts. The third part of the Doom was the most memorable game of its kind for me. I really liked this game, but I played it for a very long time. Due to the viscous and saturated with blood and horror atmosphere of the Martian base, which constantly puts pressure on the player, as well as the tough game-play, I had to pause constantly, going through this game to ... exhale. This is a masterpiece.. Better than Doom 2016. It's my childhood. The best horror shooter game I've ever seen. Good shooter. Loved the atmosphere. Had some annoyances with the AI basically just running toward you and surrounding you. Feels like a cheap way to script enemies. The plot is very similar to Half-Life. The flashlight being separate from your guns is annoying at first but eventually you won't need it. I think Dead Space 2 is like the ultimate version of this game. It's basically the same but does everything way better. I played on normal and it wasn't too difficult. You will fight mostly the same enemies and you don't even need to use all the guns. Shotgun and Assault Rifle were my go-to weapons. Only used the Plasma Rifle when the Assault Rifle ran out. NEVER used a single grenade. I'm pretty sure they're useless. Saved the Rocket Launcher for bosses. Didn't even end up using the BFG because I was saving it for the final boss then realised you can't damage him with anything but the Soul Cube. So like every survival horror game I play I finished with full ammo in everything lol. Anyway it's a good game that doesn't deserve the hate it gets from Doom purists. I'd rather play this than Doom 1 and 2.. What? This? You call this game comparable to Half life 2? No, it's not, its just ""that"" game in great game series which is weird and doesn't feet. Actually when this game arrived, there was not so many good games in that time, that's why it got this score but no no no, it didn't aged well at all, unlike half life 1 and 2, gameplay is boring and linear, story is non existing, guns are all the same. I didn't enjoy it when it came out, and i know that no one said that this is the best game ever, and now i see that fake reviews existed long time ago. I didn't remember anything epic from this game. This game aged like dead body - its skeleton now.. Despite this not being as good as the first two games, Doom 3 managed to be fun in a survival horror, trapped in darkness sort of way. It was just a struggle to even play it on a PC when it first came out.. Many fans call this game a ripped off. Those are just gamers who don't have taste of horror. This game is so much better than no weapon game, Outlast.. A legendary action/horror FPS that stays true to the original Doom games. The downside of the PC version is they removed the cooperative mode that the Xbox version had although there is a fan-made mod.. What hurts Doom 3 most is that it does not know what it wants: The atmosphere and level design say that the game's goal is horror, whilst the abundance of enemies and ways to kill them point at something far more action-packed.. The best Half-Life clone you'll ever play thats not a Half-Life mod nor the original Half-Life. Absolutely fantastic atmosphere, audio design incredibly ahead of its time and divine pacing. Sure, it ain't classic Doom. At least not for the first 6 hours. But then again, it's not just Half-Life. Doom 3 manages to find a really nice balance between the thinking of Gordon Freeman and the shooting of the Doom Guy. Massively underrated game.. By far the best Doom I've played so far. Great atmosphere, level design and action. This game can scare you. I wish they would have followed Doom III's design philosophy for the latest Doom.. Very atmospheric and scary. The only reason I knock it down a point is because most of the levels look the same, and you can get lost, even though it's somewhat linear. EXCELLENT 5.1 sound, even if some of the guns sound muffled like the chaingun and plasma rifle. The environment sounds are what stand out here. The sounds will have you turning left and right constantly, checking your back for enemies. Graphics at this time were jaw droppingly gorgeous. It tested my Radeon 9800 Pro to the extreme, and it was well worth the purchase. Outside the Diablo franchise, this game contains one of the coolest Hell levels ever designed. 9/10. It's addicting.. Doom 3 focuses on elements of horror, therefore it is the weakest part of the Doom series. 90% of this game contains darkness, therefore, you must pull out torch,which slows the gameplay. However, this game has a great storyline, the enemies are strongest and weapons are pretty good (the exception is machine gun, which is probably the weakest weapon in game). Horror elements to the Doom series does not belong, therefore I can not give a rating greater than 7.. It has the foundation to be a great game, but it has too many flaws. 1) Fall damage is excessive. You'll lose 20 life if you fall 5 feet. It makes the game less of an adventure. 2) Lots of jump scares. It might have been cool the first time, but the 20th time is just annoying. 3) Getting hit causes your aim to go crazy. This makes the game **** because it means one can't run and gun like it's a Doom or Quake game. One needs to use cover all the time when fighting former humans. 4) Enemies can be very difficult to see because there is a very little contrast between enemies and the environment. Doom 3 removed all of the things that made the original Doom interesting.. Just recently replayed the latest edition, I now remember why I hated this game. This game is a pure shooter, it may say horror but it sets ambushes throughout, to scare and set a frantic set, its contrived. The level design is a pure maze, with puzzles at choke points, this is the most asinine **** and illogical level design I have ever seen, I seriously went around in a circle for an hour, just to find some door I was supposed to open. Let me reiterate, this kind of level design is pure **** I hear Doom 4 is some shooter EA style, glad I got this POS out of my system before I tried there latest piece of crap.. Lots of people love to talk crap about this game, but in context, it was a huge leap forward for the series you know, being able to actually aim up and down and have environments that were vast and required actual exploration. Sure it was dark but lots of horror games are so that's a moot point. The monsters were pretty good, especially later in the game although the bosses were a bit weak. Actual footsteps rather than feeling like you were floating around felt a lot more rewarding and realistic. Maybe 8 is a little too generous but when played with a good surround sound, high end graphics, and with little knowledge of the game beforehand it was a rewarding, scary experience overall. It's not perfect by any means, but a solid, fun game.. Overall, this game was great. different, but it's still great for some reason, Monsters looked nice and scarier, the gameplay was terrifying and challenging. my main issue of this was the **** SHOTGUN. the spread, dear god. but that's just my personal opinion. but I don't understand why people said that this wasn't a doom game... because you're still fighting demons from hell, but way more scarier and slower for a difficult and challenging experience. if this game wasn't called ""Doom"" then everyone will think that this was a **** rip off to doom or just another horror version of doom. which everyone will still hate it for ripping off Doom's weapons and monsters.﻿. I really enjoyed this franchised, so I couldn't let Doom 3 unplayed. ","well-written, gorgeous, tense, and expertly paced, although the boss fights often run you out of ammo, requiring the use of multiple savegames . technically, this game has problems only with the resolution, which will have to be set through commands, otherwise everything is fine . the plot is below average, and there’s almost no lore, and the characters are nonsense ."
667.Subnautica,"one of the best survival/horror games of all time, amazing storytelling and world building. also does amazing as a horror game for people that fear the unknown. this game is amazing. it is a survival experience unlike anything ever seen. the base creation is cool. the biomes and creatures are really unique. Subnautica is a wonderfully designed survival open world game that does its job perfectly well. Each biome is distinct and fun to explore to some extent, and the game does a beautiful job at making the environments feel alive and real. The ecosystems of fish in most areas all feel realistic while being fascinating and otherworldly. The gameplay is smooth and does a good job at making you feel like you're swimming instead of just floating (due to the movement animation and how the water is shaded mostly). This game is also more terrifying than any horror game I've played while being a survival game. Maybe it's just my thalassophobia, but every time I see a biome drop off into another deeper area I have to gather genuine courage to even move a few feet forward lol. The story of the game is told in a pretty simple manner (voicelogs) and one could argue that this type of storytelling is cliche or hackneyed (a lot of games use this type of world building) but this game was one of the first experiences I had playing video games and therefore the storytelling has more weight for me than for other people (possibly). The inventory is way more forgiving than other survival games and the addition of different types of lockers gives you basically unlimited storage (which of course is a plus). Crafting is easy at first but later requires you to explore much more deeper in order to find the materials needed for vehicle modules and the end game goal. Base building is pretty easy and not very costly for the most part. The vehicles are pretty fun to control (especially the prawn suit) and you will need them to beat the game (or to really do anything in this game). Overall, this is a great survival game and worth every penny it goes for.. i played the crap out of this game it is the most beautiful environment for survival and has a great story. The view glitches I encountered were funny and not game-breaking. and sometimes even gave me a great challenge to overcome it in game. I loved the time capsule thingy .its game design is the best.. Best exploring game of the ever. İ dont say bad about this masterpiece. Just i want the know mc's lore and what the hell happening in the aurora before the explosion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An incredible open map game where you explore oceans with different fish and even monsters. And you can create bases in different parts of the game.. A masterclass in terror. Especially if you have thelassophobia, fear of deep waters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a great game, very good enviroment and good feeling when playing. Gave me thalasophobia.. One of my favorite games of all time. The developer made a fantastic immersive survival game.. Best water themed exploration game ever, the devs made a great work. Great game!. Top tier game, best survival game I've played (except for Minecraft maybe). Great map. Everything is alive, it's beautiful and very scary at the same time. It never gets boring andthe animals are creative. There are stunning moments in this game which makes it feel even more alive.. Incredible exploration and survival game. The atmosphere and the music of the game is immersive and breathtaking.. This is my favorite game of all time. The world and exploration are second to none. There is a true sense of wonder when you first jump in that no other game has achieved. And the progression is excellently done as well.. Future games should have more monsters in the deep as well as bigger monsters. There needs to be a depth accurate to a planet like the Mariana trench at 10,972.8 meters. Also needs more vehicles with different types of submarines, add carriers etc.. Awesome, memorable experience. The building aspect is secondary, what really stands out is the immersive biomes and exploration. It is a gem, a unique game that I will remember forever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game I’ve ever played, the story is super engaging, it is mildly terrifying without being a horror game, and I get goosebumps every time I play. This game is a must-buy, especially because of how cheap it is. I strongly suggest you check this game out and play the sequel while you’re at it.. Story: 10/10 Characters: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Visuals: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 The best open world survival horror game. Easly better then Ark or Forest.. For me its a must play becouse theres so much content, and so many good mods. The game is good for new players cous you dont know what creatures are out there.. It worth absolutely the experience, you Will never find anything like this, the sound, the surrondings, the fear of your imagination.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Subnautica is genuinely, in my opinion, is the best game of all time. It offers such a new view for me, combining a great story, survival, horror aspect, and fun combined into one. I never thought an underwater game would change my view of gaming entirely. The game is so perfectly designed to where you need to craft something to become more powerful, and in order to find those crafting materials you have to explore deeper and deeper into the world of Subnautica(literally.) Everything is perfect in this game in terms of balance, story, horror, etc. The only problem is SOME performance hiccups, but i'm sure that's an easily ignorable thing at times. Like I said at the beginning, overall the best game I have ever played. 9.9/10 game.. Superb survival and exploration game. It has excellent atmosphere, creature and map designs, achieving total immersion. It is simultaneously beautiful, strange, unsettling, and to some extent, terrifying. The crafting possibilities, variety of materials, vehicles, and base construction are enormous but not overwhelming. The story and lore are fantastic—a puzzle that you piece together gradually, learning more and more about the planet and its past and present inhabitants. The only downside is the optimization and several significant bugs that can ruin your game. It's the kind of game that you really wish you can forget and play again for the first time!. This game is one of the most important games that I have ever played. It offers a totally different experience with delightful gameplay. It's a game that has truly made a difference in my life. This game gave me one of the best times in my life. If i only could i would erase my memory to explore this game again. This is one of those games that has mixed opinions and some notable issues but I absolutely LOVED this game. I just felt in love with the progressing system and the underwater exploration. Haven't finished it yet, but will do soon.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't play survival games and this is the first one that I have finished. The grind is not too hard on you here an somewhat satisfying. I was directed where to go, but it is not difficult to figure it out by yourself. The overeall idea and experience earn additional point, the design of animals is also interesting. The story is not deep and there are no characters to interact with, music is good and complements your diving experience. You may like it a lot or drop on the first try, the game is good in its niche and finds its fans, but there is no much here that will surprise you.. THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WATER THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WATERTHERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WATERTHERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WATER. Overally the game was an actual great experience with new interaction of an survival game which is letting you exploit deep in the ocean, however there's a thing that i don't like and hope to be fixed which is saving your progress. In case of crashing game or your computer shut down won't automatically save your game. Therefore be careful if you want to log out or roughlythat. Amazing game, I will never step 1 foot in the ocean again. Subnautica is a fun but terrifying underwater exploration game, that I would 100% recommend playing.. this is a super good game play it if u can if not just do it do it do it do it. This game is like the first time I ate ****. Wet, salty, and it never goes anywhere.. Subnautica is a very enjoyable game with it’s unique world type and creatures it sonetimes scares the hell out of you and sometimes it pulls you towards to the deeps i recommend this game to everyone that loves survival games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It actually very great but the prize is kinda high,but i bought it when it sale at 125 baht is around idk 3 dollars??? wouldhave been better if i can play Co-op. Art game. Slow and boring. I think my favorite part was waiting for a timed event to happen, gathering enough resources so that I could go to investigate, and discovering that the giant ship has textures worse than an NES game - all while wasting my time and that there was nothing particularly valuable over there. I'd give it a 0/10, but it actually works.. Good game with a atmosphere thats really immersive and a meh story that i couldnt care less about tbh. But a really great game for exploration and just roaming the open world. really fun and enjoyable in the beginning its a bit confusing but gets explained nicely. Great game, beautiful landscape, but I find so many glitches and bug. gameplay is really fun and kept me engage during 30 hours of gameplay, finding something new to unlock blueprint to craft is really addictive. Game has the best climate that I ever felt in video game. It's fishing simulator with couple of additional steps. It's much very worth the time and cash. Game takes around 20 hours to complete (at least for me), you sure can complete it earlier, it's mainly depedent on how much do you for example take care of the base building or how fast are you progressing. Let this game age like a fine wine.. Very good environments, discovering them for the first time was both scary and really cool, wish there were another game that had something like it. Pretty buggy though. Fantastic game! The lore is very interesting and the surroundings look beautiful. This game is, lets face it, BAD like really BAD! Its just minecraft underwater and with more bugs. Minecraft was already a sorry mess but this takes open world survival craft to a new low. Do better devs..... MY FAVORITE GAME. Subnautica is beautiful, amazing, interesting, the lore is so cool, and the exploration is VEEEEERRRRY GOOD, I put a9 because the game as many bug but many of them d’ont break the game.. An incredible story with an amazing mystic world. High tier science fiction with good gameplay and open world.. Very good game, nice exploration and story. I found it quite enjoyable playing. Highly recommend.. This is probabily my most favourite game of all time. I got almost 300 hours and eachand every one of those was worth it!. One of the most atmospheric and beautiful survival game I've ever played! I highly recommend it to everyone.. The best game about undersea. The story is absolutely amazing. graphics, music, gameplay, monsters, everything was perfect. It is definitely one of my favorite games. Even though I have completed the game 3 times, I still play and build structures from time to time. thank you so much for creating this game!. One of my favorites of all time, i love the gameplay the lore the progression the athmosphere of the game. Even they couldn't top this game. Only thing between the 9 i have given and a solid 10 is the little but annoying bugs.. One of my favorite games. The game is an ultra-well-made sandbox with tons of features. The map is extremely large and the game is pretty scary when you're just starting out. I'm not giving it 10/10 because of a few rare bugs that had quite an impact on my gaming experience (the seamoth getting stuck on the sand).. Very unique under water survival game, different game modes, beautiful graphics and some of the best music and audio I have heard in a game yet. At work I literally have Subnautica music and songs stuck in my head whistling away while at work. The way the game progresses is designed very well, always needing to push deeper and farther to get better tech to continue your journey through this beautiful ocean environment while finding points of interest everywhere. Base building is clean with loads of content for bases and upgrades for vehicles and handheld **** of my top 5 indie games ever made, but this game is AAA quality no doubt. If you have a fear of deep water and the ocean I highly recommend playing this game. Beacons are your friend.. When you want a cheap game and Grega graffic this is for you. Very addictive, great game. The only critic i have is that it needs more defensive buildings and craftable goods you can actually use besides whats already in the game. And i wish it had coop play just like ark and no mans sky. If there was a coop i would play hundreds of hours more with a friend. The story never bothered me. I play only the sandbox experience and this game is perfect. You as a player really feel small in this big hostile world.. This is not game, this is experience, adventure, immersion, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT IN THIS <3 <3 <3 <3. The best survival experience i've ever had. My favourite story game of all time. Intro- From the developers of Half-Life: Natural Selection, comes one of the most anticipated survival horror games in recent years. Subnautica is vastly different from other games in the genre because, as the name suggests, it’s almost entirely set beneath the ocean of Planet 4546B. There are many challenges that come with creating a game this advanced entirely in the sea, yet Unknown Worlds have blasted this out of the water (pun intended). Expectations- Subnautica is a big game with brilliant visuals, awe inducing sound design and a load of scares. It certainly set the bar quite high for itself. Considering the number of survival horror games recently, the niche market isn’t looking so niche anymore. Despite this, my expectations were more than met. It has been thoroughly thought out, every aspect considered, and is truly one of the most immersive games I’ve experienced in some time. The implementation of many alterations due to player reviews shows that the developers sincerely care about the experience of Subnautica, which is a refreshing change to micro-transaction filled games. Gameplay- Subnautica has fantastic gameplay, the fluidity of different aspects of the game is incredible. From the way the submersibles work so well in tandem to allow you to explore efficiently and create mobile expedition survival bases, to the integration of different fauna and flora in the environment making the entire world feel cohesive and immersive. The controls are intuitive and feel natural to use, the HUD is simple yet effective. The flow of the game is well balanced, giving the player enough freedom to explore whatever they feel, in whatever order they choose whilst still slowly pushing them through the game using time-based story anchors. The game does a great job of making you hate the depths however still enticing you to go deeper and deeper. Overall, the gameplay is excellent but it does have some faults. Subnautica has been known to be buggy and this can be rather annoying at times, occasionally detracting from the experience, but they aren’t overly common. The performance of Subnautica can, at times, leave a little to be desired, however it will still run on a mid-range GPU. Graphics/Audio- In terms of graphics, this game is stunning. The immersion created by the scenery is incredible and really allows you to lose yourself. The environments are vivid but still moody enough to create a great atmosphere, they feel alive and like a cohesive ecosystem that is perfectly knit together. The environment and creatures make it even clearer. They act predatory and defensive, further solidifying the idea that you really don’t belong. Subnautica uses its environmental graphics well, your lack of vision and darker areas stop you from seeing what might be out there but at the same time lighter more colourful areas signify a lack of danger. Visual cues throughout the game make the experience overall more enjoyable. The sound design in Subnautica is second to none, the music fits like a glove and subtly shifts as you progress through different areas to create tension. The roars of enemies off in the distance, just out of sight, allows for the game to lean heavily into terror instead of horror, meaning that the creatures of 4546B don’t really ever stop being scary. The soundscape is unique and further proves that you’re very much alone on this planet. Length- Subnautica does an excellent job of enabling different lengths and styles of play, it’s the kind of game where you can just jump back right in where you left off and play for 10-20 minutes of you can lose yourself for an entire day and not even notice. The game can be finished in a couple hours or you can spend days exploring and creating huge bases allowing a single game to take 100+ hours. Story- Whilst it isn’t the most in-depth story to ever be written, there are enough guts to keep you interested and entice the player to search deeper and deeper into the abyss. Without many interactive elements in the story, such as NPC’s, the game tends to rely more on the intricacy of other aspects to help guide you further into the story. However, Subnautica does a good job of gently nudging a loitering player further along as it has several scheduled events that force you to move on. Target audience,pro/con- Subnautica has a fair share of jump-scares so it may not be the best idea if youre the nervous type. It is versatile and anyone can enjoy and be immersed in the experience. Pros: The immersion and depth are unmatched, Subnautica can get a scream out of the most veteran of horror game players, The environment and sound design make this one of the most fulfilling survival games out there. Cons: The story, although not bad, might not really have the content for players who prefer a little more lore, The game can be challenging to progress through, and its known for being a little buggy. Usually these are minor and insignificant but some can affect the experience occasionally.. fantastic horror game. The best exploration game I’ve played yet, with a great ending.. Nearly the best survival game NO.2. Subnautica Took Me A While To Get Into, As I Had Never Really Played Other Survival Games Except Games Like Minecraft, But I Loved It To Bits By The End. You Learn To Become Wary Of What's Out There In The Sea, And As You Get Further In You Discover More And Unlock More Which Makes It Safer To Discover Some Areas, Like The Prawn, But You're Never Safe, And That's What Is Great About Subnautica.. Overall: 83/100 Subnautica is a survival and exploration game focused on deep sea diving. Selling the feel of diving into an unknown area where you have a sense of anxiety, adrenalin, and excitement is what Subnautica does best, but there are also many other enjoyable aspects to the game. The game falls short in some graphical areas and some parts of the mid game are a bit slow/stale, where the story progression slows down. Gameplay: 8/10 Graphics: 7/10 Music/Sound: 9/10 Uniqueness: 9/10 Monetization: 9/10 Gameplay - The diving aspect is executed very well. You really feel like you're diving. Learning new recipes for items you can create, along with building your base, is also very fun. There is always something new you're looking forward to creating. While looking for those materials, you often find another blueprint. It keeps you engaged and always saying ""I'll just do this before logging off..."". The story is good, but not amazing. The only bad thing I can really say about the gameplay is that it gets a bit repetitive in the mid game, where there is a bit of a slow down in the story progression. I feel that the developers could have added a bit more here to keep the gameplay flowing. Graphics - Certain graphical aspects are really good! These I would rate 8 or 9 out of 10. The best of these are the water effects, and the biomes. The water looks great, especially when underneath and there are sunrays bursting through the water. It's brilliant and really sells the feeling that you are diving. The biomes are beautiful, and each feels very distinct. The colors are gorgeous, and the graphics of the different plants and fish you see in different biomes are lovely. Where the graphics are let down most is pop-ins. It's really immersion breaking and very frequent. Whenever you are travelling you will see it everywhere. There is no option to increase draw distance. There are a few other areas where the graphics could be better, such as the planet in the distance, which looks almost like a cardboard pop-in and at times doesn't even seem like it's in the distance. Music/Sound - Brilliant. It really sells the feeling that you are diving into an unknown area. Each biome has different music, matching the vibe of that biome. There are some biomes where the music really gets your adrenalin pumping. The sound effects are great too, even the little things such as guggling down some water. Excellent job by the sound team, and I think sound is a very underrated aspect ****. Uniqueness - There is no other game like it. If you want to feel like a diver and want to explore and underwater world then pick this game up right now. It would get a 10, however it does re-use many survival game aspects, so I can't call it a completely unique game. If you have played many survival games, you will probably find the survival aspect boring. But the underwater exploration is just simply fantastic and you will not find it anywhere else. Monetization - Excellent. You pay for the game once. You own the game forever. There are no macroscamsactions, lootboxes, or any of that garbage. It didn't get a 10 because to get a 10 you have to be incredibly good value, and the game is still in that £20-£30 bracket. While absolutely worth it, I have seen on occasion some simialr quality level games at under £10. And these are the ones that I would give a 10 to. The devs have also offered some DLC, but they have put effort into it, and it is standalone to Subnautica, so you don't need the DLC. Think of that as a different game! Overall, Subnautica is absolutely worth the money. Developers who don't try to scam their players should be rewarded. It is currently £25 which is good value. Overall, if you have an inclination to explore an underwater world and like the idea of diving, and improving your equipment to explore more and more areas, then seriously consider buying this game. This is what it excels at. The story and the graphics are good, but not exceptional. Survival game lovers might find the survival aspects a bit boring as they are pretty standard.. designs of the creatures are amazing, survival mechanics are good, and the whole atmosphere is just so good, but we don't talk about the bugs.. Obviously playing it was an unique experience. Every gamer should play this.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Im not too big a fan of open world game, but this game really change my mind about it. Every area have a unique distinguished feature, with atmosphere and sound that is very fleshed out The sound design is definitely the main feature here, you can tell where you are from the enemy sound or if you being chased by something terrible There is no map in the game so you have to either memorize the place or just use beacon, however memorizing the map is not that hard after putting few beacon for landmark because of the unique flora and fauna in every area. 10/10 not recommended if you have a fear of the ocean. One of the best games I played recently. +Beautifull designs and original survival sandbox +Tension and fear of the unknown deep ocean +Good OST -Lack of NPC -Character with unknown personality. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 89 IIIIIIIIII====================. Survival game with the twist that there are no good means of killing most of the dangerous creatures, so they just have to be looked out for and outmaneuvered throughout the biomes. While exploring, there is also an intriguing story found which form interesting developments. The story points to a general direction of where to go next, and what structures to explore. Unfortunately, attempting to build outposts in new areas is limited to boring circles and cylinders overshadowed by the worldgen(static). Although the endgame was uneventful and tedious, Subnautica was overall fun as a whole.. Subnautica is one of the best examples of what makes videogames fun. Its mainly immersion. Unlike modern videogames Subnautica doesn't assist the player throughout the play-through. No tutorial, no handholding, no cutscenes, no map, no real indication of what you have to do, nothing. Only the freedom to decide what you want to do yourself. This base already fades away the sense that you are playing a videogame. On top of this, your character never talks, which really makes you feel like you are that character. Not that you control a character with its own conscience. After playing for a while, you start to realize that you really have to figure out everything yourself. And because the underwater world and its mystery is so captivating, you can easily put up with long hours of exploration to seek out every place and piece of information there is to find. To top it all off Subnautica is incredibly scary. I can say with certainty that Subnautica is going to introduce you to multiple fears you didn't know you had. They play right into those fears by adding fog, big wrecks, big bodies of water, darkness, disturbing looking biomes and worst of all alien sea monsters. Not to forget the incredible sound design by Simon Chylinski which builds up the tension from 0 to 100 real quick. After a certain point, Subnautica becomes a battle between your curiosity and your fear of the unknown. Overcoming that fear time after time was a great experience. There is honestly so much more to say about this game, but you really just have to experience it yourself.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Great World I had slept on Subnautica for the longest time, it had been in my library more or less since release and until now I only had around an hours play-time in it. I viewed it as just a weird underwater survival sandbox but it really is so much more than that. Firstly the game looks great, it's very colourful and the different biomes take on a whole new colour palette whenever you enter them and leave them which makes the world feel more enjoyable to explore. The different fauna and fish; the amount of detail and lore they've put into these things just from scanning them is absurd, but in a good way. There's always something to read and learn and eventually you begin to feel one with the surrounding marine life. The resources you get are interesting, or at least the way you get them is interesting and fun to me. A bit of mining, a bit of cutting and combining them to make new items so that you can fabricate even more advanced materials and items. It's no different really from most survival crafting games but there's something a lot more satisfying about getting items in this game than it is others. Maybe it's just the sound of the fabricator. There is an overarching story, but I won't delve too deep into it, basically you've crashed on an alien planet and need to get off the planet; and some other stuff happens here, there and in-between, but I won't spoil it here. My only real criticism is that some resources can be rather difficult to find, Kyranite especially. You can be wandering around for quite a long time in the completely wrong area and have absolutely no idea that you're wasting your time. So you end up basically scanning the entire map to find out where to go, only to need to get an upgrade to go there. Which isn't a problem, getting the upgrades is part of the fun, but it can be rough after searching for a while, finding where you need to go, only to back-track to get the resources to go there. Feels like time wasted. Furthermore in order to complete certain tasks, you need certain items which are hidden in deep sea bases, without some of them, it's near impossible to complete the game. Sometimes you get a weird frame-stutter bug when entering and exiting a vehicle, it's noticeable but it's not game breaking by any means. I enjoyed my time in Subnautica, it's one of those games where you'll be asking. ""Where did the time go?"" And next thing you know, it's 5am. Don't do what I did and sleep on this, it's a phenomenal game. For a first run, just have your goal to be to complete the game and you'll find the magic that's laced throughout this amazing world. 7/10 - Will likely do another playthrough at some point.. The first couple of hours into the game I really loved it, I would have given the game 10/10. Later on when the radio messages stop you may lose a sense of direction. At that point the game becomes about grinding for resources to upgrade your equipment. In the end it stays a wonderful world to explore. + Good + + Beautiful world + Excellent atmosphere + Great sound + No guidance in what to do, this makes the game a little bit more believable and adventurous. - Not so good - - Inventory management. Too small inventories make grinding for resources exhaustive. - Pop-in of the environment, at one point I got stuck in the game because I couldn't find a certain location. - No in-game map. Finding back certain locations becomes hard. - No hint system or guidance to progress.. Very fun and climatic half survival half horror experience. the thalasopfobia fellows will defiantly have fun. Incredible open world undersea game. Really sells the undersea environments with many believable yet alien animals and environments. Ambience is stunning, the game is overall gorgeous, and its only big flaw is some technical issues around pop-in. Great exploration game, especially if you enjoy the sea. It has a beautiful art style and a pleasant mystery story that you have to discover by yourself like a marine detective :D Unfortunately the game could have used a lot more polish, as the controls for certain transportation options were very clunky, frequently getting stuck on edges. Fish and other more dangerous creatures would oftenly clip through solid objects, which also hurt the overall experience. The enemies were also quite derpy and once you get used to them it becomes trivial to avoid them. In the second half of the game, especially the end, it did really get excruciatingly dull when it came to gathering materials for the ""final ingredients"" and components in order to finish. Overall this is a fairly enjoyable game if you're a fan of diving and exploring the natural world, with a few caveats.. My favorite survival, the exploration is very well built and discovering the planet is very cool. Best survival game out there right now.‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎. Playing this game truly was a great experience. You get dropped into an open world and left to your own devices, which is both exhilarating and scary, though the game gives you hints where to go through immersive story telling. Since you are on an unknown planet somewhere in the future, you have no clue about the dangers of the waters or the capabilities of the tech you discover along the way, which makes playing refreshing and rewarding. The game has a lot of horror-y asp","one of the best survival/horror games of all time, amazing storytelling and world building . subnautica is a wonderfully designed survival open world game that does its job perfectly well . the ecosystems of fish in most areas all feel realistic while being fascinating ."
668.Mouthwashing,"Great! Not just horror but thought provoking, great story, deep and it gives an introspection into yourself. Play it. One of, if not the best genre defining physiological horror games ever made. An absolute Master-Craft of storytelling and writing, memorable character design and visuals, and a creep factor set to just the right degree. Nothing is uninteresting in this game. One of my personal favorite games of all time, even with how short it was. I could spend half an hour rambling on and on about my favorite moments. An absolute diamond in the rough, go give it a shot if you haven't already. 11/10. Peak fiction, despite the plot line being al jumbled. In fact, I think it being all messed up makes it better, as I see it as remembering what happened while in your final moments. Absolutely amazing and a must play, reccomended you go in blind.. Mouthwashing is a masterpiece in psychological horror. Subverting common horror game tropes in order to tell a bleak and intense story that holds nothing back. It may be a relatively short game, but the experience will stick with you after a playthrough. This game is best to be played without any spoilers.. Short and sweet must-play. Well, maybe not so much play, more an experience in suspense, superb writing and an atmosphere you could cut with a fire-axe. Also the best donkey-ultrasound-simulator to date.. It made me sign in to metacritic to share my emotions. This game is TOO SHORT. We want more more and more. Loved the setting and narrative, could of definitely used more sequences with the crew compared to the trippy stuff. Played on Steam Deck.. Great game ! The story is well told and engaging, and the ambiance is very special.. “I am 14 and this is deep therefore its the best game ever made” ****. Shallow undercooked story that explores too many themes and succeeds at none. One of the worst character development efforts for a story this ambitious. Extremely overrated.. This game is a waste of time. Absolutely stupid. Its a point and click, youre there just for the story, which ****. Terrible game, I hope its creators feel shame for it.. Quite possibly the greatest indie psychological horror ever developed. Mouthwashing pushes the limits of video game storytelling. You won't find any jump scares here, but tons of suspense, grim anxiety, and body horror.. Brief and haunting. I really appreciated the different story hooks like dialogue and environmental stuff that teased you as well as the non linear story telling. The old PS1 style is really great to see and adds to the dread as sometimes details and figures down a hall have that added fizzle to make them more frighting. The ship starts to feel like home pretty quickly and I almost wouldn't have minded looping through more days of just mundane hopelessness and conversation; just to hang out more. The lack of abundant jump scares is also great as the game finds ample ways to scare, even small things like the game seeming not to fully pause in the pause menu is unsettling as are even smaller things that change like how characters teleport to where they need to be rather than walk there in real time. This was exceptional. Mouthwashing is.. something special. Certainly one of the best horror games in recent time. Seriously, I kept thinking about the themes of this game for several days after I finished it. It's just so captivating. From the stunning and unique look to the well written characters and the atmosphere that ranges from pure horror to light-hearted moments, it's a ride you will not forget. My one and only complaint about this game are some of the gameplay sections that only stretch playtime and are not really adding anything to the experience.. Without spoiling too much: Mouthwashing is a psychological horror game that tells a harrowing, non-linear story of a cargo ship crew stuck in space and how this entire situation deteriorates their psyche. Fantastic art style, great use of music and sound, and an easy recommendation to anyone looking for a short yet incredibly interesting and disturbing horror game. 8/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great story, characters, and sound design. Unfortunately the gameplay is little more than walking around and talking to people, so I would've liked more interactivity within the game world and more gameplay mechanics.. Mouthwashing is a game that made me afraid. This game is not about mouthwashing, Mostly. Go play it. Without a doubt this is the best game 2024 for me good story good writen characters some puzzles are boring but doesnt matter other things are so good that you dont sen the bad things","one of, if not the best genre defining physiological horror games ever made . a masterpiece in psychological horror, it tells a bleak and intense story that holds nothing back . the story is well told and engaging, and the ambiance is very special ."
669.Devil May Cry 5,"Peak combat, amazing and over the top story, great enemy design, exceptional bosses and insane soundtrack. This game does everything right and more. Every character is different and I had great time with them all not to mention that replayability and skill ceiling are almost infinite. Would give it 11/10 if I could. The gameplay is ridiculously good . There is infinite amount of moves and combos in every character and every companion and every weapon. Although the story is bad as usual from DMC but the characters are enjoyable with there sense of humour.. I very much enjoyed this. Great combat story and music. Good replay value as well.. Devil May Cry 5 is the best game of the franchise (with Devil May Cry 3 a close second). The story is great and very entertaining, the graphics are somewhat insane, the characters are great, the music is really good, the enemy design is very well done, the bosses are chaotic, and the gameplay is excellent, awesome and very fun with great weapon variety that makes you want to get better in the game to have way more fun. Capcom, take your time for Devil May Cry 6, it needs to be the best ending possible for the franchise to surpass this game. It's a game that proves that a franchise doesn't always need to change to save itself, but to let time pass and make a game that is totally worth your time and that you will love.. My first DMC game I've ever played and I've got to be honest it has made me very interested in the franchise. The characters are so goddamn unique with everyone feeling different with one another, they are definitely quirky but not to the point where it feels forced or cringe. I have not played many hack and slash games but my god is this one my favorite, the amount of customization in the way that you can play each character (besides one of them) is insane Nero has his many different types of arms with different types of mechanics and then there's Dante with his four different modes he can change mid battle and a bunch of different **** up weapons that make no sense but are just so cool. I have no clue what I'm doing but it looks awesome and I love it.. I played and felt, it's still not as good as part 3 but good enough to become one of the best games of the Series.. One of the best games in the series, truly a great experience, I am very satisfied with this product from Capcom, this will be the first brick to bring this brand back to its original position. Really looking forward to the next game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great return for the franchise! Most fun and accessible combat system in the entire saga, insane soundtrack, graphics and art are at their peak! Does the game have defects? Yes, but the results are so good that I ignore them completely!. Devil May Cry 5?!? That's the fifth one! I've played too many of these, I don't want to play anymore. Devil may cry 5 is an probably the best hack and slash game that I have ever played. Gameplay is amazing, story is awesome, everything about the game is good. The only problem with it is that it's too short.. The developers were unable to improve even after many years. Along with the consequential implementation of some pupulating in-game elements that catered to marketing expert-managers' demands, it became a foolish opportunity for the DMC5 developers to create the worst Devil May Cry game. As a result, it unfortunately delivers empty areas without objects, architecture, platform or environmental gameplay. This allows the dumb AI enemies to remain dumb, as they won't get stuck anywhere or cause any game freezes, also the worst idea and dumbest thing: the auto-combo mode wich shouldn't exist in an game, can be used in an empty and dumb content. The only redeeming factor are some boss battles, of those found in previous DMC games. If you would like to give a try DMC4 special offers much better and more varied content, in high performance 60FPS. Or try the much better, smarter and harder challanging combats, great gameplay, strong artdesign and performance ""Metal Gear Rising"". this game is phenomenal! no other words! My favourite was always the 4th, from the trailer I Was expecting it could be not so good. I recently experienced Devil May Cry 5 on my Xbox Series S, and true to form, Capcom lived up to expectations. Having previously played Dragon's Dogma, Resident Evil, and Monster Hunter Rise, I've consistently found Capcom's games to be impressive. Devil May Cry 5, despite not being a lengthy 100-hour game, captivated me for about 12 to 15 hours. Within this relatively short duration, players assume the roles of three distinct characters—Dante, Nero, and V—each wielding unique powers, strengths, and weapon combinations. It's been months since I dedicated time to completing a game, and Devil May Cry 5 earned a perfect 10/10 from me for its exceptional gameplay, compelling story, stunning visuals, and seamless performance on the Xbox Series S.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The combo system is great. Some of the characters are clearly more fun to use than others (Dante is super freeform meanwhile V is kinda boring). Most boss fights are really enjoyable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Devil May Cry 5 is a bewildering masterpiece. From the inception of this incredible game series we've had ups and downs but here stands the peak that all future hack and slash games should aspire to. The game has an intricate, yet simple combat system made to be infinitely repeatable in terms of success. All characters are human, despite demonic nature, having flaws and failings that seem so basic, yet ignored by the large majority of games nowadays. They interact like friends, rather than robots. We cannot deny it has issues, such as the rather annoying character V, a gameplay that is less hands on than Dante, Nero or Vergil, which can lead to a player not being as invested. However, this is made up with V's boss battles being absolutely exhilarating with his limitations. Overall, every character is fun,every battle is engaging and - other than V and some side characters being underutilised in the story -the story is simple and fun, with a true heartfelt message buried deep within. It is a must play game.. Actually pretty fun and very fleshed out combat mechanics, just gets extremely repetitive, coupled with the fact that there is basically no story. It's funny though, so if you're into hack and slash bayonetta-type of games, this is even better.. Forgot V’s gameplay and this game is a **** gameplay,mechanics,graphics character design,bosses everything is done right for this game. Game gets boring at some points of time, otherwise pretty good combat system, good cutscenes.. Nah dont really dig this game at all i dont like the mechanics or the stupid style configuration if this game had ninja theorys DMC: devil may cry control configurations i would yell high praise for this game but nope its garbage mechanics piss me off more than make me enjoy this garbage game and the graphics are garbage to RE engine is garbage looking just like the rest of there RE engine games. Absolute masterpiece and the best game in the series hands down, 3 is also very good but 5 is perfection. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 88 IIIIIIIIII====================. Good if not a bit repetitive. As time has gone on I’ve grown a bit cold on this series. Fun and cool aesthetic, but over the top and cheesy and not always in the best way.. This wasn't nearly as fun as it should have been. DMC5 felt like a chore to play, and I had no desire to complete it on higher difficulty levels, which is one of my favorite parts about the series. DMC is one of the few franchises to get difficulty settings right. The core problem is that the combat is poorly designed, overcomplicated, and very sloppy. When I think back to the original Devil May Cry, and how simple the combat controls were, and how the fights were elegant dances fighting a few enemies at a time, I don't understand how that PS2 game could be so much superior to this one. Let's starting with targeting. You have to hold down a button to target an enemy, which is terrible design. Switching targets is also wonky, and it seems that your character has to be perfectly still to do it. This is among the worst targeting systems I've ever seen, and for a fast-paced action game fighting 4-5 enemies at once, it kills the gameplay. The end result is that I ended up spamming attacks against waves of poorly visible enemies. It didn't feel tactical or fun. DMC5 has ridiculously complicated controls for an action game. There are 3 different characters that you switch around, who each have very different move-sets. Dante for example has 4 different stances, 5 different weapons, different attacks depending on subtle directional and positioning cues. It just ends up being annoying, and reminds me of the problems with Doom Eternal. These are action games. They should have 1 button to attack. They're not that deep. DMC also has a wide variety of special moves for each weapon, character, stance if you've unlocked them, which are like Street Fighter combos. I hate controller combos, and they're the last thing I want to try to pull off while juggling many threats at once. Some commands also have the same combo. I can't count the number of times I jumped on my golem, when I didn't want to. The resulting game is chaotic mess that was so annoying that I stopped caring after a while. The story also has a lot of cringe in the form of family drama and emotional outbursts like some crappy anime. This is Devil May Cry. What is going on here?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Started the game with the combo set to auto. Tutorial level. First wall jump and the guy couldn't even get on the platform. Seriously Capcom?. The game starts off as incredible but halfway devolves into some weird cringe anime show. Doesn't feel like they pulled it off, and they got confused with the development halfway. Great gameplay, style and graphics though. Also Nico is a babe.. After and HD port of the original trilogy and a stupid Emo freaking Dante, Capcom FINALLY brought this series back from the dead. Not only was Dante done right but Nero got what he deserved in the sense of a much more likeable character.. Played od Series X. Better than DmC but still boring locations and too much of underworld.. Not sure how I missed this game and overlooked it for so long. First game in the franchise I played, and 0 disappointment. Aside from the cutting-edge gameplay, lovable characters, and awesome villains, the graphics beat that of even Rocket League, GTA, and other massive titles on the XBOX One. Amazing game.. Holy crap this is one of the best action games I’ve ever played. Even with having little knowledge of DMC before playing 5, I didn’t feel that lost. It definitely feels like it’s own stand alone story & I appreciate that as a newcomer! The visuals are some of the best I’ve ever seen, Capcom & the RE Engine have been getting back to back W’s lately and I love it. Probably my favorite engine out rn. The slick stylish combat is addictive & it’s appropriately over the top! I definitely have to play the rest of the series at some point. Also the soundtrack is full of bangers & makes the moment to moment gameplay all the more better. Dante, Nero & V are all incredibly fun to play as & they all play differently. Literally cannot recommend this game enough. Also Nero could get it.. Thankfully, the Xbox One version of DMC 5 performs better than Resident Evil 7 ever did. Of course, it's still inferior to the PS4 edition due to a lower resolution and less stable frame rate. The game is terrific fun bogged down with the occasional loading screen. Any fan of the previous titles will have a blast. With this fifth main installment, players get to control three characters; Nero, Dante and new hero V. Each have their own fighting style. The game includes 20 missions, 12 hidden bonus challenges and 6 difficulty levels. Also, the Bloody Tower was added as free DLC. Overall, this is another great addition to the series. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10. This game place at top 5 best games I played in this console generation. Gameplay is so amazing. I'm not a fan of metal music but I loved dmcV musics.. This game is absolutely badass. I really only have 2 complaints with the game. Using rb to lock on to enemies is fine, but switching targets seemed to be a big issue all game. Combos are difficult and must be timed perfectly, and sometimes just fail to work. However switching between 3 characters and remembering the best combos was my only other problem. Nero and Dante are fairly easy to play, and have kickass moves and weapons you can upgrade. V is much more difficult since you have to controls 3 followers, and make sure he doesn't get hit. Also he is boring as hell to play as. IDK why I started talking about the things I didn't like because I beat this game in 3 days it was so addicting. If you are a fan of hack n slash games, with cool combos, and weapon upgrades this game is for you. Story is ok, and has a cool ending. Graphics are some of the best I've seen on the current generation of console.. Awesome action and graphics, with a really cool entry at the beginning for newcomers to the series, wish more games would do this. Really worth playing if you like dmc and even if you haven't played any of the previous entries.. Devil May Cry 5 controls excellently, looks amazing, and is the best in the series since Devil May Cry 3. Devil may cry 5 is one of the best action games of the year. Due to its frenetism is really addictive and what is more important: FUN; which is the main reason to play videogames. In addition the graphics are great (one of the best of this generation) and the soundtrack fits really well with the gameplay, so you'll soon get hooked on this game. The story unfolds in a good way along stunningly designed levels; It's a pity that we couldn't explore them more deeply. Dante and Nero are awesome characters; very charismatics and with an enough variety of combos to perform. However, the new character V, has one of the most boring gameplay i've ever seen in a Hack and slash game... You feel like you don't have the control on him. Despite this, he plays an important role in the story. Devil may cry 5 might be a great and one of the most addictive action games of the genre. But i really miss much more content.... The main story is kinda short and there are not more gamemodes... So if you want to keep playing you are forced to play the campaing over and over again; what can turn into boring in the long run.. DEVIL MAY CRY 5 is my favourite action game of all time. the combat introduce a new character who has a neat fighting style. the ending to the series is phenomenal.. Devil May Cry V an enjoyable game overall. Graphically outstanding, narratively confusing, character dynamic is decent, enemy variety great, music varies to okay to great, overall gameplay is good. Certainly worth playing if you into these type of games.. DMC is back! King is Back!lll Thank you very much! Everyone who was involved in the creation of this masterpiece, namely Hideaki Itsuno and his team, as well as who created this series, namely Hideki Kamiya and Shinji Mikami with the Little Devil team !! I love you, Dante and Devil May Cry !!!. I enjoyed the HELL out of this game. I just wish the characters had faster progression, and more depth to the story!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. PERFECT, the best hack and slash from this gen. So nice grapychs (the facial expressions are impresive), ost and history. But my only complain, is because is too short in compare to the DMC 4, and the gold gems subtracts a lot of difficulty from the game in special in the final bosses.. Its clear from reading some reviews on this site there is a few moron that could never figure out that you can do more than press buttons. These types of idiots should be ignored as they set all their games to easy then cry because they cant find the depth.. DMC 5 is a true return to form for the franchise and is not only one of the best DMC games but also one of the best games of the year..With a bunch of new characters moves and abilities you travel through the world raising hell and looking cool doing it. Its core Hack and slash, where the challenge is in getting those beastly score and doing the sickest moves in the game... Better than bayonetta 2 in everything less combos. i played thks to Game pass. Devil May Cry 5 offers to every action games player out there, 3 different play-styles to help keeping the gameplay as dynamic as it can be. The pacing of the game is pretty on point. Graphics are just out of this world, one of the best looking games i've ever played. Soundtrack is good too, not great... But definitely a strong point of the game. Overall, is great game for anyone that is looking to have some fun and just defeat some demons.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Devil May Cry 5 is the ultimate comeback of the series, been one of the most fun games that I have ever played, with simple and fun controls, beatifull scenarios and a stunnishing soundtrack Devil May Cry is the most refined hack and slash game of this **** narrative is... Ok, it stands on it`s purpouse of being something to complement the game with some nice turns and very charisnathic **** thing that I didn`t apreciate too much was the secret mission, because some of then involves doing stuff that cut of the pace of the game, like doing a kind of parkour with V, (that really **** even finding this missions ****, i leave behind about 3 of then because I really just wanted to get back to the action. Abou the characters, V is weird to play and it is the less fun of then, mostly because you need to stay to far from the action, Nero is kind of the protagonist, he is the most hard character to play with, because you need to learn the right timing to use the devil breakers, which are very creative and unique and, Dante,that has a goddam motorcycle.. Pleasant. No brainer. Played but won t remember much. Same environment all game along. Devil May Cry 5 is one of those games that feels great to play, though at times can get a bit repetitive and redundant compared to its predecessors. After putting in around 15 or so hours within the game, I have to admit that I felt I enjoyed DMC5 a lot more that the last few installments of the series. The game shines at its peak with the writing and some of the astonishingly absurd moments. This is where I found the most enjoyment out of DMC5, with certain moments as Dante being the biggest highlights of the game (his personality alone made the game worth playing through out of the ridiculous things that he says and the ways he goes about doing everything with a way over the top tone). Being able to go through the game switching between 3 characters (with certain points allowing you to choose who you want to play as) was something that I found to be particularly interesting. Each character feels very unique, I felt Capcom did a good job creating different styles of play for each, though I felt playing as Dante was definitely the most enjoyable between the three. It did create a form of replay value just to see certain differences within the missions, but overall not really much else changes - it's just the way that you get to the end point. So with that, I feel Devil May Cry 5 was a good installment in the series. I think Nero's development made him a more likable character than he was in DMC4, however, I still feel that the game is at its best with Dante at the helm just for his ridiculous and witty personality. It's nice to see the series return on another high note. I definitely feel that I can recommend this one on story alone.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. In this review, only the negative aspects of the game are considered. The purpose of this work is to help you to get a better decision on the purchase of the game My Rating: 9 of 10 Weak points : - The angle of the camera that showed the character and environment is not acceptable in the game. I've never played a game with such an amazing combat system. It's easy to start, but you're always craving making those sweet SSS combos, and the game rewards you for it. My only complaint would be that the developers spoiled all the weapons before the release. Still, an amazing game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing and very fun game with a lot of replay value! Now this is the Devil May Cry games all true fans and all true gamers wanted and deserve! The graphics and animations are excellent, the gameplay is extremely good with a lot of variety, Dante, Nero and V all have different and refreshing play styles! You really can't go wrong with this game if you are a fan of action oriented games! BUY IT!. I love it! Graphics are awesome. I had so much fun playing it. The story is not hard to follow and combos are not difficult. I loved the 3 character story, it makes the game more engaging.. The cinematic are great, graphics are great, the Game Play is great, I love the story even the surprise that Shoji Kawamori was apart of the project and help design the Devil **** problem that I had was the loading times were kind of boring, camera angles are still a issue other then that the game was fun and entertaining like it was meant to be consider Devil May Cry Series was always known for its humor and action it manage to pull it off.. Noticeably juvenile, rather than just quarky, slightly boring gameplay, progression, and level design, cut up by way too much time in cutscenes and menu's, all together not bad and good graphics, but somewhat disappointing.. After a long wait Devil May Cry is back! If you are a fan of Action games, it doesn't get better than Devil May Cry 5. The game has superb game play, full of cool combos to learn and skills to master. This game is meant to be replayed multiple times, by the end of your third play through you will feel like the Legendary Devil Hunter himself. The two starting difficulties are easy and don't take much skill, but by the time you start your first Son of Sparda play through, you will realize this game has some balls. The games story is very enjoyable, although if you have not played the previous games (excluding DmC: Devil May Cry) you might find the story confusing. The game has some small flaws, like Bloody Palace not being released day 1 with the game, but it is coming soon so LETS GET THIS PARTY STARTED! Jackpot.. I'm torn about this game. I enjoyed it more than any beat em up I've played since Bayonetta 2 and its combat system is an absolute joy. Dante in particular is masterful - it's him at his most absurdly adaptable and powerful. He's the Swiss-army-knife of gaming fighters, capable of fistfighting, kickboxing, swordfighting, bo-staffing, nunchukking and...smashing people up with half a razor-sharp motorbike in each hand(don't bother quibbling with the logic). There are also his long-range attacks: pistols, shotgun...a dual-wielded rocket launcher(!)...there's even a weirdly camp cowboy hat/cape combo that allows you to sort of...'jazz-hands' your enemies to death. Those are all the weapons I found on my first playthrough but there are probably more. Imagine that. And then imagine being able to switch between four different fighting styles based around gunplay, fast dodges, swordplay and blocking/parrying enemy attacks...does that sound insanely intricate yet? Okay, now bear in mind that Dante is only one of _three_ characters you'll play as. Neither of the other two are quite as complex or open-ended as Dante, but they all have their own idiosyncracies and different movesets. And then, on top of _all of that,_ there are upgrades available for everyone. It's slightly mindboggling. Now one of those characters is, in my opinion, a write-off. V, the equivalent of a magic build in Dark Souls, is just not that much fun to play as. You feel little connection when you land a blow because it's all done by your proxies in battle, a trio of magical animals/monsters who do your fighting for you. I'm not going to go into him any further as he's just not worth writing about and thankfully he doesn't take up too much of the playtime. Later on you can choose to play as one of the other two(and you will) anyway. The other character is Nero, and much of the complexity and variety in his moveset comes from the huge range of Devil Arms he has; they are artificial mechanical prosthetics that he can switch out, each of which has a unique set of attacks and special moves. He's only marginally less liberating to play as than Dante. His moveset is smaller, but not by that much, and he, just like Dante, is a glorious, swift, efficient wonder of a character to control. I really can't praise the combat enough - if there is a flaw it's in the lack of humanoid enemies, as fighting giant beasts doesn't give you as much satisfaction as fighting something human that you can relate to. This was the case in Bayonetta 2 also, as well as in the God Of War reboot: the highlights of both those games were battles against other human characters, respectively Balder and The Stranger. There's nothing like a one-on-one against a humanoid enemy to get the blood pumping. The final boss in DMC 5 is an absolutely sublime battle for the same reason. So I finished the game having enjoyed pretty much every single second of it, and knowing that I had not even begun to scratch the surface of either Nero's or Dante's(particularly) full combat abilities. And there's the rub: the credits began to roll at what I'd assumed was about the halfway point. Perhaps I was expecting more than I should have been but when it happened I was absolutely gutted and really surprised. I felt that there should have been at least another seven or eight hours' worth of campaign left to play, and it's that that really remains the only major issue I have with the game: I wanted more, so much more, especially after the long wait since the last canon Devil May Cry game. This is undoubtedly the most sophisticated and sublime combat system DMC has come up with: it shines, it glistens, it's been honed to perfection. It may well be the single greatest combat system ever developed for any beat-'em-up, and I'm a huge fan of the genre. Ninja Gaiden, Bayonetta, the first God Of War; these were all seminal games for me. Visually the game really is gorgeous; after a rather dull, slightly ugly start where you slog through a few too many dreary trainyards, the game's levels begin to flex their muscles and you see some gorgeous if rather generic fantasy environments. They're rarely more than simple arenas in which to beat up enemies, but sometimes you stop and linger on their graphical beauty nevertheless. And the character detail on the avatars...truly superb. The 60ps framerate makes the whole thing even more enjoyable, and just watching Dante respond to your every input within a nanosecond of pressing the button has a certain charm to it. It's just _cool._ Rockstar and the RDR2 team could really learn something about how much difference a _responsive_ avatar makes to gameplay. It's crucial. So I leave you with this: this is a total blast of a beat-em-up, honed to perfection over the five entries, and it offers the most open-ended combat in any game. Ever. If you can bear in mind that it's over way too soon you will love every second.. It's incredible. I could nitpick it, but I won't. Please buy this game so we can have more Devil May Cry.. very fun game never played any DMC games but i loved this i would recommend to everyone. Devil May Cry 5, unlike 1 and 3, made me pick it up and put it down so many times throughout my first playthrough for just how boring it became after every 3 missions. After finishing the game on the highest difficulty avaliable at that time I didn't feel like trying the higher difficulty for just how tired I was from playing this game. Despite the Devil Hunter mode meant for veteran players of the series, it's still the easiest game in the series. Though I don't mind low difficulty as long as it's still fun, this game is so easy I can just mash tringle to beat the game, even on boss fights. **** made me look at the other TV screen to see a movie while hitting the tringle button mindlessly and still defeating all the enemies without noticing than I know something is very wrong. It didn't happen to me with DMC1 and 3. The large variety of abilities can be bought by red orbs only make the game more of a button masher than it was without them, unlike in DMC1 and 3 where I had to be a little more patient with movement (I mean I could still button mash but not as much as here). The secret missions can be found within missions are helping a bit, making this game a 5 out of 10 for me, but overall DMC5 feels like a handheld game brought to consoles (a game you play only for short moments to not burn yourself up).. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is visually appealing, has cool characters and is fun to play. But do know that this is a hack and slash game, don’t worry, it won’t kill your hands. The button smashing is absolutely reasonable and the background rock music is very nice, kind of feels like your own private party. The negatives: - ENG voice is out of sync - Environments feel sometimes empty If you like cool, sexi and funny characters, lot of action, this one is for you.. DMCV ignores the (unfairly IMO) maligned 2013 reboot in favour of a return to the original continuity. Sadly the game also seems to have thrown out level variety, character development, and puzzle solving. To me it felt like a step backwards, ignoring the many improvements the reboot made to the combat system in favour of an over-complicated trio of control set-ups mapped to the game’s three characters. For the most part these characters play like their DMC4 iterations, with some changes; Nero’s Devil arm has been replaced by a string of mechanical hands that break constantly throughout the game forcing you to spend in game currency to keep using your favourites or keep having your right hand change its function throughout.. not that you'd notice as the arms are all pretty much interchangeable. Dante now has 2 different types of devil trigger added to an ever expanding arsenal of weapons that require you to switch between them and a set of 4 fighting styles that effectively alter the function of the B button. This makes his control scheme the most cluttered and complicated. Despite having played DMC games before it felt unintuitive and many was the time I wanted to pull off a killer sword attack only to find that I'd switched to gunslinger mode or trickster... or wanted to pull **** covering trickster move and instead pulled off a flashy sword move that was far out of range of my intended target. A truly skilled or dedicated player wouldn't let that stand in their way… but for the casual gamer playing for the story (which I'll get to later) then it generally descends into random button mashing that doesn't feel rewarding or fun. Likewise despite constantly being under attack from numerous enemies the game more or less forces you into taking enemies on one by one... switching between targets is unintuitive (mapped to the thumbstick buttons) and having to strafe and dodge attacks often prevents you from performing the combo you just unlocked to finish the fights quicker. The third control-scheme comes in the form of new character V... a ""mysterious"" individual with unknown motives. This is perhaps my biggest bugbear with this game... V ought to have been an interesting player character that drives the story forward... instead he's a forced control scheme that isn't that fun","""devil may cry 5"" is the best game of the franchise (with ""devil may cry 3"" a close second) the story is great and very entertaining, the graphics are somewhat insane, the characters are great, the music is really good, and the bosses are chaotic ."
67.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"Awesome game! I remember when I played the 2007 version on PC and now the remastered version on Xbox Series X works perfectly, very good graphics, an adventure that you will always remember. A legendary game!. I'm playing all the Call of Duty games in order, and this one is a HUGE step up from previous entries. Instead of similar, linear-feeling missions, this game plays out almost more like an action movie. However, there are some frustrating gripes I have with this game and I know that I'll enjoy many more games later in the series than this one. Overall a damn solid game though.. A true action masterpiece that was arguably the best game of 2007. Developer Infinity Ward not only topped their previous efforts (Call of Duty 1 and 2), but crafted the definitive FPS of the Xbox 360 era. Like ""Grand Theft Auto III"", it was a revolutionary title that influenced many shooters. The amazing set pieces still hold up quite well. Along with the masterful story mode, the addictive multiplayer is what set the benchmark .for online shooters. Great graphics, great story, great action. This is a great game that ranks up with ""Bioshock"", ""Metal Gear Solid 4"" and ""God of War"". I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. Modern Warfare not only changed shooter, but gaming in general. It caused multiple studios to chase MW's success. The campaign is secured in a level of believability before Call of Duty leaned fully into ""Michael Bay"" action. To add to its great campaign, Modern Warfare changed the face of multiplayer with its highly addictive gameplay loop and create a class.. It's the same old same, shoot and shoot some more. It really does blow me away why people even like this because it's kinda boring.. Incredibly immersive for its time. Ground-breaking and joyful approaches to fundamental FPS mechanics. Child hood classic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. it was goated back in 2007 but now its nowhere near as good as MW2 BO1 BO2. this rating is objective aka factual. Revolutionized the military first-person shooter. The campaign is a taut thrill ride with excellent shock-value and memorable characters and moments. Not a single mission is wasted. It's challenging without being excluding. The multiplayer is refreshing to return to even to this day, a no-frills experience with great maps, including Shipment, one of the best roller coaster rides in all of multiplayer shooting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a real gem for its time, a very cool story and lots of action!I miss that time!. good game 10/10, the ending was also epic, it gave a perfect closure to the saga, if cod 4 was a good game, mw2 improves it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game that defined modern shooters. Great for its time and aged well. Modern Warfare 2 blows this out of the park but Modern Warfare is a great game to try too.. Absolutely amazing campaign with clean and smooth gameplay, fast paced action, and an excellent cast of characters! Easily a 10 out of 10 must-play game!. Very good campaign and good multiplayer mode, its not the best cod like everyone says, but it is one of the best.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is the peak of xbox360 and ps3 era evrything on this game is perfect. Just beat the Game, i really enjoyed the campaign, and the texture of this game are so so so realistic for 2007. Im impressed.. This game's campaign is really good. I haven't played around with multiplayer yet. But I hope it goes well. Good game.. Cool. só isso. Cool. One thing want to tell that the games is my awesome games I played. Absolute Masterpiece! I have never felt so immersed in a game before 10/10.. price soap friendship. This game is pretty good, with a really cool story, I really enjoyed Captain Price as always, and the multiplayer in this game paved way for what would become some of the best line up of games ever made. The customization of weapons in this game was phenomenal. The only issue I have is that it felt like the campaign was short, even though it was really incredible.. I played this game during a couple of very stressfull years of my life, when it was released. If i completed the main story mode, i dont even remember. But the on-line mode... i was addicted. I know most of the maps by heart to this day.. the story is great, multiplayer isn't the best with customization but you still shoot and kill people and its a fun experience!. The story is compelling, shooting is great and i love the stealth sections. On the shorter side but still so good.. ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" is a masterpiece. This is one of the greatest video games of all time. The first COD entry set in modern times, it was developed by series creator Infinity Ward. When MW was first revealed to the public, I immediately thought of Tom Clancy's ""Rainbow Six"" titles. Indeed, the game has a very Clancy-esque feel due to a realistic scenario. It doesn't feature the Jerry Bruckheimer-like bombast of the sequel. The campaign is flawless and the online multiplayer is in the tradition of ""Counter Strike"". Over ten years old, ""Call of Duty 4"" is still a fantastic game. I would give it a 9.4 out of 10.. An amazing multiplayer experience! The sineplayer story is excellent! At the release of this game I couldn't ask for more!. The first big milestone in the COD series and what a game ! This is a true classic !. One of the best games of all time and the game that popularised cinematic storytelling. A timeless classic.. One of the best FPS games ever made and some of the best times I've ever had with online multiplayer.. Masterpiece. Incredible campaign. Fun multiplayer, let alone the fact it revolutionized First person shooters. Great game with a good story, great characters, fun unique levels, and awesome unique gameplay. Great take on the combat of the modern world and its politics.. This game is alright. I finished the campaign and loved it but compared to modern Call of Duty games, it's not that great. I unfortunately missed out of playing multiplayer back when it was popular. One thing I don't like too much was the graphics. It was too grainy for me, I could barley see anything.. A complete and total revolution in FPS was brought about by this masterpiece and Halo 2. Still to this day probably some of the best co-op and multiplayer shooters ever made!. Definitely the most iconic and impactful in the series and one of the best FPS games of all time.. This game was revolutionary for the genre. Surprisingly fun shooting mechanics, and great atmosphere The story is very memorable and it has some very iconic missions. The multiplayer is very enjoyable, with great maps and guns. Overall it's my favorite game in the series, this game has everything a Call of Duty game needs, it's the whole package. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. Awesome game with a great storyline and interesting characters. The best FPS. A Revolutionary First Person Shooter with some groundbreaking missions, surprisingly fun shooting mechanics, great atmosphere and very enjoyable Multiplayer experience with iconic maps & guns.. COD 4 isn't just a legendary COD game, it's just a legendary video game in general. COD 4's campaign is one of the most memorable and replay-able campaigns of the franchise with very iconic characters like Captain Price, Gaz, Sgt. Griggs, Captain McMillian, & Zakhaev. Not to mention, this was the first modern military COD game. The COD 4 multiplayer changed the FPS community forever by adding custom classes, kill-streaks, perks, gun camos, and lots of game modes like Team Deathmatch, Free-for-all, Domination, Sabotage, Headquarters, & Search & Destroy. Just because of the Campaign & the innovations in Multiplayer, COD 4 is just a perfect game all around!. This is where COD really took off and became globally known as it is today.. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 8/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 8/10. The call of duty games that make it a franchise and all time classic. Still one of the best call of duty games in the franchise and it still holds of because it have some good pacing , because it's not action all the time it et hav som quiet moment to make the action point, and it still looks good today. This game is simply one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. It has a classic campaign, and a very chaotic multiplayer. Just breathtaking.. I remember playing the excellent campaign. Soap and Price were my favorites.. Comparing this to other call of duty games like MW2, MW3, BO1, BO2, I really don't think this holds up compared to them. I have personally never felt the urge to go back and play this game, unlike others in the franchise. That aside, it is absolutely a good game, just not quite as good as some of the others.. I think it is the best call of duty game I don't have to say anything else.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game was my first time playing Call of Duty and it was so good. Very few Call of Duty games have managed to top this one in quality for campaign or multiplayer. The story here is great albeit a little short. Price & Soap are the best and every mission in the campaign was awesome. The multiplayer is also great, including the maps and weapons available. This game is a must-play.. Definitely one of the best first-person shooter games and the best trilogy ever. All three games are a must-play for a complete experience.. The game in the series that would change it forever. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the game that got me into Call of Duty. I wish they could just make Call of Duty's like this again.. One of the best linear FPS campaigns of all time. A must play on any console.. Play Call of Duty 4 on your Xbox360 and realize it 's better than the Remastered Xbox One version. Not because remaster is bad, but because nostalgia. Well, how could that really come out in 2007? It 's just a brain explosion from gameplay and hurricane action. How funny after that to look at the series as a whole, which couldn 't do anything better. Well except MW2 everything just multiplied everything by 2 times (but no longer so spectacular) and dilogia Black Ops (creating a normal plot). Well even after 13 years in MW it is pleasant to play, here still mechanics as in modern shooter blockbuster. How funny after that to look at the restart of MW 2019, which is worse in everything.... Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GOOD. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GOOD Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. Pretty good game! The only flaws are the explosive spam , the overpowered M16 and the game compared to more recent entries and even other classics like Modern Warfare 2 (it's sequel) , is too simple in terms of killstreaks. However, you have the 3-5-7 killstreaks with a fun killstreak system as well, the maps are amazing and in the original, running and gunning is very much done unlike it's remaster where camping is done 24/7. The game is a solid 8/10 as of modern day standards.. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a first best ever directed action game! I so love it! Amazing game!. A Modern Warfare classic that ignited the Modern Warfare franchise that's known for.. bad plot, Russians, as always, bad normal graphics, crappy online great soundtrack. A great game to start with the genre, A good story, great graphics, very recommended. :). One of the last good Call of duty games made. The campaign had a great storyline and was fun to play through although it unfortunately didn't have local co-op unlike Halo games of the time. The multiplayer is the best aside from mw2.. A revolutionary masterpiece, Call of Duty 4 brings the best multiplayer since Halo 3. Boasting a great albeit short single player and a magnificent multiplayer, CoD4 serves as the most revolutionary console FPS since Halo: Combat Evolved and Goldeneye 007.. COD 4 is one of the best first person shooters of all time. The brilliance of the modern setting married with a captivating story and multiplayer still is being talked about today. The game has proven to be a landmark with shooters to the point of why such a saturation of them has been so endless in the last decade. The gunplay is still snap quick and awesome, with an interesting design choice of missions and a multiplayer system that made squad tactics and communication an absolute must. The only downsides to the game is a few perks in multiplayer were far more potent than others and parts of the campaign did feel silly at times. Regardless, Call of Duty 4 is still a king of shooters in the eyes of many of its fans and I cannot deny such a force that helped put its franchise on the map.. Cod is trash now but back then... It wasn't so bad lol. It's still and always has been a twitch shooter with not very much skill though... A campers dream. The story is terrible like MW2 and 3 and there isn't much to it compared to halo 3. This is a game you play for a few days... Maybe a few weeks or months if you're a dude bro. Any longer than that and you're a total moron who doesn't know what a real shooter is like half life or perfect dark 64. This on is the best of the cods pretty much and like I said... Even then... This franchise kind of **** back then and now it seriously **** now. The newer cods deserve scores around 3/10 lol.. For a 1st person shooter game i think it would be hard to find another title will be bigger than cod mw, like the graphic and the sound, simple outstanding!. This game loosened my grip on Halo as my go-to FPS. CoD4 has one of the greatest campaign modes ever for an FPS and boasted a streamlined multiplayer experience that encouraged constant player engagement and some customization. While the series would expand with a great sequel, CoD4 is regarded as one of the most important games of the 2000-2009 decade and is still talked about with great fondness to this day. So much so that Infinity Wars, creators of CoD4, are remastering it with a special release of Infinite Warfare in 2016. For me, Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 hold some of my most memorable moments in campaign and multiplayer. If you haven't played them and you're a shooter fan, you owe it to yourself to give the Modern Warfare series a play-through... This game follows the trail left by Allied Assault while successfully bringing the formula to the next level.This is a masterclass in single player campaign pacing and scenario. Expert and respectful checkpoint placement means that you will never redo a section previously beaten twice. Playing on hard is highly recommended as the various mechanics and level design will be more thoroughly experienced. The shooting is both varied and weighty. The levels are designed in such a way as to hint the player towards multiple possible tactical approaches ; Choosing to storm the inside of a building is as challenging as it should and might reward you with a unique vantage point. The various set pieces are seamlessly integrated and never feel odd or disconnected from the main mechanics. The voice acting is great and the minimalist story telling keeps the scenario engaging and fairly credible. That said, the game is clearly part of a sophisticated war propaganda machine and is likely indirectly responsible for the death of many young testosterone filled adolescents in need of adventure ; I believe this will be rightly regarded as a historical piece of Zionist propaganda down the line. The main villain's name is even named after the current president of Syria, whom the Zionists are currently trying to actively murder ; Russian patriots are also antagonized. The visuals, animations and lighting hold surprisingly well, and thoroughly immerse . Modern warfare is not only a good shooter, it is simply one of the best FPS experience of all time and deserves to be celebrated as such.. Though the franchise as a whole may have outstayed its welcome due to it being a money-making machine, there's no escaping the fact that Call of Duty 4 is exceptional in every aspect that it attempts to target. Single-player is by no means a drag, and provides memorable characters that you will care about in the line of duty, as well as some jaw-dropping sequences. The real highlight here however, is the multiplayer. Creating your own classes to suit your style of play, or to suit the map you're going to be playing on if you've planned that far ahead, Modern Warfare will provide you with endless hours of entertainment and fantastic first-person shooting mechanics that is only rivalled by Halo 3. An absolute blast whether you are playing solo or with friends, and a true legend within the multiplayer gaming world.. Call of Duty Modern Warfare Gameplay is great, story is okay, new fresh idea Great levels and fast past action. Check it out, its a pretty dam good game. **** major ass, Like when I get promoted to major some lowlife mouthbreather starts **** on my ass. It's awful, the other team gets too many touchdowns and we can never even make it to the world series. It's not my fault that Donald Trump is the best player or that our team keeps luesing. This game was revolutionary. The first person genre would not be the same without this game. The addition of the perk system is groundbreaking. On top of great multiplayer, the campaign was 2nd to none. While not my favorite CoD game, definetly one of my favorites. Campaign is excellent, with a very cool storyline that is CANON (cough cough BO 1 and 2 cough cough) and the only downside is that it´s not very long. (4-7 hrs. long) However, multiplayer is where the game shines! It´s extremely addictive and very enjoyable, maps are great, a variety of weapons, and overall fun. Downsides are that there are too many host migrations and that hosts can do whatever they want. Also, the game is filled with hackers, especially the PS3 version. But in the end, Cod 4- Modern Warfare is one of Infinity Ward´s greatest masterpieces ever! I highly recommend it if you´re starting out CoD or if you haven´t played it yet and are disappointed int he newer CoDs.. This game is a classic. a must-own. The multiplayer is brilliant and addictive. The singleplayer has the best story and most memorable missions in a Call of Duty game. The only reason i'm giving this a 9 is because it may be a little bit outdated from the other Call of duty multiplayers nowadays. But at it's release in 2007 everyone would've have given it a 10. It's still a masterpiece in many others opinion including mine.. split screen or single player are both fun even if i get beet by someone who is new at this i mean really it is surprising that a new person like that can beet you at your own game that you been playing longer than her. It was the start of one of the best series of games ever. COD: 1, 2, and 3 were the first games in the series although this game was the first that got people to buy the game. If you didn't ever own it but thought about buying it you probably should of bought it. Then once people heard about MW2 and people bought thought it was the start of one the best game series ever.. Astounding at the time, yet it still holds up in the present as a game of pedigree. Call of Duty 4 was revolutionary when released. The story was gripping but it was the time **** online multiplayer that stole our hearts. If the online servers were still policed today it may still have offered the best multiplayer experience.. I played this quite a lot back in it's heyday. Singleplayer never held my interest but the multiplayer obviously started a COD chain reaction that may never die. They have made many improvements but also missteps since COD4. I will give this an 8/10 it will always be a classic.. The CoD game that launched the franchise into the stratosphere. The campaign was incredible - better than some summer blockbusters. What else can be said about the multiplayer? This was lightning in a bottle, and has been the standard by which we judge all future CoD games. CoD4 was the best game of the Xbox 360/PS3/Wii generation, and I will cherish the memories I have and the friends I made playing that game. It is the gold standard, and it is missed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Literally the best FPS I've ever played, nostalgia goggles on or off. It's a shame it's not supported for online. Would love to see a redux version for next gen consoles. Call of Duty 4 is an excellent shooter with a memorable story and a multiplayer that has an incredible replay value. CoD 4 was the first game I've played in the series back in 2010 and I've been playing CoD ever **** story is great along with awesome and in depth characters. Today, most CoD players don't even play the game for its story. But, I highly recommend playing CoD 4 's campaign as it's unforgettable experience coming from a first person shooter. As for the multiplayer, it's addicting as any other CoD except this CoD will more simpler in terms of perks, kill streaks, etc. But it still has the CoD formula that we all love to play. S , I give this game a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it to any COD or fps players.. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is one of my most favourite shooters. This is the first Call of Duty to depart from the World War II era and now takes place in ""Modern Warfare."" The campaign is very fun with exhilarating missions, the story is compelling, the characters have great personalities, and the environment is excellent. And then the multiplayer is absolutely amazing. I've spent so many hours just on the online part. The leveling system works really well, the maps are all fantastic, and the game modes are really fun to play. Call of Duty 4 is a must play shooter and it's a must play.. best game ever made on console. its truly sad where this franchise has went. totally down the toilet with activision pumping and dumping games with the cod name on it just to make profit as fast as they can. truly shameful. long live cod 4.. i used to love call of duty games because i enjoyed working to unlock all the perks. but every time i play online, someone somehow unlocks all the weapons/perks/EVERYTHING within hours. i on cod4mw, it took less than three hours for someone to ruin it for me AGAIN! just like in mw2 and codwaw and mw3... i'm never buying these games again as i don't even get to enjoy the challenge of progressing anymore.. In my opinion this is the best call of duty game and nothing can beat this game. Campaign is really fun with and without cheat codes. It's short but it's multiplayer makes up for the short campaign. Multiplayer has a variety of weapons and perks to choose from.. Probably the best CoD there is.. this game is the least frustrating call of duty out. Maps, perks and guns are perfect and no overpowered ks, guns RC cars. Honestly I couldn't even pick this one out of the billion entries of this series if they were in a line-up, and I only played 2 of the series. Smooth controls.... it's a shooter with a bunch of **** playing online and some kind of ridiculous story for the 40 minute, linear campaign. I guess it was fun enough.. This game, defined the next generation of FPSs with a sharp plot delivered with high octane action. This is how war games are meant to be made, and played. Missions like war pig and game over have crystallized in my mind as some of the greatest missions. Ever. 9/10.. This was, by far, the best FPS shooter ever released. This was truly Call of Duty's best game. It was so simple, yet SO great. It had flaws, good flaws that made a game fun. You know, fun, the f word that didn't make you scream. It was the PERFECT game. If I was rich. I would take this game, upgrade the graphics, and release it again.. The game is amazing and here is why. The campaign is very memorable, very fun, challenging, pretty long, but overall amazing. The multiplayer? The best in the entire CoD series. It's fun and very refreshing for it's time. It's very well balanced, and addicting. It introduces several new features into the series. Features such as killsteaks, Create-A-Class, Challenges, 18 players game modes, perks, knife melee, etc. Overall, the best CoD game of all time, and one the best shooters to date. Easily a 10/10.. A solid and entertaining experience, I came to the game too late to get anything from the multiplayer experience but the campaign itself was very entertaining and the story arc plays well across the three MW games. Graphics, gunplay and immersion still hold strong even today whilst many games of this period have quickly aged and flagged.. This is one of the hardest games to review this generation for many reasons. Let me start by saying I get my competitive online multiplayer shooter itch scratched by Halo and my co-op/modern military multiplayer shooter needs filled by Rainbow 6, so I found COD's online offerings a little dull and the community full of **** so that wins it no points. The first time I played through COD I found it very entertaining but the forced set pieces and crap AI made it feel like an expensive ghost train with no ghosts, the characters where rubbish and the story pointless. However this game started the trend of the shock moment in COD games and in this one it was executed perfectly, the part where the player is caught in an atomic blast is one of the best and most memorable moments in gaming history, the blast was so great it managed to kill COD as the series has gone downhill since that very moment, even this game couldn't be arsed to compete with it as it just kind of ended a little bit later when I believe the atomic blast would have been a perfect ending to the game. With all this in account the game scored a 6 but the price it was, compared to the length of the game, knocks a point off to 5. I mean the game is less than 6 hours long which no one should be paying full price for. Which gets me to the point where Modern Warfare gains a 4, just like gears of war I have to look at the legacy that COD left us, it's a giant seller and because of this other games try to copy it's selling points so this is another game that helped flood the market with generic brown cover based shooters. COD also saw the raise in sales of **** DLC and micro transactions off the success of this game.. This game revolutionized the world of first-person shooters. The advanced gameplay, mechanics, and graphics were the first of its kind for the FPS. The elements of the game still inspire developers to this day. Some say this game was inspired by Half-Life 2 in some ways, for me it's a great game in general. There were so low and hard points to the main story. For the most part, the campaign was designed with exceeding epicness, and had some moments of glory other video games will never be able to take. Even better then the campaign as the multiplayer. The multiplayer is now the godfather to all FPS this generation. The multiplayer sets standards that will always be praised. 2007 may be the Year of the Shooter for many years to come, yet the biggest shooter of that year was Modern Warfare, whose glories will last a long time.. Great single player story and probably one of the best shooters of all time make Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare a must have for all game libraries. If one does not own this game, than they do not understand the first person shooter genre.. This game was a masterpiece for its time. It made me get off the Halo series and it set the standard for FPS. This game easily one of my favorite games of all time.. This game is a lot of fun and definitely worth getting. The campaign is fun and keeps you entertained by switching up what you're doing periodically. The down side is that the campaign is full of infinitely spawning enemies making it difficult to move forward at times. The ending wasn't great but the rest the game is excellent.. this... game... woah, seriously this thing defined the genre of FPS' i still play it today, if anything this game still holds up today, so black ops 2 can **** it.. One of the best shooters ever, the best Call of Duty game ever, etc. A lot of good things can be said about this game. I've spent an incredible amount of time enjoying it. The campaign is of course based on scripts and doesn't have much variety, but in 2007 it looked incredible and had a lot of breathtaking scenes and missions. And the best thing about singleplayer is that it's only the warm-up before the jaw dropping multiplayer action. A diversity of customization options introduced in this game became a standard for all modern FPS, the maps were nearly perfect balanced, as well as weapons. The arcade mode is a waste of time, and there are other minor flaws, but this game is still a great experience. Sadly, I can't recommend buying it now since a very small number of players play it's multiplayer on X360 and PS3, and on PC it has this stupid dedicated servers system. But it will always be in my heart as (I repeat) the best shooter I've ever played.. There has not been a better cod since this. This was the start of the cod franchise because this game was just way too good. This was when Infinity Ward was actually good. Infinity Ward has now placed themselves among the giants in the first person genre. With Modern Warfare 2, they deliver with a spectacular campaign and a refined multiplayer. Adding cherry to the top is the fun and new spec ops mode. The campaign looks towards a more blockbuster feel this time around as there are clearly more emphasis toward setpieces and explosions. Tying this together is a story, while not living to its full potential, sets up some fantastic segments throughout the whole game. It also has a controversial scene that may turn the media's head. The multiplayer is better than ever. With rebalancing and new killstreak awards, it becomes more addicting to play. Last but not least the new and fun addition Spec Ops mode. It can be played by yourself or cooperatively. It gathers inspiration from the campaign and Call of Duty 4. These are fast and fun bits that are even better with a friend. With all this in mind, my only three major gripes with the game are 1) The story isn't too interesting 2) The AI is lacking and enemies keep respawning. 3) The multiplayer needs a bit of balancing. Other than that, Modern Warfare 2 establishes Call of Duty as a brand that will stick for a long time.. One of the best FPS's ever made it was so innovative in the multiplayer and there is still a large multiplayer community. the story is well done and the voice acting is great and the characters are well-written and the graphics might not look so good today it still runs at 60 FPS so don't listen to the naysayers a must buy. From its classically intriguing story, its fascinating characters, its perfectly revolutionary multiplayer, and its absolutely gorgeous breadth of graphical milestones, ""Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" easily lifts the shooter genre above its head and carries it to new heights.. By far the best CoD game I've played and to say it was released in 2007, is very, very impressive. Thought the storyline was one of the best and the online is great, despite the modders which is the only thing that ruins the multiplayer but that has nothing to do with the game itself. The graphics aren't the best, but don't forget this isn't a new game. Activision really put other game developers to shame when they brought this out and I thought they let themselves down with the release of Black Ops 1 & 2. Ignore the haters on here, they're clearly just fanboys of Halo or Battlefield that hate this game because it is AMAZING and popular something they will never be.. This game was literally the best Call of Duty because it changed Call of Duty forever. Finally where a game evolves into the modern day instead of WWII. Don't get me wrong I love WWII, but this game separates itself from everyone because it is the first modern call of duty obviously. The campaign is","modern warfare not only changed shooter, but gaming in general . the campaign is a taut thrill ride with excellent shock-value . multiplayer is what set the benchmark for online shooters ."
670.Halo 4,"The last level is basically everything wrong with this game. Neverending annoying bullet spongey enemies, weak weapons, samey, boring environment and then when I finished it, the ending cinematic was glitched and had no audio. Imagine a new studio's first attempt to follow up on one of the greatest game franchises ever and there is a glitch causing the audio not to work for the ending. I had to watch it on YouTube. Now we're in 2025 and Halo is a shadow of itself and I bet Microsoft wonders why. In my opinion 343 Industries created a great first impression with Halo 4. The game is packed with so many new guns that just feel great to use, new enemies that are different than the flood and covenant, great movement, really incredible vehicles (I really loved the mantis) and an overall incredible storyline with a great ending and nice cinematic scenes. I was sceptical at first but the more I played the more hooked I was. I know this game isn’t taken away well but I think it’s a great start and would highly recommend.. This game is a masterpiece, its mechanics, its characters, its universe, I love it, it's great.. This game dosent feel like halo like at all. The weapons sound way too different story was ok but I just don’t like that they were making Cortana feel human yet there is a human cortana, Dr. Halsey.. It is ok, but this is the start of 343 starting to bumble around and with them intentionally making Halo not halo. Not to mention their hatred for Bungie.. After the release of the original Halo trilogy, Microsoft handed their golden goose to a new studio: 343 Industries. I can't imagine that many employees have much love or respect for Halo, because the game doesn't feel like Halo, but more like Call of Duty. The gameplay never feels like the original Halo games and fails to feel satisfying or fun. Enemy predictability is outright removed, making you wonder why you died most of the time, whereas in the original Halo games, when you died, it was entirely the player's fault and you could always tell why or how you died. Combat in the original games were fun in close quarters and it was always a viable option. In Halo 4, the combat is mostly done in mid-range to long-range because of the poor level design and unpredictable and inconsistent AI. The story is decent, and the only notable thing about it is the humanisation of the previously stoic and closed off Master Chief and Cortana.. meh, decent clearly not better than the first trilogy, but it was ok hope infinite is better. That intro to the game is **** ****. .. .... .. . .. ..... Great story, epic, great gameplay, great graphics. Long missions. Great characters. Emotional. 10/10. Halo 4 was an exciting new environment to explore, but huge disappointment. Halo 4 presents a fresh new start for the chef and a great set of mission but with one issue, the quantity of the of them was slim and the game is generally difficult. The guns are cool, adding a new set of enemys and and arsenal with it, the story's isn't any thing new in the sense that it stay in the original story and universe. When it come time to playing Halo 4 it has its upside and its downs but in the end it turn out to be fine and enjoyable.. Halo 4 is OK. Not as innovative as earlier games in the series. probably worth more time on other shooter games.. Killed the entire franchise. Halo 3 had over 1.5 million active players a year after launch, with Reach maintaining roughly a million in the same time frame, despite COD’s takeover. Halo 4 debuted with a million players and had under 10 thousand when it hit it’s one year mark. That’s how bad this game is, and the franchise will never fully recover. And no, the campaign isn’t “half bad”. It’s embarrassing.. Halo has never been a game series that I really kept up with in terms of story, and while I certainly don't think the story is bad, a lot of issues with pacing, character development, and sameness fill most of Halo's cast.Cortana, on the other hand, is far more iconic and unique compared to the rest of the Halo series, being one of the few characters that can emote and talk more than a few cool lines or military jargon. Due to Cortana's unique position of constantly talking to Master Chief, Halo 4 opts to focus on their relationship with each other, however I feel the majority of the focus is paced wrong or feels too rushed at the end. While I don't think that Halo 4 did anything wrong in the direction it wanted for Cortana, I have to ask why they didn't go more into the relationship between the two main characters instead of the pacing issues we have with Halo 4. And it's not like Halo 4's story is particularly bad, it just feels like it's trying to be everywhere at once, when they clearly had a focus on Master Chief and Cortana. Introducing the new big bad with a few lines, setting up a new commander, and having a new batch of enemies feels a bit jarring, and out of place. None of these are outlandishly bad mind you, just not paced as well as they could be. Just all of the 1st act feels a bit everywhere, and the 2nd act doesn't pay everything off well enough to justify these flaws. In terms of new weapons, the new additions given by the more robotic aliens are super cool, and vastly useful compared to the Covenant's weaponry. There are some balancing issues with the bigger bads, mostly dealing with the knights that take far too long to take down, but for the most part all the engaging action of cover and fire that Halo is know for is there. Overall Halo 4 is a good entry in the series, and one that stands right next to Halo 3 in my opinion.. This wasn't that bad. I heard some people say it was bad, but I can't see it. I do miss dual weilding, but it doesn't really affect the gameplay in any signifigant way.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Halo 4 is a decent time, the graphics are beautiful and the machanics are tight. But the ugly new designs for old characters, the annoying enemies, and the over dramatic narative keep it from being a truly great game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I do not like this game at all. The campaign is an attempt to rekindle the series that had been beautifully capped at the end of Halo 3, which was never needed. Sure, I can see why some people like the story, I just don't see at as appealing personally. The game looks like every late-era xbox 360 game, dull and washed, a blur of green and grey most of the time. A few decent set pieces doesn't save half the game looking bad. But Halo 4's biggest sin is it's multiplayer. It takes a perfected formula, and turns it into Call of Duty. No equal starts, weapons avaliable in loadouts being so broken you would think it would be a power weapon. Map layout knowledge is also gone because of markers and weapon drops that completely ruin the games arena shooter roots.. Great story (master chief is not just a covenant killer machine) , game play is awesome Lodout system for multiplayer is bad idea but at the end halo4 is a upgrade for franchise I Don't know why some people hate this masterpiece for like runing ability?!? Some people sey noo 343i added too much new things in halo so what? Bungie whith halo reach added new things to. I basically never use this site but this is one of those games that are so good that you gotta talk about it. This game deserves more attention and ever since I played it its been my favourite in the series. (What do you mean, ""12 years late""? shut up no one cares, just buy the game). While this game certainly has some major flaws, some aspects of the game are truly amazing. The game still looks amazing, and has a great story. The multiplayer is poorly designed, and the Promethean enemies are awful to fight, but many great new weapons and vehicles were introduced, and the game overall is solid.. The master chief and Cortana are stranded in hostile territory when they encounter a new alien threat in the form of the foot soldiers used by the Forerunners in the war against the Flood. This plot is essentially an excuse to relocate the war between Earth and the Covenant to some new environments and features new weapons, new vehicles and new enemies but otherwise the format is virtually unchanged. This is my only gripe; it's a little too similar to Halo 3 - but being too similar to my favourite game in the world isn't exactly a damning indictment. Another cutting edge FPS from the Halo franchise that fans will love just as much as the others.. While the story started dull and kinda fast i kept playing and then... I understood that this was one of the best halo games yet IMO. It has addicting multiplayer matchmaking, good storyline (also kinda fast) it's graphics are top-notch. Halo has surprised me yet again!. For me this halo game has the worst campaign of all the halo games. Mainly because in this game you have to fight the sentinels the most. It also made you fight the flying drone sentinels the most and that was so annoying. The missions were more boring than other halo games and the story was also very boring and dull- there were a few fun missions though- the one with the massive vehicle. The multiplayer tried to copy call of duty in some ways and so was quite meh. The maps of the multiplayer were quite solid though. Overall a disappointing halo game.. Well for these people Saying that halo 4 is not like the others. What do you think, We’re getting a new part of the story that is awesome. You are just talking about the nostalgia. Which is a stupid reason to hate a game just because is not the same as “the old ones” Bro if we gat the same it will be so boring. Like just more and more Covenants what is happening to your mind. You definitely have bad taste on games history. Halo 4 was my first ever multiplayer experience and it was a lot of fun. Single player mode was great as well with a great story and awesome OST.. I give this game a review of six out of ten because it is not particularly fun.. Best Halo game. The forerunners are a good enemy, great story, and visually amazing!. This game was the first game that ever made me cry. Near the end when you're going up the staircase with Cortana in her death throes I was playing through literal tears welling up in my eyes that at a certain point everything was blurry. To me this game was a Masterpiece.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 8. Halo 4 is simply okay. While elements of the sound design, graphics, voice acting, and overall polish of the game have improved from the previous Halo titles, the game is a significant step down in terms of gameplay. The enemy AI, a long-standing strength of the entire Halo franchise, is one of Halo 4's biggest weaknesses during the campaign. The new faction is also pretty unfun to fight. They're better than the flood, but that's a really low bar. The level design is sub-par by the standards of Bungie's Halo games (but probably average compared to most shooters.) It just feels average on all accounts of gameplay. I think it's telling that out of all the games in the Master Chief Collection, this is the one I would least enjoy replaying. I do recommend the Master Chief Collection, which this game is part of. However, if you're looking to only buy some but not all the games in the MCC, then feel free skipping out on this game. You're not going to miss much.. I'll be honest. This is not as good as the bungie games. The story and gameplay are both inferior to the masterpieces bungie crafted all those years ago. However, this is a very good and a very well made game. It really grew on me the 2nd time I played it. The first time, I did not enjoy the campaign. Maybe it was because I had covid. On the other hand, the 2nd time, my opinion completely changed. I don't know exactly what did it, but I was able to appreciate the story much more. The gameplay on the other hand, is still certainly what suffers. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but it suffers from linear level design and unpredictable AI. Probably my biggest problem however, is the extremely low ammo count for some weapons. Some, like the battle rifle for example, stay , more or less the same, but weapons like the plasma pistol have such a low count compared to previous games. It's unfortunate, because you will likely use this weapon often on higher difficulties. I am also not the biggest fan of the art style. It isn't bad in its own right, but it more or less completely abandons the style of halo 3. From a technical standpoint though, this game looks and sounds incredible. It's crazy to think this game came out nearly ten years ago on the 360. It looks even better on 9th gen, and 120fps is greatly appreciated. Overall, while this did not live up to bungie's excellent halo trilogy, it is still extremely well made, and takes the series in new directions. I think it's the best game since reach.. Hot take: This is the best halo story campaign wise and it has the best progression system in its multiplayer of any halo game. I think this is a great game, and the best thing 343 has ever done. I love the emotional depths of Chief and Cortona in this story and I think all the levels are so fun. Amazing Halo.. Really felt like a departure from the original series. I was never a huge halo fan but even I knew this game didn't feel true to the spirit of the franchise. The game mechanically was decent, the story was decent, and the gameplay sections were decent, ultimately the entire experience felt painfully average. The only thing helping this game is the multiplayer is fun even though it still doesn't feel like traditional halo multiplayer and feels much more washed out.. Something felt off. Pros: + The new machines introduces by 343 are super cool: e.g. Mammoth, Mantis. + In general, the biology-inspired designs work: e.g. electric dogs, Didact's ship as chrysalis. + The retcon for index is kinda cool (though execution suffers). + So the game shines the most when it goes the furthest away from the original trilogy. Cons: - Gunplay feels off. There is no punch to guns. Enemies are bullet-spongy. - Levels are meh. In a sense, you go through a set of very small rooms and need to kill all enemies to proceed further. Again and again. It makes gameplay feel kinda random, more like Quake 3 Arena or Doom rather than Halo. - Enemy AI is meh. - The graphics are meh. Some designs are quite cool. But there are many visual glitches (even to this day). Huge ships just disappear in the air after the explosion. Items re-spawn behind you. All this breaks the illusion quite a lot. - People look wooden. And the cutscene art direction in general is not up to the standard of previous games. Also, the story between Master Chief and Cortana will make you cringe.. A a kid, I really enjoyed the game. It's the first shooter game I've ever played. I loved the the sci-fi action and the characters; however, I realize that the game isn't as good as I remember. The previous games have better gunplay, characters, and multiplayer, and story.. 343 Industries does a good job at keeping the legacy of Halo intact. The multiplayer is fun, and the single player is fantastic.. This game is good. The graphics, the guns, & everything. Really, this game is amazing.. This game is a 9.5 for me it was all most as good as Halo: CE, it has a great story, good characters, fun gameplay and cool new enemies, nice level design, and the music is ok. Every weapons feels useful ,has heft to it, and is fun to use, this reminds me of Halo: CE and is where I feel 343 got a great deal of their inspiration from cause I see it a lot in this game. The way they showed the emotional bond between Chief and Cortana and how it has evolved after what they've been through the past three games was great. The new characters all felt like they belonged and added to the game and its story. The game was a little short compared to Halo: CE and the music honestly wasn't very memorable at all except on the last level but other than that it was an amazing game.. I played the hole game and I liked 1 part about it 1 PART but the muliplayer was okay but the spec ops I can rate because i never could but still I would just play Halo Reach.. the game is ok i did not like the story the gun play is good i have not tried the multiplayer but that all i have to say. When Halo's quality dropped due to 343i taking over it broke my heart as a fan of the first three instalments. I play it occasionally on The Master Chief Collection, but not as much as the first three.. First of all, graphics are gorgeous. Amazing landscapes and very detailed textures. But when you reach the second half of the game it all becomes just grey. Everything is very grey after a while. The story should have been a standalone. Everything felt very pasted on. Like it wasnt meant to be there, but still is. Even tho i still really wanted to finish it to get the full HALO experience i became very bored with the gameplay. The convenant are still very fun to fight, but the prometheans not at all. The best part of the game is the first hour or so, after youre done riding the warthog down the mountain is drops off exponentially. The starfox like mission was still a lot of fun tho. Not a bad game, just a bad halo game imho.. Even with it's massive problems what comes to game desing and story writing, Halo 4 is NOT a bad game. Is it flawed? Yes. Is it different from the earlier games? Also yes. But is it bad just because of it being different? No. Halo 4's gameplay is amazing and the graphics aren't bad at all, I'd even say Halo 4 is one of the best-looking Xbox 360 titles to this day. The story may be a little lackluster and new enemies may be annoying but the game's still... worthy. Worthy Halo game. Still not entirely good but fine enough to be enjoyed.. The best Halo game ever! This was my first ever Halo game on my first Xbox and it was the most fun I have ever had playing a game! The graphics were so amazing, the story was great and I loved the custom games that I would play with my friends. This, to me, is top-notch Halo with great modern mechanics. I definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone as I truly believe this to be the best Halo game! There is so much packed into the story and I think that 343i did such a great job with their first outing with Master Chief! Also, I think he has never looked cooler. His armor design is gorgeous and I love the more rugged worn down look to his colors. I know a lot of people don't like this game, but I will forever stand by my opinion of this being the greatest Halo game of all time.. Good compelling story. Graphics are great. Campaign Level Design is mostly bad. Big Team Battle and infection are fun but the rest of multiplayer isn't very good. Overall a good game but not one of the better halo games.. To be honest, I don't understand the hate for this game at all. Yes it is true that the campaign was the one that took me the least time to complete but the graphic progress of Halo 3 to 4 is something impressive. The narrative is good and sets the stage for what will happen in Guardians. I guess the hate is because the developer switched from Bungie to 343 but I don't consider it a bad game at all.. Best halo game standing with Halo 2. As everyone appreciates, this game shows Master Chief's human side in a beautiful way when he has to face not the Covenant, not the Forerunners, not just a random enemy Promethean, but the imminent loss of something more esteem to him than he could ever feel. Beautiful story, fantastic graphic evolvement, and great gameplay. 9/10 would recommend. Would've been 10/10 if they let the enemies have some screentime as well.. I really want to love Halo 4 and I've had to of played this game like a dozen times by this point. But after my most recent playthrough I cant say more then its okay. Halo 4 has a lot of issues that hold it back for me but I will say that my favorite aspect of the game is the story. I love learning more about the forerunners and having that human connection with Cortana developing rampancy I thought were all great ideas. Execution wise though was handled kinda rough. Most of the important info about the forerunners is jammed into one exposition filled cutscene so if your not finding the hidden terminals in levels your probably lost. And the Didact as a villain could of been so much more. But the stuff with Cortana is great still think it could of been handled better but I do like the idea of making chief more human and exploring that personal aspect. And I also do like seeing him confront a superior like with what happens in the story even if it does seem kind of dumb for it to happen in the first place. So the story is rough but overall I like it where the game falls pretty flat is the gameplay. This is the least fun to play FPS Halo game to date. Where to begin the weapons for the covenant and these new promethium weapons just feel bad and some weapons are literally useless. Each faction needs to have a weapon equivalent which just makes it feel very redundant. Like you don't need 3 different assault rifle weapons especially when 2 of them are worthless. Enemy AI is also notably bad In this game they will constantly just stand their or get stuck on terrain and when compared to even Halo 1 its just sad. But what really kills me is the Prometheans because their just not fun to fight at all in this game. And theirs no verity in how they fight or how you should approach them its like of course I want to after the flying guys who can revive fallen enemy's and fling grenades back because their so damn annoying. And like previously stated their weapons' are all redundant and not interesting to use. And the grenade they have has to be the most useless grenade in any mainstream shooter cause that thing cant kill anything I swear. Finally I like most everyone else hate the redesigns in this game because well they just look ugly at least the covenant ones do. I don't mind the guns and equipment being redesigned as much but the elites just look wrong in this game. And I wish they didn't change Chiefs armor not only because it wasn't necessary and didn't make sense considering that he was stuck in a broken ship. But it would of made the ending when he goes into that big room with the other Spartans way more impactful if he had the same armor from the last 2 games. With all its battle damage he's received and the fact it would of seemed outdated compared to the other Spartans really showing that he's alone and outdated now I think would of made the ending much more impactful. Overall the stories okay they also had spartan ops which can be fun and gives a narrative after Halo 4 but because they reuse a lot of levels like way to much it gets quickly repetitive and boring. And the multiplayer is also my least favorite of the FPS Halo games and its hard to explain why. But a lot of my complaints about the guns and gameplay do translate to the multiplayer and it just feels the most generic Halo game to play unfortunately. Overall Halo 4 isn't bad but it just falls so short compared to its predecessors. With its more generic feel and plot that needed to get flushed out more and the fact that its probably the glitchiest in the series as well as I've experienced some bad technical problems with this game before. Such as a level being unplayable half way through meaning I had to restart the level.. 343 achieved a masterpiece! after the trilogy closed the human covenant wars chapter, exploring halo lore into forerunner universe was amazing! I agree with those who claim that prometheans are not as fun as the covenant to fight, they are right! some parts of the execution could have been done better! but the experience is amazing! loved the story! got sad as cortana got worse. Amazing new mechanics as being able to sprint and ADS, finally! Played the game on xbox 360 back in the day, and replay now on xbox series at 4k as part of the masterchief collection. Man what a masterpiece!. Multiplayer wasn’t great however it was fun but not in the typical halo sense. Story was strong though not as good as previous entries.. The story is good and chief is back But the multiplayer feels more like cod and I don’t like it Where is the halo way. 343i really tried its best **** like an action movie! a Call of Duty game at its best! writing is ok i appreciate the **** its not a great halo game! i hate Forerunners and their Guns,,, the villain is basically a sith lord... no boss fight with the villain? what was the point of him in the game ? but i enjoyed playing this game...although the musics are completely defferent because they are not made by Marty but 117 is **** others? not so much anyway... it was Acceptable!. Halo is quite simply the closest thing we have ever experienced to a living, breathing alternate universe.. Halo 4 Campaign is good and i'm tired of pretending it's not. It has nice story, good voice acting, best looking Cortana, good graphics, solid soundtrack (both discs). I personally think it's very important to overall Halo lore that Halo 4 Campaign exists and i think it was easily one of the best video games of 2012. Yes, multiplayer was bad and that's why i almost feel that Halo 4 should be just treated as Campaign. Whenever someone says they hate Halo 4 or that Halo 4 was bad, my first question is ""are you talking about Campaign or Multiplayer?"". You can't say that Halo 4 as a whole game just ****, because you didn't like the multiplayer part. I feel like lots of people who Hate 4, just hate it's multiplayer and they never even really cared about story/Campaign part. For me lore/story/campaign always comes first, multiplayer is just fun bonus thing. I agree that both equally matter, but when one part of the game **** and other part is great, you can't say that whole thing ****. That's why i feel it's so easy for some to say that Halo 4 ****, because they never cared about Campaign anyway. Either way i think it's solid and important game, obviously not the best (that would be Halo 3). Does anyone agree/disagree? I really want to get this discussion going, because i deeply care about this game as a long time Halo fan.. The story is amazing but sometimes the game is just confusing and hard (Even in normal difficult).. Pros: + sprint button + beautiful graphics + hud improvements + improved crosshair Cons: - Prometheans enemies - Prometheans weapons - indoors section - repetitive - bad level design - convoluted story - Master Chief and Cortana dialogues. A drive for innovation that felt just right in some places, while it felt like it went too far on others. Halo 4 is the first one not developed by Bungie, but it's clear that those behind it were big fans of what had come before. The graphics are the best the series has ever seen, the art style and environments are top notch, for the most part, and the soundtrack retains the Halo magic but with a new spin. The gameplay is very strong and the abilities feel more useful than before, but the addition of sprint as a toggle instead of another ability might have been too much. The main focus of the story, which is the relationship between Master Chief and his A.I. companion, Cortana, is outstanding and it feels deeply personal, on a level that the series has never explored before and it resonates with the player. The main antagonistic force, however, was terribly implemented. A whole new enemy faction, which made no sense if you hadn't read or seen any of the extended material and throughout my playthrough I tried connecting the dots that from the information certain terminals would give. Their design also felt like something that did not belong in Halo and it was appalling when this new enemy faction appeared on the same place as the Covenant (original enemy faction). It was a night and day comparison. In conclusion, Halo 4 is at its best when it tries to be a small contained experience. The relationship between Master Chief and Cortana was the highlight of the whole experience, however the new enemy faction was so badly implemented and felt like a fish out of water. It was 343i's first big step and they tried to leave a mark. In my eyes, despite some sizable missteps, they succeeded.. This was my first Halo game, and even though I enjoyed it, it was a very shallow experience. The gameplay is fun, the graphics are fantastic, the character models look great, and it's a well made game overall, but the story & characters are forgettable.. Halo 4 has its ups and downs, story wise halo 4 did a amazing job making master chief more human like and going into more lore about the forerunners then the other halo games did and looking into the relationship between master chief and cortana and the graphics was amazing for 2012. But the music of halo 4 didnt feel like halo music. It wasnt bad just not halo music, and the characters didnt have that much life into them either. the game just didnt make me care enought about them, and the multiplayer felt too much like a COD wannabe. But halo 4 is a great play for a good story but would not recommend the multiplayer.. My favorite Halo game. The emotion and character is incredible. As we see Cortana begin to deteriorate and Chief struggle to come to terms with that. My biggest problem is the Promethean Knights, Watchers and the Didact. The Knights **** to fight against. They give so little feedback to the player, it can be really hard to notice when then shields drop, especially in a hectic firefight. The Watchers are a part of this. Nothing hurts more then killing a Knight, redirecting your attention to other enemies only for a watcher to come along and reconstruct the Knight. That hurts so bad. And the shield the Watchers can deploy on Knights make them **** even more. The last problem is the Diadact, or how criminally underused the Didact is. He is an awesome villain with a massive presence, but he’s barely in the game. It feels like they have an antagonist to have an antagonist rather then create a fleshed out enemy. I also really wish the Didact had become the enemy of Halo 5 instead of Cortana, but thats a little bit more of a problem with that game rather then this game. Even with these problems, I love Halo 4. My favorite Halo game, followed only by Halo CE.. Where the series began to go down but still an enjoyable game for FPS and Halo fans. Fans, NOT fanatics lol.. The Metascore is correct! Halo 4 is an Masterpiece! Great Graphics! Great Sound! And Master Chief is perfect in Halo 4! 343 Industries created an Masterspiece!. The multiplayer for this game is incredible i love it feels like battlefield in some time but it’s halo. Halo 4 Annoying but beautiful Halo 4 is a 6 hour long first person shooter and is the first standalone game from 343 studios.

I get the point is to make the game not feel linear, but instead I just feel like a chicken running around with my head cut off, trying to trigger a door opening to m","after the release of the original Halo trilogy, Microsoft handed their golden goose to a new studio: 343 Industries . the gameplay never feels like the original Halo games and fails to feel satisfying or fun . in the original games, when you died, it was entirely the player's fault ."
671.Football Manager 2010,"This game is so good that if you are really into football, you might get obsessed with it.. Best version of football manager series. The balance never becomes same accurate.. There are those who say I shouldn't be reviewing this.. I don't like football and never have but one thing I can give you is an outsiders perspective.... I was handling all the stats trying to get things ready and then expecting to be able to watch a match and guide from the sides... what do I get? The kind of visuals expect from the old spectrum version of football manager. I am not enough of a nerdy statistician to find this even remotely interesting. I'd rather play brothel manager or cleanup manager.. Fantastic game. It's the only one from the series where I've managed to last more than 2 seasons. I'm in the season 2016/2017 with Lazio at the moment and I am still loving it. Well done to the creators for making such a fantastic football management simulator.. Sensational !!!!!!! once you get into it , you will not want to leave it . it will keep you glued for weeks . graphics and sound are poor but overall this game is a bombshell","if you are really into football, you might get obsessed with it . graphics and sound are poor but overall this game is a bombshell . i'd rather play brothel manager or cleanup manager ."
672.Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood,"Very slow start, but overall, I enjoyed it. We learned a bit more about the Garleans and their prince, however for some reason they didn't really show much about the prince's story, unlike Heavensward, were they cared for each of the characters. Here however it seems, as if some characters are more like plot devices for the WoL.. Great expansion and FINALLY an opponent with Zenos, we can take seriously. It's the first time the WoL is weaker than someone else and I love it. It gives the story more depth, if the player stops being this over powered hero. My only complain, though, is the fact, that Zenos got way too little screentime. Yes, he is powerful, has great voice acting and in general interesting, but... they gave us almost nothing. Like... they let everything about this character open and that was disappointing. Also again, too many filler quests in the msq.. samuraiiiiii playing this a xaelahas too many pride point for me to rank it lower.. I'm very mixed on this one. The positives are getting to explore new areas and cultures. The negatives are how big some of the areas are, how much filler there is, and how little I felt I got to truly know some of the people. So pacing issues. If you like crafting, then spearfishing is introduced here. It is a mini-game set at an underwater gathering node which is kind of interesting. The negative though is this spear never gets an upgrade. Red Mage and Samurai were introduced in this expansion which are both favorites. The job quests for both of these are very good compared to some others as well. The new housing area is beautiful. The biggest negative for me is the same as most others: Lyse. Loud, obnoxious, and stubborn. It's like all her experience with the scions as well as her brain were hidden in that mask she wore. When that came off, so did the rest. She saw what happened with the Crystal Braves, but she still acts the same as Alphinaud. There are also a lot of JRPG tropes in here that aren't my favorite like fighting the same character(s) one last time at the end of the game or a segment. I can honestly say that the only character I liked in this entire expansion was Hien and his retinue. Ala Mhigo is some of the most painful content out there to the point where I would need to buy a story skip if I wanted to level a 2nd character. The idea of replaying this makes me nauseated. That said, the content definitely picks up post-MSQ leading into Shadowbringers. Characters are more interesting and there's a lot less Lyse as well.. An improvement over ARR and HW to be sure but not quite there yet. SB begins to add some great characters mixed in with those you might not care for. Overall it's a pretty decent entry into the FFXIV saga which might drag on at times in some areas but isn't completely without value.. A top notch story to go with some of the best mechanical interactions the game ever had. Combat flowed seamlessly, and endgame fights were challenging but fair. This was definitely the high point for PvE players.. This expansion is still imo one of the best ffxiv expansions easily! The healers were the best during this expansion. <3. This company steals from **** you pay for a subscription and then cancel, they will take your money the next month even though you cancelled. They took my money and then refused to give it back. I was a loyal customer of theirs for many decades, occasionally buying games and services but after this experience, I will never buy another game or service from Square Enix ever again!. Stormblood is a little long for my liking but the setup it makes for the future is incredible. Some might not like how long it is but the payoff in the later expansions it sets up is worth it ten times over.. Despite being originalyl received with far less praise, I've come to think of Stormblood as one of the better expansions in XIV's history. Starting with a stunning cast of new characters in a segment of the world developed solely for the purposes of expanding the cultural identity of XIV's cast, Stormblood is both impressive and perhaps the expansion with which SE injected the most funding and resources to date. Stormblood heralded one of the most spanning naratives, began the threads that formulated one of the most notorious characters in the game's history, and all of that was managed while providing some of the most in depth-driven character casts I've seen in an RPG, let alone an MMO like XIV. It's worth your time, it's only drawback is that is absolutely does overstay it's welcome with the post MSQ patchquests. There are many of them, too many much the same as HW.. Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood has some great gameplay segments & encounter design, but it's held back from surpassing Heavensward by a story that felt like two expansions smushed into one (still better than A Realm Reborn's story though). Far from a bad expansion, but still the weakest link due to just how great Heavensward, Shadowbringers, & Endwalker are.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fourteenth game in the series.. would have been a lesser score for me if not for the patches. main story got bland by dividing it into two regions but the patch stories and content made it for me. people might forget the tons of content the expansion brought due to not liking the main story quest of 4.0 but i did have a hell of a time although the empire plot could have gone another way but it did help set up the big bad of the next expansion. Don't let anyone tell you that this expansion is bad, or even the worst one. While I wouldn't say it's quite as incredible as HW, it's still very much enjoyable. Every single character is enjoyable.. Fun adventure story and lots of content, much more compared to later expansions.. Stormbloods very good, but it's more on the level of ARR instead of Heavensward and Shadowbringers. The trials are amazing, the best of the game imo. The dungeons are among the best as well. I like most of the characters in Stormblood, but the pacing is awful on some parts it drags on similarly to ARR. The plot is good but not great like the other expansions.. While feeling like a weaker story than its predecessor Heavensward. the actual quality of Stormblood is leaps and bounds better than ever, the cutscenes, the dialogues, the character building, the world building, Stormblood is VERY good in a lineup of Expansions that are also VERY good and the other expansions are bolstered by its existance and willingness to focus more on world building than many players may not enjoy as much as it drags on.. Not my favorite expansion cause I dislike Lyse, but the story was still good! There were a lot of feely and funny moments!. Story was mediocre, too little voice acting to be immersive, lots of very ""same-y"" quests... walk to a place, talk to a person, walk back... occasionally kill a mob. Thankfully there was some excellent raids and dungeons which kept my interest and were thoroughly enjoyable. Unfortunately the savage raids are short and contain only a handful of bosses each time, so you run out of challenging content quickly. Ultimate's are ok, quite challenging but again so short.. Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood was an ambitious tale of freedom, liberation, and what it means to stretch one's self too thin... which was, unfortunately, the major drawback to what could have been a great narrative. Mind, the overall experience was enjoyable, but the pacing and tonal issues hold it back severely. The characters were well written as per usual, but Lyse's development might be a tad rushed and sudden at times. The dungeons in this expansion range from awe-inspiring to rather average for the game's standard, while the trials in this game I must admit were all simply amazing. Not to mention, most of the new zones were fun to traverse and explore due to them taking place in locales only previously mentioned in passing. Overall, Stormblood is a good expansion, just not as great as what came before and what is to come after due to being held back by narrative and character development pacing issues.. Square Enix makes this expansion with care. Top quality contents. Just buy if you love ARR and Heavensward. Battle system still on the slow side.. I didn’t think this one would be better than the Heavensward expansion, but it was just continued excellence in game design and story telling. 10/10, and a loss for words this is an MMO. If you don’t like the Trial / “Realm Reborn” take my word, you won’t like any of it… New players hope you are ready for 200+ hours of MSQ which is mainly reading text. I fell for the recent hype. To all the people who says “it gets better” seriously, what is wrong with you? This constant insincerity is what kept me going. IT DOESN’T GET BETTER (a least to the point it serves as a valid argument). I just finished Shadowbringers 5.5 MSQ, and let me tell you, this is an “interactive Novel” more than it is a video game. Sure with each expansion the game (novel) gets a little better, in terms of graphics, animations, storytelling, but the CORE of the game doesn’t change, it is still this outdated mmorpg tab targeting, with its main FOCUS on MSQ, which is basically walls of text. Your quests in order of occurrences is: talk, travel, click objects, kill NPCs, do dungeons/trials/story instances. They added one different mechanic in Stormblood lol, which is to “click stuff in FPS mode”. I can count the EPIC moments of the story in one hand! 3 of them were in Havensward and 2 in Shadowbringers (forget RR and SB). The main focus of this game is the MSQ, but the problem is; the MSQ is 90% fluff pointless writing and storytelling, you could cut out 80% of this writing and still get a concise accurate description of the story, albeit just more on point. What Square Enix is doing is inflating game time content with more and more text and sloppy animation screens, which I’m not kidding stretches the MSQ than it really needs to be. I’m not even talking about important background build up, I’m talking about content you won’t even remember because it served no purpose in the grand scheme of things. (Anything you wont remember a month from now isn't worth reading about). Because the MSQ is mainly storytelling, and single player orientated, why not just play better solo video games that are much, much better technically advanced in gameplay, like GTA 5, Witcher 3, red redemption 2, and hundreds of others titles? There were times I was so desperate to just “play” the game, because there is so few dungeons/trials and killing quests in-between all the walls of text. One could always pay a story skip potion, but the fact is MSQ is the focus of this game, the endgame is extra stuff. Players and Square have both said that MSQ is the focus of the game, and the more casual player base. WoW = focuses on repeatable endgame content after a short introductory (and often crap) storyline. FF14 = 200 hours of MSQ (at minimum) at which point you can cycle through some endgame content and get max ilvl gear fairly easily. But levelling others job/crafts, which has its own questlines seems be one of the most popular things to do. I won’t be buying Endwalker. People who enjoy reading fluff for hundreds of hours to see one good cutscene here and there, you do that, enjoy! I’ll watch it in a recap YouTube video and do more productive things with my life than read FLUFF MSQ content, which is intentionally used to extend game play time. “You can always make more money, but you can’t make more time” think about if you’re really enjoying that 200 hours or if you’re only enjoy small amounts of it. Whilst the epic moments were epic, the pain of going through so much unfun content to see it was not worth it. The balance is definitely not there. Even most fans think the post RR quests are so bad, yet square hasnt fixed it by just removing it for new players by using a short narration cutscene to bring players up to date for havensward. (And i heard it was even worse, oh dear God).. This expac is for my fello Lyse stans. Story wise I think it's a lil less exciting than HW, MSQ got reaaally repetitive there for a while. It's not bad by any means, but def not the best. Some of the new zones added are really really cool, others not so much. The story is a lot more war/politics based and less fantasy epic battles. All in all it's 100% worth it for some main character's developments, new races and characters, zones, mechanics and stuff, they added some really cool new stuff to the gameplay here.. I don't like theme of Far East. But hey! This expansion wake up my interest to this culture! Storytelling grow up again and more challenge and beautiful contents awaits! Bravo. Amazing story. Graphics has a great emphasis on attention to detail from scenery to character.. Final Fantasy XIV is my favorite PvE MMO, however I think this expansion was the worst. Story was boring, and I felt it a chore to play through. Towards the ending the quality shifted upwards, but this doesn't same my rating to go higher. Instances however were good, and I also liked the maps, and new classes.. the expiation had it's fair share of launch problems but the actual content is actually quite phenomenal i enjoyed every bit of it , just remember this is an mmo it's not fair or reasonable to not expect grind for levels or a soft cap on gear THERE IS NO MMO THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT , or even soft mmos so please be reasonable other than that the content that was provided was quite awesome not only in presentation but in execution as well. I tried out Final Fantasy XIV on a whim with a discounted price for some **** wanting to have to level to max, I purchased for $25 a ""level to 100"" kit so I could try out the pvp(which was why I bought the game). Unfortunately, unbeknownst to me I was unable to even participate in pvp, or anything but the level 1 starter quest. That's right, in order to do ANYTHING in the game you have to go through a 70000000 hour quest that is so boring you will want to die. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you really enjoy storyline, which I do not. I felt ripped off, and will never log in again.. FF14 is amazing ! If you never played it, download the free trial and see for yourself !. This is a second review with the Expansions ""Heavensward"" and ""Stormblood"" taken into consideration, The game is overall ""good enough"", it definitely does not feel like a 100% premium product in most regards simply because the developer does not seem to take into consideration the western audience's wishes as much as one would have hoped, mainly the community is instead revolved around the appeal of the game, However I failed to see the appeal on the release content of stormblood while could see some appeal on heavensward release content and of course the patches, it felt like the budget fell drastically for some reason on stormblood quality-wise both in the narrative and the story itself, it felt like they could have done much more with it but didnt. I still believe one can enjoy the game, the maps though I find very uninteresting to be at, they are look-alike in many ways, I would even say they reused a lot of assets and it is very obvious, even the music pieces are essentially 1-3 per expansion excluding the boss fights of course and *some* dungeons. If someone is not into text-based story telling, simply do not play this game, the voiced narrative is very limited and seemingly random, this game relies heavily on its story and it is 96% text-based at the very least, I would not recommend therefore this game simply for the reason that globally 1 out of 10 people has trouble reading and basically they do cannot enjoy reading because of effects like the different types of dyslexia, the developer does not seem to contemplate the importance of this fact, the game is developed in Japan and then localized by another group of people in the company, the producer's native language however is mainly pictorial which makes it very easy to read once mastered to a degree, therefore the text-based story becomes a breeze to read however once localized, the western system of reading is much more difficult for the brain to decode and therefore the text-based story becomes unpleasant for most people and certainly unbearable for those 1/10 people world wide, which is still a huge number of people. Consider this before you invest into the game, if you can read fast and you like this type of narrative then you will be very satisfied, otherwise do not commit unless you want to train your reading skills, which is something I did, to put it into perspective the 90% of the game time you will spend on your first 1-2 months will be reading the story, it depends on your speed, it is advised to only skip anything that is not in a cut-scene to save some time if you so choose. The story and its quests are only unbearable for some due to the above, if you want to do a second playthrough you can simply skip through every narrative content by rapidly clicking on your screen, it can still be a bother of course, the game's store has ways for people to either skip or transfer, the game as of right now has limited cross-server capabilities and the server data-centers feel very fragmented, therefore it is very possible that if you do not communicate with your friends on which servers to settle in, you might not play together and for the most part the game is indeed single-player for the first 1-2 months, consider all the above before you commit. Best of Luck and have fun! As far as expansions go... Shadowbringers>Heavensward>Stormblood>A Realm Reborn. Main quest are long, boring and tedious. Average characters, story, music, poor quality in some parts. Boss and dungeon design uninspiring. The game showed no improvement in terms of design and systems from the original release of ffxiv a realm reborn. Its just a big unenjoyable time-waster. The tasks are so lame and simple that automated bots make up half the player base, they do the same main story quests as you do and even farm dungeons in duty finder. If you are playing the same game they do, you are doing it wrong. This is a ridiculous time waster that makes you dumb. Stay away.. Don't ever step in this **** This isn't a game, it's garbage. It's not fun, it's not rewarding and of course because it's made by Square Enix they can't make good games, can't they? Actually they do make some good games here and there, but this oh boy don't even touch this **** even with a stick because the stick is gonna pull you in the **** Don't buy it, don't even think about it. This is trash, not a game! This wasn't a joke review, I'm serious.. After coming off Heavensward I can't help but say what an immense disappointment Stormblood ended up being. I kept hoping the storyline would pick up like in HW but ultimately it was a contrived mess of a story with an even more disappointing ending. I can but hope that Shadowbringers fixes this.. FFXIV is one of the games I just can't stop playing. I recommend this game to anyone, and I have easily put more hours in this game than 99% of any game I have ever played. If you're a final fantasy fan that is on the fence about an online Final Fantasy because you think they are suppose to be offline please do not be. FFXIV is worth it! It not only has it's own world but almost everything from previous titles! If you are missing Final Fantasy and need something to suite your mmo sweet tooth this game is by far the best mmo on the market!. Still the best MMO RPG available right now, and probably the best I've ever played (and I've played them since Lineage 2). The sheer vastness and complexity of this game make it almost always interesting to log back in and play for a few hours. And so I have been doing, from the release of this expansion up til the current patch (as of Oct 2018). Graphics are better than they have been before. They ditched ps3 support in an effort to allow for bigger areas and other graphical improvements and it shows. It is still a FFXIV, so the aesthetic is the same, but new areas, new skill effects, and new instances are absolutely great. Music is great, as it has always been. A bit too militaristic in some places for my taste, but plays into the overall theme of the expansion. And the new themes for new primals and other trials are beautiful, each better than another - and with such variety I haven't heard in not only other MMORPGs, but other games in general. New jobs (classes) are pretty good too. Even though they only introduced two dps, they differ enough to make for an interesting experiment (my main hasn't changed since ARR). My only complaint about them is that they don't feel complex enough on higher levels, but that's the situation with many other jobs. Speaking of which, the ability rework is not the highest point of the expansion. Removing and reorganizing many of them was necessary b/c there were just so many, but I feel they could have done better. Expansion to core kits for many jobs do not feel like natural progression, instead it often feels like a few new abilities have been plopped on top of a fleshed out class. All in all, most of it works out well and slight corrections since the initial release have improved the situation anyway. The lowest point of the entire expansion is probably the story. It's not bad - it's just not Heavensward level of epic. Heavensward had me logging in to continue main story with almost religious zeal. Characters were authentic, values rang true and the adventures were immersive (even if they dragged a bit towards the end). Stormblood's story is interesting, fun, the cast is diverse and there are some plot twists here and there but it feels somewhat uninspired. Still good, but not excellent. Additional content, like raids, trials, and dungeons, are pretty great. They are masterfully done and differ amongst themselves enough to keep you interested. While they follow pretty much the same script as before, they offer aesthetic variety and different mechanics so I was never really bored. To be fair, I think this is the part that has improved the most since ARR and I am happy devs are just getting better and better at it. The community has always been one of the reasons I kept playing for years. People are just nice and toxicity is limited. That said, with the game becoming a bit more popular, this has changed slightly with SB. It's still miles ahead of WoW though, so if you want to find friends online to do cool stuff with, this is definitely your game. Finally, I'm not a big fan of the most recent additions and changes to the game. Eureka especially feels dull. Luckily, there are so many other things to do this is really not a problem. Can't say much about PvP b/c I never really had time to try it ^^.. I played this garbage for 5 years now (in fact I had a review from 4.0), and the only thing I can think of is ""fall in quality"". The game never - EVER - got better in any possible way, not in gameplay or content - and the story is another thing which I'll gladly talk about very soon. In fact let me start with the story which is, to say it bluntly, completely garbage: I used to follow it during 2.0 and 2.1 and I could not believe how bad it was, it simply wasn't entertaining nor engaging to follow it to the point that I only followed bits and pieces ever since. I am a HUGE JRPG lover, some of my favorite JRPGs are Trails of Cold Steel, Berseria, Vesperia, and old classics like Legend of Dragoon, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger/Cross, the list goes on, but this game flat out fails to tell an entertaining story and at actually engaging you; if you don't follow from the very start, you're basically unable to follow afterwards and making it very noob unfriendly to anyone who even dares to step in. If at least each expansion was its own separate story - which is how it should've been - I could at least compare each story by itself and maybe even enjoy them, but nope: have fun following a bunch of morons with no personality throughout plot lines so forced not even lube would help. Oh and of course you cannot skip it as they wanted to make it clearly the focus of the game...until they decided to add a jumping potion that allows you to skip to level 60 and begin the story from the last expansion The story is truly important, but so is money, now pay up if you actually wanna experience the game or enjoy the 548 unskippable quests! Alright now, let's pretend you actually survived the long ordeal and you FINALLY manage to be able to do all the content: at first it is a lot of stuff, I'm not even joking here, but you will soon realize that it's a flash in the pan and you'll soon have nothing to do for the rest of the game. For example there are 50+ dungeons to unlock and clear, which sounds like you'll have a lot of fun doing them, but once you're done clearing you have no reason to re-run them as they give you no incentives or achievements or anything worth a second run. SE seemed to have realized this too and they started giving crappy glamour items in order to give them some more life, but even then it doesn't hide the fact that dungeons have no lasting power. Even WoW's dungeon are still re-run thanks to the achievements and a better transmog function, which ACTUALLY gives a good reason to do them. FFXIV dungeons are, essentially, rotten data. Crafting and Gathering are probably the only two things that seemed to have some lasting power, if they didn't rely solely on complete RNG, which is there only to make it LOOK harder: the potential was there but they ruined it by giving each action a % that will easily screw your rotation and basically make you quit instantly. Fishing is even worse and all you'll be doing is sitting for hours upon hours, hoping to hook the fish you want, hopefully HQ, and then repeat the process until you get better gear, which will become obsolete in few ****? And there are a lot of side content - or fluff content - that has no real staying power at all: Gold saucer is the prime example with its crappy card game, LoL copy, crappy Chocobo racing and other minor stuff that you'll most likely never bother with unless you're into collecting crap. Hunts were potentially progress content until it died out because it never innovated, with people preferring doing weekly stuff rather than jump into the toxic pool. Eureka is currently the worst content I EVER played in my entire life, even worse than Diadem, and I can't even recommend it as a joke! Beast tribes are okay but I wish they gave more than 3 quests per day: this takes less than 20 minutes to clear. There are many but it's the daily lockout that will stop you and make it LOOK like it's longer than it should. PvP is okay, but the combat system is clearly not made for PvP and it turns out clunky and just not fun. A shame. And now the community, oh dear Lord the community: we're talking about a group that will relentlessly defend this game and its flaws, even at the cost of harassing people or namecalling you. I mean It's not even hard to seek them out: simply mention your dislike for the main story and you'll be stormed by everyone; say that the game is boring and they'll slap you and shout ""go back to wow"" or something; try to say that you're having no fun with the current content and hopefully they'll just ignore you or say you whine a lot - even if that was your only complain. There is simply no discussing with these people: I've been playing for 5 years and I safely say ""there is not a single person who was worth calling a friend"". Not even one. I had better times in LoL - or even WoW - than in this toxic cesspool of a community. As such, I highly recommend staying away from this game and just save your sub.. The story was good even if a bit cliche and tropey though the quests (gameplay wise) still were pretty inferior to what WoW does. Zone design was improved compared to HW but copying of assets is still pretty noticeable in areas like terrain doodads. I understand buildings having only 1 or 2 varieties but I shouldn’t see things like the same rock and tree over and over so easily which can usually be dealt with but just rotating an object. Ruby Sea feels like a huge empty zone given the water doesn’t add much actual gameplay either besides swimming. If you’re going to add a mostly water zone you should at the very least add some type of gimmick rather than having it be nothing more than a barren land of emptiness and copy pasted rocks and kelp that you swim through. In general some zones just didn’t feel like they reached their full potential such as the Lochs and Yanxia while others like Azim Steppe were really well done. The zones still feel dead in general when compared to WoW’s where you’ll see NPC’s actually doing things such as bears hunting fish or predators hunting prey and in general FF14 zone design seems to be nothing more than ‘this is the bear area and over there’s the wolf area and this final area is the bird area and the mobs are just all walking back and forth in their little zone’ and doodads just seem thrown into the game world and rarely are blended in. The main issue with SB right now is that once you hit 70 the game is the same exact game as HW. You do the same 3 dungeons over and over (with high DPS queues) to grind out tomes and in general are doing nothing at all actually new unlike how Legion added Mythic+, artifact weapons, and the world quest system (an improvement of the old dailies system). And of course with Omega they are continuing the convoluted gearing system from Alexander. Square is once again relegating any new systems to patches and we have to hope these new systems are well developed unlike Lord of Verminion and Diadem and even things like the eventual beast tribes may just be the same ol’ 3 daily quests. I’m iffy on this thing Square does where they release a ‘skeleton’ expansion and how they instead put new systems into patches I’m holding out hope that they surprise me with the upcoming patches though given Square has been nothing but predictable with FF14 so I’m not getting my hopes too high. It doesn't help that the one new system, Eureka, has already been delayed making the first patch pretty barren for a patch coming 4 months after release with some of the content not even being patched in till a month after that. So 5 months for everything while in that time Legion released 2 patches following a 77 day release schedule that added far more content than 4.1 is adding. Stormblood is a mediocre expansion and the playerbase should honestly expect so much better from a company like Square.. After a few months, I can say it's pretty decent. The story is a significant step down from Heavensward's but it's at least on par with A Realm Reborn's. The changes to every job I've levelled to 70 have been at worst meh to me (I'm not a fan of Bard anymore, but it's fine) to great (Ninja is far less of a **** to play). Most of the new music tracks are amazing. Unfortunately, the zones continued the downward spiral started in HW. Most of them are huge with very little interesting things happening. I blame flying. Also swimming was woefully underused. ARR still has the most interesting and unique zones. I was also not a fan of how parts of some zones were completely walled off by the story. Having high level areas be filled with high level aggressive monsters ala ARR is a much better way to go about it. Worth buying if you're already an active player. I wouldn't say it's good enough to change your mind if you didn't like it already. There's a lot of people **** about the price change. They are dumbasses. The only change was that Brazilian and Russian players on the Steam version are now paying the same monthly fee as Brazilian and Russian players who played the not-Steam version, which is also now on par with what the rest of the world is paying.. An uncommunicaded increase in Steam subscription pr","it's the first time the WoL is weaker than someone else and i love it . it gives the story more depth, if the player stops being this over powered hero . the biggest negative for me is the same as most others: Lyse ."
