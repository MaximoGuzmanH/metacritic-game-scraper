673.Bloodborne: The Old Hunters,"Loved it just as much as the base-game. Bosses are great. Lady Maria and Ludwig are absolutely my fav game bosses of all time.. Arguably the greatest DLC ever made. At least in the top 5. This perfectly fits in with the rest of the game a superb addition to the already fantastic game that is Bloodborne, Old Hunters adds some of the very best music & boss fights to ever come into existences, an absolute must play add-on.. One of the greatest dlcs I've ever played its challenging but the last boss is annoying.. Alot better than the normal game more fun alot of enemiesin love the llast bosses. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This DLC is exactly what bloodborne needed to make the experience complete. The added environments, gear and enemies perfectly complement the base game and complete the difficulty curve, which the original lacked at the end. Fear the old blood!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is not only my favorite video game but also the best video game I have ever played. I love depth in game narratives, environmental storytelling, and when complex concepts are woven into the fabric of games. Every time I play Bloodborne, I am pleasantly surprised by the developers' ability to create a game that checks every box for me. The soundtrack's eerie violin sets the mood of fear and horror, the measured weight of every weapon type, and the slow progression of madness depicted in every level of the game make this nothing short of a masterpiece. It's perfect down to the last minute detail. Best dlc ever. Ludwig, Lady Maria, Orphan of Kos are some of the greatest bosses ever made and the level design is absolutely top notch. And that music, bruh! Unreal.. Best DLC money can buy!. ludwig is my all time favorite boss,which is boasting an extremely ugly exterior, yet swinging a pristine moonlight greatsword just like a true knight and hunter.. it's fun. Pretty interesting lore, and of course, more challenging bosses to beat. Very fun DLC!. if you think the main game is unique this dlc is even more the boss fight are on another level the world is somehow darker a lot of developers should learn who to make good dlc's like this one miyazaki realy surpassed him self in this one. It is not dlc, it is DLC. It has great bosses (hi, ludwig and orphan) and the locations are as incredible as in the original game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10/10. As great as the main game. Message cannot include less than seventy-five letters, so I have to write it.. I like the dlc see it has some problems it's very short and the level design is mostly just so so but boss is what makes it worth it and I enjoyed them all very much. This DLC is pure art from beginning to end! Although it may feel a little short, it is the perfect addition to one of the most challenging games ever made.. Did what bloodbornes base game did but better. Amazing fights and the pizza cutter is my favourite weapon.. The best DLC **** I've ever played, just as good as the main game if not better! It is ESSENCIAL to the full experience of Bloodborne imo! Also Lady Maria is cute and really good for waifu material if you're into that kind of stuff >:3. amazing! best bosses in the game not even close. the music for Ludwig is so good and the cut-scenes!! must play if you have the main game.. this game re-imagined the souls formula, improving what made the other games great AND created the most engulfing and terrifying world design of any game i've played, a truly grotesque masterpiece and work of art and epic adventure in a bloody and bizzare environment, with many of the best bosses there can be found in teh videogame industry and the a perfect dlc that elevates the game to another level. The greatest DLC of all time. The new areas are near perfect, the bosses are on a whole other level in comparison to the base game, and the weapons are unique and great. 100% worth it.. Dark Souls 3 - Shields + Lovecraft = Bloodborne This game is fast-paced melee combat that rewards aggression far, far more than passivity. You get in there and YOU be the monster that all these horrors fear, not the other way around. The bosses are awesome, greusome nightmare-beasts. Some of rhe monsters and settings skeeve me out and still give me chills. And the DLC is some of the best content in the game, with awesome new weapons and one of the most difficult but most fun boss battles in the entire SoulsBorne set. The one and only mark I have against this game is its ""Chalice Dungeons"", randomly generated content-padding that you NEED to go through to get all the achievements and SHOULD go through if you want the best upgrade materials for your weapons. These areas are tedious, time-consuming, and monotonous. Despite that looming black mark, Bloodborne remains a top 10 game for me, between its fun combat and Lovecraftian worldbuilding.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great added content, a little not well balanced on regards ot the vainilla version. Nevertheless is an amazing expansion. With tons of interesting content.. The best DLC I've ever played. Laurence is a pain to fight, but other than that, I cannot find any faults with this DLC.. Bloodborne Dlc Bloodborne Dlc is good.İ have to say it is **** some faults make the Dlc worse.Bloodborne areas were good,fun and exciting.İ can say the same thing for Dlc but they are same areas.They are not interesting...3 main areas were good but they were taken from main game.Different kinds of bosses,items and others make Dlc funnier but they are not enough.There must be new gothic areas and other things. There are new things.İtems bosses and others... Atmosphere is nice but areas aren't very good. Pros Atmosphere Bosses Other Cons Areas(some) same things Score:88 in. Step up from the main game IMO. It's even bolder and more fascinating allowing for a deeper understanding of the world and lore.. My favourite DLC. It has everything you want. Great ost, new bosses, weapons, well-done locations and more. You should definitely play this.. Perfect but unfortunately there is not Arabic language and the gameplay are so interesting and enjoying. best bosses and areas in the game. Also great new weapons and good story expansion. The DLC does add a lot of great weapons and items to the mix, but the best parts of Bloodborne for me were the initial levels that all make sense and connect to each other in meaningful ways. With the DLC taking place entirely in a dream, it bears more resemblance to the latter half of the game where the developers just start making everything gruesome and creepy. I did stick with it and complete all of the levels and every boss, optional or not. So it's at least interesting enough for me to go that far with it. Edit: I decided to change my review score after reading ""The Paleblood Hunt"" by Redgrave. That essay explains the lore of Bloodborne and should absolutely be required reading after finishing the game. So much of what seemed like nonsense in the game was actually a very intricate story.. Fantastic DLC. I just don't give 10 because it should have come with the standard game.. Masterpiece DLC with some of the coolest and most difficult bosses in all of gaming.. I honestly think that some parts of this Expansion should have been in the main game. It contains the best boss fights in the entire game, adds more depth to the story and answers some questions. Also, it's significantly more challenging, which is a good thing because the second half of the main game was a cakewalk. The only thing that bothered me is its length, it feels very short but it really is worth playing, it adds a lot of content, a must-play if you enjoyed the main game. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. More Bloodborne? Yes please. One of the best DLCs ever made for one of the best video games ever made.. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. One of the best video game DLCs ever made. Incredible bosses, environments, atmosphere and variety of weapons. The soundtrack is the best of any video game DLC I've ever heard and it makes Bloodbornes soundtrack quite possibly the best ever made in this era of games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. DLC Review Gameplay 9 Graphics 10 Fun 8 Atmosphere 9 There are 5 boss fights.. the best dlc of the history the bosses is so hard and discover all the secrets and weapons and the story is so fun even though you will suffer a lot during the process and you cry to the boss 1 boss 3 boss final and the secret boss but very well dlc. This DLC helps to establish a worldview. It has great artwork and it still keeps you nervous and fun. Increased weapons make the direction of play diversified.. Story: 8 Graphics: 8 Sound: 9 Gameplay: 10 Game Time: 10 Hours (Main Story). Masterpiece. Miyazaki has done it again. Every boss, area and enemy is brilliant.. The old hunters DLC is perfect in everyway : Weapons are even better than the original's Story is so goddamn interesting like holy hell is it satisfying to know The bosses are perfect , just sheer perfection in their design / moves... The soundtrack is even better than the original's. I think I listened to them countless times. One of the best DLCs out there. Bloodborne's best content, hands down. Unforgettable boss fights, unbearable challenges. Love it!. Incredible addition to Bloodborne. It makes this game better than any other Souls game in my opinion, it gives it that edge. Incredible areas, bosses and music. The Old Hunters is where Bloodborne reaches its climax.. An excellent DLC that add even more to the mysterious hidden story that hides itself in the game. New enemies new weapons and more bloody grotesk and awesome bosses!. The DLC would be as good as the base game except for the sudden spike in difficulty for Orphan of Kos. He requires such precise timing with parry and dodging leaving virtually no room for error. He can kill you in seconds and it's infuriating. There's also no NPC summon. It takes leveling to 160 with a maxed out weapon, plenty of fire paper and beast pellets, appropriate runes (up visceral attack, lake/great lakes) and tonssss of practice. Nobody asked for this. I managed it, but it wasn't nearly as rewarding. My recommendation is to get the whaling Loran Chalice and get a random dungeon full of those cloaked poison enemies. There's a room on floor one next to a lamp that drops 50k blood stones. I went from level 115 to 180 in less than 5 hours. Also great to mine for purchasing items.. While the base game introduced the player into the new game mechanics of the souls series, the DLC almost expects you to have memorized the mechanics by now. The difficulty is increased, enemies hit harder, are faster, fights tend to get more chaotic, the whole package. If you already played through the basegame and decide to start the DLC for the first time on an NG+ run, I would highly discourage you from doing that. Apart from that, it is certainly one of the better DLCs that any game has produced to this point and proudly stands at par or even above all DLCs from the rest of the Souls series. The pros: - Level design, like the base game is exceptional. - Atmosphere and lore from the base game are expanded and give further context. - New weapons are arguably among the most ""fun"" weapons in the game - New challenging enemy types ensure that the first run through the DLC is not a breeze. - The final, and most important plus: The bosses. Without going into spoiler territory, I find a majority of the bosses to the best in any of Souls, be it by challenge, soundtrack, or just the overall satisfaction of beating them. The cons: - Even though you really get your money's worth with the DLC, I can't help but wanting more of Bloodborne. I may be wrong, but the DLC overall felt quite short (especially in comparison to the Dark Souls 3 DLCs). In summation: If you liked Blooborne, then you will not get around playing the DLC. I recommend the DLC to anyone in possession of a PS4.. Bloodborne: The Old Hunters is the DLC expansion to the base game and a great one at that. The Old Hunters takes the player to the Hunter's Nightmare where beasts and crazed hunters reside. In addition to new maps and locations, the player will face new enemies and satisfying boss encounters, and be able to obtain new weapons and attire.. If you liked Bloodborne, you're gonna love this. Perfect addition to the game, with some of the best bosses in the entire franchise.. FromSoftware did the impossible by making Bloodborne even better with this DLC. Very unique new places to explore, great new weapons and some of the best boss fights in the entire game. I'm proud to finish the game by myself except the last boss. I had to get some help from a fellow hunter. A classic!. Best DLC for the best exclusive on PS4. New big locations, 5 new cool bosses. That is, the content here is 1/3 of the original game.. great bossfights (with great lores) great areas and great weapons and a pure masterpiece. When you think Bloodborne can't get better, you get this. Epic DLC with even more epic and challenging Bossfights and lots of new collectibles. Love everything about it!. I got into this game few years late and is regret not playing this at launch. Everything you want in an action RPG is superbly represented in this game. And if you think casual gamers would not like it because of the difficulty, they even catered to them by allowing you to summon up to 2 person to help you with boss fight.. I have trust issues with DLCs and very often I refuse to buy them simply because they are not worth the price or I refuse to buy something that would have been necessary in the game itself but they cut it out to sell it as a DLC. This is what the standard should be for DLCs in the market. Bloodborne itself was complete already, but this addition just enriches the gameplay and story even more.. Maria and Ludwig are excellent. Orphan and Laurence are the two worst bosses in the genre.. a masterpiece and gem , thank miyazaki-san thank fromsoftware for this masterpiece. The most difficult game in the world. I want to finish this game but unfortunately. I still stuck at the first boss from the beginning until the end. I know you might want to critic on my review. Before you criticize my review, you have to first self-review yourself. Did you ever rate 0 to other games such as Death Stranding and leave comment about that game was the most boring game in the world? Now you should know why I say Bloodborne is the most difficult game in the world. A game for minority is only suitable for certain people. Same like me too, I like to play Death Stranding but doesn't mean that I like to play Bloodborne too.. New weapons and bosses are exciting! They ratcheted up the difficulty to please all the sadists! Great fun and reason to play through the game again.. I just love Bloodborne .The art design, the detailed world, the ememys, the weapons and of course the gameplay. The best PS4 game ever.. I’ve faced across all four of the Souls games—Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls II and Bloodborne. Even after I shook off my rustiness—I’d grown soft playing games like Witcher 3 and Tomb Raider—the expansion still pummeled me. Between sneaky traps, hyper-aggressive enemies, and nightmarish levels, I often found myself overwhelmed, my unblinking eyes gone dry and my vision fuzzy. In some areas, enemies will fight each other, and I’m not afraid to admit that I’d use them against one another just for the reprieve.. The best ps4 game I have ever played. Thank you Fromsoftware for this masterpiece.. I almost quit From Software games because of this game due to failure to pass the werewolf at beginning. After several trials and many tutorial videos, Bloodborne took me to an incredible journey. The atmosphere, melee system, music, storyline are just state-of-art and one of a kind. Please issue 2 soon.. This game pushed me to the very limits and a few times even made me rethink about gaming in whole and if I want to pick up a controller ever again. But after beating the game, I was the happiest man alive, such an amazing feeling!. Trust me when I say this DLC is undoubtedly one of the best DLC's in gaming-history. A true masterpiece in every way. If you love Bloodborne or the Souls-Series you will love this the most!. Legendary game, play it, this game changed my life for good, all I have for this game is LOVE.. Any reason to play more BB is good jumping back in was exilirating and this dlc has what i think is the hardest boss in the soulsborne games. Excellent DLC, excellent and quite interesting locations, bosses are not worse, and many are even better than bosses of the main game. Wonderful musical accompaniment, which only cost the soundtrack in the battle with Lady Mary and Ludwig. Added a huge amount of new weapons, which makes the game even more diverse. Must have. A bit harder then the main game so I enjoyed playing it. New (old) locations are huge and they just look beautiful. Booses are absolutely amazing and soundtrack... ohh Praise the SUNdtrack ! PS. It definitely is not DLC... IT IS FCKING HUGE DATADISC !!!. Just as good, if not better, than the main game. Just another reason to keep playing.. give 9 beacuse two boss you cant win myself.This make us bad.Every time yu need help.this negaive score.atmospere very **** difficulty very very high this reducing game quality some where.... This DLC blew me away. The new boss fights are very memorable and challenging, the new areas feel very original and add new colours to this adventure, the weapons are innovative and the lore has gotten me so much more interested. This is how you master a DLC, even though I finished it, I can't wait to explore more of anything like this. Very few companies are still ethical with their content like From Software that shows us an unforgettable adventure and as gamers, we should express our appreciation and get more companies to follow suit. If you look at how I review games, you will see that The Old Hunters has earned the 10. Let's Play!. The Old Hunters is Bloodborne's excellent expansion/DLC. The Old Hunters is a lore-focused expansion which (sort of) explains the backstory of Bloodborne's Lovecraftian plot. There is a great story here, too, but once again it's buried in some item description screens, which is my only real gripe against the SoulsBorne series. There are a few cut scenes but these don't help the player understand what's actually going on. Plus in order to access the expansion you have to meet some requirements in the main Bloodborne game. But enough with my few gripes, because everything else is amazing. First of all The Old Hunters is tougher than the main game, especially in its beginning area. You have to defeat many minions and hunters like yourself, as well as powerful giants who are more like mini bosses. Regarding boss fights, try and defeat Ludwig solo, hah! But after that initial beating, players should have gotten used to the expansion's increased difficulty. Furthermore, all but one of the 16 new weapons and firearms can be found in the environment. No need to buy them from the messenger shop like in the main game. Highlights include the Holy Moonlight Sword and Rakuyo. This expansion actually has more cool weapons than the main game. Last but not least, the soundtrack is still amazing. The new music is a perfect fit for the game and along with the graphical style gives it a unique atmosphere. The theme of the Ludwig boss fight is a highlight. You can't go wrong with The Old Hunters, it's essential for every Bloodborne player. It's one of the best expansions in modern gaming, a far cry from the average DLCs which often feel boring and unnecessary.. Another stunning entry into FROM's catalog of amazing games, or in this case DLCs. The Old Hunters takes the player back in time, not unlike Dark Souls' Artorias of the Abyss, into the Hunter's Nightmare. Aesthetically the areas in the DLC are amazing, they are detailed and varied from the main game and each other. Enemies are very, very unforgiving, you will frequently encounter Blood Drunk Hunters through-out the DLC and they will hand you your a** if you are not equipped or experienced enough to deal with them. There are some environments from the first game which are clearly re-used, but the way they are incorporated into the game is perfect. The DLC has a couple of excellent clothing sets, plenty of new weapons, a new (and helpful) Covenant, which has links to the maingame, and 5 thoroughly (1 hidden, 4 compulsory) awesome bosses, including probably my favourite SoulsBourne boss, Lady Maria, of the Astral Clocktower. I case you can't tell already I loved this DLC and its an excellent add-on to the main game, both in gameplay and lore. If you haven't played through this and enjoyed the main game you owe it to yourself to take on The Old Hunters at least once. This is one of the dlc's in this time of gaming that are actually worth it. Once again, we find ourself in Yharnam. However, the world looks twisted. The buildings are slant and a lot of the roads and houses doesn't seem to make any sense. The world still look beautiful just in it's own way. The dlc added a lot of new weapons to use. A lot of unanswered questions about the lore/story of Bloodborne was also answered. We learned much more about Laurence, Gehrman and Ludwig for example. Also came some of the best boss fights I have ever played. There was a story behind them, they had an awesome scenario and they were lovely tough. If you like Bloodborne this is a must buy.. how is it possible that they made a perfect game better? How did they do it? This is one of the most amazing gaming experiences I've ever had and when I finished this DLC I was honestly sad that it was over. Anyone that calls **** must play this, this is absolute perfection and you're missing out.. A great addition to a great game. Spectacular scenery and types of enemies, a lot of new and interesting weapons, non-obvious secrets. I want to highlight the powerful bosses who transformirovalsya during the battle. Recommend! Waiting For Bloodborne 2! Hurry). Bloodborne is awesome, this DLC is event better. Great and hardest boss fights (except chalices), new locations at highest design level and much more like equipment, tools, events etc.. It's rare to see a DLC this good. Many awesome new weapons and amazing bossfights. A worthy end for Bloodborne. You have to buy this if you liked Bloodborne.. Miyazaki's Magnum Opus. Featuring the best levels and the best bosses in Bloodborne, The Old Hunters is without a doubt the best DLC of the souls DLCs. The 3 levels are brilliantly designed, the bosses are brutal with 3 strong contenders for being in the top 10 best bosses in the series, the weapons are badass and you even get answers to several lore plot-holes. What more could you want? The only reason it does not get a perfect score is because 2 of the 5 bosses (Laurence and Living failures) were borderline bad. However, The Old Hunters is damn near perfect, and in my opinion on par with the first half of the original Dark Souls, which is quite the feat.. The Old Hunters expansion is one of the best expansions Fromsoft has ever made. It is easily on par (if not better) with Artorias of the Abyss, The music score is phenomenal and mesmerizing, some of the best souls series bosses are found in this game, the new areas are visually stunning and creepy to look at, the lore expands gives more thought for players that embrace the Bloodborne world entirely. The new weapons are spectacular and feel really viable for different builds and runs. The enemy variety is substantial enough to feel good and not lacking too much. There are a couple reasons I cannot give TOH a 10/10: 1) Despite some of the best bosses being apart of this, there is a couple that are not so clever or well thought out, leading to a few frustrating moments as a result. 2) There are a couple of enemy types that are reused, but others that are so strong and powerful that they can serve as unofficial mini-bosses because of this, making them tedious if you are not on point with them. That's really it though. There is a alot great things this expansion has done for fans and even in a critical eye, it stands on a positive scale very well. It also serves the notion that quality beats length; it might seem short, but the content presented is grand and strong. As mentioned, this easily stands among From's best dlc work ever made.. The greatest expansion of all time, to go with the greatest game of all time. Miyazaki-san, I don't know how you managed to outdo yourself when you already reached a height of excellence I did not think was possible and then you go and create the best DLC **** you add one of the most significant story revelations ever to one of the most complex and expertly written Lovecraftian horror in a Victorian setting ever. Praise Miyazaki and praise Mother Kos for this give us eyes so that we may see. We are born of the blood, made men by the blood, undone by the **** eyes have yet to open, FEAR THE OLD BLOOD. More awesome weapons, bosses, enemies and difficulty. In short more Bloodborne! If you didn't like Bloodborne to start this isn't going to change your mind. But if you are like me and love Blooborne this expansion lives up to the standards of the main game with some of the most brutally difficult, but thrilling boss fights yet. The weapons they added are all pretty damn great as well! It also served as a tool to get me leveled enough to finish some of the optional chalice dungeons from the main game.. Greatest DLC content. Probably in the same league as the Witcher 3 DLCs in quality, but not in length. Going into this as in NG+++ made the difficulty a bit weird. Most people had trouble with Orphan but I had most trouble with Laur___. 4 of the 5 bosses were extremely memorable in their own way, and while the size of the content limits the level design creativity, it still offered many little secrets and rewards. The DLC further consolidates my belief of Bloodborne being the best PS4 exclusive pre-2017.. One of the best DLCs i' ve played from one of the best games i've played Many exciting boss fights and escenaries pushing the story even more to its bloody origins. Loved every corner of it. Terrific game play, though can be too difficult sometime, Marvelous map design, Varied enemies and bosses, Tens of weapons, several ways of fighting, These all make it the best game I've ever played.. How do you make Bloodborne better than it already was? Give it a good 5 or so hours worth of DLC is how. The Old Hunters offer new areas, new enemies, new weapons, new clothes, new items and new bosses in order to properly test the hunters who have braved the main story. This is DLC done right, and for 15 bucks, it'll take you far. Much farther than most story add-ons these days. The new environments are sprawling and beautifully designed on top of being downright treacherous. You get three new areas that are massive with much to uncover, and exploring these areas feels new and fresh, even for the seasoned hunter who knows the streets of Yharnam like the back of his hand. The new weapons are a welcome addition, as well. The most eccentric of trick weapons are found here, from a double edged blade that splits into a sword and dagger to a curved sword that transforms into a bow to a massive mace that uses your own blood for spikes. More styles of play open up to you from the new weapons offered here. Additionally, new spell items are available, so arcane builds have something to rejoice about, too. The new clothes will help you with your fashion even more, providing some sick new threads that's sure to impress any beastly monstrosity or malicious invader, because as we all know, armor is used only for Fashionborne. The new bosses are... well, they'll stomp you. Make no mistake, this DLC presents the hardest challenge any hunter can face, even outside the bosses. Take them into account and you're in for a pretty tough slog. The bosses, however, as with all of From's masterworks, are eloquently designed to push you to your limits and test your meddle more than anything ever has before requiring you to be fast, aggressive and absolutely at your best, even moreso than the main game. They will test your patience, your skill, your wit and your perseverance more than any Soulsborne boss ever has before. Despite just being DLC, The Old Hunters does indeed have a story of its own that's tied in with the main plot. It's as incomprehensible and convoluted as the rest of it, so as much as I'd like to give a summary, the proper words to describe it seem to elude me. What it is, though, is compelling and mysterious, and you'll want to delve deeper into its world and see it to its end just as much as anything else from the series. Just look up VaatiVidya or something, he'll know what the f*** that weird mumbling dude with the creepy hole skull was about. Now for the nitpicks. Pretty big ones, at that, two of them. The NPC hunters in this DLC are absolutely ludicrous. Two particular encounters, to be precise. Though NPC hunters are all over in the DLC, these two encounters are particularly guilty of absolutely atrocious and unbalanced design. Ludicrous damage, infinite stamina, HP values bigger than a list of feminist's complaints. Just absolutely stupid and not fun to fight at all. Even NPCs should follow the rules the game sets, and these do NOT. They break the rules to an almost appalling degree and I absolutely hate them. The other, and everyone will know what I'm talking about, is the OTHER most unbalanced and ludicrous enemy in the game. The bipedal f***ing s*** whales in the Fishing Hamlet. What the flying flaming chicken mcnuggets was From THINKING when they designed this enemy? They're ludicrously overpowered, have a ridiculous moveset that can cross the entire map and stunlock you to death, and the ones with the anchors can go f*** themselves with it! They ****. EVERYONE hates them. And if you think you don't, trust me, you're mistaken. Those two points alone are so egregious that I'm taking a point off my score for the entire DLC. They're THAT bad. Other than those stupid two points, the DLC is perfect. It's big, it's challenging, it's engaging, and it adds onto what is already a masterpiece. From really did outdo themselves with The Old Hunters.. That DLC is amazing. Has amazing weapons, hard, satisfying boss fights and great lore. Better than vanilla game. If you liked the main game, you will love DLC.. I've only been playing this the last few weeks and it's the second best dlc I've played after Blood and Wine. Full of new bosses, weapons, areas etc. just more proof that dlc can be done right and adds to the game.. Old Hunters is a pretty solid expansion that adds more Bloodborne content and should be a must pick for all Bloodborne fans. On the other hand, I wasn't really blown away by it in a way I was with vanilla game, it doesn't really improve the base game, just adds more stuff, areas, few bosses and plays it quite safe. Bosses I feel are the strongest part, with again fantastic music and challenge, Lady Maria being my favourite, intensive and hard duel in a beautiful setting. From weapons I loved the new Moonlight sword which in combination with Loch shield and metal helm pushed me to create a really nice paladin character. On the other hand, i was not such a huge fan of new locations and the overall story left me a bit disappointed by the time I finished it. However, it made me go through entire Bloodborne again and refreshed my opinion that this game is just a total maste","ludwig is my all time favorite boss, boasting an extremely ugly exterior, yet swinging a pristine moonlight greatsword just like a true knight and hunter . ludwig is boasting an extremely ugly exterior, yet swinging a pristine moonlight greatsword just like a true knight and hunter ."
674.Hitman 3,"Absolutely astonishing masterpiece, bedrugingly inconsecutive apocalyptic gameplay, reinforsibly incoherent, unspeakably outrageous dislocations, unfavourably departemental albeit barely containing merely sympathetic coordination. Abruptly enfuriating sideshows, gorgeously intellectual, fearsome interlocutors engage correlating obsession. ngl som gud stuf goin right here 10/10 man. A great game series comes to n dignified end. I liked the game and the new location. Sadly there is still no real story. It is just a sandbox game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The concept is just a little bit outdated, but stands solid yet. I wish the whole plot would be more engaging and dramatic as well. Besides that, this is still a perfect sandbox with an insane amount of lovely details, I loved spending a ton of time there! Very rarely a great game of current time!. Incredibly replayable Also the freelancer mode was an INCREDIBLE amount of post-release content to be released completely for free There is almost nothing about this game that disappoints me, by far my favorite shooter of all time, does stealth perfectly. In general, the game is nice, but there are logic errorsexample: being able to easily kill someone from a distance with any kind of weapon reduces the difficulty of the game quite a lotbut I like hitman games, so I gave it an above average ratingalso, the Decals are very beautiful. If you like assasination games, you will be love in this part. Level design, npc behaviours, animations, tension all are so good in this game.. Missing german voice audio like in Hitman Absolution. For me, the last good Hitman. I would also prefer a Story instead of episodes.. Super fun game. Good stealth mechanics and I find my self killing a lot of people on the map since it's just too fun. Very good graphics too.. This game is wonderful, but after the release of Hitman 3, I can no longer play it in my Brazilian Portuguese language. Why? We have one of the best gamer markets.. I have played too much Hitman 3, but I love it! This game is seen as a funny kill everyone simulator, but is far from it. You could play that way in the game, without instinct, special unlocks, or knowlegde of how to play the game and it's still really fun. But the best way to play it, is the intended way which is as a stealth game. Seriously finding out how this game was intended to be played made me want to play it more. If you are someone who likes to speedrun games or parts in games play Hitman 3, If you played games like Golden Eye play hitman 3, or if you are anyone who enjoys Stealth or stealth like games at all play this game. That isn't to say that Hitman 3 is only for hardcore gamers, but Hardcore gamers will absolutely love the game. This game overall tho is fantastic. I love the physicis of everything. You can spend hours just playing around with the physics and finding cool or funny ways of completing objectives. I love the graphics. I don't like the sentiment that Realistic graphics make a game more fun, but this is a game that benefits from it. The game is legit gorgeous in every map. This game is funny. Yes it is trying to be somewhat serious, but it has aself aware video game form of funniness and weirdness. There's ridiculous and weirdly over the top delivery on lines, and you can take out targets and people with anything from a bananna or spaghetti to a smg or explosion. Additonally this could be counted as a fault, but as someone who loves this game there are SO MANY collectables. Escalation after escalation, contract after contract, and challenge after challenge. You could play this for a solid 2 years and still may not have all of the unlocks. With all that being said the game isn't all good. For starters the fact that you have to read the fine print to actually know which game you are buying is obnoxious to say the least. 2 of the best maps are locked behind a paywall of 20$ and made to look like it's worth it by throwing in a bunch of small bonus content. Gameplaywise the unlocks are a plus and minus. Most are fine and fun challenges to get items, but some are annoyingly teadous if you are actively trying to unlock something specific. Physics are solid 9/10, but sometimes the game does glitch out, which you see the more you play. Guards will see you behind walls, distractions don't always pan out with NPC RNG, texture glitches from not only the terrain, but the suits themselves, and balance issues from anything from the guards themselves to the items and unlocks. Thats a large thing the Hitman Community is actively upset about. IoI is so weird with updates and what they actively give time to. They don't release new maps, but will add items that are incredibly useful, that unfortunetaly get nerfed because they become a new speedrun meta. And there are more, but some would only be noticable by hardcore players. Again overall great! But has its fair share of issues.. Fun game, I love the amount of things that you can do, your only limit is your creativity. My only problem with this game is the fact that you have to be online to access basically anything.. Amazing game, I'm a fan of the franchise and this one is hands down the best one. Once finished, there are mods and custom missions made by fans that give the game thousands of hours of pure entertainment. Not a 10/10 because the hand to hand combat is not as good as it could be and not being able to dual wild pistols is a big mistake imo.... Gameplay is cool but the story is astoningishly bad even compared to the earlier entries which have a decent story at best. Hitman 3, the latest installment in IO Interactive's acclaimed series, masterfully refines the stealth mechanics that have defined the franchise while introducing new layers of depth and replayability. This game sets a new standard for the stealth genre, offering players a sophisticated and immersive experience that is both challenging and rewarding. Stealth Mechanics: A Perfect ExecutionAt the heart of Hitman 3 lies its unparalleled stealth gameplay. The game meticulously balances accessibility with complexity, ensuring that both newcomers and veterans of the series find something to love. The intuitive controls and refined AI make for a deeply engaging experience. Enemies react realistically to your actions, heightening the tension and satisfaction of each successful infiltration. Agent 47's arsenal of gadgets and disguises allows for a myriad of approaches to each mission. Whether you're blending in as a waiter to poison a target's drink or setting up a remote-controlled explosive to create a ""happy accident,"" the possibilities are nearly limitless. The level design further enhances these mechanics, with sprawling, intricately detailed environments that are ripe for exploration and experimentation. Endless Possibilities one of Hitman 3's greatest strengths is its replayability. Each level is a sandbox filled with countless opportunities and secrets waiting to be uncovered. The game encourages players to replay missions multiple times, offering different starting locations, disguises, and mission objectives that drastically alter the gameplay experience. This not only extends the game's longevity but also ensures that no two playthroughs are the **** ""Escalation Contracts"" add another layer of challenge and variety, progressively increasing in difficulty and complexity. Additionally, the ""Contracts Mode"" allows players to create and share their own custom missions, fostering a vibrant community and providing an endless stream of new content. For those seeking even more challenges, the ""Elusive Targets"" present time-limited missions that test your skills under high pressure, adding a thrilling edge to the game. In conclusion, Hitman 3 is a masterclass in stealth game design, offering a richly detailed world, sophisticated mechanics, and an astonishing level of replayability. The game's ability to provide a fresh and engaging experience with each playthrough is a testament to IO Interactive's craftsmanship. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer looking for an engrossing stealth adventure, Hitman 3 is an essential addition to your gaming library. With its perfect blend of innovation and refinement, Hitman 3 earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10.. One of the most creative games of all time. IOI should make more maps because each map in this game is soooo alive and gorgeus! Can't wait for Hitman 4!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The current World of Assassination package always contains Hitman 1 (2016) and this is about the Hitman 3 DLC package. The levels might have the best settings of the trilogy, but they are scaled down from the (almost too) grandiose levels of Hitman 2 and thus lacking in replay value. Some **** level plots felt unfinished, some levels felt great on the first playthrough and then lacking in subsequent ones, Mendoza's first impression stuns you for hours until you get to the second target where the Villa is little more than a shack, and the finale level is 1/10 garbage. Ambrose island was reusing assets, but fell flat on its face in the gameplay department. This is okay for one run, but nothing of the epicness of Hitman 2's Mumbai.. While not in any way revolutionarily different to it's two predecessors, it still has the roots that make the other two the games that they are. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.. just entertainment, not too different from the other hitman, can get repetitive. February 2024 and Hitman Freelancer doesn't save customisation in Hitmansion if you quit the game unless you launch a mission and finish it or ALT-F4 to desktop. Shame.. The best of the trilogy. Hitman 3 is an almost perfect game that improves upon the last two games. A game that will give you a real hitman experience with its unique looking and beautifully crafted maps. You can literally have fun by doing nothing and just wandering around the map. It has a great story that makes you think about how the story will take shape after each mission. The replayability part gains its true meaning with this game. Definitely one of the best stealth games ever, in my opinion. There's nothing more to say, this game is definitely a MUST PLAY, so go ahead.. I had a lot of fun with this game. You will not find this type of social stealth anywhere else. Agent 47 is a master of disguise and sabotage. Each mission has its own unique feel with a multitude of ways to get the job done. Locations are essentially stealth sandboxes. It's a lot more than just crouch walking, knocking out targets, and hiding bodies.. the game needs some optimization here and there, BUT apart from that the game is amazing. this is how true replayability should look like. the game is pretty boring ,you can not stealth kill your enemy without your gun , and one of the dumbest things about this game is that when enemies came near you , you can not draw your gun and shoot them , you have to fight with them by dealing with A , D buttons to knock them out , agent 47 walking animation is really bad , he walks like a robot , game has serious sync issue , when you turn on the V-sync due to lack of triple buffering game stutters and fps drops below 60 and when you use fast V-sync you will experience screen tearing , tearing issue persist even if use g-sync on your g-sync supporting monitor ,TAA does not implemented very well in this game and you still have aliased edges and to reduce aliasing you have to use one of the SSAA methods. The game is incredible; everything is almost perfect, from the missions and weapons to the targets and more. Highly recommended.. The best stealth game ever made in my opinion. Having Hitman, Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 along with Freelancer makes this one of the most content filled game ever made.. THERE ARE NO SPOİLERS! PREFACE: The final game of the long-established stealth game series, as well as the final trilogy, the reboot. In 2016, the series was rebooted under the name Hitman. In 2018, Hitman 2 came with almost exactly the same mechanics and visuals, and in 2021, this reboot made its final with Hitman 3. You can think of these 3 games as seasons of the series. Visually and mechanically the same games. Currently, 3 games are sold in a single package under the name World of Assassination. STORY: Our main character is agent 47, an experienced assassin. In this game, we can see that agent 47 is a truly experienced and master assassin. Some chapters touched upon this situation very well. But there's nothing well-crafted about Agent 47's personality. Classic is the same as previous games. There is neither an intriguing plot nor the characters written well. The side characters were not handled well. There are 6 main story chapters in the game, and they all last approximately 1 hour. So, like the previous 2 games, it contains a short story of 5-6 hours. I can't say that the game is a game that should be played for its story. There is a structure in which the story is used as a tool rather than a goal. You don't care about the story until the last 2 episodes anyway. It cannot be said that he is very good at presentation either. The story is told with cinematics at the beginning and end of the episode. GAMEPLAY: Let's come to the gameplay side, this is the most diverse and important point of the game. The main story of the game can be easily finished in 5 hours. But everyone can do this in different ways. If you want, you can play with everyone. If you want, you can progress by secretly killing them with your silencer, or you can finish off your targets by poisoning them. There are different ways like these. It is possible to kill targets in different ways from different places. By using many disguises and listening to the conversations of some NPCs, you can get in close to your target and kill them. Personally, I preferred to disguise myself and play secretly with my Silencer. On the gameplay side, its only mechanical rival seems to be MGS 5. But it is also a game with a more linear structure compared to MGS 5. It has not very big but layered areas. A single building often has many different locations. Thanks to this, the level designs have become much better. In my opinion, level designs are the most critical factor in stealth games. This is what makes Hitman 3 clearly superior to the 1st and 2nd games. They've really gone to the top in terms of level designs. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Artificial intelligence is again one of the most important aspects in stealth games. For example, in MGS 5, the artificial intelligence was amazing and this pushed you to different tactics. There is no such artificial intelligence in Hitman 3, but they are not brainless either. When you enter the enemy's line of sight, a short-term bar appears and if you run away before that time expires, you will not be caught, but they will search the area you appear in for a short time. Some enemy NPCs have a white dot on them, which means they know they are your enemies. When you change your disguise, that white spot can disappear. GRAPHİCS and OPTIMIZATION: I can say that it is very good in terms of graphics and optimization, especially when we look at the games that have been released recently. It is a very good game in terms of optimization and graphics. I remember getting around 150 FPS in the game with the RX 6700 XT. According to the tests, stable 60 FPS can be achieved with 1060 and Ultra. This is a really good value for a game that looks good released in 2021. But the game's RT optimization is extremely bad. When I turned on RT, my FPS value, which was 140-150, dropped to around 30-50 and I did not notice any visual difference. I do not recommend using RT in the game. LAST WORD: I think the game is the best game of the stealth genre right now. ""Can I buy it?"" If you ask, it is 197 TL in Microsoft Store. It can be used on PC. It also includes the 1st and 2nd games, so I think it's a pretty good price. If you like the stealth genre and have played and liked the previous Hitman games, I highly recommend it. If you don't like the previous games or the genre, you won't like this either. If you want to get into the genre or series, the first part of the game can be played for free under the name ""free starter pack"". You can play it and see if you like it. By the way, the game is also available on Game Pass. Those who have Game Pass or those who want to play games other than Game Pass can also play from there. In short, Hitman 3 is not a masterpiece, but it is a quality game that does what it does well. SCORE: 85/100. The perfect ending for the story of 47 adventures in a really good game that succeeds in everything it does. Good graphic, good maps, good shooting, good mission. A Must-Play for all lovers of Hitman Series. I love hitman and to me this is peak hitman. All the things great about hitman with continuous content, great modes, great graphics, and peak gameplay. Best hitman game of all time imo. an excellent ending to one of the best trilogies in the history of video games. worth playing. I am a long time fan of the series, all the way since Hitman 2 on GameCube. I played all three games of the new trilogy, and while I very much enjoyed them, the value of it was questionable. With Hitman 3 converting into Hitman World of Assassination by merging all of the maps from all three games and adding the new Freelancer mode as well as other additions, this is a MASSIVE value. The amount of maps that you receive is fantastic, especially with you getting the variety from all three games, so none of them feel like a waste. For example, the intro levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 were very small and felt like a wasted map in each individual game, but now with access to all of the maps, the change of speed of going from small maps to large maps adds awesome variety. The Freelancer mode isn’t perfect, there are a few bugs, but it adds a nice coat of paint to maps you’re already familiar with and encourages/forces you to explore new areas and look at levels differently. Definitely adds more content to a game already bursting at the seams with content. One critique is the extremely confusing DLC catalogue, it’s hard to tell what you get with each package, and I believe that might be by design. Regarding the game itself, the maps are fantastic. They feel more alive than any of the previous games, and it is really starting to feel like an actualized vision that the earlier Hitman games tried to create. Some of the maps are absolutely brilliant, specifically the race in Miami, the level in suburbia, and the “who did it” style mystery mansion. Mix those fresh takes on Hitman with some extremely well executed hugely populated levels and more traditional Hitman espionage levels - this game has it all. The amount of detail and the stories that develop in each level makes it feel to just get lost in them exploring around. I like how one tip you overhear takes you into another direction, then you cross paths with your secondary target, so you change your game plan again. It’s great. With that said, the jank that we have learned to embrace in previous Hitman games is still here - the sometimes overly scripted AI, the NPCs that feel like a living crowd but completely soulless individuals, the randomness of the AI that bounces between brick stupid and ignoring you killing someone right in front of them to being super sleuth investigators that will investigate all the right places at the right times, etc. It’s not perfect, but it’s absolutely the best attempt at the classic Hitman formula, though nowhere near revolutionary. Fans of the series will be extremely satisfied. The graphics are excellent, especially in the amount of detail in the maps, although it looks a lot less polished in other areas, such as the character designs. The sound design is great, although the thriller movie background music on loop gets a little old. The story is somewhere between a great overarching theme to uninspired. It adds a cool theme of feeling like you’re influencing what the global elite are doing to the world, and then it progressively narrows down to a cool look at Agent 47’s backstory, but there are so many cutscenes that are loaded with random characters that I don’t care about. I appreciate it for giving you the feeling that you’re just an assassin infiltrating the global elite, but at the end of the day, it’s good enough but still forgettable. Excellent game which will be a huge hit for fans, and an approachable experience for newcomers. Hitman World of Assassination is an incredible value.. Somehow it's fun, but dialogues and ""funny"" puns are straight from adult movies. XXX ones. Lately it's become greedy cash grab too. 40 hours of ""pretty fun"" though.. This series has absorbed all the best from the previous parts. The game has no alternatives, it is amazing. thank you ioi interactive for an unparalleled experience. A great game that is worth full price. I wish they were not taking a break for hitman games. The stealth, locations, variability are awesome. Definitely one of my favorite games, but the script is just a placeholder.. Hitman 3 is a great game. If you want to unlock everything, you need to put a lot of time into it. Very satisfying.. Great game. The story is decent. The scoring is great, visual is really amazing, the voice & sound is also amazing. Based on the gameplay, graphics, sound, content, and originality of the game, I will give it a rating of 5.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 75 IIIIIIIIII====================. hitman 3 improve what hitman 1 bring on and pushing graphics of this hitman series. still cant escape to feel 2016 game dlc maps feelings.. I bought this game on Steam and it was quite expensive, so I'm not one hundred percent sure if its worth the cash. But the game itself is fairly decent even if the graphics probably are a little outdated. The non linear gameplay in the Hitman series will always keep me coming back.. Very good game. Really good optimization and great levels. Especially the 2nd one.. The Hitman trilogy is amazing. but the only new thing for each game is the new maps. reskin of old weapons and some bad suits with gloves. would have love to seen more weapons like revolvers etc.. Hitman 3 is a masterpiece, unrivaled in the modern game development landscape. From the insanely good soundtrack to it's implementation, which I think is even better than Doom's, the game is littered with ambience. For example the boxes rattling from the thumping of the bass in Berlin is something I have never seen done before. the Graphics are mesmerizing. I was in pure awe when I saw the first level. Reflections have never looked better. Pure quality.. What could be a great game ruined by ridiculous quirks that should be long gone by now. Very much a long time fan, a beautiful game, but, for the love of god there are some things that are so unforgiveable. The settings are amazing, so much detail, hidden little pieces all over the place. The story is brilliant, played out over 1, 2 and now 3 explaining, who 47 is, brilliant and I never saw some of it coming. The characters are fully fleshed out and the hits, brilliantly executed, BUT..... The AI, ye gods, when will IOI listen to what the players have been saying?, it's just so shonky, it's not funny. NPC's that see you through the tiniest of cracks, through solid walls, hear ""silent"" take downs and investigate simply ""because"", or spot you with no reflective surfaces while with their backs to you. This isn't as if this is something new either, players have been reporting for YEARS how bad the AI is on the NPC's and IOI have done exactly nothing. And now we have Freelancer mode. WTAF!!! Put all those bugs into an unforgiving layout, then jack the bugs up to 11. It's not even funny. You get halfway or three quarters of the way through a syndicate campaign, kill the target, and because there are decoys, they take the decoys to an exit, there is NO indication they are a threat to you, you try to exit, and they kill you, no warning, just dead and that's hours of work ruined because, if you die the campaign is reset and IOI are too lazy or too stupid, take your pick, to do their job properly. A great game ruined by slap dash programming. I had given a rating of 5, now dropped to 3. On Freelancer mode, if you die in normal mission you lose that map, take a hit on your money and lose your tools and weapons you took with you but not those you had at the safe house. If you get killed on a ""Leader"" mission you loose ALL tools even at the safe house, financial hit, keep the weapons at the safe house, and the campaign is reset to the start. Just killed on a regular mission, yet due to IOI's slap dash rush to use Freelancer mode to get more money, and releasing the update before it was ready, I got killed on a regular mission on the final level but got reset as if it were a Leader mission. I'd call IOI incompetent, but they don't even rate that well. They've become another Dev more interested in milking their game for every last penny they can out of their customers, then getting the game right. Just another bunch of morally bankrupt, self serving grifters. You want to earn some points back IOI, let us turn off the voice of that sanctimonious, arrogant patronising Diana, the last thing I need to hear after your shonky piece of software has just screwed me over for the umpteenth time is her voice prattling on.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Why I hate the video game Hitman 3. by tinyedge at work Oct 30, 2012 Tony didn't say ""it's the front of the car"". by tinyedge on Sep 19, 2012 For 3 years, Hitman has been in limbo for any updates. Some of them are just great tweaks to the visual design, while others are great additions to the game. This includes: weapons. Get Jackson out of your defenders. Fight as you know how. I've been playing for months, and today I'm finally a month away from the new game. Of course, there are new weapons and perks. But I have a lot of time to be free and have fun. Here are 5 things I could have done better. They are listed in no particular order, they are all good and can be found in the following order: * Weapons for all characters, even low level * Choose the light's color scheme and visual cues (you know, tell me if this particular blue smoke light is in a white van, etc.). * New theme song, good credits * More weapons per character with attachments to the weapons used * Weapon decay system (after losing all weapons. Really fun game. This game is not for you, if you do not care about your score. The intended way to play this game is too retry missions to get a better score. This is surprisingly fun as there are so many creative solutions to beating each level, you could sink dozens of hours in one level alone and still discover a new way to achieve your goal. Even if you just want to get a - star rating in every mission, this game is fun and gives you many options. Definitely worth it.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. I understand how people can like this game, I just didn't think it was fun.. This is my favourite hitman game, it is very unique to the other games, and it has a lot more on the story than the other hitman games. The only issue is that they did nothing to change up the formula, sure the maps in this game was the ebst they have ever made, but the story, and the gameplay was the same through 3 games, and because of that I am gonna have to put it a bit lower than I would have done otherwise. A great game series comes to n dignified end. I liked the game and the new location. Sadly there is still no real story. It is just a sandbox game.. hitman 2 better + ratio agent 47 looks like he's in his 20's combat is boring asf maps are too complicated. Good Game, but simply too few levels and variety. I don't want to play a level over and over again. Therefore -1 Points. I miss Hitman 2 Silent Assassin. A lot of missions, small levels and a great story, which fitted 47. Absolutely worth to try in trilogy. That was very fascinating game so far in the year. How long to beat: 15 - 20 hours of gameplay for main story, if you explore the map and want to achieve most of goals. After that, of course, many hours for achievement hunting. + Funny as always +/- More or less the same experience like Hitman 1 and 2. I mean they were fantastic games, but you won't receive a huge step forward with Hitman 3 - Some unrealistic things, like random arabian guards speaking perfect british-english. Not even british people speak perfect british english :D All in all 9/10 but considering the fact that it's a full price game and basically could also has been an add-on to Hitman 2, only 8/10.. I got the whole trilogy through Epic Games Store. The game is super fun with all its assassination challenges and cool settings. I have never played Hitman games before so I started from Hitman 1. It is convenient to be able to play all chapters from within Hitman 3. If you want game that makes you explore and think then this is the game for you.. One of the best games ever made. The level design, the atmosphere is amazing. There are no other games for comparison with this franchise. Enjoy.. Boring game of open stages and confusing a fool who wants to deceive a hundred people without sound and all his donkeys have only a good amount of graphics. Porsches that are all shapes from 1900 until now. I liked the game! A very epic ending. But it is a pity that in 3 parts almost nothing new. Part 3 differs from others in that there is a camera. But despite all the shortcomings, this is the best game about the killer.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 8.. Furious! last level of Hitman 3 is the absolute worst ending to any hitman so far and most games in general. unbelievably bad. there is 5 actual missions. that's $12 a level. absolutely not worth 60 dollars. this should have been a 3-5 level DLC. I wouldn't even pay $30 for it if I had a choice, just torrent it.. Not enough content to warrant full price. Love the Hitman formula and style but they're delving it out so stingily, that its only really worth getting at about $15. 4 real levels and virtually no story. Not sure how this was on so many game of the year lists when its more like an appetizer than a full game. Maybe wait for a complete edition and even get that on sale.. It¡s literally the best stealth game ever made. You have so many options and choices to kill your target. A lot of replayability and spectacular graphics.. I mean, I got free deluxe upgrade from steam ;), can't complain. I get that a lot of people are angry but it's an endless fun game.. (Note: this is for the Switch version) ""Hitman 3, when taken as the complete World of Assassination package, ranks as one of my favourite games of all time. It’s a masterclass in gaming that takes what made the originals so good and expands upon it, removing those clunky controls and making it feel so damn good. It’s a shame then that it’s spoiled by being a cloud game, and has all the issues you’d expect from that. If you are like me and have no other viable way of playing the game, I would recommend trying out the demo to see how well it runs on your connection. The game is certainly a masterpiece and all the additional modes and custom contracts will ensure that hardcore fans have a lot of content to play. I’ve clocked in at over 100 hours and have barely scratched the surface of what’s on offer. I can easily see myself hitting 1000 hours before hitting the 100% mark. In fact, the only reason the game doesn’t score higher in terms of value is simply because I just don’t own the game. I’ll have put in all this work, and then one day IO Interactive will take it all aw","the freelancer mode was an INCREDIBLE amount of post-release content to be released completely for free . the game is by far my favorite shooter of all time, does stealth perfectly . after the release of hitman 3, i can no longer play it in my Brazilian Portuguese language ."
675.Persona 3 Reload,"While I have immense respect for Persona 3 for being the title that started the Persona series as we know it today, the game for me is the weakest between persona 4 and 5. I know the intention was to do a faithful recreation of the original, but if that’s all they wanted to do they could have just released an original game with scaled up graphics. The fact that they remade the entire game means that there is at least some attempt to update it for modern audiences and I feel like reload is in this awkward middle ground that is unsatisfying. Gameplay wise, it adds a few things that was not present in the original (such as being able to control your allies) I feel like Altus did not go far enough in making adjustments that would improve the experience. For one there are no abilities from ranking up social links like they had introduced in P5. This introduced another level of strategy to how you decided to allocate your time and was a great addition to the formula. There is also a lack of activities to do at night. There are 2 social links available at night and you can go through them pretty quickly. All that’s left is increasing your social stats or hanging out with your party members in little activities. The problem is that this isn’t enough to sustain the full year and soon you are left with nothing to do other than going to the dungeon. But for me, the real draw of the Persona games is the characters and story and again I find P3 to be quite weak in this area.Again, I appreciate that this was their first attempt at social links, but many of the stories are just not as compelling as the later entries. The main storyline is also tonally inconsistent. Persona always had a mix of goofiness and drama, but I feel like P3’s goofiness to be too goofy and the drama far too edgy and melodramatic that it is difficult for me to reconcile the two. This game wants me to accept that a robot was built to destroy Shadows and they made it look like a teenage girl. Then the robot was enrolled in a normal highschool. but also, one of the party member’s is so depressed about the death of their mother that they were planning on killing someone in revenge before killing themselves because they have nothing else to live for. Coupled that with the the young ages of these characters and it just feels to absurd to be taken seriously. I would only recommend this game to either people who have nostalgia for P3 or people who are curious about the origins on the current Persona formula. Other than that, I would stick with P4 or P5.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game could be a 25-30 hours packed and tight experience with no fills whatsoever.... Instead it is a 70-80 hours slog that's stretched far beyond its lifespan (by the way the DLC is another 30 hours of NOTHING). I absolutely love Persona, it's one of my favorite JRPG series of all time, and I have to thank Persona 3 for this, because it changed Persona forever. This game is like an amazing prototype for the next games following after it, it was ahead of its time when it came out, with the calendar system and the social links that make you feel like you're part of its world, you go outside with your friends, do random activities and things like that, playing a Persona game genuinely feels like you're living a 2nd life and I love it. Can't forget the gorgeous aesthetic and unique art-style, the menus look so pretty, and the soundtrack is fantastic as well. As for the gameplay, it's awesome, and compared its original counterpart, it has been reworked for the better, in the original game you can't control your party members, and the fatigue system made it so you can't go to Tartarus whenever you want, while in this version of the game, you can finally control your party members, and the fatigue system got removed. Tartarus isn't perfect though, it's definitely improved, I like how every block looks different, and the monad doors gave me a decent challenge, but there were times where grinding felt like a slog, that's why I much prefer the different dungeons of the later games. Another issue I have is the pacing, it's painfully slow, there's not much happening in the story for the first 30 hours, and the lack of side activities makes the overworld feel empty. The social links aren't very memorable either, I found most of them to be underwhelming to be honest. Having said all that, Persona 3 is objectively the weakest modern Persona game because it has the most flaws, but at times it's also the best one. It really takes a long time for the story and the characters to get good, in fact the characters aren't likeable in the beginning, but they slowly develop and learn from their mistakes, they're realistic and act like normal humans and I really came to appreciate them more by the end. The story itself gets so much better later on, I'd go as far as to say that it becomes the best story in the series, the dialogue is so well written, and I love the message, that death is inevitable and you have to find a meaning to live your life to the fullest, it's so impactful and inspiring, that ending **** me in the guts so hard, and it's going to stick with me for a very, very long time... Final Rating: ""Excellent"" ~ 9.5/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While it's mostly been redone to fit the mold of the recent persona 5, this remake still manages to keep the spirit and vision of the original that made it a all time classic alive through a stylish new coat of paint, and frankly I don't on't think there is much more you can ask for without coming as nitpicky.. Great Game, Loved the story, the combat the music in the game is also so good, characters are fleshed out and don't feel like empty npcs, alot to do also in this game. Deserves a 10/10. [strong 9 - perfect 10] this is my first time playing anything from the persona series, and i am anything but disappointed. persona 3 reload has beautiful graphics and one of the greatest storylines of any game i have ever played. just press play. trust me.. A game that very highly deserved a remake, finally gets it and is one of the best games ever made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this is my current comfort game right now, my only issue is its age is showing in terms of gameplay systems but everything else feels amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I was one of those people that got into Persona too late to appreciate what the original Persona 3 offered. I played FES on Xbox Game Pass (at least, I think it was the FES version... it's delisted now) and decided it would probably be better experienced through the remake, which would be out two months afterwards. The facelift of the game is absolutely INCREDIBLE (the extra inch of chin all of the character portraits got made them a lot prettier to look at). The game looks so beautiful, and while it takes after Persona 5's design philosophy, it still retains a lot of its own character. The fully voice acted confidants went a LONG way, and while there are certain tracks that I feel aren't as good as in the originals (mass destruction), the English lyrics and clarity are much improved, and the additional tracks it added are great as well. The gameplay improvements were welcome to me as well, despite going against the original vision for the characters acting independently, the system is a lot better functionally than relying on AI to do it. The imported mechanics from Persona 5 are welcome as well, making the gameplay feel familiar and fun. Not to mention, the addition of Theurgy was really flashy and fun. I know this makes the game simpler, as Persona as a series isn't exactly renowned for its difficulty, but the optional Joker and Elizabeth battles arguably makes up for that for anybody that is itching for a challenge. The Team Design of Persona 3 was already very good and balanced, and there weren't those characters that ALWAYS stayed in rotation because of the nature and design of the bosses (okay, fine, Yukari stayed in the entire time, but that's it). That being said, I have some issues with the game as well, having played Persona 5 Royal 3 times before even starting my Persona 3 Reload playthrough. Firstly, the game starts off excruciatingly slow. It took nearly 12 hours for the game to start grabbing my attention, which is the biggest pet peeve of mine for any game. Persona always takes its time, but I think 3 drags it out the most for me. Similarly, experiencing Tartarus for the first time was really boring to me, not only because I experienced Persona 5's Mementos, but also because the 260-something floors of Tartarus weren't interesting. If this was any other game, I would have probably dropped it and left a bad review, but I stuck around because I was invested in the mystery. Persona 3 being an older-feeling game was to be expected, and it's easy to just say ""focus on the story because this is the best one in the series."" Yes, I believe that it's really hard to find a game that envelopes its themes of its story so nicely throughout the game, and it has one of the strongest uses of symbolism in the entire series. However, I also can't ignore the journey I took as a player to get there and the slog that is Tartarus, the small and cramped world that wasn't really made for free-roaming the same way Persona 5 is, and some of my least favorite Social Links in the modern trilogy. Seriously, I absolutely hated going through the Suemitsu, Tomochika, Hiraga, and Tanaka Social Links. I will say that Persona 3 has some of my favorite S-Links as well, like Maiko, the Old Couple, Bebe, and Kamiki, and it's solid overall, but I'm just saying there were more than a few stinkers and mediocre ones. Gameplay features in later games like abilities tied to Social Links in Persona 4 and the Persona capturing mechanic from Persona 5 were sorely missed. I just felt like these are key things that Metaphor: ReFatazio and Persona 5 spoiled me on. When all is said and done, though, these were things that I was more than willing to put up with for over 70 hours, and it's a game that I am considering playing again to Max out the compendium, witness the alternate ending for Chidori (I forgot to buy flowers), and max out all the Social Links. And also, it has probably my favorite True Ending of all the Persona games as well. So yes, there was a lot that I didn't enjoy doing that much, but it also has some of the greatest moments I have experienced in gaming, so I am super conflicted on this one. Definitely a worthy remake, though.. First game I'm reviewing here so: emotional rollercoaster. That perfectly sums up this game. From start to finish I was immeresed in living the school life and fighting shadows during the night. A perfect remake(they've recently announced the missing dlc!) that I must recommend to anyone wanting a great story, engaing combat and attention to details. After finishing it I've felt empty. The same feeling accompanied me after concluding Mass Effect 2, The Witcher 3, Gothic 2, Read Dead Rdemption 2 or Persona 5 Royal. That's a feeling reserved for only the best games.... Persona 3 Reload is a significant remake of the beloved 2006 RPG, bringing major visual and gameplay improvements while staying true to the original. The game adopts Persona 5’s sleek style, with refined character models and an updated soundtrack that elevates the experience. Combat has been streamlined with a Shift mechanic, allowing for faster, more strategic turns. The addition of Theurgy skills gives each character unique abilities that enhance the tactical depth. Despite a few omissions, Reload remains a top-tier RPG, and is arguably the definitive version of Persona 3. Persona 3, but with beautiful graphics. What could possibly go wrong? Well, nothing! However, there are minor mistakes I will get to. Now, let’s talk about the good. Persona 3 Reload basically remains the same as the original when it comes to the story, adding some new cutscenes, that sadly do not expand the overall plot at all and new Link episodes, which, on the other hand, were a really good addition, as it expanded the backstories and motives of your party members and gave more depth to them. The gameplay was massively improved, making me excited every time I went to Tartarus, as the gameplay loop was extremely addicting and with the new cool animations and newly added Theurgies, working as an ultimate attack for each member, I would get stuck for hours every single moment I visited the Dark Hour. The issues I have were quite major for me. For starters, the biggest part of Persona games, being the social links, were extremely weak in this game. Apart from a few of them, the majority felt like a chore. They felt like it was one proper conversation spread to ten interactions. I played on the hardest difficulty, Merciless, and the combat felt very challenging at first, however, the moment you get Theurgies, the difficulty drops massively, as you can obtain buffs and sweep through enemies easily, making bosses the only fun encounter in the game. Speaking of bosses, the final “boss rush” was a joke. In the original, where I played on hard and had overleveled personas, I struggled for hours and they felt like a real challenge. Two out of the three final bosses in Reload were swept by my party in one turn, leaving me dissapointed. Apart from the weaker social links and the weird difficulty scaling, I believe this is a great game for both Persona 3 veterans and newcomers. The game, in terms of content, is almost the same as the original and that is for the good and for the bad. Time played: 70 hours (100% completion) Difficulty: Merciless Pros: - Great story - Fun gameplay loop - stunning visuals and soundtrack Cons: - weird difficulty scaling - weaker social links. Thanks atlus for this great remake I knew about persona 3 and P3fes but i never tried it before know i am playing P3R and enjoying it so much. Going back and experiencing a core title in Persona history was a great experience. The music is funky, the characters are above average, the story is interesting enough. You run into a lot of the same style of enemies in the last 1/3, but the ending was satisfying. I like these games because of the limited time in-game. You can only do so much before the game ends, meaning its re-playable.. really loved the story of this game - the last 5 or so hours i was battling tears the whole time. the only downside to this game is the gameplay - it's not as good in comparison to persona 5, which is expected, given P3 is an older game. would still highly recommend this game to anyone.. This remake of P3 was a love letter to fans, from new ui and battle mechanics added from Persona 5 Royal, to new music and a significantly better way to experience Persona 3. The new voice cast is phenomenal, and the new story content adds so much to the characters I've loved for the past few years.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. THE BEST persona game out there with THE WORST ending I have ever seen in a video game. Honestly, pathetic.. Absolutely love this game. As someone who came into the persona series from Persona 5, I am floored by the plot for this game. Finding out that the developers remake the game to have closer style to persona 5 makes it a lot more enjoyable for me. The plot and pacing could be a little more tighter but overall I still enjoyed this game tremendously. The DLC is a must for anyone who enjoyed this game because it happens after the main game and it give a very nice closure to the plot. Have I mentioned what a banger the OST is? I love it and have been listening to it since I finished the game.. The story and the original system are unquestionably interesting. Definitely a buy for Atlus and Persona fans. The second half of the game was a bit hard to work through, but there is no doubt that it is a masterpiece.. This game insanely good. It has a deep lesson about the meaning of life, friendship and acceptance of losses. I've never played a game that made me feel the way I did playing Persona 3 Reload. I strongly recommend it. The ending was most bittersweet experience of my entire life: at the same time, I felt sad, almost crying, and happy.. The newly best Persona game has arrived with a full remake. Everything about this is an improvement and easily wins anyone over as the best Persona game hands down. The graphics are amazing, the social links are mostly amazing, and the combat is at its best here. This was a beautifully crafted 90s styled game yet has a modern touch which doesn't detract from the setting and atmosphere. Almost a perfect game but some of the characters and plot feels a bit off at times. Other than that, this is the best it gets and is proof of why this is my favorite Persona!. KIMI WA NE TASHIKA NI ANO TOKI WATASHI NO SOBA NI ITA ITSUDATTE ITSUDATTE ITSUDATTE SUGU YOKO DE WARATTEITA **** MO!!! TORIMODOSU!! KIMI WO I WILL NEEEEEEEEEVER LEEEEEEAVE YOU!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Persona 3 Reload doesn't live up to the original, and some features present in the original are missing, such as the ability to equip the protagonist with different categories of weapons other than the one hand sword. This feels more like a cash grab for series newcomers who may be interested in some of the series' classics, those who started playing Atlus games with Persona 5, but even then I'd recommend you to emulate the PS2 Persona 3 FES rather than buying this.. Visually appealing, a nice overhaul on all of the aspects that made Persona 3 special, the soundtrack, characters, plot, and development, is neatly put in place, earning it as a masterful remake. The large appeal of the game has always been playing a school simulator while at the same time, going through an RPG with a well-put fighting system. By far the biggest appeal that makes Persona 3 Reload stand out is the emotional impact it holds in comparison to other Persona games. It's darker in tone, more depressing things happen, it focuses a lot more on mortality and keeps up consistently for the majority of the game. Of course, it still has comic reliefs to pair up with the protagonist, but even they aren't bendable to the rules set in the world established by Persona 3 itself. It has been a nice experience for one that I grinded countless hours for and hoped it wouldn't end someday.. A phenomenal game with great visuals, a great story, and hours upon hours of content. It’s a beautiful remake to an already great game and improves on it on nearly all fronts.. I would say i prefer Persona 5 Royal to this but i absolutely love this game and is one of my favs this year.. What is a faithful remake of the original has become one of the best games of 2024. Atlus strikes again with fluid gameplay, great music, boss fights, and a great story. After 80 hours I can’t wait for Episode Aigis. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I still can't believe Atlus actually remastered persona 3, This game was quite outdated but now I can safely recommend everyone to play persona 3. PLAY PERSONA GAMES PEOPLE WE WANT ATLUS TO RELEASE PERSONA 6. Persona 3 is like Persona 5 and 4 a great example of delivering great storys bound with an engaging day system, which makes decions matter more and let you immerse more in the world. The Remake put in great efforts to improve the visuals and gameplay, based on Persona 5's approach and added a little bit of depth to the interactions, based on what I've learned, because there are many versions of Persona 3 ot there. For the story I have to say, that it is on a whole other level from most JRPG's of todays standard, very mature topics packaged in a school sim. While I really loved the story it takes many hours to get a move on, the first 50 hours in my 100 hour playthrough felt like a tutorial and the story did not really progress until later on in the story. Pros: -Very unique artstyle and detailed models for npc's and Personas + Shadows -The Soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard and definitely on the level of Persona 5 -The story is very moving (I even teared up a bit) -Almost the whole main cast and side characters have interesting designs and stories to tell -Choices you make during conversations get often rewarded by a unique dialogue line -Difficulty options are good in my opinion. I played on merciless and didn't have to grind at all, some enemies were just bullet spongier and made the fights more dynamic Cons: -The story is very slow to progress, it felt like a Turial until I've put in 50 hours minimum. In the begining there are more or less only trivial conversations and I can feel many players could drop it, if they don't feel rewarded for this long time -Confidants have that one annoying song that always plays when you interact with them, after a couple hours and completed ones I started to hate that song -For me it felt like most of the time you were not actually playing the game, but instead only reading a novel. The gameplay aspect took way to less time and you could always finish a Tartarus district in a day, so I was kept yearning for more actual fighting (This is fixed with the DLC if you are like me) -Another Problem was the size of the town for me, I know its based on a ps2 game, but still after a couple hours you can see Paulownia Mall in your dreams Most of the contra points are based on the fact that it is Remake of a Playstation2 and PsP game, but I still wanted to mention them. Still a banger **** and the ending definitely redeemed all the criticism I had.. This game helped me through a pretty hard time in my life and I’m thankful for that. Also though this game may have the worst dungeon out of the persona games, it makes up for it with some of the best characters and the best story in a persona game.. Phenomenal experience, you can tell it's a 2006 game though Gorgeous presentation, orgasmic music, stellar combat, amazing gameplay. What isn't good about this game in my eyes it is the best/my favourite game of all time the characters the story its just an emotional roller-coaster that I love to bits if you get the chance to play the game take it it is so worth it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Persona 3 reload has truly made a mark on how a remake **** should be made. Down from the visual to the musical aspects this game gets full marks. Depending on your difficulty the game can go from riveting to just a casual experience, this game makes you feel like your truly a part of the story. Persona 3 Reload is a phenomenal remake of the original Persona 3. While it does not have as much content as FES or Portable and Kotone Shiomi (FeMC from Portable) is exempt from this game, the game is amazing. The combat feels smooth and satisfying, the graphics look phenomenal for a Persona title, and the characters are likable. The story is also the best of the series and manages to conclude on a proper note compared to other games such as P5R, P5T and P4G. The game length is great. While it isn't unnecessarily short, the game's length feels perfect and even better than the original, which took a ridiculously large at least 95+ hours to complete on a single playthrough without going for every single individual mission/social link/rescue/item/persona/etc. This is easily one of the best remakes/remasters of 2024 and is easily for me, the game of the year of 2024.. I came into playing this after playing Persona 5 Royal and was unbelievably pleasantly surprised. While some parts of this game are a bit dated, for the most part, the plot and characters hold up very well. It may not be as fun **** as 5R, but it arguably has a much better story. With that being said there are a few changes I wish were added in this remake. Better Social Links - I like all of the characters in this game, but the confidence they have is very shallow. **** for instance could have been a great character because of her want to be more useful as a whole, but is unfortunately not utilized and is instead watered down and just made into her sometimes cooking meals for the dorm. That's kind of a common issue with the social links, especially the teammates. 90% of the teammate's social links revolve around eating ramen. There's not much dialog to be had which is unfortunate because all of the social links are fully voiced, unlike past games. With that being said while there can be problems with the game, there are also countless innovations and good things to say about it. Including: The soundtrack is amazing. Persona games always seem to have great soundtracks and this is no exception. The use of wind instruments and surprisingly good rap elements make for a great soundtrack. The Combat is as good as always. I love the use of Theurgy, and being able to unlock different theurgy effects for yourself and your team. The only real issue I have is shuffle time. I feel like shuffle time while sometimes good is often a bit outdated of an approach, and I feel 5 and 5R did it better with negotiations. Lastly, I was surprised to have enjoyed Tarturus as much as I did. I expected to get sick of the constant grindyness of it, but I was honestly surprised by how fresh it stayed. My only wish for it would be to make the dark hours have a bit more to them. The only dark hours I really enjoyed were the sleazy motel one and the spoiler bridge scene. These were both really great uses of the time, but they make me want all of them to be more like those.. The vibes, the music, the characters—it's like you're living your protagonist's life; it's really interesting. The combat is repetitive and basic, but it does the job.. A game with amazing music, fun gameplay, great story with extra things to do on the side, its almost perfect. Another fantastic game by atlus with dlc coming soon.. Graphics: 10 / Gameplay: 10 / Story: 10 / Lore/Soundtrack: 10 / Total: 10 = 10. I played Persona 3 Reload in 2024 and thought it was a great game that I loved. However, I dislike the DLC microtransactions in this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. By far best p3 experience,................................................... A faithful recreation of the original game in 2009, however, the game recreated both the good and the bad of the original. Community plots are mostly too short and some of them don't make any sense. The game has the best technical graphic feature in all Atlus games released, but the graphic is not polished enough. Mainline story is wonderful in atmosphere in the last month, however in the early part of the game, it is lack of flactuation. Dungeons are randomly generated so it's no fun clearing it, and newly designed demons in all these 15 years after the original comes out didn't appeared in this game, I hope we can see more SMT side demons in Persona.. Great game but they could have cut 20 hours out easily. Par for the course for Persona games though.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. persona 3 Reload and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are the most fun games I have played in 2024. Perfect I stopped playing ff16 ff7 rebirth and just continued playing this game.. ""Persona 3 Reload"" is a real gem that kept me glued to my PC for hours. Atlus took a classic and gave it new life, making this game an absolute must-play for JRPG fans and beyond.Right from the start, you can feel that we're dealing with a refreshed version of a classic. The graphics look great - the colors are vibrant, the character models are detailed, and the new animations add depth to familiar scenes. The music? Well, it's Persona, so as you might expect, the soundtrack is an absolute blast. The new arrangements of old songs stick in your mind, and the added tracks fit the game's atmosphere perfectly.Plot-wise, ""Persona 3 Reload"" maintains the same high level as the original. The story is exciting, full of plot twists and profound moments that will stay with me for a long time. The characters are brilliantly written, each of them has a unique personality, and their development during the game is pure pleasure. The relationships we build with our team members are key, and you really feel like your choices **** gameplay, while familiar from the original, has become more fluid and dynamic. The combat is more balanced, and the Persona fusion system is now more accessible and satisfying. Although the game is based on the classic solutions, a few new elements have been added that diversify the gameplay and prevent the game from becoming monotonous.However, it is not without its flaws. Despite the refresh, some mechanics could be refined even more. At times, the game can seem a bit outdated, especially for new players who do not have a sentimental attachment to the original. However, for those who appreciate a well-written story and a unique atmosphere, ""Persona 3 Reload"" is a game worth keeping on your radar.Overall, ""Persona 3 Reload"" is a great remake that pays homage to the original while bringing it into a new era. It is a must-have for fans of the series and anyone looking for a solid JRPG with soul. My rating? A well-deserved 9 out of 10!. Well that was a great game. Deals with some heavy topics though... kinda helped me going through tough times myself. I think if you're into rpg with a focus on story and characters you'll love it. I came from P5R as a first experience with the franchise, and ended up liking this one even more. Remake of the original 2007 game. It has improved a lot in terms of graphics and mechanics, but has censored parts =( Turn-based RPG (Pokemon style) with a lot of reading. I recommend it for RPG enjoyers and those who like shonen. Among Personas 3, 4 and 5, it is the least shonen. Since it is the newest in the series, it has improved a lot, but not enough. -- Pros: Identifiable characters. Good plot, Soundtrack. Offers an opportunity to relive high school. Offers a solid perspective on ethics and politics of how human relations should be. 0 bugs. The game's structure is very addictive and forces the player to plan their time in the game -- Cons: Very shonen. . There are choices, but about 70% of them are false. No matter what you choose, it will give the same result. The producer Atlus was lazy. The game is not complete ""Voiced"" out of laziness and to cut costs. If it were, it would be a better experience. Censorship (fear of showing/saying sex and death -- some characters die and turn into glitter instead of a corpse). Could make more portraits for NPCs.. Persona 3 Reload revitalizes the classic RPG with stunning visuals and enhanced gameplay mechanics. The dark, compelling story and rich character development remain as engaging as ever. While the updated features bring fresh life to the game, long-time fans will appreciate the faithful preservation of its core elements. A must-play for both new and returning players.. Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Graphics: 9/10 World: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall 10/10. Remake done properly. Atlus has done it again. If you never played Persona before, this is a good place to start as all the player-friendly elements are drawn-in from Persona 5 Royal to make the playthrough easier and much more enjoyable. The gameplay, animation, style, graphics, music, sound, characters, and story are all top-notch.. A solid jrpg That was good on ps2 and even better here due to having a somewhat more fleshed out story and a revamp battle system. It’s definitely an easier game than the older version so some might prefer the older version to the remake but other than that it’s worthy entry in the persona series, and solid remake of persona 3.. i don't know how to put in to words how happy i am that this turnBASED KINO has made a higher score on steam than final fantasy remake (95% p3r vs 89% remake (also known as demake or redditmake)). square enix will be forced to listen because another 10/10 has just wiped the floor with their en","reload is in this awkward middle ground that is unsatisfying . gameplay wise, it adds a few things that was not present in the original . it also adds a lack of activities to do at night ."
676.Injustice 2,"The story didn't interest me. The randomized loot online is annoying. The fighting is good & takes skill to master.. This game is an easy 10/10 in my book and by far one of the best fighting games ever and this is coming from a Dc comics fanboy. This game has everything you could want in a fighting game. great story, amazing graphics, amazing characters and gear sets chef's kiss I'm just hoping injustice 3 is as good as injustice 1 and 2 and nothing like mk1 that is probably the worse fighting game out to date. To be honest, I never actually played the game, but it really looks like a polished, perfectly balanced masterpiece of a fighting game, let alone a DC game. Nice job, Netherealm Studios, you made a good fighting game that isn't Mortal Kombat (even though Sub Zero and Raiden are both in this game as guest characters). I also like the game because of the guest characters. They're not as questionable or outright weird like 2019's Mortal Kombat 11, in fact, they're surprisingly good (I really love the addition of the TMNT in this game)!. Nice game, but a bit shallow, graphics just ok, the mechanichs are very good, frenetic combat. The plot is not that good but have good moments. Aside from a few continuity problems I have with this game, I do like how the story mode just ups the stakes in a feasible way. It's really nice to see how they build on the first game, and still set up fights with choices you make. Again it's a bit formulaic, but it fits well enough. The fighting has also been retooled a bit and feels less stiff compared to the first Injustice. I do wish there was some fun for the DLC characters to do something in the story or to simply have more characters in the story as a whole, but at least all the guest characters are fun to play with as well. I can't say the same for the loot box system they put in the game however, and it really makes me confused why such a thing exists, as it's largely for two modes that don't really do anything. Still it has a great trial mode, and a better tutorial for more advance techs then most fighting games. If you want to get into fighting games, Injustice 2 would be a good start.. Garbage story if you actually like comics. Fundamentally misunderstands the majority of character used in this story. The story is terrible no matter the medium in which is told. The story is also quite short too. Core gameplay is fun and customizing looks of heroes and battling favorite heroes is fun online. Play for the gameplay, not for the story.. Very good game. Personally, I don't play games of this genre, but considering the universe, I couldn't ignore it. I think that in such games, one of the most important elements that make the gameplay enjoyable is the graphics. This one is really at a good level. Comparing it to other graphics from this type of games, we see that Injustice is the best. I also like the diversity of the maps we play on. The combat is satisfying and fun. The plot, like the plot in this type of games, is not exciting, but it is enough. The online storylines, weapons, and characters are also very well done.. Taking in to consideration I hate the typical Hollywood cheese, this game really pulls it off. It is fun combat. Pretty much a variation of Mortal Kombat. The story mode **** on that sack of **** Batman film that somehow manages to loiter around the IMDB top 10 films. Injustice 2 works on every aspect. Fun to play, engaging story due to the fights integrated, good mechanics, good roster. I just tried a bit of the DLC today and the TMNT one is pretty good. Great that the story blurs the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Don't get me wrong, there's no depth to the story but it doesn't matter because the fighting brings the excitement. Again, think Mortal Kombat. For a while **** ton of franchises I can't stand, I really enjoy this game. Great fighter.. This is a pretty big step up from the previous injustice especially in terms of aesthetics, the game looks incredible and the dc characters have never looked better. Injustice 2 is a fantastic Mortal Kombat clone (even though it is made by Warner Bros too) with great gameplay, an amazing story, and overall beautiful graphics.. Good game, a little repetitive but OK. The single player story mode was great, really immersive and catchy.. Nice graphics runs at a stable 60fps , soooooo many customization it feels endless the combat is very good the story is not great but that's not why you buy the game for.. What a terrible game. I created a profile just to submit this. I understand what it is the free game of the month. The game does not keep up with your inputs, you try to string a special together and it uses the basic form instead. The only saving grace is the story, which is good for the hour you play it. Spend your money elsewhere.. (Story mode specifically) Injustice 2 is DC at its best, with complex and rich characters, fun game-play and a story that pushes different icons throughout DC history on paths that would almost never be explored for their characters. Game-play is adequate and feels really good when you find a knack for it. With a few minor issues such as the general overwhelming nature of the game-play for those not veteran to a fighting genre, an aggravating tutorial and the final boss being unnecessarily frustrating, injustice 2 is just short of reaching a 9. Would recommend for any fan of side-scroller fighting. Injustice 2 exceeds in every manner. It's better than its predecessor in every aspect.. Game is pretty fun. Gameplay is nice, visuals are too, and just from what I remember the OST was pretty good as well. To me though, the game didn't really feel all that fun though. The mechanics were very linear, and controls felt boring to me, at least IMO. Contrast this with a game like Blazblue, the controls feel a lot more free form, the companion system feels fun, and character moves are all really unique and fun to use. In a fighting game, I want uniqueness, and fun controls rather than something like this in my opinion.. Injustice 2 looks awesome but i think you should make a superman game just like injustice. This holds the title as my favorite Fighting and Superhero game ever. Graphics even for today are amazing. i love the superheroes and fun gameplay easy to learn and hard to master. The story is pretty trash tho and the gear system is very annoying but since i have hundreds of hours on this game i can't give this anything but a perfect score.. The Game was solid I really enjoyed The Returning The Characters such as Superman,Aquaman and Batman but The Character that steal the show in terms of Gameplay and Character are Supergirl and Doctor Fate also great Antagonist in Brainiac Voiced By Fantastically By Jeffrey Combs one the best voices since Corey Burton in JL And JLU it was interesting to see where the characters we at in terms of The Post Regime-Insurgency Conflict the gameplay was much-improved Love how it is Basically Mortal Kombat X but with DC Heroes Great Score By Christopher Drake(Batman:The Dark Knight ) and Development from Ed Boon(Mortal Kombat X) A Fantastic Sequel To The Injustice GAMU 10/10. Fun game, really hard to master, matchmaking is bad, always getting stomped.. Super fun, played for a while but it got a little repetitive. Really fun gameplay and a good selection of characters.. Great game amazing graphics and fighting mechanics and story. Improved better from the first Injustice game.. Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Good fighting game with a great story. Awful money grabber though. Could have been an 8 or a 9. I am knocking it down to 5 because unless you give them more money you better be able to sink at least 30 hours a week into this to unlock things.. Graphics 8/10 Playability 6/10 Entertainment 7/10 Overall 7/10 Fun also for causal players.. The best story for the fighting , gear , geraphic , i loved , story , story. Another barrier breaking game for me, it was hard to me to enjoy fighting games prior to the Injustice series, surprisingly including Mortal Kombat. That’s clearly changed now, but Injustice 2 holds a special place in my heart because of that. The story is really great (no shocker) DC is known for its amazing extended universe content. The graphics are still really damn good too. The game is a joy to play too, the fighting is extremely fluid and the sound design is spectacular. Please go experience this game so we can get an Injustice 3.. Worst fighting game ever made. People who give this game high scores are whst is wrong with the industry. The game is trash in everyway but you have all the fan boy$ loving mictotransactions coming out the a$$. want at least 40 of them. Can one fight much. U r becoming addicted to it. Characters are so cool but I want at least 40 of them.. this game is really really well made i didn't play the first one but i understood the story which is really good too the comparing it to mkx (which is a awesome game too btw) it feels way smooth and fast the combos require more precision and timing rather than mashing the buttons, the characters moves are so cool the super moves are super cool the new gear mechanic has it's pros and cons it allows you to fully customize and make your own character the cons is the slight pay to win mechanism there are these rich kids that spend hundreds on loot boxes to get the best gear possible and the casual games pairs you with anyone ready that means if you just getting started with 1k-2k in gear points it is very possible to pair you with someone with 7-9k if stats that can finish your entire bar with a combo the loot boxes really **** they should've been more creative with it like they recreated the towers from mk with the multiverse they could've easily added something else to replace the krypt (yes you can win motherboxes by leveling up or wining in the multiverse but it's so slow and very random like if i am maining batman i need gear for batman not other characters i never used (my main characters are black adam,batman and i rarely win any gear for them)) so yeah loot boxes really really **** this is not a mobile game i am paying full price fir the ultimate edition also i am not saying they should give away everything like that they should add a challenge system for every piece if gear or you can fond it in some other place like the krypt. so yeah to finish it iff the games is really good definitely don't buy the ultimate edition tho i bought it and i rarely use any dlc characters but if you're looking forward for a character from the dlc than you can buy it separately a a solid 8 for me.. Incredible music, incredible voice acting, incredible graphics, incredible gameplay, incredible story mode, incredible customization system and incredible character selection.. Shortly behind MK11 this game is one of the best beat‘m up which was ever made. Technically it is amazing to play this game in 4K HDR at 60 FPS, the textures and the stages are gorgeous. I was missing the story mode for every char like Tekken, so I left one point out of my score.. I get it on a promotional pack and what i say is... the game full of garbage... LUCKY BOX ? yes... they forgot de real fight and at the end the game become a garbage of full boxes that you put IA to play for you... because the armor system **** a lock... very sad, i love the injustice 1 but the second game is not good... i`m still stucked trying get one catwoman hability.... man.... these guys ruined MK11 and Injustice 2.... Brainiac very hard difficulty, more like very annoying my main reason I'm uninstalling same with mortal kombat, same with tekken. Do you creators not know how to make a fun difficulty where it doesn't have to be so challenging smfh.. So this game looks amazing. My big problem is the microtransactions.. The amount you have to grind to get cool gear is just bs. They want you to pay for them... Im never buying another Injustice game again.. This needs to stop.... A decent fighting game with annoying lootbox mechanic and a degree of universality between characters that makes learning their combos less satisfying compared to other titles.. One of the best fighting games I ever played. The story and gameplay are very superior than Injustice 1, the characters are awesome and the graphics too.. Injustice 2 is a great addition to its genre. While it is not the first fighter to introduce a gear system, it does it in a great way by allowing players to use it to their advantage offline, then giving the choice of playing with or without sets online. The roster has some marvelous additions and the developers deserve credit for continuing to support and balance the game post launch. If you enjoy DC Comics, or fighters, you need to add this title to your collection.. I'm not much of an fighting game kind of guy. This game however was just so much fun and a very good game. I enjoyed the campaign(Superman Ending) and of course the multiplayer. All the characters and guessing who they are was so much fun and this game was just so good I could not believe it.. Injustice 2 is an amazing game, especially for a fighting game. It is my favorite fighting game that has ever been released.. Solid gameplay, and interesting story that kept me playing. Online can get frustrating for how almost everyone has all max level heroes while I do not making matches uneven most of the time. But the game is still fun and more fun than Ive had with most fighting games out there.. While Injustice 2 might be the best Netherrealm game yet, at least from a technical standpoint, it also suffers the most from WB's scummy business practices. The core gameplay is still a ton of fun, if a little slow, and the campaign looks and feels great. The Multiverse, a refined version of MKX's Living Towers, is a great addition, and provides consistent PvE content when you don't feel like getting brutalized online. So what's the issue? Netherrealm Studios have churned out ten additional characters since the game's release, and you have to pay for ALL of them. Some of them are crazy good and can counter popular strategies, but if you don't fork over the dough to buy them, you're put at a disadvantage. This doesn't even factor in ""gear"", stat-altering cosmetics that unbalance casual play, or ""source crystals"" a premium currency used to change the color of your character's costume. Even those who waited for the full-priced edition that includes all the DLC characters have to deal with the economy of a mobile game, and it's depressing. It pains me to give this game such a mediocre score, but the core mechanics, as solid as they may be, are bogged down far too much by WB's penny-pinching. If you have to play it, I recommend you buy a used copy of the Legendary Edition to ensure you get the most complete experience without directly supporting these practices.. Great fighter selection. Great story Been a while since a fighting game pulled those out in a sequel. Story:8.3 Sounds:8 Graphics:8.7 Gameplay:9 Mechanics:10 Characters:8 Animations:9. I don't understand why this game got high score from reviewers. Sure the graphic looks great, many characters to play and story cinematic looks amazing but the combat itself is not good at all. I am veteran in fighting games, my favorite one is SFV, I would say Injustice 2 fail miserably in this area, and it is critical area. In short, Combat mechanic is very difficult to play. Instead of creating combo by yourself, you need to look at the list the devs provide, and you have to memorize and do just that. There are many combos for one character, but in the end, people will just spam 2-3 combo they are used to. If you try to mix and match by yourself, let say spam some button, your character will just pause itself. It was a bad design and if you look at the competitive esports, Injustice 2 is dying. Story is also not good. It is just a script that allows characters to fight each others. Many scenes are irrational. (stupid I would say). I only played for the sake of finishing it, that's all. In brief, Injustice 2 is only good for fans of superheroes. It has great animation but bad gameplay. If you are looking for a solid fighting game, I would recommend SFV, Tekken, Mortal Combat, or Dragon ball Z. Those games have stronger foundation. Injustice is only for those who just want to play as Batman or Superman and get through hero's story. Also, It is not suitable for casual or kids, because game mechanic requires you to remember combo, you can't button mash. You can't just grab controller and ready to go. The button sequence also has to be put in fast and in correct manner only. It is sad because the graphic looks so well, but gameplay and story are more important than graphic. I deduct 4 points from gameplay alone, 1 point from story so the final score is 5/10. Gameplay needs overhaul seriously. Don't buy this game for kids. It is not designed for kids, both gameplay and story.. After I had tried to get into Prey and it just wasn’t doing anything for me, I moved on and decided to finally sit down and play through the story of Injustice. I had played quite a bit online but I never took the time to sit down and play through the story of the game. I really enjoyed the story, it is a continuation of the first Injustice’s story. I really enjoy the story, I do wish the story of the game would be longer but it’s a fighting game so you can’t expect too much from the story mode. Whether you like the gameplay or not, this game needs to be the blueprint for all future fighting games. There needs to be content, when I think about everything in the game, there is so much I can do. I can go online, there is a well-written story, there is a tower system where you can fight AI, you can play locally. My favorite part of the entire game is the gear system where you can customize your favorite characters. You get the gear from playing the game, not to mention you also get loot boxes for playing the game. The game gives you so many loot boxes, it’s almost too much. Yes, you can pay real money for loot boxes but honestly, I don’t know why anyone would do that. Just play the game, you get gear, you get loot boxes and you can level your characters. In this day and age, the most important aspect of a multiplayer game is the net code. The netcode can make or break a game and for Injustice 2, the Netcode is near flawless. I have rarely had any laggy matches and there doesn’t appear to be any major input lag online. All in all, whether you’re into fighting games or not. This is a game that I highly recommend.. Injustice 2 is THE best fighting game ever made; in terms of story, gameplay, graphics, and characters.. If you enjoyed Injustice: Gods Among Us then you will love Injustice 2. The game packs an all new customisation system which has revolutionised the fighting game genre allowing you to upgrade and design your favourite heroes to your liking. The game's roster is flawless. There are no character who feel out of place and the game feels balanced. Every character has their place in the game and none of them feel out of place in any way. The gear system allows you to experiment with you favourite combos and try new characters. In addition, the game's story mode is very fun and compelling. In summary I'd say that Injustice 2 is a must have for fans of the fighting genre. Although the story was a lot more boring and poorly written than the last game, the game-play is just significantly better. I actually got a lot more play time because I was completely invested in the fighting. Fun multiplayer and decent RPG type mechanics.. 8.9/10, definitely one of the best fighting games of all time. DLC, multiverse, and online make this one of the best games of 2017.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GOOD GRAPHICS AND GOOD CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! cheap dlcs the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Completion: 100% story mode. Dabbled with multiverse. Pros: - Best story mode in a fighting game bar none. Great experience with solid narrative and exception cinematics. - Gear is fun and extremely varied in appearance and function. - Some of the best facial animation in the business - Fun battle system that is easy to pick up - although it does feel a bit limited after awhile - Flashy super moves, backgrounds, and animations are great for the flow of combat Cons: - Some characters look ugly and not what you would expect based on other depictions of them - Really not a lot to hook you after the relatively short story mode is over. While gear is fun to play around with, unless you plan on playing the game competitively (which I don't), there is not much else to do. Multiverse gets boring since there is no particular goal or end in sight. - Relatively simple compared to many other games in the genre - DLC characters in fighting games can really hurt the community - I don't want to pay more for extra characters than the actual game itself - Loading times are overly long - Projectile spam is a relatively big problem in this game Final Word: - Great experience that may be a bit skimpy for the price if you are a casual player - especially considering the high price of the DLC characters. True Score: 8.3. A more polished version of the first entry in the series with a less stellar story. The amount of polish in this game is breath taking, the MO Cap work and facial animations, stunning. This is keeping the trend of making story in fighting games matter. This one doesn't hit the mark as much for me, I like the new characters, but I felt like they popped up in the story just for the fun of it and didn't have much of a reason outside of just to be there. This happened more than once and I kind of scratched my head (when Hal Jordan shows up its basically out of thin air while you are in the streets...doesn't make a lot of sense.) Focusing on Brainiac as the pivotal plot point isn't as gut wrenching as Super Man going bad and Batman dealing with it, they get to that a bit more and there are some cool moments, but doesn't outshine the first game. The roster adds some nice new additions (Scarecrow and Blue Beetle among my favorite newbies) and all the redesigns seem to be better. The fighting is just as fluid, with some of the supers changing for the better and for worse. I think the unlocks became a little too over complicated for my liking, I like my skins and portraits and didn't care for the new loot boxes and equipment drops. On top of that it makes the changing of costumes much more tedious and unlocking items doesn't seem as straight forward. Fighting AI or a buddy is still lots of fun. The polish...woofta is it good. An enjoyable story, but not as good as the first. Padding out the collectibles when they could have added cooler skins=bummer. New roster added some duds in my eyes, but still a good line up of characters. 8/10. Injustice 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way. New characters, new interactions, and new fun to be had. It does lose some points from its sudden shift in tone, being a little more light hearted than Gods Among Us. And there's more DLC to be bought, which is never a good thing. Injustice 2 is another great fighter from NetherRealm Studios. In terms of the base game, I'd say that it slightly edges out its predecessor. I'm personally not a huge fan of fighting games, but Injustice 2 does a great job of making each character accessible and fun to use, though there will be some you're better at than others. Thankfully, the new gear system allows you to balance out that character's faults and make the character your own. I must say I enjoy that side of the game much more than I expected as someone that's normally not into gear or upgrading characters. The story was great, perhaps even better than the first Injustice, but I really do wish they'd make it slightly longer. I'm definitely in the minority on this, but the story's the part I was looking forward to most following the first game. That being said, it's really fun while it lasts! My main gripe with the game was the leveling up system, especially with how long it takes to level up. It almost seems like the game wants to restrict you to one character. Once you get to Level 20 on one character (which takes forever, unless you have a ton of time on your hands), all of the other characters will feel incredibly weak by comparison. If they made the leveling up system a little faster, I would have almost no problems with the game. The stages, acting, graphics, and presentation are all fantastic. If you enjoyed the first Injustice game, you should absolutely pick this up. I don't know if I can recommend it to anyone else other than fighting game or DC fans, but if you're thinking about it, you should definitely give it a chance. However, this is definitely the last time I buy a complete edition before the game releases because the DLC is utter garbage.. Got the game on sale. It's gorgeous and some fun for awhile. But man, it gets repetitive QUICKLY. You level up and win gear, but ALL you do is fight over and over again. I thought the story and leveling/gear would keep me interested, but it just doesn't. Just too little to do and so repetitive.. The amount of DLC they throw at you every time Netherrealm makes a fighting game is getting really old. Getting prompted to spend money after dropping $60 is disgusting.. Injustice 2 certainly isn't a bad fighter, but I definitely wouldn't consider it one of the best. The overall presentation is pretty good, and new additions like the gear system are fun & welcoming for casual players. However, the story does not live up to the original and the fighting mechanics are still odd/clunky. It's the kind of experience that casual players will be quick to forget and serious players will be apprehensive to adopt.. Game is 10/10 Why you may ask? is it the graphics? The gear? The story? The super moves? The ability to cancel combos? Nope non of those throw that in the garbage The reason it's 10/10 is you can be Batman kicking the **** out of a huge DC roster... Okay seriously Its a great game actually has a branching story, great character selection, Great modes multiverse is amazing. In my mind, Injustice 2 is the best fight game of 2017 and the best super hero(DC) fight games ever. Warner Bros made an excellent job on this game, It has nice graphics, a part 2 to Injustice 1 story, clean fight gameplay and this game is nostalgic, because you can play with your favorite heroes of DC Universe !. An alright fighting game but with way too many issues to recommend to anyone. The gear, which was a main selling point has been extremely poorly implemented. Even if you buy the Ultimate Edition they lock additional content behind a paywall (skins). They released a patch which has deleted a lot of the gear that people have worked for months to obtain. All while providing little to no information and support.. This game suffers same problems as other NRs games. Main issue is the blocking-system, with moving back being same as block. If your facing an enemy that uses projectiles, you want to move in on him - not move back. As he Shots projectiles - you wanna just block in that position. Close to impossible in this game, as blocking now is same move backward, turning the whole thing into a spam-projectiles and use 1-2 counterattacks when your moving in and can not protect yourself. This ruins the game experience for me. Also, the game is complelty unbalanced. You are at a great disadvantage against certain characters depending on who you play. It should be balanced each guy against eachother and it totally is not. Because neather realms prefers to just throw a lots and lots of moves in to the game and not think about balancing. MKX has same problems but at least it has a decent block system. The game is also very stiff and counter-intuitive. Kicks and punches that should land just dont cause of the unnatural low reach-level of everyone in the game. This is much tighter in MKX, where you can feel that punches that should land also do land. This game also suffers from the annoying 30%-hits if you press l2+r2, which I never liked, just like in MKX. And you still cant configure to turn anything on/off. I would disable this thing and also projectiles should only do damage if they land, 0% if they dont. Maybe even penalize if your spamming projectiles to much. To discourage projectile spammers. Injustice 2 is really just a reskin of MKX, with less tight gameplay and a poorer blocking system. Dont buy this, get MKX or something else not from neather realms.. Injustice 2 is the best fighting game that I've played in quite some time. It has a fun learning curve and a great roster of (fan favourite) characters - albeit missing a few. The main problems I have with it, albeit a minor issue, is that it is another fighting game with (overpriced) DLC characters and micro transactions. The saving grace is that the roster is so large to begin with that I have never felt the need to buy any of the DLC characters (as much as I'd love to make Starfire my main), and that the game is actually quite generous with its currency (apart from the one currency for unlocking alternate skins/colours - WHY HAVE 3 currencies?!?). Best ""fandom"" fighting game since Dragonball Z: Budokai 3 or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle.. A good fighting game but definitely overrated. The gameplay isn't good at all. The story is mediocre and the graphics are nice but a bit weird at the same time. The story was awesome.I love the new gear mode. The characters are **** favorite is Red Hood ofcourse. I just hate when I play against a stupid 12 year old that stays at the corner and starts shooting whatever instead of facing me like a man. A sequel that is on the same level as the original. Great game-play, good choice of new characters, stunning graphics, and an entertaining plot. Only drawbacks are that some characters are lacking in terms of effective basic combos and the story isn't as good as the first game. Overall this game is fantastic, even if you've worn yourself out playing the original Injustice.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Though I believe Injustice 2 contains a lackluster and less-pivotal Story Mode compared to the epic tale of two DC worlds colliding in the first entry, Injustice 2 makes up for it through an update on it's awesome gameplay, an incredible gear system that seriously makes me play for hours and just ridiculously great mocap work.. This is incredibly the best fighting game ever made for this year, although the story is confusing and crazy. They added what was good or what was not good in the first game and improved and that includes the online system and its new proposals. Graphs-10/10 Soundtrack-9.0 / 10 History-8.0 / 10 Gameplay-9.0 / 10 Best fighting game 2017 -9.5/10-. Injustice 2 is incredibly fun. I really enjoyed the first injustice, I know it's flawed but I thought it was a really solid fighting game, so I was worried about injustice 2, since I thought it didn't need a sequel, but to my surprise, injustice 2 improves on every aspect from the first one. The story feels shorter than the first one but it's a lot better, the characters develop throughout the story, a lot of the antagonists are really sympathetic and it does explain some of the actions they did in the first game. And with great characters comes a great conflict, especially the last 30 minutes, the only problem I have with the story is that it's barely 5 hours, but other than that it was a blast. The gameplay and graphics both improved from the first game, even if I liked the first injustice, even I can admit that the graphics weren't good at all but in injustice 2, the facial animations feel realistic, the environmental animations are great and the characters design are literally incredible. The gameplay is basically like th",the story didn't interest me. the randomized loot online is annoying. the fighting has also been retooled a bit and feels less stiff compared to the first Injustice . justice 3 has everything you could want in a fighting game .
677.Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut,"Ghost of tsushima is a very good game, thanks to its gameplay, narrative, music and side quests. But there are a few shortcomings, notably the sometimes horrible collisions, and the sometimes messy combat with its almost non-existent focus on the enemy, but which is still very stylish when you're used to it... What's more, the game features a number of diverse activities that are quite enjoyable to perform! I obviously recommend this fabulous game, which makes you feel like a real samurai!. While playing I went through various feelings to this game: from the pure delight to the tedious monotony, but the general impressions are great as you can see from my score. The game's atmosphere and the setting are the most great sides of GoT and those parts have a great influence on such stuff like side quests, colectable and other side activities, so all those things turned out very and very strong. The vibes of deliverance the home island from the invaders were enough interesting and exciting to me. I also could refer the combat system to the advantages because it felt fresh and not boring almost the whole time of playing (it is 70 hours in my case). The open world is how expected became the most controversial part of the game. On the one hand the views and the nature of game's world are beautiful and they are also stayed fresh and nice the whole 70 hours, typical enemies' camps, mostly typical points of the inerest and a fading interest in those activities closer to the end of the game on the other. The game's story, the characters and the plot's curves are also not the best side of GoT but they are on a good medium level, some gamers will fully like it. I would said that the side stories and the world's notes are even better than the main plot. Summarizing all that has been said, I can say thatI loved the game, a very few games caught my attention for 70 hours and longer, so I can call Ghost of Tsushima one of my favorities, but I cannot deny obvious sick sides of it.. Wow, this game is a gem in the mud that is currently the video game industry. The gameplay is perfect, entertaining and not repetitive as you gain new abilities and tools constantly. Also I feel so cool in the game. The slow legend increasing, the way I gain Ghost stance is chillingly awesome. Maybe the story could have been a little more interesting/personal somewhat, like the Witcher 3. But this is a matter of personal preference. Buy.. very beautiful world, good combat, characters and animations just look weird. I don't understand the people hating on Ghost of Tsushima, this game is pretty much the best narrative story game ever, The mechanics swordplay etc. This game is an absolute masterpiece in every way possible with its open world filled with absolute beauties. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hands down, this is the best narrative story that Sony has to offer. Hats off to the studio. masterpiece ****! One of the best games, story and gaplay vise i played. TheAtmosphere Is amazing gameplay it’s also polished overall 10 out of 10 game.. GOAT game. Interesting plot as for me. Graphics 10/10. I am waiting for part 2 in 2025 year.. This game was just outstanding I loved this game I fall in love with this game the soundtrack is 10 out of 10. Storie 9.8 out of 10, for me almost 10 this game gave me so many emotions the final mission every mission in this story was perfect I have nothing to add I just happy spent all those time that I spent with this game perfect damn and I just you know regretting that I didn't play this game earlier.. Sony please invest in some good games instead, with a proper story and fun combat instead of this mid. This game is a masterpiece. The authentic landscape of ancient Japan paired with the stunning graphics makes for amazing visuals, the gameplay and combat feel incredibly smooth and satisfying, the many different stunning armor and Katana sets give you a wide variety of customization options, and the mind blowing story with many emotional twists and turns make this one of the best games I have ever played.. Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is a stunning expansion of an already incredible game. The lush visuals of Tsushima are breathtaking, and the added content on Iki Island offers a fresh and compelling new story that dives deeper into Jin’s past. The combat remains one of the game’s strongest features, with fluid swordplay and a variety of stances and techniques that make every fight feel rewarding. However, while the Director’s Cut adds value with its new content, it doesn’t address some of the original game’s lingering issues, like the repetitive nature of side activities and the sometimes predictable open-world design. Additionally, the narrative, while strong overall, doesn’t always reach the emotional highs it strives for.. The story about the game is kinda bad in the beginning, but it improves in the medium til the end. The combat gameplay is perfect!. The absolute best samurai game to date. This game features amazing combat and amazing story. With an even more beautiful open world,. Outstanding game. The boss on the 2nd island is some of the best masochistic fun I've had. Definitely play the game on lethal difficulty. It makes the combat a lot more exciting and puts more emphasis on weapon switching which is what makes the combat fun and engaging. The stealth is like playing old Assassin's Creed games and the combat is like sekiro. Graphics are phenomenal. Side missions are boring and repetitive but I've done a handful of them because I was engaged with the story and because I just had fun fighting people.. The lack of emotion in the faces and animations is kinda ruining the overall storytelling. The graphics are good, and the fighting mechanics are great. But that's really just the only thing that kept me until the end.. IT IS JUST PERFECTION THERE IS NO GAME LIKE THIS IN HISTORY(EXCEPT SEKIRO) WHICH HAS BEST STORY SWORD FIGHTS AND BREATHTAKING VISUALS!. Just play and enjoy this work of art... did 3 runs with this game. First on the ps4, ps5 and now ps5 pro...enjoyed every second of it. A masterpiece. One of the few games that excels in technical features, storytelling and gameplay. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing history and amazing map. There are a lot of things to do besides the main quests. The combat system is amazing, it allows you to fight in different styles. Totally recommended. Ghost of Tsushima is an amazing combat and open world game. It offers the perfect samurai experience and has a compelling story. It also offers one of the greatest characters in gaming.. I like katana and samurais. I played this game until I got a platinum thropy just for this, and the story was not bad, and the battle mechanics were very enjoyable and felt good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I just finished it.... What an incredible experience. I know that the game itself repeats the archetype of action-adventure games that lately sony specially comes with... But man, the world, the spectacular despict of the katana battles, music, ambience, and the strong points of the story, how can i dont think and feel that this game is one of the best things i ever experienced? Thank you **** punch for this incredible game, love it with all my heart. One of the best games ever created simply everything was a 10/10 except- -The combat variety of enemies (all enemies where the same and lacked variety) -The world being plane(while the graphics where amazing there was not that much to do in the world I wish there was more interactive features instead of a empty plane in a lot of place). Amazing game! Graphics, gameplay, and the fact that you are a bad @ss Isa lot of fun! H8ghly recommended! Grab the Director's Cut. Iki island is a solid add on! Make sure you explore everywhere and complete ALL side quest before continuing the main story. Only set backs, climbing mountains and hillside. Sometimes it's difficult to angle the stick and jump to the right ledge. Also, lots of mountains and hills to climb lol. What an amazing experience! Every scene every view in this game easily mesmerized me. I had so much fun. Besides having so much fun, I realized that it’s a game that stands out artistically. The moments when we wrote poetry truly drew me into the game and brought me joy. It’s definitely an experience that should be had.. Brilliant game. One of the best open world game there is with a wonderful story and incredible graphics. The DLC is fantastic.. Game is overrated. Put 8 just for my love for pretty open worlds and history simulation. Game is 7 for everything else. Easy. Outdated leveling and gta-type stuff. Story is good but slow paced. Gameplay good, but not to special and becomes easy kinda early. Best thing about the game is direction, authentic experience to feel yourself in one historic setting even if not completely accurate.. very good story ,awosome mechanis , very beatiful atmosphere and Emotional songs that make you feel in the game. Great story and ending. But the side quests was a bit repetitive like Far Cry and Horizon Zero Dawn. Overall a very good game!. It was nice to feel like they did a good job of preserving the authenticity of the original. It would be better if they fixed the cutscene skipping.. One of the most fun single player games I've ever played. With a very engaging story full of twists and challenges, a great setting full of beautiful locations that even a random hill overlooking a field can be so mesmerizing, and with fantastic gameplay mechanics tailor maid for the fast style of Samurai action, Ghost of Tsushima is a terrific game that almost anyone will certainly get a lot of enjoyment playing.. The Director's Cut enhances the already visually stunning world of Tsushima, with the PlayStation 5 version offering significant graphical upgrades. These improvements include 4K resolution, a smoother frame rate, and support for the PS5's DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which immerse players further into the experience. The combat system, already praised for its satisfying swordplay and fluidity, continues to shine with minimal changes but benefits from enhanced responsiveness thanks to the power of the next-gen consolidation is the Iki Island expansion, which not only offers a new area to explore but also introduces new stories, side quests, and a fresh set of challenges. The plot centers around Jin's journey to the neighboring island, where he confronts new enemies and uncovers more about his past. This expansion offers an excellent way to extend the experience of Ghost of Tsushima, with more of the same beautiful world-building, satisfying combat, and emotional depth that defined the original game. Additionally, new mechanics, such as horseback combat, provide a fresh take on familiar gameplay, keeping things exciting and varied. In terms of Gor's Cut* adds more depth to Jin's character development, offering additional skill trees, new abilities, and more customization options for the player's fighting style. These additions make the already great combat feel more varied and dynamic, ensuring that even long-term players will find new ways to engage with the world. However, despite its many strengths find the Director's Cut relatively incremental in its changes to the core game. The open-world gameplay remains largely unchanged from the original, and the story, while captivating, follows a familiar path that may feel predictable to those who have already completed the base game. Overall, *Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Casterful update to an already fantastic game. With its breathtaking visuals, improved gameplay mechanics, and compelling new content in the Iki Island expansion, it offers a more complete and rewarding experience that makes it a must-have for samurai action fans. For those who haven’t yet experienced Tsushima’s beauty, this version is the perfect opportunity to jump in.. If you like action rpg-like games and open world games, this is a must, without a doubt. One of the best games I've ever played in my life. Immersive, violent, great story, excellent gameplay. Simply greatest game in the last years.. Definitely a great game for Samurai fans! Challenging but responsive gameplay, amazing quality and an amazing story. beautiful game to play and experience cool emotions with decent (no amazing) story. nevertheless, story is fine and with cool views, music and gameplay it makes perfect sense to play this game. While no game is perfect, this is very close. NPC's are very well fleshed out and written, with quests, side quests and NPC quests all feeling very unique which is rare these days. The combat feels very fluid and rewarding and the stealth aspects are amazing (coming from someone who isn't good at stealth games). Very quickly became one of my favourite games I ever played. Fortunately got this from ps+ and what an enjoyable experience from the combat to the scenery. Must play on OLED or Mini LED VA. 10) Masterpiece - 9) Amazing - 8) Great - 7) Good - 6) Above Average - 5) Mediocre - 4) Below Average - 3) Bad - 2) Terrible - 1) Pile of **** - 0) Worst game ever contender. Best melee combat i've ever see, Japanese vibe, that why you need to playt this game, combat always have something new for you, this have a lot of upgrades which is not boring. But why it got 8, it's story. Story become boring middle part of game, and it's easy to say what action hapend next.. Ordinar game from PS, good plot and graphics but nothing new, ill better go for Witcher one more time. Graphics 9/10 - One of the best looking games I've seen, but could have used raytraced reflections and the facial animations are not the best I've seen in a game. Story 9/10 - The story is good but pretty simple honestly. I don't mind because the characters were also pretty good. Gameplay 9/10 - I played on the hardest mode and had a blast. However it is a Playstation game so expect puzzles, climbing rocks and forced stealth sections. Overall 9/10 This is top 10 all time for me. If just all single player games were like this. A brilliant storyline with a wonderful Japan to explore and great mechanics. DLCs are as good as main storyline. Highly recommend playing in Japanese. There isn’t a game like this, the world design is absolutely beautiful and the combat is fun. If you like anime or are heavily into Japanese culture/Samurais this game is a must play. this game is so peak, the story makes you want to take a break just to process what just happened, the combat makes you feel unstoppable but its hard at the same time.. Complete game perfect gameplay, charismatic characters and a game that has almost no defects in its great proposal from beginning to end.. GoTis a fantastic game, in my opinion the design lacks a bit sometimes altough the landscapes are Incredibly well done, the part I didn't enjoy that much was the price and length of the dlc, the online part wasn´t that great too. Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is a total masterpiece. The game throws you right into this gorgeous open world, set in feudal Japan, with amazing visuals that make you stop and just take in the scenery. The combat is super satisfying whether you're slicing through enemies with your katana or sneaking around like a stealthy ninja, it always feels awesome. The story? Intense. It gets you hooked with some deep emotional moments, and Jin Sakai is such a relatable character, you really feel his struggle between honor and survival. The new Iki Island expansion in the Director’s Cut adds even more depth to the game with new areas to explore, cool characters, and some fresh storylines that hit hard. Whether you’re into epic samurai duels or just want to vibe with the beautiful world and ride your horse through fields of grass, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is a must-play. Straight up one of the best games out there.. My prefered plasytation game ever. This game was very fun and great to play.. An incredible next generation update and dlc for an already phenomenal game. This is the definitive version of this game and has made it so easily one of my favorite games of all time! Jin's journey was already an incredible one, and the addition of Iki Island and it's content giving us a chance to experience his upbringing and how he became the man he becomes only added more depth for the character and deepened my love for him and this game. I cannot wait until one day we hopefully get to see how his story continues, and we get a Ghost of Tsushima 2!. Ghost of Tsushima is a game set in Japan telling the story of Jim Sakai, who has to face the invaders of his country – the Mongols. As a result of a huge battle, almost all the samurai are murdered and Jim, who miraculously survived, has to somehow repel the invasion with the help of his allies and drive the enemy out of his **** plot of the game is simple – the enemy has invaded our country, we have to find allies and drive the enemy out of our country. The story is not engaging in any way due to the shallow narrative. The dialogues are very poorly made, in no way engaging, without emotion, without panache. Despite the fact that each of the characters accompanying us has their own problems, experiences, dilemmas, the way of conducting the narrative does not in any way make us want to bond with the characters of the game. We can say that the plot in this game is, and that's **** world presented and the mechanics are a huge strength of the game. Let's start with the world presented. The landscapes are truly Japanese and the game looks so beautiful that I stopped in certain places many times just to admire the views. There are many references to Japanese culture, such as writing Haiku, worshipping foxes, coloring clothes, hot springs. Fans of Japanese culture will have something to admire.Another advantage of the presented world is the sense of exploration. While exploring the world, we not only collect decorative elements for our samurai, but also find places that increase our health, fortitude and give talismans that strengthen our weapons. Exploring through this makes sense, because in this way we directly increase the strength and survivability of our character. Despite its large size, the map is not empty. We will come across a fox den, hot springs or enemies. It is not like we are driving through the area from point A to point B and nothing will happen - we will always come across something.Another advantage - combat. In the game, we will mainly participate in unequal fights, where we will be alone and there will be several opponents. Additionally, the opponents do not stand idle when we attack their companion, they can even charge at us in groups of several people. Thanks to this, we have to be able to ""find ourselves in the crowd"" and effectively block approaching enemies and be able to effectively choose the target of attacks. The diversity of opponents adds spice - each type of opponent is fought a little differently. In a word - it is a **** addition to group fights, we also have boss fights and here I have one reservation. Boss fights are demanding, we have to learn the enemy's attacks and know how to block them and when and how to attack, unfortunately most bosses have repeatable fighting styles. Here, the creators could have tried to diversify the fights **** game does not reveal all its cards at once. With each region, the challenge increases because the opponents start to fight differently, their armor is stronger. In addition, we learn the main character's skills throughout the game, and not all at once at the beginning of the game.I was surprised that the game does not have any loading screens. We do a fast travel, 3 seconds pass and we are already in the **** game has RPG elements such as character development, equipment upgrades and modifying your katana with special stones that you get by finding special shrines. Unnecessarily, in some dialogues, you can choose dialogue lines that have no effect on anything - Jim will simply say something differently. This is completely **** for minor bugs, in addition to the ""Iki"" island, the dialogues in cutscenes were out of sync with the voice.. This game is very immersive and has a lot of really good QoL features. The story is linear but it is intriguing and rewarding in the very end. The graphics are top notch as well. What makes the game stand out is the experience of playing it despite it being a shorter game than others. To add more, the uniqueness of it’s combat system.. Just a 10/10. I cant say anything more. Play it. Please. Story is good. Gameplay is good.. Female samurai just make this game a fiction, together with other elements of the game. But why then go for that realistic look of the game and placing it in realistic historical setting, trying to make the gameplay and graphics as realistic as possible, with fighting mechanics such as standoff, wind on grass etc., when any connection with the historical/cultural setting of medieval Japan ends there? They even say it has been inspired by Kurosawa. But have you seen female samurai in Kurosawa films? No. Because there weren't any. So, Kurosawa made great fiction films, but they made sense from historical/cultural/societal point of view. These games are just pure fiction and all historical/cultural atmosphere that they are going for just falls flat. Even the story isn't that interesting or engaging. So just drop the Kurosawa mode and have your game as intended.. A beautiful story in a breathtaking imagining of Japan. The story is brilliant and the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately its a little repetitive and the cutscene quality is far below what I would expect from a first party Playstation exclusive. Gameplay 10/10: Awesome gameplay. The movement and combat gives you the samurai feeling while Stealth is done in a perfect way reminding you of how an AC game should have evolved. Graphics 9/10: Great job on graphics. Amazing job on environment & buildings. Interaction with everything around the world is done perfect with great details. Characters could have been build better compared to everything else Open World 8/10: The world and the details around it are amazing indeed but there are points where you feel it's empty. When It comes to locations with other npcs everything is perfect. Story & Characters 10/10: The story is great and building perfectly during your gaming. Characters are interesting and everyone has something to offer to your story.. It’s been a pleasure to platinum this game. There’s a lot to say but you should definitely play this game yourself to feel it.. story 8/10, visual especialy the world nature 10/10, unique and charming game 10/10, gameplay 8/10, content too much repetitive 7/10, music 9/10, value 8/10, performance 9/10. The years leading up to this games release I was hoping to play as a terrifying cold heartless ninja/samurai killing Mongols in feudal Japan. What we got was such much more than that, and Jin Sakai has so much depth to his character. He’s already solidified himself as one of the great PlayStation IPs. 9/10. Game Review: Ghost of TsushimaGhost of Tsushima is an action-adventure game developed by **** Punch Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Released in July 2020, Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional game with invented characters. However, it draws inspiration from the real historical event of the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274, which began on Tsushima Island. In the game, the players are met with the main character Jin Sakai in his quest to free his uncle Lord Shimura from the Mongols. The game accurately depicts the Samurai’s moral code. Fighting your opponent eye to eye, acting without anger and fear, and killing with honor. As Jin Sakai continues his journey he realizes that the traditional code of the samurai may not be sufficient to face the threat posed by the Mongols as they use dirty tactics and fight with no honor. During his quest, Jin Sakai is torn between following his moral Samurai code or using dirty tactics to fight off the Mongolians to save the people of Tsushima and his uncle. Throughout the story, we are met with different characters showing their struggle during the invasion. We see the result of war: death and destruction. There are no winners in war, only demise regardless of age and gender. Overall, the entire plot of the game is truthfully magnificent, and well-written. The voice acting for the characters is phenomenal, creating an impact on the players and making us truly feel the characters’ emotions. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. The game allows us to use multiple fighting stances and different types of main weapon we can use which can differ per player allowing for a more diverse and fun gameplay. Moreover, the graphics are absolutely stunning, with realistic visuals that are almost distracting. I sometimes just stop for a moment to stare at the beautiful sunset in-game. It is very cinematic some people might even play it just for the graphics. In every great video game, the graphics are a key factor, and Ghost of Tsushima totally nailed it on this one. Additionally, the soundtrack is amazing, making you feel like you are in the Edo period. Moreso, during dramatic scenes the music used is perfect, making it feel like I’m watching a movieFrankly, it’s one of the best games I’ve played, truly magnificent. However, there are some cons to this game. Namely, it is pretty expensive, reaching about $70 for the director’s cut, but It’s honestly worth it for the experience and entertainment you can get with the gameplay spanning up to almost 62 hours for a 100% completion of the game. Moreover, the game is quite heavy, and you will need a compatible gaming device to run it smoothly. In conclusion, if you’re looking for an epic game with stunning visuals, and a very gripping story you should definitely get this one. Everything in the game is well made and you can tell they put a lot of effort into it. Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play game Despite its high cost and system requirements, the game’s quality makes it a valuable addition to any gamer’s collection.. Excellent game, beautiful graphically, good main story line, even better side stories, combat is very intuitive and easy to learn but takes time to master. Has different play styles, good replay ability. Love the game but in my opinion cut scenes should be skippable, I have replayed the game a few times and it gets boring to have to go though the long cinematics and dialogs again, and could be bigger, maybe with another DLC, the game is very entertaining but short.... it feels like a playstation exclusive assassins creed game but not bad. Close combat mechanics are good.. The game is a masterpiece but a question for **** Punch… WHY THE **** DIDN’T PUT A SKIP BUTTON IN THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH?! I mean… The story is great, but there’s some people who don’t care about the story, they just come to play. So PLEASE put a skip button in first playthrough in your next game. And I’m so excited for your next game Ghost of Tsushima 2.. Game is amazing. Great story but gets repetitive. Musashi Miyamoto approved. Gameplay 9 Graphics 9 Combat system 9.5 Story 10 Character design 10 Face design 9 Overally 9.2. As the game purposes, it is such a nice samurai's game! Has a nice history, nice combat and good missions.. Perfect. Played New Game+ 3 times already. Good mechanics, Great story, Awesome visuals. Must play.. Very Good Game! (Masterpiece) | Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut | 90 Points (4 Stars) | Story 8P | Side Story 8P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 7P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 7P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. All round great experience!! Fully enjoyed the game even with the filter to create the old movie feeling. Amazing art concerning the open world and various armors.. It's was great game and when I play this game Sometimes I stop and I see the view and gameplay It was parfcat. In the end, I'm really enjoyed and I highly recommend playing it.. The game takes us on a journey with Samurai Jin Sakai in feudal japan, where we have to fight against the mongol invasion and question what really matters, honor and tradition or driving the invaders of tsushima island no matter what. While playing you can also stay busy with a ton of side missions which never bored.. Great game. Good story. Nice historical references. Good multiplayer mode too.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game has beautiful graphics and the gameplay is good but it is very repetitive and boring always the same things to do in this open world with not a lotof life. The wind feature is a good idea tho. **** Punch had made game more creatives before that and with a better gameplay like Sly cooper and InFamous. I really hope that they willdo something like that next and not something like Ghost of tsushima because it is BORING. Writing this as the end credits are playing, this game is an amazing, incredible and downright beautiful experience that I cannot do justice with words, but I can try. Ghost of Tsushima has one of the most immersive and stunning open-worlds I've ever had the joy of experiencing, the combat is challenging and satisfying and has a lot of fun mechanics. The story is one of the best I've ever seen, the character arc of Jin Sakai is so believable and the story as a whole is on par with other great narrative driven games like God of War (2018) and The Last of Us Parts 1 & 2. Go play this game, you won't regret it.. I think the fact the people behind the game were made ambassadors for Tsushima as a mark of respect for the quality of the research and appreciation for Japanese culture is all that needs to be known. The duels are superb in particular - if you've played games like Sekiro, you'll find the difficulty manageable overall. I think the one thing to be aware of going in is that is does use certain open-world mechanics (eg, clearing bases), that are common to other franchises. All in all, great game, and I will also be purchasing it on PC.. What happens when you combine incredible graphics, satisfying combat and a good premise with risk-free writing, repetitive gameplay and unskippable cutscenes? A game that loses it's steam very quickly. It's a shame that **** studios didn't take bigger narrative risks (or gave us the ability to skip cutscenes), as the experience takes a dive into mind-numbingness after the 5th copy-pasted side quest the game shoves down your mission list.. This game looks and plays incredible. But I just feel like I've done all this before and don't really feel like sinking in a hundred hours to seek out all the equipment and upgrades and plethora of seemingly cool ****. This game feels like the culmination of every game that came before resulting in the very best at being exactly that without bringing anything new to the table or even being that interesting. Lots of great mechanics and QoL features make this a very enjoyable experience that I'm sure tons of gamers will enjoy the hell out of. I've got other games to play.. Poor history, carachters personality is uninteresting, as well as NCPs personality. I found it so boring, story wise, that I had to drop the game after finishing the first act.. Great game about a Japan. Probably the best game on the ps5 My scores: Graphics:10 Gameplay:7( Too difficult duels at the highest level of difficulty) Storyline:7 Platinum: 50+ hours. Ghost of Tsushima is proof that RPGs don't need to be stuffed full of numbers and complex systems layered on top of each other in order to be enjoyable. With their more minimalistic approach to the genre, **** Punch delivers an unforgettable gaming experience full of heart. The characters each have distinct, memorable personalities, the story never feels like it drags","""ghost of tsushima"" is a very good game, thanks to its gameplay, narrative, music and side quests . but there are a few shortcomings, notably the sometimes horrible collisions, and the sometimes messy combat with its almost non-existent focus on the enemy . the game's atmosphere and setting are the most great sides of GoT and those parts have a great influence on such stuff like side quests ."
678.SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs,"Once you look beyond the PS2 polygons there is an exceptional tactical game here that will give you plenty of strategic ideas and options that exceed the choices of the current ps5 generation. Directing choices and controlling the games level of aggression in your soldiers is very satisfying and will make you feel like your choices matter. This game, in terms of your genuine tactical choices, is simply miles ahead of many third person shooters and I'm surprised the SOCOM brand hasn't been re booted.. What can i say. I played the online mode of this game for, maybe, thousands of hours. I used to play with my HS friends, every single afternoon after classes, for years. So, so many memories, so many laughs, so many tantrums. I could write a book about the people that used to play this game in Spain around 2003-2005. It is a core memory for me. I still know every map by hearth, specially desert storm. Every inch of that place is deep ingrained in my brain.. There is no game like Socom II. Once you get in, you are addicted to the nearly perfect gameplay. Overall rating: 9.2.. The atmosphere in every location it's amazing, sometimes the game it's so hard to beat that when you accomplish the thing it fells rewarding. it's stealth and action well done.. And a combat ""simulator"" released for the PS2. There's a mission in Brazil that is the most complicated of the whole game, at least for me. SOCOM II: U.S. Navy Seals was and still is one of the best tactical shooter games not only on PlayStation 2, but ever released! You get a perfect interplay between realism and fun gameplay, beautiful graphics and smooth controls. Only the multiplayer had some issues, but single player is brilliant! Very addictive, even today!. More interesting levels and missions than the first game. It had really fun online modes as well. Cool graphics and nice level design.. I played the game as of 2015 after having it bought used several years ago. I'm not playing many shooters at the moment but SOCOM 2 sort of got me ahead mentally and confirmed some of my prejudices concerning weapons an military kind of stuff i had in real life. In the game you have singleplayer campaign mode and a multiplayer skirmish mode and the ability to equip 4 soldiers and to command them while fighting first person or over the shoulder view. At least with the version I own the single player campaign isn't fully scripted but calculates what happens by chance and based on the fact if you carry explosives and want to use them (then the enemies do as well). So no 2 single player games are the same and the enemies appear with different weaponry and at different place throughout the campaign. I think the game is a strong buy at the moment. My opinion (as confirmed by this game) is as follows: First: It doesn't help to be stealth. If you can acquire a superior and more accurate weapon you can fire fully automatic and have more range and ""punch"" then its a better choice compared to a silenced one. You may be spotted more earlier but this want hurt you because you can kill everybody before you get in their range so 1 or 2 enemies more don't make a difference. Also: People will know you are there if you kill some of them in reality. Even with silencers. In the game you get always silenced weapons by default but you can change that in the inventory. Second: Tactics boil down to sending your team ahead and killing every enemy you come across from the back while your team does the rest. That's true in Socom and in real life imo. Third: 9 mm guns are inferior weapons and inferior weapons are no weapons at all. In the game that means, you can kill as many people with 9mm guns as you want if you have assault rifles and body armor and don't get in their range. Just like in real life. In several mission you fight enemies who are badly equipped and field only 9mm guns because the don't get rifles by their leaders. All of them will die. So don't mess with opponents who have superior weaponry in real life. Socom teaches you that. Fourth: Helicopters kill you. They may not kill your team, but they will kill you every time you come across them. Also you can't shoot them down, because they will always be out of range of your rifle or too strong. So try to hide and don't attack them out of stupidity. The same is true for tanks. If you don't have anti-tank weapons avoid them. Fifth: Most probably you are not going to find the bomb someone tries to blow up stuff with in the first place if nobody marks it for you on the map but get killed by it or somebody you bump into while searching for it. That's true in the game and in reality. Comparing SOCOM II to other tactical shooters and having played the operation flash points, call of duty and the metal gear solid games I think SOCOM II is more realistic. You can also pit the fn90 vs. an m14 which is quite interesting, since the m14 still wins because of its higher range. I think this is also true in real life, which sort of shows the shortcoming of a personal defense weapon (small and comfortable to carry but not strong enough if you need it), but I did not verify if the fn90 is portrayed correctly in the game.. This is probably the best game made for the PS2 era. This is what a Third Person Shooter should be like. I played this game so much and it never got boring. The only downside is that now with Sony taking the ps2 servers offline you have to do other stuff in order to still play it online. I'm sure I may try this sooner or later, but I'm really curious how many people actually still play it online. It's a great game and will go down in history as one of the greatest in the PS2 era.. Many SOCOM fans declared this game to be the best of the series. Having only played this and the first one, however, I really can't tell. But, wow, this game was and is still awesome. The campaign is now less linear and the AI for both sides are improved. Another feature which I loved is bonus objectives. These are hidden objectives which can only be discovered after completing them, so you really have to experiment and explore a lot to discover them, like finding maps, or sabotaging vehicles. Usually, when you finish a bonus objective, it makes the next mission easier. I feet quite rewarded. There is online play and it IS awesome. Why did I use present-tense you say? After all, aren't the servers shutdown? Yes, the official servers are down, but online play is still possible using LAN tunneling with Xlink Kai. And there is quite a number of people in the community there. You just need to discuss on a time to meet. The developer of this game has started his own studio and is making a spiritual successor to SOCOM; it's called H-Hour. You better check it out!. Loved it almost flawless,perfect game for anyone who likes commanding men. Very realistic that's the best part about it. Love the wepon loadout so many choices.. The multiplayer for this game was/is mind-blowing, and, although the campaign was only ok, it is always a game worth playing if you have an ethernet cord and an online adapter as people, including myself, still play this regularly.. This game nowadays is crap do to the fact that there is no longer multiplayer, and the campaign is lame, the story however is better this time around, but in the end it's just more of the first game, I can't recommend this game, you can safely avoid.","socom 2: U.S. Navy Seals is one of the best tactical shooter games ever released . you get a perfect interplay between realism and fun gameplay . multiplayer had some issues, but single player is brilliant ."
679.The Witness,"The best puzzle game ever made, frankly. Masterfully designed around a single principle, a line and a point. The sobering reality of this game's 8-year development as an auteur's passion project (and the subsequent disdain caused by public and media hype leading up to it- not its developer's fault) is that games like this may be even rarer still to come, despite what The Witness wonderfully achieves. Though strangely not credited as an inspiration, its closest relative is that of Myst- but unlike Myst (or its sequels) did, it manages something far more cohesive, clever, intuitive, and rewarding. Whilst it may seem anticlimactic at first for an open world puzzle game, it requires the player discover the secondary mechanic of the world's incredibly intricate design to fully appreciate what the gameplay is secretly doing regularly in front of you. Much like Blow's previous game, 'Braid' (also recommended) was, the game's narrative is entirely introspective and open to interpretation by the audience, not at all forced on the player like so many preach that it does (though it may come across as pretentious where dialogue is offered). There is absolutely no reason nor excuse on God's Green Earth why anyone who likes Puzzle games would not enjoy this, much less be in reverance. We may never get one this good ever again. A monumental achievement.. Brilliant puzzle game. Absolutely must have for any puzzle gamer. Up there with the portal series and the talos principal.. Superb in almost every way. I loved its art style, its mysteries hidden in plain sight, its challenge. The ps4 generation is when I felt for the first time that gaming can be something way more than just fun. This game represents this realization so accurately! An ode to human nature, intelligence and the mystery of being alive. It's one of those games that I can't go back to because its like a love you can't replicate. A must play.. The witness, is a very special videogame, at least for me. The witness is interesting, to say the least: I love the game, as equally as I dislike it, but there is one problem that I have... The World of the witness, or the island is stunning, its very colourful and has great scenery, I loved walking through the island and finding great spots to just stare at, even if I wasn't paying attention to the puzzles. I have to hand it to the designers who worked on the map, they did an amazing job. (This is where this review might get a little different, to clarify this is my opinion, remember that.) The most important aspect in the witness is like in any other videogame: Gameplay. The main focus in the witness are these screens that you interact with that display the puzzles, in a grid type method. These puzzles can very, from easy simple to understand puzzles to jaw dropping puzzles that make me want to rip my hair from my head. But the really weird thing is that, even tho the puzzles are stupidly hard,...that's what I love about the game. Usually when creating a game you obviously don't want to make it TOO hard but that sometime gets to the point where there's no challenge at all, but in the witness they have the guts to give you hard puzzles like that it's honestly really cool, for instance look at the mountain section in the game the puzzles in the mountain, oh my god where do I even beggin. The puzzles in the mountain are so stupidly difficult to the point where it's funny, the puzzles aren't ""cmon these are so stupid **** this game"" instead they are ""bro these are way too good to be true"" So in conclusion the puzzles are great regardless of them being hard. An aspect that i also enjoyed in the game was its lack of guidance, youre not told where to go, there is no set in stone path you need to take. witch i think is really interesting, since games are always telling you were to go: with arrows, tasks etc. but in the witness you decide where you want to go: dont understand a puzzle?: dont do it, is there a puzzle mechanic thats not intreduced yet?: go explore! stop aimlessly staring at your screen watching guides thinking this is where you have to be, like i said: go explore, find new puzzles that you understand, explore the colourful map in the path that YOU want to take. Now the problem I had in the witness when I played it : the ending (I have gotten both endings) When me and my friend finished the game there was this feeling inside me, this feeling like we didn't actually finish the game. The ending felt rushed like they were just trying to get it on shelves in time. I was confused, sad, angry a little. I really wanted to continue the game but, ""what's there to play if its already beaten?"" In other words ""I'm still really hungry but what's there to eat if the fridge is empty?"" There's another way I would like to explain it, think of it like this: when you're playing a videogame there's a rope attached to your back with a weight tied to it, when you get to the end of the game you get scissors to cut the rope and free yourself from the weight when I finished the witness,... I couldn't find my scissors to free myself from the game, that weight was stuck on me forever, like a scratch that i could not itch. There will never be a videogame like the witness for me. The game will always stay in my heart as a great, difficult and beautiful puzzle game. -Delta. Ah, yes, the line puzzle game. It bored me. However, the ambience is on point. I felt unsettled and alone, and above all, confused, which is what i think they were aiming for. But the puzzles made me fall asleep, sorry. Good for puzzle enjoyers, not me.. beautiful world, ambient sound and the feel in ith entirety. Lacks guidance. had to put down the game, because it made me confused of whats the goal.. This game is a type of high art in the form of puzzles and contemplation. Very intelligent and thought provoking game. Probably one of the best if not THE best puzzle game ever created. Braid was a masterpiece too.. This game is an IQ test. Pure and simple. You can tell how smart someone is simply by their review score of this game. This is one of the best puzzle games ever made.. It's great in parts, but (for me) too difficult/obscure in others, which made it frustrating. There's no way that I would have been able to complete it without looking up the wiki. Interesting and atmospheric puzzler in which you wander an island populated by people frozen in place, solving puzzles presented on screens to progress. It starts very well but soon when the narrative gets less linear it becomes far less obvious as to what you are supposed to do next, resulting in too much aimless wandering. A nice idea well implemented, but many will find it overly and unnecessarily frustrating.. The puzzles are excellent and a little (but not unreasonably) tough. I strongly recommend against using a guide, atleast for the ‘main’ and ‘side’ content. There are some optional (and easily overlooked) bonus puzzles. These are obviously distinct from the main/side puzzles. You will get a few of them on your own or by accident, but 100% completion is very unlikely. Frankly there’s not much thinking involved in these bonus puzzles and there is no reward for completing them. So I recommend (for your own sanity) that you ignore them altogether.. Great game, although there are puzzles that can be tedious without a guide, but because I'm not very good at it. This is a beautiful art, with outstanding graphic design and world design. And like Kentucky Route Zero, let down by an incomprehensible narrative. This game raises so my 'why' questions it does not explain in a way that gives any sense of enjoyment or closure.. beautiful world design, phenomenal game design. finding areas you don't know how to solve, finding the tutorial areas, and going back to solve the original puzzle is extremely satisfying. getting every laser to unlock the mountain, and then finding THE CHALLENGE. a phenomenal puzzle game, offers a challenge but not insanely difficult (besides a few puzzles: **** the sound puzzle on the shipwreck) and i don't think there is a better one in existence. The puzzles present an infuriating dichotomy: some are an absolute joy to figure out and solve; others are diabolical and downright obnoxious for you to find out what to do and solve them. As far as puzzle games go, its an alright one, although not worth the 15$ that you would have to pay to play it (I got mine for free via playstation plus). Also, for platinum/achievement hunters looking for easy pickings, I would advise you to stay away: there is an absolutely insane achievement that is truly not worth your time and effort. If you're looking for a good logic game with balanced puzzles that are both fun to solve and test your mind, I would recommend definitely trying it out at some stage, as it can be frustrating but genuinely gratifying to figure out what you have to do and solve the puzzles, but maybe try playing something like Portal 2 instead before you truly delve into the puzzle genre.. It's a good game, but... it's very stressful, it makes it difficult for me to progress through the levels since my head almost hurts.. If you like a peerless challenge, The Witness will knock your puzzle socks off, offering a steady progression from the immediately obvious, through moments of frustration & revelation, all the way to the mind-bending and apparently impossible final test, making the a-ha moments all the more satisfying. All presented in a compact but pretty world with a unique art style and a diffuse narrative that's revealed gradually, obliquely, and impressionistically as you climb up the difficulty ladder. Even reliving my playthrough to write this review, five years later, is a moment of very happy memories.. This game is fully packed with puzzles. Puzzles are the best thing in this game but they also bring this game down for me - some of the puzzles are amazing, very creative and require a lot of out of the box thinking - however puzzles in this game are somewhat evenly distributed between creative ones, totally obscure and puzzles that are just chore to solve and not fun at all - sometimes you learn a mechanic and it's fun to solve next puzzles based on it, each puzzle gets more complicated or includes some twist on the mechanic - but going further it gets old and too tedious and there is no more sense of awe and discovery like before. As for the story it's decent but didn't keep me involved. Overall it's a good game worth a buy. It's quite similar to The Talos Principle but not in its league.. A relatively simple line puzzle concept is overused under the guise of an open world game. Solving puzzles is not really rewarding, causing one to wonder at the end of the game what exactly one has ""witnessed"". Games should be fun and should not feel like a repetitive chore. The world created is beautiful and it is a shame that the level of interaction of the player with the world is so low.. A game that teaches you how to intuit, be creative and develop critical thinking. It's also a game that teaches you that it's okay to not know something. I find these teachings to be invaluable. The Witness contains some very basic mechanics, but the way you use those mechanics can get imaginative, tricky and downright complex in all the best ways. Almost all of the puzzles are quite intelligent too. The underlying narrative, although not the main focus, is pretty intriguing with some extremely interesting philosophical points that make you want to explore more of the mysterious and undeniably beautiful and varied island. The exploration aspect of the island is of equally high quality. You constantly find puzzles that you simply can't figure out how to solve or ones that contain unrecognizable symbols. The game teaches you that it's OK to walk away and try it later, once you have more clues as to what the symbols mean. But the most important thing that's happening here is that through different puzzles, you can build intuition that will help with different kinds of puzzles. Hence, figuring out what to do with some difficult or alien puzzles also has to do with building up your intuition. This aspect of problem solving is usually reserved for high-level non-gaming stuff, such as college-level courses and it's a delight to find that the gradual building of problem-solving intuition is a major factor in a game. Most games are all about building short-term intuition (which is not as related to critical thinking as long-term intuition) and/or smarts. It also teaches different ways thinking, since a good amount of the puzzles require out-of-the-box and abstract thinking. Sometimes it's not about piecing clues together to reach a unique logical conclusion (although this is a part of it too); it's also about developing different ways of thinking so that you can use educated guesses and then test those against newer and more difficult puzzles and then refining the initial guess. It almost sounds like the scientific process behind research! It's an intelligent but difficult game. Stick with it and you'll be rewarded. And even if you don't complete it (it's huge), you'll still have experienced one of the most original and creative pieces of art that gaming has to offer. Truly eccentric.. It's just fantastic, it's how difficult a game should be, I had a great time with all these crazy puzzles, and even when I finished the game there were still too many secrets to discover, I fell in love with this game.. In general if you like riddles and puzzles this is a fantastic game, although the games not for me and my brain. Done very well.. I've heard and read lots of praise for this game. I do not entirely agree. The puzzle concept is fine, and there is some genius involved in shaping it up from time to time, situation to situation. The graphics and lore are interesting, with an almost cell-shaded environment that is well suited for the game. There is true satisfaction in completing The Witness, but one might ask: is it balanced? The main issue is that, after the first few minutes, the user is left alone understanding puzzles. The concept introduced at the beginning of a ""stage"" is not enough to finish the stage itself. That happens often, and the open world structure does not facilitate this. By amplifying the sense of satisfaction and adventure, game progression is left behind. Gameplay cycles are this way broken into pieces, leading to frustration, which the absence of action furtherly widens. A very good puzzle game. I would have preferred a more scalable approach.. If you like puzzle games, this is a masterpiece. It may not be fun to watch (for example, like Portal sometimes is), but for the person engaged with ****. So much of the fun takes place inside the person playing it. Which -- I mean, I get that sounds obvious, but... I would get up Sunday mornings, make myself some tea, and stare at a grid for an hour, and I LOVED it. For my money, best puzzle game ever made. I wish I could erase my memory and play it again.. Created by Jonathan Blow, the man behind the excellent Braid, The Witness allows players explore an open world environment solving puzzles in order to unlock the secrets of the island on which they find themselves. The game itself essentially revolves around one type of puzzle in which the player must correctly draw a line, or lines, on a grid. There is an impressive level of variety to these puzzles, and they’re all very clever, but for me personally it still wasn’t enough to support a game with a run time of at least twenty hours. Each new type of puzzle is often introduced by what amount to tutorials, with the game allowing players to solve simple examples before upping the complexity. All too often however you’ll find that you need to solve 20-30 of the same puzzle type before being able to move on, and this is made all the more frustrating when the game decided it wants you to repeat the previous puzzle after making a mistake. Once you do solve a set of puzzles and unlock a new area your reward is then a load more puzzles to solve! I don’t want to be too critical of The Witness as it’s clear an incredible amount of time and effort has gone into it. I can’t help but feel that a bit of editing to reduce the number of times you repeat each type puzzle, and reducing the overall run time, would have made it a more enjoyable experience however.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The problem with the Witness is that it has such a simple and pure gameplay mechanic, that there is no margin for error. This is true for both the player and the developer. And while the developer expects perfection from the player--the developer has made glaring errors in judgement and some absolute garbage puzzles. These puzzles come up randomly, and they ruin the experience. I am going to break down one of these puzzles below so that you know exactly how much thought I've put into this. The game uses nothing but the simple mechanic of drawing lines as both the entire gameplay loop and as the method for communicating how the mechanic works. The first couple dozen puzzles are magical discovery in this regard. You learn the rules through deduction and careful attention. However, the problem occurs when the developers intentionally breaks more than 1 existing rule at a time, and they do so without warning. Gameplay Spoiler Below: For example, in the Marsh area, inside the light blue staircase, you are introduced to a somewhat new mechanic: 4 blue squares grouped into a larger square. So far, the rules for the tetris square puzzles are such: -you must draw the outline of all yellow shapes depicted -the yellow tetris blocks must be inside the outline that represents that shape. -You can fuse the outline of two shapes together so they create one large shape, as long as all the contributing yellow blocks are included inside the larger outline. -You cannot ""morph"" the shape of any depicted tetris block. If its a long skinny block, you can't rearrange the squares so that it is an ""L"" shaped block. -You cannot overlap any same-colored squares while fusing shapes. They must fit like a puzzle. Then we are introduced to Blue squares. Blue squares are never depicted as tetris blocks, (until the fateful and horribly designed puzzle.) These are the rules: -A blue square can be used to delete a yellow square. The blue square must be included in an outline with a yellow tetris image in order for it to delete part of that tetris shape. You can delete any square you like. -If all yellow squares are deleted by blue squares, you can create any shape at all, as long as all the necessary blocks are included in the shape to produce ""nothing"". If the entire set of squares produces nothing, outline no shapes and proceed directly to the goal. We have seen some blue ""tetris"" blocks, in which I mean that two or more blue squares form a larger shape. Example: **** All of the solutions to these fulfill the rule of ""you cannot morph shapes made form 2 or more colored squares"". As such, the player MUST assume, if they are to beat the game as the developers have taught us, that the rule stating you cannot ""morph"" the shape of any depicted tetris block applies to both yellow and blue. At no point in any of the previous puzzles are we given an easy to solve puzzle which communicates the idea that blue squares are allowed to be morphed. Through logical deduction, the player is forced to make an incorrect conclusion ABOUT MULTIPLE RULES, which I will detail below. Then, the developers give you this utterly horrible, completely illogical, red-herring infested trash pile of a puzzle. Second puzzle in from the right, with the group of 4 blue squares: **** Look at the solution. You are meant to split the 4 blue squares into singletons and then apply them to individual pieces of two different yellow tetris blocks, and after you do that, THEN you place the augmented yellow blocks on the bottom row. Or perhaps, you OVERLAP the two L shapes so the tall parts meet in the middle, then split the blue shape in half, and delete the short-side of each L shape. Any way you try to think about it, this puzzle follows none of the established rules, and to make matters worse, it is only ever used once during this entire set of puzzles. A complete logical fallacy that breaks mutliple rules in the midst of a series. These types of infuriating and utterly senseless roadblocks make the game an absolute chore to play. There can be no enjoyment while I constantly wonder whether the developer is being a total jerk to me or not. I am so glad I got this game for free. This is definitely not worth $40. It has not been peer-reviewed.. I enjoyed the puzzles and the world. But if you are a story lover this game is pointless! I was disappointed about the ending, I wanted the stone people to come to life and there to be a super cool story. But no you do puzzles and they give you nothing. If I wanted to just solve puzzles I can easily find an app to do so. So disappointed. I feel like I wasted my life playing this game. Also if you had a concussion, post concussion syndrome, sensitive to lights or easily get dizzy this is not the game for you. It hurts the brain. If you want to improve this game have a story, don’t use bright lights and spin stuff around.. This game is beautiful and a must play if you enjoy puzzles and brain teasers. It does get very hard and some of the puzzle types are hard to understand with just in world clues. I had to start cheating eventually but I did finish the cheat proof “challenge” at the end. The philosophical stuff was a bit beyond me but this is a lovely way to kill 30 minutes to an hour if that’s all you have or just want a break from a more intense game.. While I respect the ideas and concept of the creators of The Witness and the style and gameplay are fun at first - line puzzles, as complex as they may be, can only take you so far. A lot of the logic behind the puzzle solutions is poorly or not communicated at all and while that may be fun for a while, towards the end you start hitting a Souls-like difficulty curve which is represented through puzzles which are more or less ""the creators of these puzzles can solve them and so should you"" levels of obnoxious and hard. The Witness is a decent game if you have a ton of free time and enough patience to play it but it fundamentally fails at being a good game. Most of the praise comes from pseudo-elitist journalists who think that if they don't get it - it must be genius. Unfortunately in this case, it's just bad game design.. i've played through the witness twice now. not knowing of the secret ending or hidden cave. people rarely put this much effort in to games anymore. you don't expect this many easter eggs.... sure, if you can't handle critical thinking, variable analysis, and creating algorithms, you might not be able to solve every puzzle, and may not even beat the game. especially for the colorblind.. but there are plenty of old games i never got to beat. not ashamed to admit, that i'd get tired of a puzzle after a while, forgetting a rule or feeling like i gave it my best, looking up a solution. sometimes concluding a puzzle as impossible because i forget a rule, though i ran every possibility and concluded the only solutions, only to find out, i forgot one silly rule... the second play through i only used a cheat on 4 puzzles, solving majority by myself, completing the game in around 20 hours. but you spend a lot of time getting lost and just exploring, enjoying, and being surprised. after 5 years, its still one of the best experiences i've had. pushing my brain to new levels of understanding, rethinking my own choices, and self doubt to find solutions to these puzzles i'd never think naturally like. its clearly well cared for by someone who really wanted to make a game that separates itself from the same old cut up and dlc sales tactic. majority of people probably can't get the most out of it... which is a dangerous idea, that you aren't catering to the majority of simple people out their. its genuinely a game for an intellect... plain and simple. however, the more you adapt, and push yourself, the more satisfying it is to solve things you never thought you could. separating you from the pack of quitters. its not a game for an epic ending. its a game to grow with. so when you quit, you know what sort you are. when you do get to finish it. you feel qualified to understand the others that did as well. a group of people who enjoy puzzles and analysis. algorithms, variables. if you can beat this game quickly, you most likely have an eidetic vision and memory of some kind. though, i've found myself having to write out a few solutions cause there were too many possibilities to all hold in my head. making it something you know you care about because you are willing to go that extra step. simply put. a great game, not for everyone. but don't be afraid to cheat so you can get to the next level and enjoy creative artistry used in it... you'll never have an excuse to truly get stuck.. I am a hardcore gamer, raised in the 80s. You can tell, I have seen some s***. But man! This game is the most boring game I ever played! My score for this game is 1 instead of 0 just because of this cool introduction tunnel. You want some indie emotional s***? Get Limbo, Inside or AAA Death Stranding. This is NOT a game for everyone. The solutions for some of puzzles can feel insane to do without looking them up, but almost every puzzle has meticulous detail, subtle hints, and cleverly hidden environmental details. Almost every puzzle feels satisfying to solve, and many left me feeling ""how did they program that?"" That being said, I do feel that making all the puzzles grid based limits the game's potential a bit. The amount of reused/filler puzzles isn't insignificant either, which is disappointing for a 40$ game (more on that in a bit). The game has NO respect for the player's time. A simple raft takes 2 minutes to reach its destination. This is annoying to me because the game claims to respect player's intelligence and time in the description, when it does no such thing. I think The Witness is pretty good game, but costs 20$ too much. The game isn't too long, and it reuses so many puzzles that it simply does nothing to earn the 40$ price tag. If you've enjoyed games like Riven, Myst, Outer Wilds and the lot, I recommend waiting for a good deal, and grabbing it then.. The best puzzle game I have ever played. Obviously if you don't like this style of games, don't even try it. The Witness will throw at you difficult challenges but gives you all the time and tools to solve them, It feels like you are playing the perfect 'Escape Room'. Definitely a hidden gem in the PS4 catalog.. Masterpiece! # 1 The Witness, # 2 The Talos Principle/Road to Gehenna, # 3 Portal 2. Creme de la Creme! I can respect the scores of those whom this game is not intended for. I believe personally this is close to the perfect game and yet I am not sure I can recommend this game to most people. Most of the people I know I believe they would hate this game or become quickly bored with everything this game is. If you are of the demographic the Witness is intended for I can’t recommend it more enthusiastically. Not sure how to identify that demographic? Portal 2 is a much easier recommendation when it comes to the masses. If you haven’t played the Witness and the game looks like something you might like stop reading reviews and play **** much information going in will spoil some of the fun. Best puzzle game ever and yet not sure I can recommend it? Weird.. First of all, this game is not for everyone. I can say I had enjoyable puzzles and equally frustrating puzzles too. I have seen most people saying its about learning on your own and **** I would have preferred a slight hint if not a complete tutorial at the beginning of each type of puzzle. Believe me, event with a hint this definitely was going to be tough. Its very addictive after a time and I tried hard not to look at solution or **** failed eventually. Spent around 20 -30 hours may be, have completed around 8 lasers but didn't finish the game completely. Lost the fun over time with too much complexity. Maybe not for me.. I don't like, when people call it a good puzzle game, or people compare it to the Myst. The Myst!! This is just casual game with the squares. There is absolutely no plot. All puzzles are completely the same. You can play this or you can just buy a journal with bunch of Sudoku puzzles.. I've been playing video games for 36 years, and this is my favourite so far. What more can I say.. This game has put game world design on a new level. Jonathan Blow did a fantastic job to create such a sophisticated puzzle game by intelligent usage of the world and its environment.. The Witness is a hard game. Or maybe I'm dumber than I give myself credit for, which is probably truer. Jonathan Blow's creation is a game that will teach you a new code, a language of sorts, and will trust you with the burden of solving an enigma across a desert island. It never holds your hand, but instead expects you to learn its mechanics through cleverly designed puzzles, or 'panels'. These panels, which are scattered across the land, almost always bring something new to the table, and each time you think you've cracked the code, they'l stump you, so there's always an incentive to keep going. The island is littered with secrets and references and little details. I lost count of how many 'wow!' moments I had during my gameplay. The Witness is not just a game, it's a masterclass in game and environment design and an experience like any other in gaming platforms.. Too stupid, no logic, just trial and fail, for ones who love meditation and ****. This is one of the top 5 games of the decade for me. I came away form this game having not used nay guides with a real sense of accomplishment. I have been gaming for almost 30 years and not game on auto-pilot. Even a new puzzle mechanic in most games is solved pretty quickly. This is one of the first games where I have to get a pen and paper out and work things through. Absolutely loved it. It won't be for everyone, but if you like being challenged by good puzzle design, then its perfect for you.. The Witness takes an exceptional approach to game design by completely throwing the player in cold water. Learning all the mechanics on your own is incredibly rewarding and every discovery feels meaningful in the greater context. I highly recommend to finish the game without any guides. If you get stuck, take your time. Every corner of the island can lead to a new epiphany. The impending sense of accomplishment only grows with the number of failed attempts. Subtle sounds, vivid colors, smart map design and great puzzle variety are only a few things that richen this experience even more. 10/10. Trust me when I say that you don't have to be smart to enjoy this game. This is because while the puzzles ARE pretty difficult, there are rarely any stakes to failing the puzzles. In some cases, failing a puzzles means that you are moved to the previous puzzles in that set, but this is pretty rare. Not only that, but the design of the world here is truly something to behold. The atmosphere, lack of direction, and lack of NPCs makes the journey of this game truly a personal one. The pace at which you play this game is entirely up to you. The game is hard, yes, but it's also patient. If you can't finish the puzzle in the tree house, you could give it a break and walk to the town or the keep and chip away at the puzzles there. There were times where I would be content to just walk around the world without any intention of making progress. I was in a pretty bad place when I was playing this game (I only got it because it was one of the free games of the month), but when my world was full of confusion and panic, this game gave me a quiet refle","the witness is an ode to human nature, intelligence and the mystery of being alive . it's one of those games that i can't go back to because its like a love you can't replicate . the game's narrative is entirely introspective and open to interpretation ."
68.BioShock Infinite,"Probably the best bioshock game. It is not perfect but very close to it. The story and the gameplay are very entertaining until the end.. I first played this game on my ps3 almost 7 years ago and I loved it. Now I beated it on my ps4 so and I still think it's a good game but having in consideration that I already played this game and that it's a ps3 game on a ps4 console I can't give it more than an 8, but it's still worth playing.. A rightfully controversial game, and one that does something so unique at every turn. its one of the most unique shooters I've ever played and I am so glad that they went into this direction, taking the constant philosophical thoughtfulness of the first, and redirecting it as to make sure it doesn't try to become something that it may not want to be. and where it's messy, its down right unforgettable. something that is truly..... Beautifully Insane.. Technically the best game of the trilogy, the story as an all is kind of confusing to a new player in the franchise to gasp it all, especially in the final half of the game, but with that sad, I think this trilogy couldn't have gotten a better final. The story-telling and the character development here are on masterpiece levels, one of the best protagonists a game has ever had, and a pretty cool gameplay witch trows me back to the first game. Masterpiece is one of the best of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played it in late 2024 and I could say that the game is not that old as for 10+ years game. Yes, graphics is not like in Dead Island 2 but it still ok, animations are great (Elizabeth' mimic is great!), gameplay is perfect, shooting is great. But the main thing BioShock Infinite is must play is because of the story - there are no many games I watch lore videos after beating. Also don't miss DLCs. To see the Rapture during its rapture worth a lot.. The best of the franchise. I totally recommend getting all the achievements in the game. It's one of those games that will leave you thinking about it for years. It's not a revolutionary FPS but it's a clever one. It tells an intellectual story; it makes you care about the characters. Its epic and its violent. The atmosphere of the world is unappareled maybe even by today's standards. Kevin Levine knocked it out of the park with this one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story - 10 Gameplay - 10 Art direction - 10 Sound - 10 recommend to continue DLC. A must play Game. This game is literally a must play for everyone who wants to play a story driven strong campaign fps I it's unlike any fps I have played will not say much more just go and play the game this is something special and you will definitely enjoy every second of your playthrough.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A story that gather everything ken Levin created masterpiece. But the throw away the weapon and get another one system is annoying tbh.. This is in my opinion one of the best games ever. To start, this is one of the visually best looking games i have ever played. Columbia i an awe to behold. Then there's the gameplay, wich is very good and a lot of fun. Last there is the story and world, this is for me one of the best parts of the game. Bioshock infinite is just a very great game that I greatly recommend.

Its thought-provoking narrative and memorable characters make it a standout title that leaves a lasting impact on players. Whether you are a longtime fan of the series or new to the franchise, this game is a must-play.. Such an amazing story. Even though there are still parts I don't understand, Infinite is the best out of the series. There are magical things that we can use as gameplay (I forgot the name), but it is easier to progress with weapons and this gets boring after a while. However, if we put all these aside, this game tells an incredible story. Dystopia can be called the ultimate steampunk experience. 10/9. The story and characters are fantastic, and I love this game so much. The only aspect I don’t like is that the combat is somewhat boring, and some of the superpowers are just useless—I never used them throughout my entire playthrough. I understand that some players don’t like how BioShock Infinite changed the combat style compared to the first two games and moved away from the traditional BioShock survival horror (which was only retained in the DLC and one of the later levels), but to me, it's not a big deal, I still love this game.. Story was good and the gameplay was good. Characters were actually memorable.. Fantastic gripping story and ending for an iconic trilogy. Beautiful scenery that leaves you mesmerized. I must recommend to play the DLC ""Burial at Sea"", if you play the first two Bioshock, u definitely will love this adition.CitC is **** tho, even more if you want all the Blue Ribbons challenges. Combat in this game MIGHT get a little ""too much"" for some people.Amazing trilogy and what a way to say goodbye to this franchise.. The games pretty good, but the gameplay feels more like it's supposed to be a fast-paced multi-player shooter like Apex rather than a explorative Horror shooter with puzzle elements. There's no need to do anything besides the mainstory. The only thing the game has in common with the first two games are the superpowers. And the mainstory is so complicated at one point, that you need a master degree in physics and philosophy to understand it. Overall it's not bad, but it's not really a Bioshock game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the greatest games of all time. WOW never gonna forget this experience.. The bioshock material was refreshing and the gameplay was enjoyable. The only thing I feel a little disappointed about is that it didn't make me feel more immersed.. BioShock Infinite takes players on a journey through the skies of Columbia, a floating city brimming with breathtaking visuals and artistic direction that will leave you in awe. Gameplay wise you can expect a mediocre shooter saved by the grappling hook which made it all right for its short run time. I enjoyed my time with the game but I found the story cluttered and lacking in character development. Somehow hard to recommend it in 2024, but I feel the setting must be experienced.. A cherry on top to one of the best gaming trilogies of all time. Really reinvents itself, as while Bioshock 2 was a great game, a third game in the same setting would have been a bit much. The breathtaking world you discover in the clouds is just as impactful as when you first set your eyes on Rapture below the sea. Fun new gameplay mechanics involving the Skyhook and interesting combat areas to boot. The story is the star here however as it takes it all to another level. One of the best told throughline stories in a trilogy.. They quite simply do not make games like this anymore, a must play for anyone who likes run and gun play with brilliant story and dialogue. Incredible!. Somehow I liked shooting in Infinite even more than in original Bioshock. Burial at Sea is a must-play DLC.. I remembered nothing from this game, its a bulletstorm clone and that's it. It has a very soy fanbase though. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Violence for the sake of violence. Oh, and communism bad. If you happen to be a person of some sophistication, look elsewhere. Just like Bioshock 1, the setting is good, but that's about it.. I think, this is best Bioshock game. Good story, good mechanics etc. And released in 2013. RESPECT!. Bioshock Infinite is an FPS game released in 2013. It is the third major installment in the Bioshock series. I must say I have mixed feelings about this game, at least a little bit. But let's start with the positives. As one might expect, the settings and the visuals are once again one of the strongest suits of this game. This time you visit a city in the sky as opposed to one on the bottom of an ocean. It is beautifully made, but for some reason, the emotions I got from it were not as strong as with Rapture. The music is, once again, absolutely fantastic. For example, the opening scene where you arrive in Columbia with the “Will the circle be unbroken” chorus is a very strong moment and probably the strongest in the whole game. And when the strongest point of the game is the opening scene, that is a problem. The game tries to present itself as a complex story of alternate universes and time travel, but to me, it all seems redundantly complex and seemingly mysterious and vague. I think the developers just went a bit too far. Another problem I have is with the political themes of this game. This time we are really force-fed a classic story of the oppressors and the oppressed. And, of course, bad and ugly racism cannot be far behind. In other words, I believe the developers have moved from the core idea of Bioshock, and I cannot get as excited by Columbia, Booker, or Comstock as I got by Rapture, Jack, and Andrew Ryan. I finished the game in about 20 hours on a PC playthrough. Microtransactions are present this time in the form of various packs and season passes and also overpriced DLCs. SJW is sadly also much more prevalent. DLCs: Clash in the Clouds: Just a regular arena with no story. Burial at Sea: This is an important story DLC that serves as a tie-in between Bioshock Infinite and Bioshock and actually serves as a prequel to Bioshock. This was probably the most enjoyable part of the whole game, which just proves my point that Rapture is superior to Columbia. The stealth combat is great, and I actually wish that all Bioshock games were more like that. However, the story is still deliberately confusing and abnoxiously vague in its redundant complexity. The fact that this DLC was split in two and sold separately for 15 USD each is just a classic DLC moneygrab move. Verdict: 80 % Generally, I am a bit disappointed with Bioshock Infinite. I expected more, or perhaps less. Final Verdict: 70 %. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ending of this story just blew my mind. Plot is really good, gameplay, fighting, looting, everything is on it's place. I really miss games back then. Well, this. Usally the first is always the best and it is hard to beat such a great game like Bioshock 1, but 2K nailed Bioshsock infinite. Hit it out of the park. Weird story but also really good, much of the gameplay is improved from the previous entires. The voice acting is superb. Highly recommend.U. holy crap my meat is hard asf just loved it. Some parts are a bit boring & repetitive but damn what a good chicken. a little bit overrated in my opinion, the first bioshock is miles ahead when it comes down to the story, atmosphere, but still a good game.. Pretty fun but heavily overrated. The beautiful environments and satisfyingly responsive FPS combat don't quite make up for the convoluted story and repetitive gameplay loop (the ending is also kind of ass).. BioShock Infinite is a captivating journey through a visually stunning world with a narrative that's sure to leave a lasting impact. While it excels in storytelling, character development, and aesthetics, it does have some gameplay shortcomings and missed opportunities in terms of player choice and exploration. Nevertheless, it's a highly enjoyable experience that deserves a solid 8/10 rating, making it a must-play for fans of narrative-driven shooters.. Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Graphics: 9/10 World: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Overall 10/10. Artistic and action-packed throughout. It diverges from the original Bioshock formula, but still makes it somewhat familiar. Couple that with an amazing story. What else do you want?. Best game from bioshock franchise. Graphics looks incredible to me. Story is ok aswell. As good as it is, it really distances itself from the other two games making a more linear experience at the same time it does a messier plot. A must play either way, and one of the best FPS I've ever played.. A game with high quality and an intriguing story. However, the changed systems from the previous installment are slightly disappointing, and while the steampunk atmosphere is appealing, the lack of details prevents me from truly falling in love with the in-game world.. Possibly the best story I've encountered in a video game, as I eventually just turned it on easy so I could blow past combat to get more of it.. Bioshock Infinite tried something new in regards to setting and it really did succeed there. For many, Columbia still can't compete with the atmosphere of Rapture from Bioshock and Bioshock 2. The story is interesting, but not as good as the previous titles. The gunplay is decent, but the combat doesn't feel as organic as enemies flood into open rooms to fight you. Overall it was a fun game, but not as good as the previous titles. I recommend giving it a shot after playing the other Bioshock games. The DLC is great.. A very good game, the plot in the middle of the game was a little bit annoying but in the end game everything become absolute crazy and very interesting. The difficulty in normal mode is a little hard i've died many times, whenever Elizabeth screams ""HANDYMAN"" I already knew that i will meet Death, but is a Very Good game. Worthy of GOTY!. One of the best things about the first 2 Bioshock titles was the world. Bioshock Infinite tries to recreate the magic with a city in the sky vs in the ocean, and while Infinite has its own theme, it also brought some problems. The game drops the RPG elements of the original for a more classic RPG approach, only allowing 2 guns at a time. The story is rich and it is very integral to the campaign of the game.. 10/10 Stories 10/10 Music 100/10 Elizabeth The Ninth Art!!! I will never forget Elizabeth.. Gameplay - 9 Plot & Characters - 7 Storytelling - 9 Pacing - 8 Music & Sound - 9 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. Final entry of the bioshock saga with the best story so far, the gunplay and the vigors are also pretty good in this game but not as good as in the other bioshocks. Elizabeth is also an amazing character and the Lutece are funny as hell. And the burial at sea dlcs are very good dlcs.. I didn't understand anything at the end, absolutely nothing. But I liked it, give me more.. 10/10 - Love it. Long live Irrational Games. Introduction Bioshock Infinite stands as a shining example of the artistic and narrative potential of video games. Developed by Irrational Games and released in 2013, this critically acclaimed first-person shooter transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming experiences. With its immersive world-building, thought-provoking themes, and masterful storytelling, Bioshock Infinite delivers an unforgettable and intellectually stimulating adventure. The Setting: Columbia, a Skyborne Utopia Set in the early 20th century, Bioshock Infinite transports players to the floating city of Columbia, a marvel of human achievement suspended in the clouds. The meticulously designed cityscape, with its grand architecture, vibrant colors, and attention to historical detail, creates an immersive environment that captivates players from the moment they step foot into this extraordinary world. As players explore Columbia's streets, interiors, and skylines, they uncover the dark secrets lurking beneath its seemingly idyllic façade. Themes that Resonate: American Exceptionalism, Racism, and Religion Bioshock Infinite is not just a visually stunning game; it also grapples with complex and thought-provoking themes. The narrative explores notions of American exceptionalism, shedding light on the dark undercurrents of nationalism and blind patriotism. Racism is confronted head-on, as the game confronts the systemic oppression and segregation that pervades Columbia. Religion, too, is a central theme, with the game delving into the dangers of religious fanaticism and the manipulation of faith for personal gain. The Protagonist: Booker DeWitt and the Mysteries of His Past The player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent burdened by a troubled past. As the story unfolds, players accompany Booker on a mission to rescue Elizabeth, a young woman with extraordinary abilities who becomes his enigmatic companion. Booker's journey becomes an introspective exploration of guilt, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions. The character development is exceptional, and the emotional depth with which Booker is portrayed adds a layer of complexity to the overall narrative. Elizabeth: A Companion Who Transcends Expectations Elizabeth, the game's central character, is a triumph of character design and development. Her presence and interactions with the player are seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, making her an invaluable and compelling companion. Elizabeth's multidimensional personality, her endearing innocence, and her evolving relationship with Booker create a genuine emotional connection, immersing players in their shared journey. Gameplay: A Fusion of Action and Intellect Bioshock Infinite's gameplay mechanics strike a balance between heart-pounding action and cerebral engagement. Armed with an arsenal of unique weapons and powers, players engage in intense gunfights while utilizing ""tears,"" interdimensional rifts that alter the environment and offer strategic advantages. The exhilarating combat sequences are complemented by mind-bending puzzles and thought-provoking moral choices, forcing players to confront the consequences of their actions. Visuals and Sound Design: The visual design of Bioshock Infinite is nothing short of breathtaking. The city of Columbia is rendered with meticulous attention to detail, from its grand architecture to its vibrant landscapes. The art direction combines a nostalgic Americana aesthetic with steampunk elements, creating a unique and visually stunning world. The musical score, composed by Garry Schyman, perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, evoking a wide range of emotions, from awe-inspiring orchestral pieces to haunting melodies that enhance the game's most poignant moments. Conclusion: Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling and gaming. Its thought-provoking narrative, immersive gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals create an unforgettable experience that challenges players intellectually and emotionally. The game's exploration of complex themes and its ability to weave together gameplay and storytelling make it a shining example of the artistic potential of the medium. Bioshock Infinite will undoubtedly continue to be celebrated and remembered as a landmark achievement in the world of video games.. As a fan of the original Bioshock, I give this high of a score only for the art direction which, as an artist myself, I think is superb and fully worthy of at least 6 of the 7 I am giving this game. In other areas I was dissapointed at the game. It was severely lacking a good horror element that made the first game so engaging, and a lot of the good gameplay/rpg elements are just missing, making it feel much more like an on rails shooter like a Call of Duty campaign mode than a game with depth and choice. Essentially, it felt less realistic and more scripted because of this. Talking of script, the story of this game was all over the place. It was incredibly convoluted and tacky, and dealt in the topic of multiple realities but in an incredibly cliche's and pseudointellectual way that had me rolling my eyes by the end. Unlike the original bioshock, with its strange self aware commentary on the work of ayn rand, this game takes place in the skies in a turn of the century version of religious zealotry and old american ideals of purity and independance, which is a really cool idea on the face of it. It doesnt just stick to this concept though, that is the problem. The game starts out great, and you are lead to believe that there are many avenues that will be explored in this. It feels like bioshock, with a creepy sense of unease and insanity crawling at the back of your mind as you ascend to a racists idea of heaven. But the game just lets you down, its cartoonish and unserious, i get that they were kind of going for that with elizabeth appearing like a good old american disney princess, but it just doesnt land. And the story is stupid, and story is the second most important thing in Bioshock after the art design, so its a 7 from me (the other 3 is the good story its missing). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Decent game. The story is so --so, scoring is great, visual is decent, and the voice is also great. BioShock Infinite, despite the weight of overhyped expectations, emerges as a shining gem in the BioShock franchise. It successfully builds upon the legacy of its predecessors, delivering a near-perfect game that combines compelling storytelling, stunning visuals, and innovative gameplay. The intricate narrative, filled with thought-provoking themes and shocking revelations, keeps players hooked from beginning to end. The game's ability to balance grand scale conflicts with intimate character moments showcases the mastery of its design. BioShock Infinite stands tall as a testament to the power of immersive storytelling and cements its place as a near-perfect entry in the beloved BioShock series.. BioShock Infinite's stunning visuals, mind-bending story, and memorable characters make it a standout entry in the series.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 80 IIIIIIIIII====================. Overall it's an alright game, good for some mindless fun. The potential is clearly there, there are moments in the game where you can see how certain mechanics were meant to be expanded, or certain things were meant to be possible in the world, but it just leaves me feeling bitter about having to engage in more second-rate gunplay. Gunning down hordes of police officers gets old and dehumanizing really quick, and the story is so confusing and poorly told that there's soon nothing left to keep you playing but Elizabeth. And Elizabeth is awesome and so memorable, but for the most part doesnt add enough to gameplay to carry the whole game on her back.. Being one of the first games i ever played, bioshock always had a special place in my heart. Game play, story, ambiance, characters ... This game has it all.. Great unpredictable plot, good graphics. The game is plot-related to the past parts with the help of dls. The game is mandatory for all game lovers to complete. The gameplay does not reach the score of 10, but it is also not bad.. This game is the best game I've played in my life after the subway series. If some things hadn't been deleted from the game, I'm sure the average of this game would have been 99. THE FATHER OF 2K STORY GAMES.. The best game I've ever played. Story, characters, atmosphere was top! Game play keeps you in game from start to end. Piece of art!. This game gave me the best moments of my life. An unforgettable story in a completely different world after the first two games. I wish I could lose my memory and play again. I wish the story was much more understandable, but we interpret some things ourselves. I think it's good about that.. This game is a masterpiece and has become the most misunderstood game of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story and characters are not bad but the gameplay was very boring. It's a bit overrated.. Bioshock: 9/10. Broken Bioshock-arena game: 6/10. Game influenced by sjw: 1/10. Gameplay: combat mechanics 6/10 stealth (w/o powers) 1/10 atmosphere [reviving system, really?] 5/10 Gameplay as RPG & ****: 2/10 Story 2/10 Graphics 8/10 Sounds & music [voxophones, again?] 8/10 [GREAT RU localization] . I don't need your ultra-powered mega-helpful NPCs in my combat, K. Levine! And I don't need to be ""a guilty one"" in your plot. I want MY play. Do not repeat this in the new Ghost-Story project, please!. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Very creative game. Whole atmosphere and art style is excellent. Basically it is a shooter, but there's so much more to it. It has a rich backstory and many creative ideas. Gameplay is fun.. played it yesterday in 1 sitting its a great game with a complex story even if the story have some problems I had fun :`D. 17/20 super game love it, the end just blew my mind. fun gameplay , great graphics (expect the 2d flowers..) and the 2 dlc are just wonderful... Very messy, holy hell. The writing can be all over the place, but it´s not bad, and the ending is really good. The main characters have a great relatioship, which is quite an achievement considering the protagonist is goofily tragic. It´s very fun despite it´s faults.. I love the Columbia and Rapture! This is amazing game I ever play and beat first time and took me go back play Bioshock 1 and 2.. The combat system is intuitive and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and enemies to keep things interesting. The world and characters are well-realized, making for an immersive experience. However, the game is not without its flaws. Some players may find the difficulty level to be too high, while others may feel that the story is too predictable.. I just finished the game to day and the end of story was great and game play is god too.. This game is a MASTERPIECE. How the story is developed, how the characteres evolve. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There has never been a game that makes both magic and using weapons so beautiful.. Bioshock Infinite takes a leap in self-awareness in a way few stories can do good. Booker DeWitt is written very well. The whole game made me question and ponder the inter-conflicts of every character. This game capitalized on Bioshock's potential and has me looking forward to the next. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. A watered-down, less interesting successor to one of the greatest story-driven games of all time. All of the dreary, worn-down aesthetic of the first two is now all stripped away with a complete action game that doesn't even resemble BioShock. Had it not shared the name, it could easily be a different game entirely. The action-paced gameplay mixed with the confusing story that adds too much to the previously established universe makes it a terrible sequel.. The perfect closure for the saga, a frenetic game that takes us back to an immersive city that has a gripping story that unfortunately ends up closing only with the DLC.. If i could wipe out my mind to re-play a game as it was the first time i would just for this one. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhAHAHAHA WHY ELIZABETH NOT NAKED. WITHOUT JOKES THIS GAME HAS GOOD PLOT.. played very late, I took advantage of the collection to play it together with the dlc, one of my favorite games. Great job like all the bioshock saga. good story, good characters, definitely a game that will hook you to the end. This game even after 9 years still impresses me a lot, along with its best ever DLC. Never really played a bioshock game before this. I was kind of shocked at how bad the excessive enemies were in this game. One enemy after another in this rush of constant combat with the occasional story beat and thematic imagery thrown in there to make gamers gush about how this is somehow genius.. In BioShock Infinite, we will experience divergent realities in every single detail. If you played previous games, Columbia offers to take you to higher ground. You are gonna dive into a war battleground in an instant as you wander through its intriguing and lovely streets. You will also face racism, xenophobia and also religious imposition while experiencing an extraterrestrial story that feels like an inner journey.. Irrational studios has done it again: epic game. After Bioshock 2, I was kind of done with the Rapture theme. Although I can play the first two Bioshock games over and over again without it ever boring me, if there was ever to be a new game, I wanted some fresh new ideas. My wish had been granted when Bioshock Infinite hit the shelves. Instead of playing on the bottom of the world, you are now playing high in the sky, almost touching space. Bioshock Infinite takes places in a new city Columbia. It floats high in the air by massive fans and, just like Rapture, keeps hidden from existence. You play as Booker DeWitt, a new character and a good one I might add. Just like Jack from the first Bioshock, you immediately feel some sort of connection with him because of his excellent dialogue, expression and overall interaction. Irrational studios has done it again. They produced another excellent game with another excellent story. It is what the Bioshock games are known for and they did not disappoint with this game. Because of this reason, I will not review any part of the story in this review, this is something that you need to experience for yourself, especially in combination with the two DLC episodes “Burial at Sea”. The mechanics of the game work very similar to the first games. You got a selection of new different weapons and instead of using Plasmids, like the previous games, you use Vigors and Salts. The Vigors have the same idea as the Plasmids but are still completely unique. You can shoot a horde of murderous crows at your enemies, posses them so they attack other enemies and then shoot a bullet trough their brains or splash them away with water and tentacles. For money, you collect the national currency of Columbia, the Silver Dollar. The new enemies in the game are also very well created and a lot of thought did go into them. You got your standard police officers and other human enemies, but then, out of the blue, you got attacked by a big, mechanical patriot doll, complete in the style of George Washington. And if that is not enough, you got the Handymans, humans in a big exoskeletons with their hearts outside of their bodies, encased in the middle of their suits. The only thing they do is Hulk Smash so they are predictable, but when they hit you, you just bought yourself a one way ticket back to earth. I like the combat, besides shooting and bewitch enemies, you can also knock them off Columbia. If there is a ledge a","a rightfully controversial game, and one that does something so unique at every turn . the story as an all is kind of confusing to a new player in the franchise to gasp it all, especially in the final half of the game . the main thing BioShock Infinite is must play because of the story - there are no many games I watch lore videos after beating ."
680.RalliSport Challenge 2,"Great game but when you lose wheels and the story mode is so hard for beginners even on easy mode and that is only way to unlock cars but overall its pretty good Player 2 mode is best. Just an all-around great rally racing game with good graphics, fun gameplay, and tons of content. Seriously challenges the Colin McRae Rally series.. My Favourite racing game ever. Great campaign and driving physics are perfect. Wish they would do a third one although it will never happen. Shame....",the story mode is so hard for beginners even on easy mode and that is only way to unlock cars but overall its pretty good Player 2 mode is best . great campaign and driving physics are perfect.
681.The Nioh Collection,"An incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo. This game has a lot to offer: - Durability: You can spend a lot of hours by completing the campaign which is huge with plenty submissions and is very challenging. - The possibilities to build your character are incredible huge.. greater game ever made. fantastic combat and story. Great graphic and map queality. Best souls like ever made.. The OG is back with native 4K support! Doesn't get better than its fascinating lore & gorgeous game design. You live the story of feudal Japan with it. I've played both Nioh games across both the PS4 and PS5, and I think the PS5 version is the better of both versions. The base game is still very strong, but minor quality of life improvements help elevate both titles higher. Pros; - Challenging, but fair gameplay - Very stable performance - Stances offer different attack options - Very replayable - Loads of weapon variety - Different builds can approach each situation differently - Every DLC is included - Haptic feedback (R2 trigger tightens up when using a bow) - Near instantaneous respawning after death (new to PS5) Cons; - Stages can feel very repetitive - Some collectibles, like the Kodama or Hot Springs, can be a bit annoying to find Nioh was a must buy on PS4. The Nioh Collection is a must own on PS5 for Soulslike lovers.. These are the best souls like games out there Nioh has a really good combat system and plenty of different weapon types to choose from. Hours Played: 46 Hours Trophy Completion: 43/103 (42%) Worth My Time: Only if you know what you're getting into. Worth My Money: Yes, it's a pretty good value when on sale. What I Like: The weapon system is pretty cool and there's tons of abilities. Runs really well on PS5. What I Dislike: Wasted potential as it ends up being a janky button masher with terrible bulletsponge AI and way too much loot. How It Stacks Up: You can really tell that this was made by the same people who made Dead or Alive. Unnecessarily complex systems everywhere you look. Tons of video game here, just none if it is particularly good. There is definitely an audience for this game though. It is for people who think the Souls series is too slow and boring and hard, and instead wish it were a casual over-the-top action button masher. At least they did a good job with the PS5 features.. One of the most underrated franchises from PS4 era. If you thin Ninja Gaiden or mix Souls with Sekiro, then you get an idea of how the gameplay of Nioh 1 and 2 are, and in the Nioh Collection on PS5, they're remastered with better gameplay and graphics. I highly recommend incredible boss variety too.. The Nioh Colletion is a better HD collection than what Capcom did with the Devil May Cry HD collection where they ported PS2 graphics to PS3 and than PS4 and than the only thing Capcom added with Devil may Cry HD collection on ps4 was 1080p resolution and 60fps The Nioh Collection Remaster however team ninja actually put in some work and improved graphics lighting shadows LOD texutre assets not just resolution and framerate the increase in graphic fidelity it's not night and day different than the ps4 pro version but you can definitely notice the difference and just an all over all more polished experience that looks and plays fantastic on the PS5 the 120fps mode in nioh 2 needs patching to improve performance and there is more bugs in nioh 2 than in nioh 1 in general but team ninja patch the game often for Nioh 1 i suggest playing in the 120fps mode because it's pefect if your TV supports it if not both standard mode and native 4k are great if you want higher fidelity go with standard if you want native 4k resolution go with the 4k mode in Nioh 2 i suggest the standard mode it's just 200 pixels lower than the native 4k mode but it has the best visual impact and its still 60fps remember this is not a remake like demon's souls where everything has been reworked from the ground up this is a remaster so keep your expectations in check and you will not be disappointed they could have gave us only framerate and resolution and just leave it at that but they chose to improve the graphics as well from the ps4 pro version so i am very grateful to team ninja personally i prefer the second game more than the first the first game had repetitve enemies until you hit the DLC's than you get to fight newer Yokai enemies and a lot of the bosses are humanoid in the first game so in a demon slayer samurai game like nioh i do expect to fight more demons than samurais the music was not that great in the first game its not bad by any stretch but not something that will grab you like in devil may cry 5 bury the light or devil trigger soundtracks many people say the first game is harder but honestly that's not the case the second game is harder the first game had the living weapon in the first game made you absolutely broken if you know how to abuse living weapon you become a monster which thankfully they replaced with a different transformation mechanic with yokai shift and anima in the second game the story was like a dream in the second it caught my attention more than the first game the one area both games are lacking is the omnyo tree they could have added more fantasy and crazy magic other than just talismans and buffs there is a few cool looking spells but nothing that impressive the ninja tree actually has some naruto shippudden jutsu spells which is really cool they should have doubled down on that i just wished there was more yokai shifts in the second game because you only have brute phantom and feral and once you get used to them and how to play them than the variety starts to be limited there but thankfully the anima yokai skills make things fresh i have only played 1 mission of the first DLC in the first game so i haven't played the 3 DLC in both games so this is my review of the core of both games i'm sure the DLC makes the games even better and more complete from what i played the first mission in the first game of the first DLC some yokai enemies made a return from the Nioh 1 first DLC in nioh 2 overall the story and character progression actors was fantastic in the first game now that the game is polished on PS5 the graphics look good and not outdated the combat gameplay has always been the strong suit of nioh and it's phenomenal so much guardian spiirts to chose and different variety builds you can make the first game has so much replayability when you finish the game for the first time that's when it starts multiple difficulties higher tier rarirty weapons the abyss but the first time you play it's always a joy and after that the grinding doesn't feel repetitive in the second game team ninja took everything to another level increasing enemy variety more Yokai bosses than human bosses they made the story more interesting they brought back beloved characters they made the music a lot better they added more weapons and the yokai abilities are awesome which makes the game feel more fresh everyone that thought this is gonna be a nioh 1.5 was wrong it feels like a full sequal to nioh 1 they just played it safe both games are 10/10 if your looking for a bloodborne souls like experience this is even better this franchise has become more dear to me than the soul series with great characters fantastic story one of the best combat system in action games Japanese culture from which you can learn something two fantastic games which are more difficult than the soul series but are rewarding if you have the patience to learn and keep playing you can play thousands of hours solo or with friends or with randoms and have a blast. Nioh 2 is simply one of the best games ever made! Here it is with all DLCs. Best mechanics, really great style and design. Good graphics. If you play soulslike games- this one can be even better for you than Dark Souls series. Have not played the 1st part yet.. I know this is a well-loved game, but I can't be the only one that finds this so hard it's not enjoyable? I had a miserable experience with the very first boss (literally the second enemy you fight) on Nioh2. I play most games on ""Normal"" difficulty and there isn't even the option to reduce the difficulty. I understand this is good for some, but a really bad experience for someone like me.. The Nioh Collection is a really well-thought-out game with the ki pulse and the deep combat system with more thought-out mechanics, the bosses are really well made and the end game is amazing. with the abyss, divine items, The Nioh Collection has hundreds of hours in gameplay including the DLC for both games are fantastic. hey! i really loved this game infact i introduced this to my cousins and they love it too thankyou for making this game try to visit my page to learn more about this game 라이브카지노. The game a have played the most last year. Amazing combat system, amazing enemies and lots of hours of fun. Everything that was very good in the first game was improved.. Leave it to sony to sell you the game again instead of providing a ps5 version. I mean, it's Nioh, what isn't to love?. The only negative thing in this game is the story i hope they will have better writer’s in the future that can write a-good story but the game still great though. The game and extra content is great, but it still looks like I am playing the PS4 version at 60fps. With some of the remasters for the new consoles that I have seen, I feel this could have been done better. Even in 4k the anti aliasing is terrible. But gameplay wise, it is fantastic. Maybe not not worth the big price tag though as it doesn't't feel like a new game.","Nioh is an incredibly good combination of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden and Diablo . the base game is still very strong, but minor quality of life improvements help elevate both titles higher . the game is a must own on the ps5 for soulslike lovers ."
682.Final Fantasy VII Remake,"The legacy of the legend created a new legend. A Final Fantasy for the current generation of players from the veterans of video game history with an eternal glint of exceptionality. [Issue#303]. Final Fantasy VII Remake falls just short of perfection, but it’s clearly one of the best RPGs to release so far and is definitely a contender for RPG of the year. I’ll go as far to say that this is one of the most important RPG projects of our generation, and I do think everyone, fan of the original or no, should experience it.. Amazing soundtracks. Amazing graphics. Amazing gameplay. Fun mini games . I love all the characters. I love seeing their relationships grow. And love seeing their character development. I always wanted to play this game, since I was a teen. But the graphics ( original game ) were too old. I'm glad I'm able to experience this beautiful game.. I never played the original FFVII. I had heard amazing things from my dad, and when I was able to play Remake, I was so excited. This game has since become my favourite of all time. The story, characters, and beauty of the game are all amazing. But the gameplay and battles have to be the highlight. So fluid and fun, I could go on for hours. I've since platinumed the game twice. Definitely a must play on PS, would highly recommend to anyone.. Final Fantasy VII Remake is undoubtedly among the best of 2020. The first part of this remake meets every expectation, beyond its technical problems, and we are already hyped of what is to come. I dare say that it is one of the best installments in the series so far and I hope that this will become a new quality standard for Square Enix.. Final Fantasy VII is an ambitious retelling that updates its systems and story for the modern era. The new battle system is fantastic and does a superb job of blending strategy and action. Additional stories and character moments are appreciated, and the way each character is portrayed is perfect. Some technical aspects could be better, but if future installments maintain this trajectory, we can all rest easy.. Final Fantasy VII Remake brilliantly recreates the events of Midgar in a breathtaking way. Even though there's no denying just how amazing of an experience it is, the adventure within will still leave fans wanting much more.. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a deep, dense and strong invitation to rediscover an all-time classic, thanks to a new three dimensional approach of the vast city of Midgar. The game fills up so many gap, deepens the plot, and sometimes takes way too much time to take us from point A to point B. But thanks to a strong and evolving combat system, new looks of iconic characters and a brilliant work of reorchestration of Uemtasu's score. If only it could have gone just a little further.. Final Fantasy VII Remake manages to balance the introduction of new concepts with faithfully recreations of the original game’s most memorable aspects, but it also unnecessarily pads out this first installment in a larger story with too much downtime between its most striking moments.. The original Final Fantasy VII was a masterpiece. A legendary game that turned a generation of western gamers into FF fans. It launched the golden age of FF, with masterpieces like VIII and XI following on the same PlayStation One console. Those games stuck in the memory for years. They have never been forgotten. Sadly, FF has declined over time. Now Square hopes to rekindle past glories with remakes. And the only reason I played this was to see those amazing characters again. To visit the world I spend months living in. But it could have been better, much better. I knew I would be disappointed, so I delayed playing it. For me, it doesn't feel the same. A lot is missing. A lot of it has been changed, and continues to change in FFVII Rebirth. It's no longer the masterpiece I once played. It's a game for the times we live in. Made for the next generation. Dumbed down and altered. Stretched out with filler. The game has been stretched so much the story is no longer engaging. The modern hack and slash combat felt out of place and I didn't enjoy it at all. Turn based combat was a memorable part of the original classics. Part one of the remake was basically just the tutorial section in the original, but they made it into an entire game of it's own. It wasn't the most memorable part. Had I played this first I probably would have forgotten about it, and my love of FF would have never happened. The story and world of FFVII had evolved and changed many times of the years, with spin-off games and the like. Final Fantasy VII is no longer Final Fantasy VII.. Good game, but some designs choices were too stupid. -Worthless animations to cross narrow pass, just to waste your time. -There is an imbalance between gameplay and cutscenes/conversation. -Some fights are poorly designed, to the point that you aren't able to even see the character in some engagements. -Story is lackluster with a lot of filler, nothing made my eyes shine. -After Aerith is taken away, till the end of Chapter 14, story is terrible and dragging. -Stupid achievements behind Hard Mode.. wtf -Terrible English localization!. I am baffled by all the extremely overly positive ratings this game got. Stretching the first disc of ffvii out over 40 hours was achieved by adding boring and empty sidequests. Another really silly and annoying method was slooooowing doooown every animation sooo much that every part of the game feels sluggish. You can just tell when your ability to run was turned off for a bit during a convo ""just because""...this is just bad content The combat is NOT GOOD. I see people praising it but it is bad and annoying! Just smash buttons to see sparks fly (which they do a lot, you can barely keep track of what's happening on screen) and if you want to do something actually strategical the switching between characters is waaaay more cumbersome than in a traditional turn based system. To make things worse, while you're smashing buttons on one character the others are basically just standing there. They only use base attacks which are useless thanks to the massive emphasis on the staggering system which is supposed to provide some sort of anime-kick-ass-moment but it just makes the battles last endlessly long. Enemies also focus on the character you are controlling so the party members don't even help with spreading the attention of multiple enemies (there is basically no real AI in the party) making multi enemy fights a ****. The bossfights boil down to ""this boss is immune to this, this one to that..."" which means no real fighting but some puzzle that is really not fun in any shape or form. And with immune I mean ""this guy doesn't take physical damage, only ice. Oh you don't have ice materia? Well too bad for you"". Combine the fact that most of the content is added-on filler with the fact that every fight during that content is boring or annoying, and you're left with....what? Design, gfx, audio, voice overs are all of high quality. The thing they did with the story, I didn't need it but fine it's their IP to do something else with so I won't hold that against them (though as a 97 vet I'm pretty sure everyone would've been perfectly fine with the original story in a new coat. The new story so far doesn't impress). Sooo...what is this? A playable ""movie"" where the playable bits aren't that good, and the movie bits are ok but not as good as we expected... Can we please stop with the 9/10 ratings ""ermegerdbestgameever"" because it really is a dissapointment. One more tidbit: the original midgar wasn't an open world but at least it had some funny nooks and crannies that made it feel bigger than it was. Here you just get a popup saying you can't go here or there... so it's a friggin railshooter now...... I'd give it a six but all these 9/10 reviews are nonsense.... I didn't like this game, as someone who hasn't played the OG game. This is not my first FF game, and I played several before. - The amount of padding and filler basically **** the joy out of the game. It could have been a 20-hour game instead of 30+. - The presentation of the game at times feels like it's to pander to those who played the original and invoke nostalgia. The main villain, Sephiroth, is shown every hour, without a proper introduction or anything. You need to assume this guy is badass, because the game tells you. There's zero build-up. - The endgame boss is the lamest thing I've seen in a while, comparable to FFXIII fiasco. Not surprising, as it seems the writer is the same dude. For those who liked it, good on you. As a newcomer, I didn't enjoy it. P.S. The OST is great tho!",Final Fantasy VII Remake is one of the best installments in the series so far . it's brilliantly recreates the events of Midgar in a breathtaking way . the new battle system is fantastic and does a superb job of blending strategy and action .
683.Pokemon White Version,"Unfortunately during it's debut this masterpiece was not appreciate for many. The narrative is until this day the better in the whole series, and different what many people think, this is not a region about America, there is others regions based on America, this region is abou NY diversity and that make this story and characters so beautiful.. This is the best first release ****. This game has a much better story than other pokemon games. N was a great character. The pokdmon designs were great. And I loved that the gym leaders actually left their gyms on several occasions. I like that the 3d is used a lot more. There are some minor things. The story whilebetter than most isnt as good as people say it is. And the post game is kinda bad. Overall a solid 9/10. Highest peak of Pokemon games in my opinion (my favorite), but VERY unfortunately one of the lowest points if we want to talk about sales expectations for the franchise.. The best story ever told in this series, along with challenging game play, and an engaging region, slightly dragged down by your limited options in the early game.. Up until this point, Pokemon White is the only Pokemon Game I have fully beaten (as of now). I'm not sure whether that's because the game is good or I just got really attached to my Pokemon (all of which I named after sauces) but I feel more positively towards this entry in the series than all others that I have played. Funnily enough, it still retains a lot from the series that you can criticize, like random encounters or shallow game mechanics, but the simplicity of this game allows the attention to detail to shine a lot more. Recent Pokemon games feel obligated to go bigger or newer, which brings the core game way out of focus. Pokemon White expands upon what is necessary, which is why it still feels like a breath of fresh air all this time later. I mean, all the Pokemon designs are on-point, the story has layers, the environments are fresh, the side content is really cute, and the motivations of the rivals and villains are all so interesting. I feel confident in saying that Generation 5 provided what the other generations couldn't, and I still regard it as Pokemon's peak, even despite the increased focus on the DS's connective multiplayer (which is for the most part completely avoidable).. best pokemon experience avabile. still in 2024 no doubt, absurd that y and x have a better score. Best pokemon game ever made in history, how incredible this game is it looks like a joke, animated sprites, a magnificent story it also has the biggest pokedex so far. This game is rather alienating to veterans of the series, I get it. It's weird to have a roster of 150 fresh Pokémon, and have some of them be superior overhauls of previous designs in the series, such as the mysterious Musharna over the disturbing Hypno, or the drill-headed Excadrill, a redesign of the bland (yet SOMEWHAT amusing) Dugtrio. It's weird to have Bug and Poison Types that are actually usable and aren't just Route 1 Pokémon. It's weird to give a Pokémon game an actual story with actual plot, and a deep message about not submitting to the way others think and how they want this world to run. It's weird to have a region with environmental diversity (Hoenn aside). It's weird that they wanted players to have a breath of fresh air in the Regional Pokédex and not have Pikachu shoved into their face for the 800th time. It's weird how TM's are actually usable now and you don't have to fear losing one forever. This game is a gem and Sinnoh stans and genwunners should stop crying.. I have played all other main pokemon games,and for me this one is clearly the worst of them all. Yes the scenario is great, yes the musics are also great (just like in any other pokemon games) but the pokemon are forgettable and you will face only three of them until the 3th badge. When I play pokemon I want to build a good team and then face challenging opponents, but in this one I just kept my starter and destroyed the 4 first arenas. Then I just stopped playing because I was bored. 5/10. For me, this is the first true 3D game in the main series. I like the fact that the gamefreak tried to break away from the previous games, it feels like a breath of fresh air. The only thing I didn't like is that the moral of the story is too straightforward. I would even say childishly sugary. Nevertheless, I look back at society nowadays and realize that many people do not understand even such basic morals, so we need such stories, that teaches us simple things.. Worst pokemon game. Yes it has a great scenario, but the scenario is not the thing I want to be good in a Pokemon game. The new Pokemon are forgettable and there are not enough of them. You will always see the same Pokemon in tall grass, against the other trainers, team plasma, everywhere, which makes this game pretty boring. Pokémon with Good writing. Golden age of Pokemon. Ngl, the story isn't as amazing as people gas it to be, and it doesn't ""answer"" or ""confront"" any real issues/questions like youtubers like to say. It was great, just not THAT great. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. possibly the best pokemon game. the most interesting story of the franchise, much darker than the other games. i love the aesthetics of the game. the pokemon and character sprites are my all time favorite. it's engaging and fun. the main flaws are some unwatchable pokemon.. Probaby the best pokémon game that Game Freak has ever delivered to us players!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokemon White is one of the two main games of the fifth generation of the legendary Pokemon games franchise (the other being Pokemon Black). It was released in 2011. The game follows the tried and true recipe of a Pokemon game. This time you travel around the Unova region, apparently based on the greater New York area. You get a great story, fighting the mysterious Team Plasma, having fun with your annoying friends and battling your way around the obligatory loop. There is a great deal of post-game content available after you beat the Elite Four for the first time. There is a weird level jump that might force you to grind paradoxically right after you beat the Elite Four. Otherwise it is top notch. The graphics is likeable. The difficulty is not great, but it can still get challenging at times. You do not meet Pokemon from other regions until you beat the Elite Four, which kinda ****, only because the fifth generation Pokemon are really ugly. Very personal opinion, of course. I played this game on PC using the DeSmuMe emulator. No microtransactions or SJW politics are present in this game. Pokemon White is a very good game with interesting gym design and ugly Pokemon. Final Verdict: 82%. I would give this game a 10 but the sequel honestly is a bit better. Still an amazing game though!. The year is now 2022 and everyone remembers these games fondly. I personally have no idea why. They’re not hard like everyone says? They’re easy. They story isn’t amazing like everyone says? It’s only N who’s interesting. The post game isn’t waaaay more interesting then other games? It’s the same formula as the other games. Elite 4, catch all Pokémon. This game is praised as being the best Pokémon game and ALL others released after it are “so beyond bad”. I beg to differ, this is the game that started the annoying trend in Pokémon games of characters non stop talking. The game that started the button mashing. Sun and Moon are the worst for non stop talking but this is where it started. This game also has next to no variety in Pokémon. Early game you’re so very limited for choice, end game you have more choice but it’s end game. Lame. This game also gave us the elemental monkey Pokémon so ew. 3/10.. One of, if not the best Pokemon games. Great visuals and spritework, an interesting story, cool new mechanics such as triple battles, and the game actually has a degree of difficulty at times(which the newer games lack). Lots of post-game content as well.. Realistically this game probably isn't a 9 out of 10. It still falls into many of the pitfalls that the other pokemon games do. There's a lack of difficulty, simplified gameplay, and a lack of significant change when compared to the other games. However, I still love it. Beaten this game and Pokemon Black maybe 5 time combined and every time I enjoy it just as much. A surprising step forward for pokemon when it comes to storytelling, as this time it actually poses questions and ideas that encourage the player to think about the actions they are taking, even if it's still comparatively basic to other RPG stories. The sprite work and world design is at its best here, love the culture of Unova and its varied settings. I like how the gym leaders actually play a role in the world and in the story, with you often times working alongside them, instead of just doing a fetch quest for them or finding them in a random spot. Has some of my favorite music in the series, namely Ns theme, Driftveil, Nimbasa, and the Elite 4. Has it's flaws but I just like it too much not to rate it highly.. This seriously is the best game I have ever played. The gameplay is fast, yet satisfying as well as all of the characters. Arguably one of the best stories in all of pokemon. AND THE MUSIC HOLY COW. I could go on and on for hours about how incredible the game actually is, however I guess for now I'm just going to leave a 10 on this one : ). This is one of my favorite pokemon games of all time. I love the story. It's even alittle disturbing and sad but that's at the end. I remember getting the game and beating it in a few weeks. I needed my brothers pokemon to beat the final bosses. The game can get hard and while some people may complain about the game being linear, I don't mind because pokemon ruby and sapphire was pretty much just as linear and no one complained. However pokemon white 2 has way more exploration. I also have to say that the post game isn't the best, it's still a better post game than some of the other previous games. One thing I also love is that they unlocked the older pokemon at the post game so that way I can get acquainted with them rather than just use older pokemon. Lastly this game is nostalgic to me because I played more of the game after I beat it during the time I graduated high school. There was ship I went on during that time and then when I started playing the game again, I went on the ship and it was one of the most magical feelings I got. Especially with the music. Who cares about some ice cream pokemon.. The story of this Pokémon game is different from its predecessors. It’s more serious and trying to be mature and profound.. I remember playing Pokémon White when I was a child and having a hard time knowing why B/W even existed, but the more I grew, the more I noticed that Pokémon B/W are indeed the best games in the franchise even at this day. Pokémon B/W succesfully tell the most mature plot in any Pokémon game, making a focus on character development and presenting a constant clash between truth and ideals, making this the reason of the names, different ways of seeing something, but more than dividing in Black and White, finding shades of gray between both. That made a huge impact on me when playing this game at this age. Pokémon B/W shows different ways of growth and acceptance with our rivals, N, Bianca and Cheren, every one connected to the main character in one way or another, but at the same time, so unique and far away from our truth and ideals, each having their own. In this game, even characters like Gym Leaders are important, and the champion is arguably the best in any Pokémon game, helping our characters to grow and develop. Pokémon B/W made a daring decision with its art style, making moving 2D sprites and taller more mature looking overworld, using sometimes 3D animation, something unbelievable taking into consideration Nintendo DS' hardware. This game also introduced the most amount of new Pokémon, making team building feel fresh and unique, as if back on Red / Blue. A lot of people didn't like this, but in my opinion, it changed the way I played future titles, using only new Pokémon. 5th gen OSTs are, also, pretty good, and I've seen a lot of people who say the same, some even saying its one of the best Pokémon has seen ever, but I think this is totally subjective, even though I really like it, and say it's memorable. If I had to say something I dislike, is mythical Pokémon encounters. B/W started a trend I actually dislike a lot, making these Pokémon gifts at the Pokémon center, something rarely seen in previous generations, where, for example, you could get Darkrai, Shaymin and other Pokémon in special areas made for them. Overall, Pokémon Black and White, in my opinion, are the best games in the franchise, and I totally recommend giving them a shot, if possible.. Really good main game, people will say it is linear, but that's just the layout of the map. The routes offer a satisfying amount of exploration, unlike Swsh, for example. It's only lacking in meaningful post game content.. 85/100 The developers with this one tried to make Pokémon a little more mature and the result is the most interesting and captivating iteration of the franchise.. garbage. i regret purchasing it, even unworthy of being pirated. to this day the bottom of the barrel of the entire franchise. When i first played Pokèmon White, it was an unforgetable time and i seriously had so much fun. Playing them again, they are still as good as i remember. The music is SO good and my favorite in the whole franchise, the character designs are fantastic, with highest quality waifus ever; Hilda, Skyla and Elesa. Both Hilda and Hilbert are the best avatars for the player in any Pokèmon, in my opinion of course. Unova is a beautiful region made better with season changing. Unova`s routes are more linear now, but i can forgive it, cause they are expansive. Though Unova and its Routes does not match the glory of Hoenn, Sinnoh and their routes. The new Pokèmon are like any other Generation for me. Some good, some that i truly love, some bad and some i hate, but only having new Pokèmon and placing older ones to post Elite Four made the games feel more fresh for me too and i loved it. The sprites are amazing here too, i must say. The story is alot of fun and feels more significant. You can argue wheter its truly good or not, but i enjoyed it and thats all that matters. The post game once again allows me to explore new areas, which is all i ask for as post game for Pokèmon For me, these games and their sequels are the definitive way to play Pokèmon. I could go on and on and on about how great these games are, but nah. I love them so much. Fun story, great music, wonderful region and a great new cast. White is my favorite Pokèmon game of all time. Ill leave this review with an appeal: Game Freak, please DO NOT REMAKE GENERATION 5!!! They are great enough as they are!!!. Story is a main focus for this game. Pokemon had been adding more and more story to their games up to the release of Pokemon White Version and this game delivered one of the best stories yet. It challenges many things that you think about the Pokemon world and treats you more like a true hero than a kid playing a video game. Almost all of the new content to this game is memorable and fantastic, especially the season changing feature, where the seasons in game will change every few weeks. Pokemon White Version also had the cleanest graphics and art out of all of the 2D Pokemon games to compliment its variety of music, moods, and events. The reason this game falls a bit short is mostly its ambitiousness not quite paying off. The quick connection feature is something you rarely use, that Game Freak seems to have put a lot of time into. It seems like they wanted to expand into an online oriented game before moving the series to 3DS, when they should have waited for their next main series game instead. The ""triple battles"" was something I was so excited for when the game first came out, but I'm not sure I ever even used it. Most of what Game Freak did for this game, was a massive leap for the series, but they tried to do too much, too fast. The game is definitely an exciting and engaging one, but too many features were a let down.. Despite the fact that Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are my main childhood Pokemon games and the ones I have the most nostalgia for I definitely consider Pokemon Black & White to be my personal favourite games in the series. I consider this game to be the last ""amazing"" game in the series as it pretty much did everything right, from its design to its music to its story to even it's aesthetic. The mix between 2D and 3D graphics actually brings an amazing amount of style to this game's visual approach as it allows for a lot more perspective and can actually create some of the best atmosphere in the series and it also prevents the game from ever looking dated. The music is extremely memorable and quite funky at times but also rather engaging to the point where it actually makes certain battles in the game a lot more epic and intense. The Pokedex for the Unova region is probably where the game can be considered weak in comparison to most of the Pokedex's that came before it however the fact that you can only capture the regional Pokemon until the post-game is actually a great addition as it allows you to build a more diverse team that actually ends up holding more sentimental value to you than you'd expect. But by far my favorite thing about this game is surprisingly enough its story and characters simply due to the fact that a Pokemon game has never directly gone as deep into it's story as Black and White has.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story is bad, but not as bad as before, Pokémon designs are horrible, more inspired by Kanto than ever and most of them evolve at high levels so you won't be able to see their final form in the maingame this time around, maingame is short and difficulty is a joke... But... The game is pretty fun to play and it improved a lot all of the flaws Diamond and Pearl or Platinum had. It really feels like a DS game, not like those. Also the music is as always very good.. Well made game,the fact that only 5th gen Pokemon is available until you beat the elite 4 and then all the other gets available and you get to revisit the region and catch them all is awesome. For fans of the old versions, there's a handful of new features in Black/White to embark on the adventure once more. Similar to other pokemon games, the adventure is similar. Your adventure starts off in your home in a small town in the region of Unova. Soon after you will be given your choice of the starter pokemon. Three of them possessing the types: fire, water and grass. You will be accompanied by two friends that will embark on a journey with you to fill the pokedex and collect all 8 badges, beat the elite four and become champion. They act more or less as helpers throughout your journey. I would like to note that there is much more personality in each character compared to older versions, which gives the story more of a taste. Now as you all know there is always an antagonist that is trying to go against the common good, and in this game it would be Team Plasma. I don't want to give too many details about this organization, as that will spoil too much, but I like how the game had them impact the storyline in an interesting way. Another great addition to black and white is the replay value. Not only is there wi-fi to keep players occupied battling it out with others, but there are plenty more to discover after the main story is completed. All the other pokemon in the national pokedex are available for encounter after completing the game. A lot of people probably wished they were available from the get-go, but its good the game forces you to use the new pokemon first. The elite four also become stronger after you have beaten the game, so that you can always go back and have a challenge or get a good amount of exp. The most distinct aspect of pokemon black and white at first glance is probably the graphics. Yes, the graphics in battle and the environment are greatly improved. Especially the 3rd city you enter. The buildings and the camera angle produce an amazing view of the area. The bridge that leads to this city is great looking too. The only objects that appear as sprites are the people, but all environmental things are 3D models. They did a great job on the improvement of the graphics. Everything looks really cool. For the sceptics this is obviously for the DS' standards. If you do decide to buy this new version of pokemon, make sure to check out the differences in the versions, because not only are there pokemon differences, but there is also certain location differences. Depending on what sounds better for you, you should get that version. There are a bunch of black/white version comparisons on YouTube or Google. Just search it up. Thank you for reading. If you enjoyed my review please add me and track me. I will write more.. The best in the mainline Pokemon series beyond a shadow of a doubt. It's got the greatest number of original Pokemon introduced and the best story of the main Pokemon games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game has a very good plot, the history is a bit more adult than te other games', and this is very good. Unova is a fantastic region, with a very different atmosphere. In general, I think this is the most adult Pkmn game, and the most ambitious and different one, and also the best.. Generation V of Pokemon is my favorite but this game is, in my opinion, amazing. One of the best villain groups in the entire series, led by one of the best characters in the entire series make this game have the best story, in the entire series. As far as post-game content goes, this one's chock-full of stuff, especially for Pokemon.. this is so cool bro pokemon white dude big chungus im pogging so hard rn even my **** is hard this game is very poggers and gamer. One of my favorite Pokémon games of all time. The story is phenomenal, the characters are the best in the series and many of the new Pokémon live up to or surpass all previous designs in the series.. Gen 5 of pokemon provides another fun and entertaining entry to the series; but thats all it is. While the previous entries to the generation felt innovative, exciting, and fresh, gen 5 felt like more of the same, without the heart of the previous entries. Don't get me wrong; it's still an incredibly fun game, and any pokemon fan would love this generation. The new pokemon look great, and the cities do as well. It just doesn't live up to the quality of it's predecessors, and I personally found myself a little bored pretty quickly. Still, this game should be played by pokemon fans.. Pokemon games have always been too slow for me. The game is enjoyable though.. Nowadays all of us agree that Pokémon peaked in gen 5. Black and White 2 were greatly acclaimed but Black and White themselves are no exception. An original story with interesting characters, the Pokémon soft reboot concept, the perfect soundtrack and aesthetic appeal of 2D sprite design on it's peak compared to the disaster that is Pokémon 3D models all help drive this point home.. For a long time I took the opinion only the first (and maybe the second) generation is great. I saw some of the Pokemon of the 4th and 5th generation and tought to myself: ""what the hell went wrong with Pokemon?! These creatures look so ugly!"" Someday I gave this generation a chance with no high hopes; I'm so glad that i dit this. I got a fantastic game with a beautiful and interesting story from the beginning. (Maybe the best storyline in all pokemon-games) It also feels totally new with so many new Pokemon and a giant (but beautifully designed) map. Anyway i totally understand people when they say ""those Pokemon look so ugly!"" - they are kinda right... I still dont like the designs of the legendaries to this day. But after a few hours in-game you will learn to deal with them and kinda fell in love with some of them. So 9 out of 10 because the Pokemon-design is lacking a bit. Let me tell you, I was absolutely sceptical before playing this game. But I can highly recommend it if you are a Pokemon-lover like me.. Best generation of Pokemon without a doubt. Not only has the best story out of all the games but also it reached its top with pokemon sprites (that I prefer over 3D models). I feel like it is one of the most underrated Pokemon games, having one of the most distinctive and visible split opinions out of all the games. Some will say that the designs are awful and uncreative but in my opinion, these games contain some of the best Pokemon designs, being Chandelure, Victini, Volcarona, Bisharp, Reuniclus and so much more, ones of my favorites. Another counterargument I hear a lot is that it's just a gen 1 rip-off, but even though it is true for some cases, the possibility to experience a similar gameplay experience with a 151-Pokemon Pokedex with only new Pokemon it's worth it. Of course, there's a lot of crap, but what do you expect from them, the had to make 151 new Pokemon, 151! That's not even close to the number of Pokemon we are getting these days! My point is that they ran out of ideas, of course, but is it too difficult to appreciate the effort they put to create these games and some of the good designs? Is it too difficult? According to most people and the rating, apparently yes. I'm just leaving this around here, and if you found this and made it through this whole comment, congratulations! You're probably either entitled and disagreeing or you were searching for a comment like this and you're nodding with your head, which seems improbable, but who knows. Either way, I'm reposting this on Black Version too, hoping for a person with a similar opinion to find this. And please, if you haven't played this masterpiece yet, just give it a try, you'll definitely enjoy it.. The Best Game ever. A very underrated generation in its launch year, but now, the time has put this game in its truly place.. Best story in a pokemon game and a big step up in graphics from gen 4 and gen 2 remakes.. I felt that this game was lacking something as soon as i created my character. It just wasn't impressive to me. The pokemon just looked really average and un-outstanding, and this is probably a polarising opinion, but i didn't like the new visuals of this game compared to previous generations. But it still is a pokemon game, and it still has good qualities about it which makes it a game worth playing . Personally i prefer pokemon platnium and the games before.. I wrote this in the Black version: Everyone says that this games have the best story in the franchise but they DON'T. Story is silly as hell, Ghetsis is dumb just revealing his ""master plan"" to everyone every time he appears, Team Plasma is just a bad filler full of stupid dialogues doing incoherent stuff all the way. It's just really DUMB and childish. The game only tells you something interesting at the beginning and at the very end, because the rest is just the same dull characters repeating their favourites words to remember you what to do. Disgusting. The plot make no sense at all since the moment they say you are the chosen one because: yes. And let's not forget the bad Pokédex type balance, the MOST linear region of them all, the ugly and Kanto inspired Pokémon designs you must use (thanks GF for improve designs in the new generations), the pretentious the plot is always trying hard to be, the region being bland and similar to Kanto, the short main game... This game can be one of the worst games in the franchise with XY.. Hand holding started here. Difficulty in this game ****, being the final boss the only ""hard"" battle, and it's in fact easy. Pokémon got boring with this generation. Unova map is linear as hell. For me this is one of the worst Pokémon games. This game doesn't have the essence of Pokémon, even the interface is boring and dull.. This it it folks, Gen 5 (Ironically as a gen 5 fanboy I never played the sequels, yet) The pinnacle of Pokémon games (cuz the B&W Anime is trash) Your favourite Pokémon Charizard? Get’em straight outta here! (Until you can transfer it) Pokémon White version casts you directly into a new world filled with philosophy, friendship and betrayal The story is this game is truly great for Pokémon standards and is to this day, the least “safe” Pokemon has ever played it. And it payed off big time Memorable characters are literally everywhere (shoutout my main boi Grimsley and the greatest Pokémon character of all time N) The music in this game is truly next level, equal to the superb Ruby/Sapphire soundtrack in my books The new Pokémon really aren’t bad, some are worse than others but this Generation overall made solid additions to the Pokédex If you are looking for a traditional Pokémon adventure this one is probably not for you, but if you are willing to play Pokémon differently (don’t mash through the dialogue) then this game will definitely be for you. Pretty meh... the pokemons designs feel uninspired and the plot is pretty stupid. Very well made game. Progression is super smooth making your life very easy, basically zero grinding is needed. HM's are almost not needed to progress. Story is pretty good for pokemon game. Visually the world is really bland, concentrating all visuals around gyms. Over all nothing revolutionary for pokemon games but still fun.. to this day, this is still my favorite pokemon game. i don't think gamefreak will ever make a pokemon game better than black and white.. Unafraid to break from the conventions of previous series traditions, Pokemon Black/White are some of the most ambitious entries in their franchise and they're all the better for it. Graphically it builds upon the 2D characters/3D world style established by the 4th Generation of games and builds a vibrant new world unlike any prior region, featuring bustling city scapes and attractive outdoor environments which change dramatically with the shift of in-game seasons. Pokémon themselves have shifted from ststic 2D sprites to crisply animated sprites which portray a lot more character in even the simplest motions and make things feel much nore alive. The soundtrack has a very unique flavour compared to prior games, experimenting with layered and adaptive musical tracks on the overworld while featuring a variety of interesting and different themes for actual battles. Mechanically, this is one of the smoothest games in the series, featuring many QoL improvements and improvements upon established systems. Rotation battles and Triple battles are an interesting gimmick and fun to experiment with, but ultimately fail to secure their place as a solid mechanic and be anything more than a gimmick. The narrative of the game is perhaps one of the most interesting evolutions, going beyond the normally rather simple good vs bad plots of the prior games and featuring a more extensive and prevalent story wherein the villain's aims can be considered more morally righteous than the player themselves. In terms of content, Black/White took the radical decision not to feature any of the Pokémon featured in past games until the post-game, leading the player to explore through a world that feels entirely new. While this might be divisive amongst some people, I feel it's entirely to the game's advantage and creates a brand new world that feels fresher than ever. Plus, thanks to the transfer service available within the game, those 'mons thst don't have a place in the world can be imported fron the prior games meaning none are left out. On the topic of post-game, Black/White features a fantastic selection of content to enj","the story isnt as good as people say it is, and the post game is kinda bad . up until this point, Pokemon white is the only pokemon game that i have fully beaten . i still regard it as Pokemon's peak, even despite the increased focus on the DS ."
684.Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies,"one of my fav, packed with many contents and it has high replay value, truly the AAA ds game. For a DS game, it's impressive. Akira Toriyama's character designs come to life in this handheld adventure. The sprites are charming, the environments are colorful, and it's like a pocket-sized fantasy world that fits snugly in your hands. Gameplay: Gameplay-wise, it's classic Dragon Quest. Turn-based battles, a party of customizable characters, and a world to explore – it's like the series never missed a beat. The job system is a welcome addition, adding a layer of strategy and customization that keeps things fresh. Soundtrack: Now, let's talk tunes. Koichi Sugiyama's compositions are the lifeblood of the Dragon Quest series, and ""IX"" is no exception. The music is whimsical, epic, and it's like a musical journey through a fantastical realm. It's the kind of soundtrack that stays with you long after you put the DS down. Story: And the narrative – it's a departure from the usual Dragon Quest formula. Customizable protagonists, a celestial plotline, and a more personal touch to the storytelling. It's like the series took a risk, and for the most part, it pays off. In conclusion, ""Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies"" is a solid entry in the series that successfully marries tradition with innovation. The multiplayer focus might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the charm, the music, and the classic Dragon Quest feel make it a worthy addition to your DS library. I've played over 100 games on the Nintendo ds/ 3ds and around 50 more on other platforms (Switch, Steamdeck & PS4) and I can still say that this is my favorite game of all time. Yes, I will admit, nostalgia is playing a role in this, but let me tell you: considering this game's release year and platform, this is the best experience you could've ever possibly gotten- and here's why: (once again, I have to stress this was a ds game over a decade ago, which makes all of this very special); - you have character customization. It's already a shame you can't pick between genders in the vast majority of games and DQ games in general, but here they just gave you the opportunity to customize you height, hair style, skin & eye color, eye shape... - also, your armor will actually appear on your character and party - there are plenty of fighting classes, and a whole building system for you and your whole party. You can keep abilities from your chosen classes and thereby customize your strengths and playing style! - the story and exploration factor is HUGE. You can easily spend a minimum of 20-40 hours on the main story and have fun exploring all these wonderfully designed different cities, areas and dungeons. the world is also very colorful (something I love about DQ games in general) and despite taking a 3d instead of pixel approach, everything looks really nice! - if the main story is over, you still have plenty of quests and dungeons to continue with your game! - the music is ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Played and recorded by a live orchestra, there is not a single game where the music has taken such an emotional and impressive effect on me. Seriously, the soundtrack is just absolutely amazing and varied - there is a whole alchemy (= crafting) system where you can further improve your attributes with, and the armor etc. have great designs There is probably so much more I can say about this game, but I think those are the most important aspects. Over the course of a decade I've put around 400hours in this game and it will forever have a special place in my heart. As most likely no one will read a review about a 13year old ds game, regardless, this is my way of saying thank you to the people responsible for creating this game and big part of my childhood. (*´˘`*)♡. Dragon Quest IX is packed with loads of content, and customization you can simply waste hours on this game without realizing it! The soundtrack maybe nonexistent and the story isn’t award winning. But DQIX easily crawled its way into my heart as one of the best RPGs I have ever played!. Single- (or Coop-Multiplayer) basically MMO with a lovely story, a great JRPG style and great balancing, all while having a super genuine story, great humor (especially monster names) and a lovely soundtrack - only downside is the rather tedious grinding that comes with both MMOs and JRPGs I guess (especially when changing classes). The latest entrant in the series was developed specifically for the DS and so has the hugely upgraded presentation you'd expect but sacrifices the quirky humour and sense of fun of the earlier games. A very attractive and playable RPG but I personally prefer the old school SNES reinventions for that reason.. This is the game that introduced me to Dragon Quest. It can be unforgiving at times, owing to some of its dated mechanics, but if you're willing to put up with that, you'll find that DQIX is shockingly addictive. On top of the main story, there's a massive amount of postgame content you can tackle... but it was unlocked via Nintendo WFC despite being on the card. There are ways around that, though.. The DQ game i've spent most time ever. Truly rich in its gameplay. I hope they will do a remake of this one in the future.. graphic and story are beautiful music is perfect story and citys 12/10 eq design 10/10 realy good game. The most customizable, free and funny Dragon Quest, with an amazing battle system, job system and skill system. Story is kind of episodic but still good.. This game starts off at a good pace and eventually gets boring. Egregious use of recolored enemies instead of new ones, slow ship exploring, everything and place being a pun instead of taking itself at least a little bit seriously, and the same damn music for every town and dungeon and cutscene; it all adds up to a large growing frustration as you play deeper into the game.. Playing it for the first time in 2020 and the game is still impressive, literally the best JRPG on the Nintendo DS, im not a big fan of turn-based RPGs but Dragon Quest IX is a masterpiece. This game is my childhood, It is really great, Emotional, Cheering and very challenging in some parts. It is a great way to enjoy Dragon Quest on the go, You fight a lot of bosses, But after defeating them you feel you accomplished something. I highly recommend it, Its cheap and nice. I bought a used Japanese copy for 980 Yen. Perfect, That is all i can say. Heartwarming And exciting but also saddening sometimes. You need to quite level up for the bosses, Though it just makes it more fun. I highly reccomend it.. While comparing it to the rest of the Dragon Quest series (a.k.a DQ1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, Monster Joker 1 + 2 and slime) it can be said clearly that Dragon Quest IX is one of the best in the series. Although it's a DS only it's a massive experience. Involves a rich story, has outfits which can be seen, a perfect party system and a good leveling up system. Comparing this game further on to DQ10 and DQ 11 it can be even more said that this game is the best one and the most advanced which makes it the odd one out. I would highly recommend this RPG game to everyone because I just can't describe how good my experience was with it. I have been playing it ever since it's release and I still am playing it postgame leveling up my grotto bosses!. It's nice but would have been *so* much better as the action rpg it was meant to be. Goddammit, purists!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I must say it is hard to put this game down I love the controls the story is very cool and it has amazing graphics for a DS game. It feels like an open world with lots of dungeons to go through and you can create your own character even put on equipment that displays on your characters model. Amazing Dragon Quest game 10/10. A traditional JRPG that does about everything right. It has the classic turn based combat system that we all know (and most people like/love) but it has an edge over the older JRPG's with the new addition of seeing random encounters on the overworld and because of that being able to dodge or attack specific monsters. The story is typical dragon quest, yet it has some refined edges around it that make it stand out in the series. Not to mention the sheer size of this game, just the story will take you over 50 hours to complete and none of it will feel like a bore. As usual with Dragon quest games: the music Is a piece of art written by the well known Koichi Sugiyama. His music sounds epic and nostalgic without being bloated or pretentious. The character designs are great as well, being made by the legendary Akira Toriyama (Dragon ball Z). What sets this game apart from the other Dragon quest titles: + Enemies visible when out of combat (no more pure random encounters) + Massive postgame content in the form of dungeons, weapons and much more (some are download by wi-fi and thus discontinued though) + Creatable characters: you create your own character AND companions (choosing their class and appearance) - The companions have pretty much no impact on the story since they're self-inserts For those new to Dragon Quest: - You can create weapons, armor and items by using drops or items that grow in the overworld - Turn based combat - Great music - Long interesting storyline -Class system (Warrior, mage, ranger...) Would definetly recommend this game to anyone who has played or wants to play a classic JRPG, heck I would recommend this game to just about anyone.. It's a really good Dragon Quest game. I have a few complaints. The wi-fi isn't supported anymore which removes some of the content. Another issue is that NPCs are too verbose. When I go to save I don't want to here the life story of the priest. Likewise, every time I buy or sell something I don't need the shopkeeper to reset the scene ""Oh, hi is there anything I can help with?"" ""Thank you. Will there be anything else?"" ""Oh, you'd like to sell something? I can help with that."" ""What would like to sell."" ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" ""You want to sell something else?"" ""I can help you with that."" I just want to sell/buy stuff. I know how to do it. I've played all the other dragon quests. This type of dialogue bogs down saving/healing/job changing. Lastly, battles go pretty slow. Biggest problem is when an enemy casts a spell that hits everyone. Instead of the outcome populating at the same time, you have to watch each character: ""Hit with blah spell..."" ""... but it isn't effective."" Again, it would be an easy thing to optimize that wouldn't take away from the old-school charm DQ that's such a part of the series.. This is arguably the best DS game in existence, as it isn't one of those boring linear-plot licensed ones. This game has a VERY easy combat system, a brilliant story and possibly some of the best graphics I have ever seen in a game. GOOD POINTS: I. The combat system. II. It doesn't take itself too seriously by putting obvious stereotypes all over the place. III. It's possibly the only Digital Role-Playing Game on the DS. IV. Fully customizable characters. V. A variety of seemingly everything. VI. A post game story that's longer than the actually game. BAD POINTS: I. When looking at how long it took me to complete, I realized it took me over 7000 HOURS to finish, which is far too long for anybody to cope with. II. You can't go back to the Observatory after you finish the game.. I am going to say this now. This is my favourite game of all time. The addicting game play, varied character customisation, catchy soundtrack, intense story, amazing humour, beautiful visuals for it's hardware, likeable characters, huge world - all of them add up to a masterpiece. I have always been a big fan of the Dragon Quest series, but I always expect decency from them, not phenomenons. And that's exactly what this game is. It's a JRPG that can be enjoyed by both JRPG fans, but also those who don't favour them much. If this gets an HD release for the switch, Nintendo can shut up and take my money!. It starts off great - great music, great quirky feel, great somewhat original story idea, great party creation. But it slowly degenerates into a grind. Quests are ridiculously time-consuming for modest rewards and leveling up is slow before long. I'm still giving it a 7 because I got almost 20 hours before the grind killed all the fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The only game on my DS I play without get bored. I love the battle system it reminds me of former RPGs on snes. The best game for ds you must play it.. Dragon Quest IX is my favorite DS Game. This is the perfect JRPG. I have 200+ hours of gameplay on this and still haven't finished all the sub-quests. It follows the original old-school JRPG Formula, but adds more to it. The graphic are one of the best graphics i have seen on the DS, the soundtracks are still into my mind and the story was great! Every single city has his sub-story which you get involved in. The map is huge and on 3 layers, one layer that you can reach by walking, one that you can reach by boat and one that you can reach only ****... a flying train. The designer of this game is the legendary Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragonball and he worked perfectly on this game. It is a shame tat this game is not so famous outside of Japan, where it is the twelve best-selling game of ALL TIME.. One of my favorite games! This game is so epic! The Story, the soundtrack... i love it so much!! The charakter designe is like in every Dragon Quest Game nice.. I find this game highly overrated. It has a mediocre story, no character progression which is compounded by your party is nobodies so they are robots following you, and the camera is awful. Monsters spawn on map can be seen as both a novel idea because battles can be avoided or a huge annoyance because some of the spawn right in front of you or spawn/wander around when you have the menu open which will allow them to enter battle when the menu closes. Which brings me to the camera. The world is 3d but doesn't rotate 360 because to save on detail some characters are 2d sprites (think Ragnarok online) this becomes a huge pain in certain dungeons with high walls so you can actually see where you are going well (Prime example Quarantomb) and also compounded by the fact that monsters spawn right in front of you. Since the camera is also zoomed close to the ground it is difficult to avoid certain mobs. Which brings me to map design, the maps are actually pretty nice but they seemed to be designed for monsters not being spawned on map. Some monsters take up a whole walkway and can't be avoided and can be quite annoying to deal with. Few other points -The characters classes are alright and it is nice that there are so many different ones -Being able to change classes is great but it comes a bit too late in my opinion -The world is well crafted and nice to have alchemy pickups -Alchemy is a bit annoying but is fixed a bit better with a lot of recipes being available more readily. The alchemy pot should be at EVERY inn though or with you. All in all I think this is just a cry for the old times instead of a push to improve. I love old RPGs like this, DQ8 is one of my top fav RPGs but I feel that DQ9 was a small misstep.. Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies just doesn't live up to its predecessor. This is mediocrity at its best. The story and most of the characters are dull for the most part. The big draw to this game was supposed to be the four player co-op but I doubt a lot of people actually got to play it that way and as a result you end up with a group of silent protagonists which obviously doesn't help the plot. This game really seems to be aimed at a younger audience, nothing wrong with that of course, but it offers close to zero value for a more mature gamer. This was one of the few games that might've convinced me to buy a DS but instead it ended up making me take a pass. The art style is great but nothing new here since it's just like previous games. The only real positive thing about this game is the wide variety of customization options.. I have spent an unhealthy 300+ hours on this game, but it was worth every second. This game is very addictive, but that's because there's so many things to do. While I wasn't a big fan of Akira Toriyama's art at first, it did grow on me because of this game. The story isn't blockbuster worthy, but it still pulls you further in, and the localization quirks and touches are absolutely hilarious. And as a last word, I'm always a **** for character customization and diverse class options. There's just so many ways to really make you, you. Art: 8 Music: 8 Writing: 9 Gameplay: 10. A modest adventure is bogged with over-complication of items, spiky difficulty and anti-strategic mechanics. For the premium experience you may have been expecting, consider Dragon Quest IV DS instead.. If you love old-fashioned JRPG's and traditional turn-based combat, this is the perfect game that you simply can't pass up. Dragon Quest IX is a very traditional JRPG that apologetically uses game mechanics identical to old RPG's on the NES the series first started on, but this is by no means a bad thing. Your character and your allies are all made from scratch, giving you free reign to come up with personalities and backstories for each of them, but some might not like the fact that the entire party is a voiceless cast. I do like the freedom to determine your party size. Go solo, and you'll have more challenges while getting more EXP. have one, two, or even three companions with you and you can make battles easier while at the same time making it longer to grind with each party member and upping the cost of equipment for each character. The menu based system for buying and selling is really one of the only flaws I can point out. It makes buying and selling items very long and drawn out and you spend a lot of unnecessary time just trying to **** up some money for your next set of armor. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that I spent more time grinding money than I was experience trying to keep my party updated with equipment. I only had a party of 3, but it was still very hard to get the armor and weapons everyone needs. If this game got rid of the menu based shop system and gave you discounts for large party sizes on equipment, this game would be perfect. Definitely a game that you cannot miss.. A great entry to an equally great RPG series with a lot of charm, story and post-game content. Also, it's fitting that I would see a Dragon Quest title released exclusively on a handheld gaming device since I was first introduced to the series with Dragon Warrior I & II for the Game Boy Color.. This is an RPG in the classic sense, and features pretty much everything a fan of the genre could ask for. There are endearing characters, perfect gameplay, interesting dungeons. The storyline is incredibly well-crafted; a tale of redemption that keeps you guessing all the way to its pungent, apotheotic conclusion. The expansive world is expertly constructed, with secrets lurking in every unrevealed area and even in the revealed ones. As if all of that weren't enough, the game offers TONS of reason to keep playing even after finishing the main quest. There is a practically infinite amount of extra dungeons, where you can get weapons, ingredients (important for the immersive weapon-crafting mini-game), and face loads of new bosses. There are special battles with bad guys from older DQ games. There are even some extra quests that actually pull the story forward, further developing the characters. Sentinels of Starry Skies is not only the best original RPG for the DS, it's a strong contender for the best game in the platform.. The game itself is very well made,the classes are good,the combat is good,and the storyline is pretty good.Lots of post game content.Free **** only fault in the game is that your companions don't talk.Ever.Also the multiplayer is pretty good.. I find this game a fun game from out of the other dragon quest so i recommend this game because it hard and the most hardest is the metal king slime he gives a lot of eperance points. Best Ds game I have ever played so far. An amazing game witch was fantastic start to finish. The only problom is that multiplayer with friends [witch is fun] is just more helping your friend but not level up your own charatcer just to help but still a fantastic game. Dragon Quest 9 8.8/10. I have to say that this is the best game I have played on a handheld device so far. Pretty visuals (given the limitations of DS), good controls, cute story... and it is pretty addicting too! I am just hoping for a 3DS Dragon Quest now!. Gameplay: 10 - Perfect. This is a JRPG at its best. Turn-based combat is perfected; random encounters are absent; there's even co-op! Story: 8 - Great. The story is hindered by the silent protagonists, but the ability to customize your party allows for greater immersion. Graphics: 9 - Amazing. The style fits the game perfectly, and looks good, too! Sound: 9 - Amazing. Catchy music during battles, emotional music during cutscenes. DQIX has some good music. Overall: 9 - Amazing.. One of the best RPGs of the generation and its for the Nintendo DS! The story is very simple compared to past DQs but is still a pleasure to play. Lots to do during and after the story is completed.. I usually don't play JRPG's. I don't hate them, but they're just not my thing. However, on a whim, I bought Dragon Quest IX and I can't stop playing it. The combat system is the usual JRPG fare, but it's tried and tested and works very well. I'm only 15 hours in but the story is the perfect amount of complex: there's a lot to keep interest yet there's never too much for you to lose track or get confused. The graphics are pretty great for a DS game and full of charm, just like other DQ games seem to do. My main issue would be vocations. The problem being that you can only switch them after you've played a significant chunk of the game, and then you start at Lv. 1 again. Some skills carry over but it's still annoying to train up a character again. However, DQIX is an excellent game and definitely a recommended buy. And take that from a rookie JRPG player.. ""Old School"" definitely describes this game. Mostly, that's a good thing. The mechanics work. The dungeons are interesting. The storyline is servicable. Honestly the only thing I didn't like about this game is that item drop rates are low and the Thief's steal skill is so outrageously ineffective that you can spend 15 minutes doing nothing but repeating the steal command trying to get one common item. When you need seven more to make something with alchemy, the grindy nature of it starts to wear you down.. While Dragon Quest 9 is slightly old school, the acctual game is brilliant! The visuals are wonderful for a DS and you can explore a WHOLE world! I was stunned when I played this! This is my favourite DS game of all time! The ending of the story is a shame, but it just adds to the whole experience of Sentinals of the Skies! BY THIS GAME!!!. Easily my favourite DS game, Dragon Quest IX is top RPG goodness, with some of the best graphics on DS. While the battle system is old hat, the levels of customisation and excellent storyline make fr a life consuming RPG, and probably the best game on DS. If you get one DS game, make it this one.. A brilliant RPG. I, admittedly, hadn't played a DQ game (although loads of other RPG) before IX, this has got me wanting to play the rest of the series. This will have you hooked for hours, even after the main plot is complete, collecting all items and the alchemy gives the games tons of replay value. It also managed to mix old and modern RPGs elements really well. The only major flaw is that it's storyline wasn't the best, but, making/customising the characters made up for it.. This game is quite possibly the perfect mix between retro and modern RPG elements I have ever seen. Although most of the elements such as battles are pretty nostalgic and retro in design, the beautiful 3D character models and maps, amazing music and large amount of customization gives a deep modern and unique twist on what is a heart a very old and classic core system. Downloadable content such as rare equipment shop which changes each day, new quests and dungeons, and much more there is lots to do even after the main storyline is complete, especially with wireless multiplayer. Its a shame that Wifi multiplayer was not possible but the amount of effort put forward to make this game the best it can be more than forgives that.. I, and apparently the whole of the Internet, cannot give enough praise for this game. It's a classic old-school RPG with a pretty 3D candy shell, and it couldn't look or play much better. The main game is long and will keep you addicted, and with extra quests, dungeons, and even weekly download-able content, you'll still be playing long after the main quest is over. I clocked a good 130 hours before finally setting the game down... for a $40 DS game, you'll be getting your money's worth and then some. Unless you absolutely hate RPGS, or don't own a DS, there's no way I CAN'T recommend this game.. It's a solid game, no doubt about it. The enhanced graphics from previous installments is really nice, got the same excellent playability. Interesting storyline...there's just something askew with this latest installment. Still think Dragon Quest 5 is the emblem of excellent DS RPG's, and is superior to this installment , in terms of storyline and pure fun. Still, it's a nice game and worth the price. A little more difficult than previous entries, so that's a plus. Still , it felt like something was amiss. (Just cant put my finger on it.). Although the 87 Metascore may not seem overly impressive, the fact that out SIXTY-TWO critics, there were no negative scores really speaks volumes. Not even any Mixed scores. This game is simply put, beautiful. The music is catchy, but not annoying, the characters are very colorful, the plot is simple yet deep, the combat simply works well, and the game is just plain fun. Especially in multiplayer.. I loved this game, probably my favorite DS game I've played so far. I found the story line to be impressive and creative. The adventure in this game was awesome. I can tell they really put the effort and time into making this game. I loved all the different kinds of monsters and bosses, the creativity was wild. Even when the storyline is finished there is still lots you can do like favours for people in the different towns you've discovered. Not to mention finding little islands with treasure on your boat. One of my favorite adventure games.. Super addictive game that doesn't get weighed down by inane characters or story. Bright, fun graphics and the ability to personalize your characters appearance and skills = instant win. Best game I have played this year!. Easily one of the best DS games ever made. It combines so well the old-school elements with new elements which results in a rich amount of gameplay. Maybe the plot is not an epic one, but is not pretensions and in the end it delivered a good story with many touching moments. I have to admit that this my first DQIX and in the perspective from someone new to the series I have to say that this game is a must-have. of that everyone should have.. Easily my favourite DS game, Dragon Quest IX is top RPG goodness, with some of the best graphics on DS. While the battle system is old hat, the levels of customisation and excellent storyline make fr a life consuming RPG, and probably the best game on DS. If you get one DS game, make it this one.","""Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies"" is one of my fav ds games . gameplay-wise, it's classic dragon quest with turn-based battles and customizable characters . the story is a departure from the usual dragon quest formula ."
685.Pokemon X,"I just played through 5 hours of the game and lost everything because it has no autosaves. Quality of life improvements are welcome. It's too easy compared to the rest of the series & the new 3-d models are hit or miss.. While it was very impressive it's debut, the game feels unfinished, and the lack of a Pokémon Z truly hurts it even more, because it made Kalos a region where until now we don't know the full potential.. This game is extremely underrated. The game looks beautiful for the 3DS. Mega evolution was an amazing gimmick. Lumoise city looks great but is a bit too big for the 3DS. Roller skates are fun to use. And the game introduced clothes. the clothes in this game were the best in the series. There are some minor problems in the game. The game is to easy and the powerplant and sotry are incomplete. 7/10. Good game, no real complaints! I liked the story and the characters seemed more memorable in this game than in other Pokemon games!. A good first step into 3D, although future games didn't improve on it nearly enough. This region Isn't as linear as some future games, but the route design isn't particularly complicated as some of the previous games had been, with this game really feeling the lack of a third version that it desperately needed. This game is really good but the difficulty is WAY too low and the rollercoaster pacing is awkward. Low content too. Pokemon X/Y's overall presentation is fantasic, but is weighed down by lackluster difficulty and limited content.. Not the most exiting pokemon game but there were no problems when I was playing it. The battles were pretty easy considering no gym leader had a full team of 6 but it's a great game for someone who is just starting their pokemon journey.. A great Pokemon title and an incredibly nostalgic game that I watched countless hours of and collected all the cards from before actually getting my hands on it myself. The visuals are great and hold up nicely, making for a smooth transition from 2D to 3D graphics and legitimately looking much better than the recent Switch titles. The new Pokemon are all great with fun moves and abilities, and the addition of the Fairy type was genius. The addition of Mega Evolution is even better, making for insanely cool Pokemon alterations and animations. The exploration is decent with some fun puzzles, although I was never a fan of how TMs functioned in the overworld. The gyms are aesthetically pleasing and mostly clever as well. The majority of this game is too easy for sure until the late and post-game, making for some fun challenges. The supporting characters are all great and fit nicely within an interesting narrative with amazing lore. Anyone offset by cheesy writing or moments should play the campaign through since the post-game missions are phenomenal in every aspect. Fast travel allows for easier completion and exploring the city of Lumiose is genuinely immersive, even making for some cinematic moments. I look forward to my future with what is so far my personal favorite Pokemon title.. It was really average but nostalgia made me to put a little bit more into rating this one:). The grainy 3D graphics that marked Pokémon's first entry into the 3D era are perfect. Although X/Y is a game that's far too easy, the sense of adventure and friendship that Pokémon is so loved for is all here.. It has good gameplay and music but the rivals and uninteresting story is decent but nothing special and the evil organization is kind of meh. The main series of Pokemon games have never suffered from not being re-playable. It is part of why Pokemon games have a higher resale value than some others. The truly dedicated players out there keep every copy of Pokemon that they have obtained, which makes for slim pickings in the pre-owned Pokemon inventory of some stores. Perhaps the two biggest selling points of Pokemon X & Y are the over 60 new Kalos region Pokemon and the mega evolutions. The increased size of the Pokedex appeals to the collectors while the mega evolutions appeal to the competitive players. All in all, these games are worthy of a Pokemon player's attention.. Boring. A poor story, an even worse cast/companions, a terrible champion, and horribly low difficulty. Overwhelmingly mediocre.. Great succession of the Pokemon games on the 3DS, just the way I imagined.. Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This game is virtually unfinished. There's just too much missing.. Everything was great about this game, but it still lacked being challenging. It was far too easy, can you at least give us a difficulty setting?. This is where these games started deteriorating in quality. I used to think this was good but now that i gave it a re run its pretty mid. The story was good loved the towns and the main city was rly cool. don't have much negative things to say about the game but it was so **** easy with mega evolutions making the game beatable even if u where a 2 year old.. Probably the easiest pokemon game but It's still very fun. ORAS Better ------ ""AnthonySTF will be going away to far ne land from hear that? If you dont hear it"". This game is great for casual people who wants to go through the Pokémon franchise. The difficulty of this one it's kind of a theme in the Pokémon community with most of them claiming that it's way too easy but i think that's not a bad thing. As i said before the game it's perfect to make new people interested in the franchise. The 3D makes the game look great, Kalos it's a beautiful region and probably has the best map of all principal games. The looks of the towns with the atmosphere it's also beautiful, the 69 new Pokémon doesn't look as bad as the Unova's ones, of course there's some that are just bad like Barbaracle but in every Pokémon game there's at least three or four designs that ****. In general this game it's a great experience if you want to relax and have fun.. 76/100 super underrated, wish there was more postgame though. or a pokemon Z. .. The only reason I am giving it a rating as high as 3 is because this gave Game Freak some experience towards making better 3d games. These games in everything were bad. They were way too easy, I do not remember the post game at all, They give yo a billion starters and worst of all, you do not even fight a Mega Evolution until Lysandre... LYSANDRE!!! The Elite Four also do not have any Megas and ya don't fight one until the champion!?!? The new gimmick was completely overshadowed, even though it was a solid gimmick. It also was a shame because they did not put Mega Evolutions in the story. Imagine a game where scientists try to evolve Pokemon even further than Mega Evolution, and you have to stop them and at the end, fight an even more difficult boss (Probably Charizard because it is Game Freak's favorite child). I know it would have taken a lot more time to make, but instead of ORAS, they could have given us this. But the Pokemon were very cool. Trust me, it took me very long to not give this game a 5, just because it had Mega Gengar.. This is an alright game though I think again, Pokemon isnt for me. Every pokemon game starts off wonderfully but after like the 3rd gym, it becomes a repetitive slog, though I at least got to around halfway through the game before I put this one down.. Pokemon XY + ORAS allowed you to complete the entire Gen 6 National Pokedex, all the way up to 721 (after mythical events). The competitive scenes were absolutely revolutionary for their time. Gen 6 featured a bigger Smogon than ever and the two most recognizable VGC tours to this date. The Vs. Recorder was a sandbox that allowed you to create matches against AIs in any way you wanted. This worked especially if you had 2 consoles with 2 compatible games. Gen 6 had the best online system to this date with the PSS having extremely convenient interface. Gen 6 introduced 3D models and advanced interaction with your Pokemon, allowing you to connect with them more. The 3DS games had some of the deepest lore in the series to talk about with other people. Super Secret Bases in ORAS ensured the Hoenn region was kept alive with something new and refreshing potentially coming every day. The introduction of megas were amazing and they gave the series so much life. This mechanic aimed to focus more on connecting the player to the Pokemon they have, unlike Dynamax and Terastallization. Gen 6 also expanded on shinies to make them more feasible to obtain, which gave rise to a dedicated shiny hunting community. Gen 6 was a time where the entire Pokemon community was at its most united since Gen 1, all because it mastered the fundamentals of what made Pokemon stand out while also leaving a lot to play with and discuss. You could really catch them all and aim to be the very best, like no one ever was. I'm putting this up just for X in case I want to use Y to elaborate on my thoughts on XY specifically. atm I just wanted to give this game a score. I didn't give this game a 10, because in most aspects, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire outclass them and these games lack extra content in comparison to your typical upper version or remake games prior to Gen 8. They're still quite useful for collecting Pokemon in a way no other Pokemon game as of current can achieve and alongside Sun and Moon, are the best Pokemon games to introduce a generation.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As someone who played this game 10 years after it was released I have to say it is amazing. The story is so cool, the implementation of mega evolution was awesome, and even for a 3ds game it looks so good. However it is really easy which is something I do not appreciate with the newer pokemon games but if you can get past the super easy battles then this game is so cool and you should definitely try it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Pokemon game ever! The graph is awesome. And the Mega Evolution is a genius idea, make the battle more funny!. This game is spectacular from start to finish, in addition to being the first pokemon game in 3d, it introduces a new mechanic that makes old pokemons even cooler and more interesting for new players and for those who have been following for a longer time. mechanics are introduced, but in my opinion the first is the most important and the mega evolution one was perfectly introduced and the graphics at the time were the best, the mix of generations and also the escape from the generic were very well incremented, for example: in every generation the characteristics of the trainer were always the same and in this for the first time the players could change the appearance of the trainer at will, also in all the games the famous bicycles were obtained in the same way and they were the only means of transport we could have access whenever we wanted, in this one we have skates, cars and bicycles. Now, the best point of this game is the gameplay, the gyms, the battles, the scenarios and the main villain are incredible. is to accompany and face. Definitely one of the best pokemon games ever and one of the best 3ds platform games.. 36/100 Pokémon X marks the beginning of Pokémon's 3D era, and the game takes advantage of that with more cinematic shots, the introduction of character customization and a feature that after almost 20 years of franchise finally allows players to pet and feed their Pokémon, leading to the most immersive Pokémon experience yet. Ironically enough, X is also the least interesting Pokémon adventure since Red and Blue, with a storyline full of the same plotpoints that the series has been recycling since the third generation, lacking the character depth of the fifth generation or the mythological depth of the other ones. Kalos lacks the defined identity of the previous regions, being thematically less focused, and yet the journey through it remains decently enjoyable to its grandiose cities and enchating towns immersed in a naturally and artistically luxurious aura emphasized by its orchestral, regal musical pieces. Megaevolutions attempt at revitalizing the repetitive core gameplay formula, but the novelty of it quickly wores off since only a handful of Pokémon can benefit from it, but especially because the game is so insultingly easy that you'll never really need to Megaevolve any of your Pokémon, leaving the repetitive formula of the series devoid of the challenge that made it worthwhile. Level Design, although visually creative, is significantly less deep than the previous games, with an extremely streamlined map structure that rarely gives any meaningful explorative freedom. All of this is aggravated by a meager postgame content that doesn't offer anything significant.. Pokémon X and Y were when the series jumped the shark (or the Sharpedo, to remain in-theme). -Started gen 1 pandering (starters and most mega evos being from Kanto) -Removed some of BW/BW2 ideas and QoL improvements. -Linear with low difficult level -Poor postgame -Bad story and characters. BW's mature themes are still here, but it generally feels two step backwards compared to gen 5. -Very incomplete, both in content and story. It still makes me angry that despite the mysteries and hints we never got an XY sequel, with GF making **** ORAS and skipping straight to gen 7. I hate it so much I even deleted my 6 year old save data with over 400 hours in it to avoid bad memories.. While not perfect, I love it!!! As my 1st Pokemon game the nostalgia in here! A great game!. The first pokemon I played and I really loved it, classic RPG combat system and very well adapted for pokemons, a very wide and complex table of types that makes the game more dynamic, a fairly large map full of npc' s and items to get, the graphics are very good for its time, the soundtrack is also very good and the only thing I didn't like was the story, simple and childish but the game is very good. Pokemon X and Y are absurdly easy and hollow games, and was shocked by how easy they were to beat. These games introduce the first new type since Gen 2 in Fairy, and the Mega Evolutions that combined upend 5 generations of continuous and logical improvements to the mechanics of the games. After doing an easy blitzkrieg through the game, it then grinds to a complete halt with nothing else to do for the most part. Only thing great about this game was the soundtrack.. This game is a decent pokemon game and it introduces fairy types and one of my favourite legendries. There is a lack of end game content though when catching legendries.. It’s a great game. While it’s a pity that it’s not full 3D-display and there’s too few Legendary Pokémon.. A bit bland, but definitely fun main campaign, yet a really lackluster post game. There was a lot of novelty in seeing all the pokemon in 3D for the first time, but after this game, pokemon games unfortunately lost their visual distinctiveness. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the best online infrastrufture the series ever had, and it's stuck on the goddamn 3ds.. Very good and fun to play. The graphics were quite good for 2013 and the gameplay was good. The game was a bit too easy and your pokemon would level up really fast. Overall a very good game.. The introduction of the beautiful main saga to 3D, and a glorious update of the foundations of Pokémon. The most user-friendly competitive was founded, and the way of combat became richer from now on.. I didnt enjoy a pokemon game like this since Pokemon Rubi and saphire. Very good! graphics got really better, protagonists design are not dull, i loved Yveltal design, we need more intimidating legendaries. Also a full team of kids is interesting. Wish they developed more megaevolutions instead of that horrible gigamax thing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I bought a 3ds for this game, and i wasn't disappointed. i loved this game. and it was my first pokemon game. sun and moon, oras, black and white, and diamond and pearl are just LEAGUES above this. its literally so easy i could beat it with my eyes closed. it discourages you from using new pokemon by giving you lucario and gen 1 starters for free, and its overall disappointing after playing the others. i recommend buying a different pokemon game.. It maybe was a big transition to 3D Pokemon, but it wasn't really the greatest transition. The animation of the game was good. Especially for the 3DS hardware. The story was bland as hell. I still remember skipping a lot of the dialogue with the NPCs since it wasn't really interesting. In my opinion this game was a downgrade from the previous generations. 6/10 Good.. Great jump to 3D! But... Meh in almost every other aspect. Pokémon designs are great this time around, region is good and customization too but: Story is as bad as before, similar to Diamond and Pearl bad storytelling. The level curve of these games are on pair with Gold and Silver being the worst in the franchise but this time making the game awfully easy, postgame is almost inexistent just like in Sword and Shield.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a good game but not too redeeming pros good graphics great mechanics the second best elite four amazing pokemon cons elite four two or three graphics are not perfect pokemon are good but not amazing added features dont do it justice compared to previous and future titles. Although it’s not the best, it’s still just okay. The gameplay isn’t that fun, the characters are terrible, the story is bad, having the anime redeem it, and the game is way too easy. It’s not easy because they buffed the exp share, but because the people you fight, the elite four, champion, and everyone else just have terrible Pokémon with terrible moves. Bad post game, and it’s just not really fun to come back to. Its only redeemable quality is the dress-up stuff, and the music. The music is pretty great, up there with gens 4 and 5.. A revolutionary step in the direction of Pokemon, but not without its flaws. It Introduced us to new mechanics, 3D Pokemon models, but lacked in some areas. Despite these few nitpicks, it brings a great experience to Pokemon that everyone should try.. Worst game I have ever played no good parts of it, super linear, 1 good starter, uncreative pokemon, barley any new pokemon, team flare **** and no good graphics. forgot to mention no post game. A realy fun pokemon game with a great introduction in mega´s but a poor story and weak supporting characters in my opinion. Honestly this is Gamefreak at their absolute worst. Bare minimum pokemon game but still passable. I dislike the characters in this game. Maybe there are too many main ones, but only one, Serena, really feels like she has an arc. Everyone else just feels like filler to me. However, this game has the same great gameplay as I've come to expect, and easily the most expressive world on it's release.. I'm just going to make this brief. This game ****. (imo). I have played every single pokemon generation to date, and X/Y is the only gen I wish never to replay. The roster of new Pokemon was INCREDIBLY lacking (like around 70 not counting megas, and gen 5 introduced 156), making it the smallest roster of Pokemon up to that point... actually I think that's still the case. I found myself only liking 2 of the 'mons - Hawlucha and Delphox. The villanous team is probably the worst one to date, all the rivals had almost zero personality (if any), the gym leader roster is at a series all time low, and that hasnt changed, the champion **** (I literally refer to them as ""Mr./Ms Nobody, that's how forgettable they are), megas were horribly unbalanced, sky battles and horde battles were meh additions, among other problems. I do not reccomend this game, at all. Play gens 4, 5, 7, or even 8.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is overall okay. I’d like to give huge applause for the visuals though. The 3Ds of the pokemon were wonders. Sadly it is lacking of challenge. A bit too easy and spoiled. Easy level ups, and hack theres too much free OP pokemon given along the main plot. And the fact that its so ez to get money and that i became so rich in this game (almost 1 million poke dollars) along the main plot is making nice items such as full restores, revives, and battle items highly affordable at huge amounts, making battles really easy. But okay its a nice pokemon game. For a pokemon huge fan i’d still recommend this game to another pokemon fan tho. It’s just too easy for a person who already knows much about pokemon.. My first Pokemon game was Black 2, and I didn't beat it because I got stuck at the 4th gym. Honestly didn't have a good time with the game. X is the absolute best Pokemon game to date. With actually interesting characters, Pokemon that are appealing to catch, and new features make this game an adventure from start to finish.. Pokemon X is the only Pokemon experience you will ever need. To this day, it is the peak in the Pokemon franchise due to its wonderful world, slightly-above-average story, and innovations compared to previous installments. If you are going to play any Pokemon game, this is the one.. after many years, I managed to play this game, I didn't play Pokémon for years and I knew that this generation would be the best to return to play. Pokémon X was a beautiful experience for me, I had so much fun, as I skipped several generations, I don't know if they repeated many things from previous games, after all, I haven't played Pokémon since the Ruby version. It was an excellent game for me.. Absolute beautiful game. Great atmosphere, awesome soundtrack, cool map. Overall great design and total fun to play! ""Only"" 9/10 because it was way too easy. (At least with the EP-sharer). -80- It was a very nice Pokémon experience that was refreshing in some ways and tedious in others. I found the map to be way too large and the second gym way to far away from the first. Else way the game is very much enjoyable, although way too easy if played normally. The new Pokémon are mostly cool and I really like the 3D environment, which I wouldn't have expected beforehand. Overall, well made, a little laggy sometimes, a little boring sometimes, fun and chill. That's all, I just enjoyed being able to play a new generation again.. While one of the most visually pleasing games on the 3DS, Pokemon X and Y are fairly bare-bones as far as Pokemon games go. If there's one thing I can say is really good about this game, it's the region. Some will say it's kind of a **** but I for one really like the seasonal progression of the game. It allows for some fantastic and extremely memorable routes. Additionally, Mega Evolution is a fun mechanic, and it was great seeing some of my favorites that weren't really strong, like Mawile and Houndoom, turn into absolute powerhouses. But that's about all the praise I can give these games. Sure, the Pokemon formula still works here, but there's just not much. There's basically nothing to do once you complete the main story. No new areas to explore, no Battle Frontier, nothing. Just the Friend Safari and the Battle Tower and that's pretty much it. Additionally, once you get through the around the third or fourth Gym, the pacing in the game decides to crank up to a breakneck pace. It's a bit disappointing, since I felt the pacing before than was fairly good. There was a lot to see and explore, but once you get back to Lumiose it's a mad dash to the finish line. As stated before, it's a very bare-bones Pokemon experience, which isn't necessarily ""bad."" I just feel like these games, the only pair in the series thus far to NOT get a third version, are the ones that would have benefited most from one.. Pokemon X is quite the innovative piece of art. The overarching theme of the game, being a lush Paris lifestyle with lots of gardens and villages, follows you throughout the entire game, while still keeping slight contrast. Game Freak had a lot on their plate trying to nudge Pokemon towards the world of 3D, and they did a great job of keeping it tame. Changing up the art style and dimensions of an already successful franchise is tough business, but Game Freak knew what kind of work they had cut out for them. Music carried the heart and soul of Pokemon through the entire game, reminding you that when you enter a new city, or your Pokemon is sent out to battle, that this is still the Pokemon adventure you set off on long ago. The Mega Evolution idea was very interesting, and added a cool new power to play around with about half way through the game. It immediately made sense as part of the Pokemon world, even if you don't quite understand it at first. The story of the game follows suit with the rest of Pokemon games. It's not awfully original, but the developers clearly tried to draw a line in the story to make it stand out from the rest. In all honesty, it didn't feel like a whole new world, just a new region to explore and conquer, which I loved, though I'm not sure how new Pokemon players feel about the lack of hand holding. Pokemon designs are fresh, the region and story stand out from the crowd, and there are several new features to get accustomed with and enjoy. There isn't much wrong with this game at all other that it's seemingly careful approach to not diverge from the typical ideas of the Pokemon series. Even then though, they pulled it off well and made sure it didn't fall into forgetfulness. Being not an awfully hard game, it's worth the pickup for anybody with a 3DS looking for a new adventure to dive into.. Story **** (thanks god we had the great SM after this), difficulty is the worst by far in the series and the game feel unfinished. After all, those games are not as bad as people say, but are not the best entries.. This game just gets worse and worse over time, although I don’t “hate it” Positives Mega evolution turned out to be super cool Most of the new Pokémon designs are pretty great Siebold is one of the bois Region can be pretty to look at sometimes (although I think that the graphics have aged badly in this game in comparison to the 2d pixel art era) Negatives Weak, weak, weak, weak storyline Awful “rivals” Team flare is so boring, they are just worse team galactic with flame style outfits Malva was a good character idea, but was utilized in pretty much the worst way that she possibly could Too easy No post game to be found All in all this game is slightly below mediocre. there are so many pokemon you can catch. why couldn't sword and shield be more like this?. Unfortunately, a little dropdown compared to other Pokemon series. Many great features has been removed, but it still gave a good main game and plot. But the post-game was the biggest downside of this game. There was very few things to do in the post-game compared to other Pokemon games and training Pokemon up to level 100 was a mess of repetitiveness in this game.. As someone who have played every single mainline pokemon game I can say this one is ""ok"", but it lacks substance previous games had. It's still nice to see pokemon in 3D, thought.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is what my childhood was based on, heavy bias but I love this game. Say what you will about the story, I think it’s one of if not the best in a mainline Pokemon game so far.. A very underrated game in my opinion. It is really a tremendous little game, not as good as many previous titles mind you but still a good game. It was the beginning of the future for Pokemon with 3D models making it`s first apperance and also Mega evolutions being introduced to the series. with over 700 models having to be made, and also adding animations for the new megas. This made the game lack in other areas, we didn`t get many new pokemon and the story was a bit meh. But even when it`s lacking in certain areas it`s still a very enjoyable game, I`ve played this game several times and I enjoy it every time. Many of the new pokemon designs were very good. The game likes to hold your hand a lot through the story which is a bit annoying, but still doesn`t take a lot out of my enjoyment of the games. A lot of fun features was added to the game, like chain fishing, and also brought back the pokeradar. If you`re just getting into pokemon, or haven`t played it for a few titles i would really recommend starting up with these titles.. Once again, Game Freak hits the nail squarely on the head, making Pokémon X and Y an excellent new addition to the series' expansive library. Thanks to the simultaneous multi-region release date more players than ever before will be able to experience first-hand that indescribable sensation of unearthing brand new Pokémon that have nimbly avoided the dreaded internet leaks. A wonderful blend of excitement and nostalgia, Pokémon X and Y evolves the core series with its impressive polygonal 3D environments and magical camera angle mastery, adding a few technical adjustments along with a brand new Pokémon type to the original formula that we all know and love. It's not quite a revolution — and is hindered slightly by the meagre use of its host platform's glasses-free 3D capabilities — Pokémon X and Y is sure to steal the hearts of Pokémon fans new and old alike.. Revolution in the Pokemon games, I got a 3ds just for that game when it was released and didn't regret it. If you were a fan of older Pokemon games it's a must-play.. While definitely still a good game, I'd say this may be the weakest example of a mainline Pokemon game since the original Gameboy games. For one thing, the game is incredibly easy. Not much else to say about that point. The music is also subpar compared to previous and later entries in the series. The story is boring and a tad nonsensical. This game just doesn't properly capture what i believe is the personality and character of the Pokemon franchise. This game does have some strong points. The new Pokemon in this generation are probably the second most all-around great group of monsters to-date, only to be edged out in terms of consistently good designs later by Sun and Moon. The human character designs are really good as well. This game does make for a decent starting off point for newcomers, but it may make them think all of the games in the franchise are this easy. The game looks nice considering the hardware its running on. Not a bad game, but definitely less than what I would expect from the Pokemon franchise.. This is by far the worst mainline Pokemon game on 3DS and possibly the entire series. The graphics are lame, childish, and all the towns are too small to really appropriate. Kalos is by far the most forgettable region. If it wasn't for the anime, I would have forgotten about this place as soon as ORAS came out. Mega Evolution are just a gimmick, and the devs were heavily bias towards Gen 1 in terms of giving Pokemon Megas. Mega Evolution broke the game, and the devs knew this so they banned all megas for SM online and made them post-game exclusive. The story was god-awful, with the worst evil team so far. (Team Flare) They might be even worse than Team Galactic, and they were terrible! Along with tons of plot-holes, too many rivals with little or no personality, and a villain with inconsistent goals, this plot blows. Along with that, this has got to be one of the easiest games of all time, nearing baby game levels. All the gym leaders, yes even the 7th and 8th, have a limit of 3 Pokemon and 3 moves on each. Along with that, the game gives you not one, but TWO starters, one which can mega evolve. Along with that you get a free OP perfect IV Lucario very early into the game which can mega evolve right from the get-go. That Lucario can easily solo the entire game by itself, making the game a cakewalk. Only four trainers in the entire game use megas, the 3rd gym leader during the mega evolution tutorial fight, the evil team leader during his last fight, and the champion. The only other one is your rival, who you can fight","i just played through 5 hours of the game and lost everything because it has no autosaves . the game feels unfinished, and the lack of a Pokémon Z truly hurts it . the clothes in this game were the best in the series ."
686.Europa Universalis II,"I spent countless hours on this game back in the day, but to best honest I cheated almost always. I remembered the cheatcodes even years laters.. Very nice little nostalgic game. Better than the new ones. It is quite frustrating that revolt risks can hardly be reduced.. This might be the game I've played more times in all my life. The first time you play it, when you start a game before have done the tutorials, everything seems to be really hard and somethings have no sense. I have been reading about this game, and I think, the important thing about this, is that the game is not an empire builder, instead it is an historic simulator in which you can try to play as a nation, and it is going to be easy to recreate the history, but it's going to be hard to change it, because there are lots of mechanisms made in order to avoid that. But the most important thing I want to say about the game is that it is really fun to play it. I have try some of its sucessors, but no one is so fun.. Perhaps it's my personal fav of all time. For years, since I was a young boy, I'm playing this masterpiece. Complexity and great depth made it a milestone in the history of computer games. I believe that this game, along with EU1 had just changed the whole strategy games' industry.. Most certainly one of the best strategy games of all time. It is even better than its successor, which says a lot. The game that brought me to the strategy genre! PERFECTION!","the game that brought me to the strategy genre is PERFECTION . complexity and great depth made it a milestone in the history of computer games . it is even better than its successor, which says a lot ."
687.RimWorld,"The game delivers what it promises and that is: to be a good story generator. Its mechanics are good, you never get tired of playing because the story will always be different as you build it.. Easily one of the most fun games I've ever played. It took me a good 10 hours to understand and get used to the mechanics, but 200 hours later it was well worth it.. This game makes you fail and struggle, but the satisfaction of recovered from this is where the game shines. I've played over 1000 hours of this game and have found it to be the best game in my steam library.. Rimworld is a special game,i remember watching my favorite youtubers playing. I was STUNNED by how good this is, a incredible art, a UI with great amounts of information that makes me eager, (in a good way) to play and try things out, such funny and unexpected events and situations. It's a little bit difficult to understand at first, but the enjoyability that you have playing makes your search further about what to do/make in Rimworld. I feel euphoric just to play 10 minutes of the game, i love it with all my heart. The kind of game where eventually you look at your play time and realize if it were a job you'd be a certified field expert. The DLC and mod community alone justify keeping this game on your hard drive forever.. i have done things in this game that would torn the backbone of a ww2 soldier out of its back... but we have to survive on an unknown planet filled with enemies... every animal (even rats) can end your journey in a matter of seconds and if you survive their rampage a raid of cannibals or alien mechanical monsters will torn you apart striking your base. every aspect of this game is nearly perfect we are asked to deal with so many game mechanichs like base building, colonists management, resourses farming and factions reputations; every dlc puts a new step of complexity that perfectly merges withwhat was build before. the only downside in my opinion is the difficulty to find a balance in the narration mechanism, we can custom it but in the end game the events are really really challenghing every time.. My absolute favorite game. I've had it since the kickstarter. Rimworld is inspired by dwarf fortress, but much easier to learn. The Firefly sci-fi style creates a great atmosphere as if you were on the frontier of civilization, a Rimworld. The base game alone will keep you entertained for many hours. The DLCs each offer new game mechanics and are not just minimal changes and in my opinion absolutely worth their price. I've been absolutely happy with the game for years and will probably continue to be.. I played ~50h and I can say: THERE SHOULD BE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS. If you like the type: Buy it NOW. If you don't like the type: Give it a try.. perhaps with mods this is better, but the DLC wont even install and the tutorial and UI are some of the worst ive run into. for a game that is supposed to have so much complexity, everything about the tutorial is visually and procedurally obtuse. the sound design is also terrible, an assault on the ears at max volume of discordant ""ambience"" and ""music"" which both appear to just be ambience. i plan to give this another shot, but my introductory experience has not left me with any desire to play more of the game.. A rich colony management game that is only limited by your imagination, Rimworld is a chef's kiss **** that'll always keep you coming back for more. Every colony will be different so will the complex story that unfolds before you with the deep game mechanics that give you a level of detail unseen in any other game. Victories, tragedies, relationships, and loss will all be part of your colony's unique story. Will your colony be a group of nudist cannibals, zealous holy order, drug pushing mercs, or a safe haven for fleeing the many dangers of the rimworld? It's all up to you. Beyond just the story, there's plenty to do in the game to keep you hooked and it goes well beyond just building a colony and making sure it survives. The visuals may not be your favorite, it personally kept me from trying out the game for a while, but there's a reason why it's one of the most highly rated games on Steam. Once you give it a try you'll never want to put it down and will always be a staple of your gaming library. How such a complex and enjoyable game was produced by an indie dev is amazing and just goes to show the level of care and talent that they possess as it blows most AAA games out of the water for half the price. With a handful of DLCs the complete package can get pricey but they're fully worth it, especially when it directly supports the great indie team over at Ludeon Studios. But if the DLCs aren't for you, Rimworld is fully intertwined with the modding community and you'll have no trouble finding what you like to personally tailor the game to your own gameplay style. I personally recommend trying out the Vanilla series as it adds so much to the game without changing its core. In my opinion, Rimworld is one of the best games I've ever had the experience to try and if you haven't given it a shot yourself you're truly missing out.. I have over 250 hours in this game and beat it long ago. Thus I did not force myself to play it till the end this time, albeit it was the intention at the beginning. However, there would definitely be some value in it. There is little I can say about this game but to give it a ten, if you want to learn if you wish to play this watch the following video, there is no need to write a satire about romantic knights when Cervantes already wrote Don Quixote: ****/watch?v=JdAjXDDQPJ0 War crimes: I did none. Drug production: I did **** Rome: check.. Ludeon Studios is the worst. The devs only care about their own profit and make money thanks to the work of the modding community (most people wouldn't play unmodded Rimworld.) The base game ****. You need a mod for every single missing or defective thing. And there are a lot of missing basic features. You have to spend a lot of time researching which mods you can add (many are buggy or conflict with each other.) Every time there's an update, you have to stop playing and wait for all your mods to be updated too. The dev log is often useless as it doesn't tell you what mod is causing a bug. The devs, who are also community admins, enable bullying and lie to cover it up. They only enforce their rules when they feel like it. They have a moderator (Jdalt) who insults people in their Discord and doesn't punish those who harass you. Instead, he punishes you. They leave posts where users expose those who criticize them so others find their Steam profiles and harass them. They are also accused of copying the code from popular mods for their DLCs and updates, and of censoring those who criticize them. They lie in their reply to reviews saying they have fixed a lot of stuff when they have barely fixed anything.. I turned my neighbors into hats, game is even better with mods and dlc. I think I'll hit 1000 hours on this game... I'm halfway there already.. Legit anti-fun. This is less a game and more a job simulator for a terrible management job. Unless you want watercooler moments on the Rimworld Subreddit, this game has nothing to offer. Total garbage.. best strategy game ever made you can do everything, 10 score for very very good game. If there is was word I could describe this game with, that word would be underwhelming. Usually, one of the first things I do before purchasing a game is check steam reviews. Upon seeing dozens of players with over 1000 hours in this game, I figured there must be a lot to do, well let me tell you, there seriously isnt. Aside from the very basics you can expect from a base-building game, you can expect to constantly micromanage idiotically programmed AI and ensure your pawns are happy by placing a chess table where they will play chess by themselves, drastically boosting their mood. This game is ridiculously stupid, the pawns are ridiculously annoying and ugly looking and after about 30 hours the game becomes stale and playing it becomes an unenthusiastic endeavour. After about 25 hours of playing rimworld, I just ended up making several molotov **** and forcing my pawns to raise their crops and torch their home before killing themselves, but not even that would satisfy my hatred of this game and the horribly animated characters. This game isnt even worth 4$, let alone 40$, and I have no idea why people are willing to cough up that much money for this horribly designed amalgamation. Please do yourself a favour and play ANY OTHER GAME. If you want to rule an colony that is lost in the space OR you are a cannibal irl this is the perfect game for you. The game it's self is perfect. Because of it's community you can enjoy almost new gameplay every run. Depending on how you play it and what goal you set for yourself you can play it almost infinitely. Only thing in my opinion that the game lacks is just having more electronic stuff :).. Time played: 107 hours This game is perfect, it has base building (core of the game), people you have to care for, and exploration as well as progress and an end goal, escape the planet. I enjoy this game a LOT and i trully reccomend this to anyone who loves prison architect or project zomboid!. The day has come when I will tell you about my favorite indie game - RimWorld by Ludeon Studios. It's a colony simulator. In the classic scenario, we crash-land with 3 characters and 1 pet on an alien planet with resources that will last for a few days. We must survive, build a base, gather food, discover new things, and not succumb to random events.I have the impression that in this game, you can truly do everything, and if it turns out that you can't, the Steam Workshop is full of mods, and you will surely find whatever you can think of I'll focus on the base game, but there are also 3 DLCs that I'll review soon. On the plus side: + 3 different storytellers who influence how often and what kind of events will happen in our gameplay, from peaceful idyll to continuous tragedy + Different game scenarios, e.g., ""Naked Brutality"" - starting completely naked and ""happy"" as a castaway, the ability to create your own scenarios + Extensive research tree - from lack of electricity to building a spaceship + Diverse flora and fauna; we can have animal husbandry+ Weather that affects the environment, e.g., we need to sew warm clothes for winter + Our initial castaways are generated randomly, each with their own statistics, personality traits, childhood and adulthood descriptions, mood, injuries, missing limbs, illnesses, and addictions + Hostile and friendly factions; we can fight and trade with them + Everything needs to be produced by ourselves or bought + Relationships between colonists + Quests + Prisoners that we can recruit, kill, release, harvest organs from, or worse, turn into, for example, a hat or food (and here's the hat puzzle in the picture solved; Rimworld players often joke that the game's biggest feature is the ability to make a hat from human skin) + Enormous replayability, and thanks to mods, we can create an entirely new game; some mods are like separate DLCsAnd I could go on and on. I also have a series on my YouTube channel - feel free to check it out :) There's no better game for me - 10/10.. Ahh yes the Rimworld. The game where you can be a peaceful colony or have a organ harvesting empire with so much to do you cant decide would you rather start learning the game or just try having a good time. But not with our friends storytellers and our icon Randy that will for sure put you into muffalo madness.A game so addictive that it will become like Luciferium to you so just have some fun making human leather cowboy hats and make sure after some hours to check the modding comunnity if it somehow the game becomes boring to you and have fun!. The pricing strategy from this developer appears to be motivated by profit rather than consumer-friendly practices. Charging $30 for what could be considered free updates by other developers feels disappointing. Graphics are horrible.. 700+ hours and still enjoyable thanks to mods, this game made me power through 2020. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Recently hit 1000 hours. The modding scene is excellent, maybe one of the best I've ever seen. Without mods, I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten even a fraction of the playtime I have. Rimworld is more accessible/user-friendly than its original inspiration Dwarf Fortress, with more of a focus on the characters than the simulation aspect. Easily one of the best games of this genre.. Deceptively good. What appears at first as a low effort strategy game, is actually a surprisingly deep game of strategy and settlement building. This game manages to reimagine the genre.. The essence of this game is to appreciate the drama unfolding among the humans in the colony. I've put over 2,000 hours into this game, and I still have a lot left to do. Great game with DLC included.. A masterpiece colony simulator. The game is highly replayable thanks to the thousands of aspects and minutiae, increased by the expansions. The Biotech expansion covers the genetics aspects of characters, Ideology covers religion and rituals, and Royalty covers relationships and hierarchy system. Maybe the only issue is the lack of achievements.. One of the best games I played, spend about 2000 hours in the game and it's still not boring. With massive mod support, you can have endless fun in this game. The real score is ~7 but since the page appears infested by paid shills that downvote anything below an 8 I punish them with a 0. The game appears ok for people that are into raw strategy gaming; it appears to have all the features for that and a lot of depth; I hear it's also heavily moddable. For me it doesn't work that it doesn't have any artistic appeal to draw me in; the graphics and music are purely barebones like I'm in 1991; it's like an office job in terms of aesthetics in effect.. boring as **** and with poor graphics the worst management game I ever played. Probably the best strategy game (actually it's so much more) I will ever have played. Great value for money.. I enjoyed my time with Rimworld. It starts off with a really intense learning curve, where everything feels pretty overwhelming and the appeal of the game is unclear. But the game does a pretty good job of introducing the concepts at just the right cadence, so that by the time the next element of gameplay is introduced, the last one is becoming almost automatic. I bring this up because this is essential for a game with this level of complexity. The way you naturally gain control over what you are doing sets the tone for the rest of the game, and that is when it really sinks its hooks in. You can almost tell the exact moment when the game clicks with you and the addiction has started. The core attraction of the game is the complex colony management system. The graphics, the music, and the presentation are very unremarkable. So the biggest way to sell the game is just to watch a Youtube video providing basic tutorials of the management system. It looks like an incredibly simple game, but the complexity underneath the hood. This game is designed exclusively for fans of the colony building/management genre. The game went through waves of interest for me, at times I was absolutely hooked, other times I felt like I was mindlessly moving through the motions. In the end, it kept me entertained for a very long time despite the fluctuating excitement levels. If this is a genre that interests you this is absolutely worth checking out and you are guaranteed to get your money's worth. Most of my friends list have 200+ hours in the game, some as high as over 600 hours. I don't think I will be one of the players to make it to that level. This is absolutely worth checking out. If this genre interests you then you'll get plenty of hours out of this. In my case, I got plenty of enjoyment out of it, but my interest levels fluctuated so much.. One of the best games of all time. This game will have you saying stuff like ""maybe video game addiction is for me!"". An inspiring game for colony-based games. You gotta feed them all and take care of your defense.. The ultimate survival game. My colonist got shot, ran away. Had Food poisoning. And died to a Hare. Fun game. Really love this game, I always seem to come back after a break, there are an insane amount of awesome mods.. CAN'T-STOP-PLAYING : seriously, an incredible game with never the same story / save, lot of contents, mods, meaningful extensions If you like any management-style game, RTS even, go for it. The game has an obtuse and unintuitive ai management system. It leads to frustrating situations. It leads to unintuitive slippery slope situations. The game's difficulty cannot be surmounted without significant frustration. It isn't intuitive enough.. An absolute blast and easily my favourite game of all time. This game is a strategic colony simulator that is supposed to be a story generator, which it is, but is otherwise just a simplistic game that is very good. The modding community for this game is insane, from something as simple as the Vanilla Expanded mods to as crazy as A RimWorld of Magic. This game is top-notch, and I have put in 800 hours into this game for good reason.. ️Please read️ I just wanna say that almost all the bad reviews on this game didn’t even play the game. They just saw the word “storyteller” and thought it was just a story generator game but that’s just the ai that does events and stuff it’s a good survival game but you can control multiple people so it’s like the sims but a survival game also you can get much more technology than in most survival games. This is without a doubt THE BEST game I have ever played, ever. Tons and tons of replayability, overwhelming charm, keeping you in your toes time after time again. It’s just perfect to me. I even find myself growing affection for my colony the longer that they last, striving to see them survive and feeling genuine dread once I lose a long time buddy. Ten out of ten, ten out of ten. Ten. Out. Of. Ten.. One of the best game. Very addictive, lot of mods. Great level up/skill system of settlers, needs, research trees, options, animals, .... and many other What could be better: - kingdom DLC - there are lot of skills from chips for manual usage. I like automations, manual clicking them is what i hate in Starcraft/Warcraft games - many units and control one person with special skill. Should be option for autouse by AI and more designed for less AI mistake chance or passive. Whole DLC is not very intuitive at first. - world map actions, new settlement management, no roads, could have better solutions. Only mods are solving lot of problems.. Such a endless game, its one of those games where if you were stranded and can only bring one. It'd be this one, you wouldn't get tired of it. Theres so many mods too.. Amazing game. Complex but easy to learn. The modding community make it endlessly playable.. I have never played this game and it is the best game to ever exist in the history of mankind. An incredible game, and sitting at 1,500 hours, it's definitely my favourite game of all time. Absolute masterpiece.. I've tried the game with a 10-euros Epic coupon, making for a 16 euros price, which is, well, acceptable for what the game is. I honestly think the enormous success of RimWorld relies on two things, more than on its own merits: 1) an extremely dedicated, and actually somewhat fanatic, community, which made it kinda of a cult item. 2) Mods Now, mods are very nice but a game should be judged by its own merits. If RimWorld was sold as a pack of developer tools, then fine, but it's sold a stand-alone game and so mods should be excluded from the evaluation. So, what is it? A colony management game with some clever ideas, a detailed character system, random events adding some spice. And then the bads: terrible AI forcing the player into extreme micromanagement and an overall lack of content (as I said, in the base game), even if compared with other indie games. Also, very clunky interface. People will tell you this is a ""story generator"". Beyond the fancy words, it just means the game gives you random events, interacting with your colony and characters, and you make up a story from them. Yeah, kinda like The Sims. It's nothing extremely innovative or surprising. As I said, a lot of people seem to just venerate this game for reasons I don't really understand, and I think it's just one of those cases of perfectly normal products getting a cult following that reinforces itself over time. Now, I would have given the game 6 or even 7 if it wasn't for one terrible decision: the game never goes on sale. The Epic coupon was just there for every game on the store, but RimWorld itself is always full priced. And we're talking an old game here (alpha was in 2013). This is extremely anti-consumer and if a mentality like this was to spread PC gaming would go downhill in the blink of an eye: many people, especially young people and folks from poorer countries, would be cut off from the hobby; and the market would concentrate around few extensively-covered, hyped games, because nobody could discover hidden gems during sales, kinda likes console market was years ago. This really shouldn't be supported and I will never buy something from this dev again. It's also ridiculous if you think you can get four or five more recent AAA great games, on sale, for the fixed RimWorld price. Right now, XCOM 2 is 3 euros on Steam. Do I need to tell you how much better XCOM is? Really, if you look at the market, you realize that wanting to sell at full price an indie game almost 10 years old with little production value in it (there are no animations, no effects, sounds and graphics are even below indie average) is just arrogance and insulting to customers and other devs.. funny sims nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. This is a 2D birds-eye-view tower-defense game with a science-fiction spin. While there is a strategy element, the main focus of the game is storytelling. THE GOOD: - This is an intensely addictive and fun game. - Play virtually any kind of story you want, so long as it involves a handful of colonists trying to survive on an alien planet! I once tried a primitive start, with my bow-and-arrow wielding people living among dinosaurs. They survived, thrived, and eventually had omni-bots doing all their work for them. It was epic! - The game design is really great, where the controls allow you to do everything you want, but it's designed so it's easy to lose track of some details or forget something. There's plenty of opportunity for excitement and drama, whether it's created by the game's built-in storyteller (who throws events at you), from your own mistakes, your colonists' interactions, or just your imagination. - The game is backed by some really fun and thoughtful science-fiction. - The mod community is amazing and gives the game tons of staying power and replayability. Every player has their own list of must-have mods. Mod management through the Steam Workshop is pretty simple. - There is an incredible multiplayer mod available that smoothly enables co-op play. - I played through the Royalty expansion and it also adds a lot of really fun extra gameplay, as well as a cool new win condition, and is worth picking up. THE BAD: - After some hundred of hours of gameplay I started to see the pattern in the main storyteller (Cassandra)'s semi-random events. This was solved by switching to everyone's favourite storyteller: Randy Random. THE UGLY: - In 600+ hours of playing this game (some of it offline, so Steam didn't count it), I've had the game crash on me once or twice. Otherwise, it's really stable, even with lots of mods running. - The developer will update the game in the middle of your playthrough via Steam, and there's no way to stop this. Sometimes, this might break mods you are currently using and ruin a game in progress. There are workarounds, but they require some tech savvy.. Great game, but beware you may need to attend AA meetings if you play long enough to overcome the steeper learning curve.. Thicc base game + easy modding = perfect game You can do anything you want from this game. Greedy developer. $30 each for literal add-ons that for any other developer would be a free update.. This is one of my favorite games, I find that it's cheap for the amount of game play and that the dlc's will make you play for hundreds of hours. I stream RimWorld on twitch sometimes and I find that its one of my most popular games to stream. It's entertaining, fun, action packed, and exiting.. Possibly the best colony management game in existence. Endless replayability, endless user created mods to keep the experience fresh when you get tired of it. I keep coming back to it, over and over again. There's just nothing else like it.. If you ever thought about Dwarf Fortress, but made so PEOPLE could play it instead of Wizards, this is it boys. It took me months to master but years to get good at. Learning about it was the most fun part about it. After that, just war crimes and bug infestations amigo. Cheers bros. Best game of all time............................................................................................................ ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 96 IIIIIIIIII====================. Highly re-playable, with plenty of different starts, tons of random encounters, and a character personality system that results in a unique story every time. On top of being an in-depth base builder.. This was my first 500 hour game, and will likely be my first 1000 hour game. It is, without a doubt my favourite game of all time. I can't put into words how good this game is. Just, play it.. One of the best games ever. If you can get into the game, it can be whatever you want, a hotel-sim, a game of a nomadic colony or a one man adventure game. The only thing that is fixed in Rimworld is the amount of storage you have to download various mods. Great support, great community and truly amazing gameplay!. A great story creator and a base management game. It took the best from it's competitors and done that things ever better. I give this game 10/10 because this is the best colony sim right **** has both great stories with your characters like Oxygen Not Included and great base building like Factorio. I really recommend you trying this one out. After 400h i can assure it's good. When my colony isnt getting raided it is mostly enjoyable and good. Can Rimworld bring you a proper amount of hours of intense fun ? Well, ask any game who even remotely liked a city builder once in their life and who got their hands on this game, that will be a yes. Learning curve ? There is. Replayability ? There is. Emphasized with the DLC. Increasing difficulty ? You go. Rimworld is not merciful. It's harsh, but with every lose comes experience. You get to painfully learn why you lose during the last minutes of every game, and you'll go further not doing it again. There really are no downsides to the game, if you like the pitch of it, then you'll get what you expect and more. So, whether it is on the short term by discovering the game first time, or by succeeding at self-inflicted challenges of increasing difficulty, Rimworld will deliver quality entertainment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game I own! With over 500 houres in the game I still feel like I've still not explored all aspects of this game. The modding community really makes this game amazing, and even though this can't be credited as much to the maker of this game, I still think it improves the game.. Game is crazy addicting. It's like a Sims but for action survival genre. All meticulous little details may seem to some as little bit over the board. But the payoff is amazing seeing your colonist survive in winter or extreme desert... One of the best games I ever played. Over 1000 hours of gameplay. Try it and you'll never forget it.. 8/10, must be played with mods. As the base game is quite bare, and feels quite linear. The modding community really came into this game though. Worth picking it up.. Very unique game that really grows on you. The graphics are very simple (or complex if you compare it to Dwarf Fortress) but the gameplay is not. You can spend hundreds of hours on things game and still find a ways to play differently. Mods make it even better, extending ""lifespan"" of the game way more. Developer was really active over the years, making numerous overhauls, tweaks and changes, Also you can do really messed up things in this game, so yea calling it war crime simulator seems fair ;). The game is overpriced and there is very little content but its an amazing platform for mods that make this game awesome. 100% worth the money. You'll easily get 200+ hours of gameplay. Also, it has a huge modding community. The biggest con is gameplay takes a while one year is about 16 hours and the graphics are quite bad.. A fantastic game with beautiful combination of strategy and management. Modding makes it nearing perfection. Do not be turned away by the graphics. This game has so much depth that it makes you dream about it in your sleep. Tynan, thank you for this masterpiece. In short: Rimworld is the most addictive drug I’ve ever tried. ====================== ---------------- Grindness: Some early game skill grind. Amount of updates: ~1 update per month Update contents: Lots of new content, every update. Game size***: Up to 350MB ---------------- Do I really need to add something? ====================. As a long time fan of fiddling for hours with a map, Rimworld is right up my very narrow alley. Surprisingly complex, well balanced and a broad array of mods and options make it very customizable and the fact that they glued combat in a build game and I'm not complaining is an achievement in itself. It's so well done that I still find myself pressing space in other games attempting to suspend time and deal with everyone being on fire, the base being on fire, the pets being on fire and the fire being on fire. Definitely 10/10. Very good game with a lot of replayability but the dev seems to have abandoned it, so no more improvement for the basic game only dlc expansions. A game that seems so simple is so complex. No two playthroughs are the same. With added mod support this game is a must play, its well worth the money.. Better game in srpg genre. But too much Weaknesses (survival rol play game ). Great colony sim with good controls and UI, which is where most of these type of games seem to faulter. A lot of content and it is easy to get immersed in the world. Not as addicitng as I though it would be fro some reason, it feels like there is something missing to hook the player more. Though that might just be me. The price is also a little steep.. Great game. You are the planer for a small colony of people. Manage their needs an wants, while defending the colony from murderus raiders and hungry spacemonsters. All while researching new equipment and gimmicks for your colony. In short: Its a building simulation that will keep you entertained for many many hours. It has a solid foundation and the many many mods make it even better and will keep you entertained for many more hours. The only game in the genre i can think off, that is deeper might be dwarf fortress, which was obviously a heavy inspiration. that being said, while in comparison, rimworld might not have as much freedom, it does run better for a way longer time and you do not need to fear fps deaths. So ultimate score would be 9, the only thing that could be done better is more gimmicks.. been here since almost early acces, take a little breath 9 month ago, coming back just this day an","i've played over 1000 hours of this game and have found it to be the best in my steam library . i feel euphoric just to play 10 minutes of the game, i love it with all my heart . the only downside is the difficulty to find a balance in the narration mechanism ."
688.Power Stone 2,"The dreamcast didn't have very many memorable games but this game really stood out for my brothers and I. I don't know if it was just us being little but we played this game all of the time. To this day it is the only fighting game that has ever been able to even get close to competing with super smash at our household. This game brought to us so many memories and so many good times. I won't forget how this game brought my family together. Thank you developers. I hope one day a game like this comes out again. This game earned a perfect score. A relic lost in the secret garden of video game classics. Fighting games never got this exciting, full of charm, quirky fun randomness, colorful characters, interactive stages filled with crazy items and the glorious Power Stones! an overall experience that you as a gamer can't miss because this here is the best fighting game in my opinion.",the dreamcast didn't have very many memorable games but this game really stood out for my brothers and i . i won't forget how this game brought my family together .
689.Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,"Despite its flaws, the game earns a solid 7/10. If you’re looking for a cooperative dungeon crawler with a hint of nostalgia, it’s worth exploring. For those interested in the full experience without committing to playing.. I think it was more of an action game than rpg, and infinite combats was boring.. A classic that deserves a proper sequel! One of the best co op games ever created and one of the better PS2 games. I played this co-op with friends and siblings for years, just an amazing game.. Amazingly fun at the time, and still great for a slower, less ""immediately murder everything and pick up the best 1% of the loot"" type arpg.. Decades before I knew what D&D was, I was enthralled by the systems, setting, and gameplay of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Now, as a big D&D fan, I know how good I had it. There hasn't been an ARPG in the Forgotten Realms nearly this good since BGDA 1 and 2.. This game did set new standards for console RPGs. Graphics are great, the puzzles challenging and the combat thrilling. Overall rating: 9.1.. Loved this game back in the day and while it a bit dusty these days, its still fin especially for coop. Its a great game to play with someone who is new to gaming.. If you like the Diablo series you will love Baldur´s Gate: Dark Alliance! This mix between RPG and Hack´n Slay has easy but satisfying mechanics, great graphics and a wonderful story. The only minus points are the length and the unbalanced skill system. In this about ten hours long adventure, most of the time you are really weak. But in the end, you´re way too strong. Nevertheless, the gameplay is terrific and the koop-multiplayer is highly addictive!. it's a very solid and standard type of RPG. It has great atmosphere and is an interesting adventure. Probably the game that Morrowind took its inspiration from. Magic and dungeons, customisable items, weapons and armour.. I played this game for years as a little kid (elementary school age), and this game has given me so much. BG: Dark Alliance is literally the reason I love ARPGs like Torchlight, Diablo, etc. Amazing game, and the sequel is even BETTER.. The prequel to Dark Alliance II. This is the game that started all of the great RPG games on the PS2. Many keep a PS3 just to play this. It is a great game and tells the back story behind Dark Alliance II.. To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I first played this. Baldur's Gate 2 on the PC is my favorite game of all time and I was almost orgasmic when I heard there was to be a new Baldur's on the PS2. And it really is VERY different to its PC counterpart. The game itself was pretty good and perhaps one of the better action RPGs on the PS2. Still the initial disappointment did leave a bad taste in my mouth. Overall: A decent game with good visuals, nice story and fun combat.. This is the game that sets the standards for RPG's on the Plyastation 2, why? It is the first RPG on the PS2, every PS2 RPG to come after it has some resemblance, though minimal at some point, they do bear resemblance. While it may bear more resemblance to an action-adventure game, it is still a RPG at its core, being played out in chapters, a very D&D level up system and an incredible graphics engine. What is not to love about this RPG? Its not about the hack and slash, but its rather the intriguing story that goes behind this Call of Duty for Storytellers. It has incredible graphics, D&D monsters, D&D setting, D&D spells, D&D level up system and lots of blood and gore in great graphics. I say again: Whats not to love?. This is a prime example of a dungeon crawler. Its addictive, has great characters, and a good range of environments. From the moment I finished the first dungeon I was **** in, and for the short 10 hours it lasts its worth every penny. What I simply dont get is why there is such rave reviews - its good at what it does but its lacking in so many respects. In short; you go through dungeons, try and find the best weapons, and level up your skills. Thats it. The game could have been greatly enhanced if there were side quests or other things to find. As it stands its fun and addictive but is not on my top list of great RPG games. Even still, its definitely worth a pop.","despite its flaws, the game earns a solid 7/10 . if you’re looking for a cooperative dungeon crawler with a hint of nostalgia, it’s worth exploring . despite its flaws, it earns a solid 7/10 ."
69.Halo 3,"Undoubtedly the best game in the franchise. It has good and memorable levels, great multiplayer, better gameplay/vehicles. I've heard the story isn't as good but I don't care for stories in games. I don't have friends.. Why is this not higher? The greatest console FPS ever made in my opinion, spent hours playing this. Honestly one of the best Halo games I’ve played teamin up with the arbiter Ona. Deeper level is like having a blood brother fighting alongside you and he became my favourite character after I played the series so many memorable characters and a great story although I did die some times it was really fun would highly recommend.. Halo 3 is one of the best shooter to hit the 360. Easily one of the best games of all time.. It's a great game. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of action, its mechanics are very good, the story line is very solid and of course the master chief is great.. I liked the series very much, the action scenes are very nice, but I am angry that they suddenly cut the series.. This is easily one of the best fps games. The campaign is amazing. The gunplay is super fun. Had some of the best custom games and multiplayer experiences ever. The goat of Halo.. Just the best Halo game ever and maybe one of the best Shooter Games of all time. Halo 3 is a must-play for anyone remotely into shooters. Some would say Halo 3 was peak Halo; I tend to agree.. Still one of my all time favorite games. Got a 360 shortly before the game launched so I could play it. If you grew up in post COD World, this game may feel dated and slow. Give it a chance. There is a lot to love about Halo 3: Campaign couch co-op, four player split screen multiplayer (this extends to online as well), quality single player campaign, customizable settings for multiplayer, secrets, etc. The story is definitely a bit campy and a relic of it's time. But that isn't a negative in my mind. I enjoy the game for what it is and will always come back for more.. Very fun multiplayer and gameplay. Story mode while having iconic level design had a very plot armor driven saga. I had a chick ask me recently if she gave me the best night of my life. It was pretty good, but it will never compare to the Friday nights I’ve poured into this game. Easily on my top 10 list.. best multiplayer shooter of all time in my opinion. campaign has the best vehicle sections, music and atmosphere. one of the most re-playable games of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great way to end the trilogy, soundtrack perfected, story took a more basic turn, but that wasn't necessarily a BAD thing. Multiplayer was absolutely legendary and perfected the formula, not to mention the impact that Custom Games and Forge had on this game.. The hype around Halo 3 was massive during middle school. It was so impactful that I had my middle school bully stop bullying me to explain to me the lore of Halo to get caught up. Its the reason why everyone had an Xbox 360. I like every other millennial have tons of memories of logging in and playing the custom game modes like dunt hunt, jaws, run from fatty and some others that havent aged well. And Jallot if you're out there I hope you got your dream to make maps for Halo realized.. Masterpiece, not better than the second one but better than the first one tho .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. EASELY one of top 10 best games of all time, Halo 3 is a masterpiece, and i recommend to anyone who never played it.. The absolute peak of the industry. The literal golden age of gaming. Another masterpiece.. I hate how slow your character moves, I swear its even slower than ce and 2. The story is very soy which makes sense since this was supposed to be the last one in the series so they make it as soy as possible. Since they sacked the elites this time in favour of the brutes the game just becomes ten times easier because their shields don't regenerate. Anything that ends the game quicker is a plus for me. Few can hold a candle to the greatness of Halo 3. The campaign is enthralling and multiplayer is fun; especially with friends.. EASILY THE BEST HALO GAME! I loved halo combat evolved and halo 2, but halo 3 is just peak!. what a timeless game…the combat is impeccable, the characters are memorable, and the setpeices are unmatched. the gunplay is just plain fun, which elevates the multiplayer. every halo game since has tried and failed to even get close to this ones glory. my advice to new players: skip infinite, grab the master chief collection (which is getting more and more affordable every day) and try this one for yourself.. An amazing game, with a great story and good multiplayer. A great end to the original halo trilogy which should not have continued in the hands of 343 who ruined it 3 times in a row.. This is one of if not-the greatest video games of all time. It is incredible the graphics game play multiplayer campaign it is basically perfect .. the only bad thing i can say about Halo 3 is that the movement is a little wonky. unfortunately i was never able to play this game outside of campaign and custom games with 2 other friends. if my friends ever get MCC on pc i will definitely be playing this, and possibly give it a 10/10. either way, downright fantastic game.. I played this with my son while he was in high school. Really great memories overall. The online experience is very fast-paced though.. just the best game of the franchise, with everything thats good inside of the mechanics. This is an amazing first person shooter, I am a huge Halo fan and had a good to time with this.. My Favorite game of all time and arguably the best game of the Halo Franchise, Must Play.. I will never forget this game, I used to play for hours with my brother and cousin and we had so many fun memories. Very high quality game, wish Microsoft would go back to making games this good.. The best Multiplayer FPS of all time. I don't think we will ever see another game like Halo 3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The peak of Halo. An incredible conclusion to a masterful trilogy, a multiplayer that is still incredibly addictive, forge and custom games shaping the community and building futher on that fun, and a really nice way of sharing those creations too. An excellent customisation system built on achievements, and it all just worked. If this isn't how you do a AAA, highly anticipated, blockbuster release right, then I don't know how you would do it.. Should be the best game of 2007, With amazing graphics and an exciting story it deserves a 10. Gaming Perfection. It feels a little clunky compared to modern shooters, but nevertheless I wish I could have been old enough to play this game in its prime. There will never be a better shooter. Ever.. What do Super Mario 64, Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time, GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark, and Super Smash Bros Melee all have in common? They are all 10/10 games that could never remotley compare to the absolute majesty that is Halo 3. But then again... no interactive entertainment experience ever had such an impact on my life as Halo 3, and I will be blessed but doubtful that any gaming experience ever will again. Halo 3 is truly immaculate in every way. Its art style will stand the test of time as one of the greatest in history, upscaled and in 4K with ray tracing mods Halo 3 looks as good or BETTER than most next generation games based on the strength of its art style alone. Gameplay its literal perfection from start to finish each and every match, the penultimate hybrid of everything I love about Halo CE and Halo 2, two juggernaut FPS titles both 10/10 or higher, fused into one incomparable experience. Forge set the standard for console developed map creators for casual to hardcore gamers. Halo 3's ranking system is more addictive than coke, and vastly more satisfying. The armor customization is amazing, despite there being much less armor in Halo 3 than in Halo Reach, the quality of Halo 3's customization is as top tier as you can ever get. GOATED maps that will be played thousands of years later. Guardian is simply one of the finest arena maps ever developed. The Pit is the greatest symmetrical map ever designed in history. Valhalla is Blood Gulch on a thousand steroids, with graphics and physics that rival and exceed numerous video games from 2023 without any effort at all. Theatre mode is perfect. Weapons are as balanced as it gets with the perfect tuning between Halo CE's overpowered sandbox and Halo 2's underpowered sandbox (sans the slightly nerfed Battle Rifle). Theatre mode was a decade ahead of everything else in the industry to such a degree, that no other studio including Bungie themsleves has been able to replicate Halo 3's UI. Halo Infinite is much better than at launch, if they had triple the budget 343i could NEVER even begin to come close to Halo 3's untouchable design at every level. A must play for any FPS fans, and the only way to truly judge Halo is to experience this game firsthand. Most of my friends many of whom do not care for Halo will play Halo 3 for hours without apology, because this game is the greatest FPS of all time!. Halo 3 is widely regarded as a masterpiece in the gaming industry, earning its status as a 10 out of 10 game for a multitude of reasons. From its engaging narrative and impeccable level design to its innovative gameplay mechanics and enduring multiplayer experience, Halo 3 stands as a benchmark for excellence in the world of video games. In conclusion, Halo 3's blend of gripping storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, exceptional multiplayer offerings, and its impact on gaming culture make it deserving of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. The game's legacy continues to thrive, and it remains a shining example of what a video game can achieve in terms of both quality and cultural significance.. nice game and very good but where is the b*obies, i want more b*obies because they are awesome. The last truly phenomenal Halo game, and the best Xbox 360 exclusive by far.. My favourite Xbox 360 game and best Halo ever. It still holds up to this day.. The best Halo game, no doubt. And my personal best FPS of all time, this game was so damn innovative and exciting and still is today.. Simply incredible. The story is very good, the characters are extremely good, the map is beautiful and the gameplay is addictive. Better than beating this game alone, is beating it in co-op with a friend, it's a lot of fun. The enemies are not easy, their intelligence is even very good in my point of view, and they are very annoying in a certain part, when they combo you together, there is not much to do. The game has a good variety of vehicles and weapons, making it possible to differentiate the gameplay at all times. It's an extremely good game, I highly recommend it.. The franchise will never be this good, 10/10 would reccomend, even in 2023!. This is a strong contender for the greatest FPS of all time. It has impressive graphics that still hold up, the greatest multiplayer in any shooter ever, a great story, and massive levels with huge battles. Near perfection.. Respect for the OG game. Halo Infinite was probably the ending stake in the franchise. Sad to see how low it has fallen. Halo 4 doesn't exist imo. I still play Halo 3 regularly and it still blows me away every single time. Stunning in every department and the best game I have ever played, full stop.. For my money the best of the trilogy. Campaign is amazing, music and voice acting and art direction outstanding once again. Multiplayer is infinitely replayable, adding forge and replays was enormous. A near-perfect capstone to an iconic trilogy. Only complaint is that the campaign is on the shorter side and I miss Halo 2's prophet of truth voice.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the absolute pinnacle of first person shooters, one of the best games ever made, damn near perfect. The most important game for Xbox 360’s then success at the time with Bill Gates says this now infamous quote called: “The day the PS3 launches, they walk right into Halo 3.” And what a way for Bungie’s deal with Microsoft to go out.. Pretty much a flawless game. All the missions are excellent in design and story. The enemy variety may have not been huge but there was so many vehicles and weapons the enemies can use it makes fighting them quite addictive and fun. Gun play is extremely enjoyable especially when using certain weapons like the BR and the beam rifle. My favourite mission is the Covenant and the best parts involve taking down scarabs. The multiplayer was also amazing and addictive as well. Overall a masterclass of an FPS game.. Pretty sure gameplay and i think it had story but i only like the multiplayer part. I'm gonna come out and say it. This is best halo game. The bit with the giant robots is sensational. i played this through with my friend and it was brilliant. Alien guns are **** though, but thats true for every halo i think. Also loved the flood level.. Best game of my childhood, very fun gameplay, I loved forge, best coop and multiplayer experiences, outstanding campaign. This is just pure Halo fun. The campaign doesnt do much new but does everything right. There are a lot of interesting missions that encapsulate the nostalgia that Halo CE invokes. The guns are really satisfying to use. The multiplayer is known for being amazing and it really is. Some gamemodes allow you to sweat it out against others and some are just pure chaos. the music is the same as the other games and kinda repetitive.. Another 3 years, another amazing Halo game and sadly, the end of the original trilogy saga. Halo 3 once again excels the bar set by its predecessor's, giving us another amazing campaign experience with the return of a new multiplayer experience with the introduction on ranks and XP. For a while, I thought the Halo 2 campaign was my favourite in the franchise, Halo 3 leaves me torn between picking the two but both are awesome. The cutscenes, the story all really make for it. For 2007, the graphics really do shine what the Xbox 360 is capable of. I can see the hype for it back in 2007 and see why still to this day, Halo 3 is regarded as one of the best Halo games and a favourite among the fanbase. For 3 years running (2007-09), Halo 3 was the most popular and consistently played games on Xbox 360, with the player base always being in the tenth's of thousands worldwide. Another feature was introduced in Halo 3, Forge, a mode where you can mess around with maps and customise them to your liking. There really isn't a lack of content in this game. Completed the campaign? Try your luck on legendary or look for the hidden skulls that give you a new campaign experience when you play it. Work your way up in the rankings of multiplayer (which as of January 2022 has sadly shut down, so I haven't been able to experience it). Play co-op campaign with your friend. Halo 3 really is an important game. A historical landmark that shows how much games meant to the developers who made them, especially Bungie. When developers truly dedicate time and passion and love for what they create, they create an amazing game like this. Halo 3 really had a close relationship with the fanbase and the developer, Bungie were seen like heroes. It saddens me to see a game like this from 2007, compared to corporate cash grabs that get pushed out every year, half-completed with the rest of the game being update over time through live service or DLC's for £15+, going back to a game like Halo 3 is important to remind us how gaming was back then. Making games out of the passion of being a game developer and pleasing the fanbase whilst at the same time, being successful in doing so, rather than feeding the masses with mediocre and standard generic first person shooters, with no sense of reward that doesn't require whipping out your wallet to feel like you have unlocked something cool. Sadly even Halo has fallen into this pool with Halo Infinite, going back to the older games makes me really wish I could go back and relive these games in their prime, truly taking that time for granted. Didn't really know how good we had it back then. With this being said, I can't deny giving this game the first 10/10. There's a reason why Halo 3 is still being held to this high standard and communities such as Halo 3 Sunrise have pushed to reviving this game by hosting lobbies even after they've been shut, and that is the love this game has accumulated from developers who loved making games and were eager to show their passion projects, with money being a second thought.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. a good game i think but its been years since i played this and forgotten what happened in this one. this game is the reason i bought an xbox 360 when microsoft greedily decided to keep halo as an xbox exclusive and pc gamers were abandoned by the halo franchise , i was so hyped for this game and when i finally played it on xbox 360 it felt ok not bad but just ok , i do consider halo 3 better than halo 2 but still inferior to the first halo combat evolved which has the best storytelling and the best campaign overall , years later i was able to play halo 3 finally on PC when microsoft ported the master chief collection on PC and when i played it again in the comfort of my own computer in 1080p it felt amazing how beautiful the graphics of this 2007 games still are , the campaign is short but epic in fact i consider halo 3 the most epic of all halo games the music of the game gives you that epicness vibe and that intensity in key moments during the gameplay overall is a very good game. ambitious , great since of scale , amazing characters , memorable moments , Arbiter , I played this late but it still managed to be on of my fav games of all time. A solid game, has a good story, good characters, fun level designs, interesting new gear compared to previous games, and beautiful music, but a slight step down from Halo 2 overall. Weapons have even less feel of power behind them than in Halo 2 and the changes to the flood from previous two games made them seem like soft sponges. The story and characters were overall good but did feel a little cheesy at moments but nothing that should bother anyone. Had great moments that really brought out emotions and made you care about the characters. Has a great ending and is a good send off to the original trilogy.. The masterful follow up to the masterpiece that is Halo 2. This game is also flawless. The story incredibly and satisfying. The missions are endlessly fun. The level design and set pieces are fantastic. The game play is so good. The graphics were just amazing. The end of this game is one of the best endings **** ever. The multiplayer is ""chefs kiss perfection. This is a must play game in a must play trilogy. I would question if you are even a gamer if you have never played the original Halo trilogy.. COD 4 and MW 2 are 10/10 games and some of the best multiplayer games I have played in my entire life. This game is even more special to me, so if I could give it an 11/10, I would.. Meh, this one felt weak for (I played the Master Chief Collection version of it). It's the most fascistic and melodramatic of them all yet. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as CE or Reach. This game just rehashes everything from 1 & 2 and puts them in a bigger package. But I was more bored than entertained. Pros: + The epilogue in zero gravity is kinda cool (and almost touching). + Some of the space cutscenes look epic (though, the low resolution reduces the illusion a bit). Cons: - Enemies and allies AI is weak. Allies in cars where dropped me 100+ from the cliffs. Enemies freeze from time to time. - The story is confusing. Like it's cool that we change locations so quickly, but I wasn't clear what's happening and what's my role in it most of the game. Also, the dated engine doesn't allow to take the melodrama of the story seriously. - The level navigation and encounter design are weak too. Like 10+ times I was confused on what I should do and where I should go.. This is where we finished the fight. but for some reason, they dug up the chiefs corpse over and over to try and milk his bones dry. This was peak Halo, and always will be. Reach and Odst were also great. But this is where i lived for about 5 years. Halo was my favorite franchise, but it is dead now. Corporate greed kills gaming, but back then, this game was truly alive.. It's a timeless classic. The game has added everything that was great about the previous games and puts them together. The graphics hold up and the gunplay is amazing.. Halo 3 is the most memorable in the series for good reason. It introduced a legendary multiplayer.. Halo 3, also thought to be one of the greatest games of all time. This game suits that title and I know that Bungie worked hard for it to have that title. when i was in high school i would play this game non-stop because it was the only 360 game i had for quite a while, so when i'd invite friends over we'd usually play the campaign offline. one time we were doing a higher difficulty run and i kept restarting the middle missions from checkpoints, and when my friend asked me why i said there were a handful of ODST's with us and we had to keep them alive because they'd follow us through the next few missions. at one point near the end i restarted after a particularly difficult area, and my friend stormed up and said 'WHO IS YOUR FRIEND, THE FAKE SOLDIERS OR ME?' we got pizza on me as an apology and then i did the same thing again. Later I found out those ODST's just spawn in at the start of each of the levels.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best first person shooter games that has ever existed, this game is a true masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Straight up making everything from Halo CE better, no more corridors or repetitive stuff. Dual Wielding is a very creative solution that can be used in the entire game to overcome battles, playing as the Arbiter is also very cool (with the introduction of some stealth elements). However, the AI is not very good. Some fights are a breeze because of it, and some are hard because the companion AI lost their IQ.. This game is the pinnacle of a video game and was ahead of its time it was too perfect. A bit disappointing. Gameplay yeah it is the best but the campaign left so much to be desired. It feels like it's going through the motions. The opening is amazing and the story and gameplay is really good plus the graphics hold up to this day and it was one of the last times I discovered hope in Halo. The last decent Halo in the franchise in my opinion. Still play Halo 1,2 & 3 on The Master Chief Collection with my nephew. Awesome times.. This game is simply put a masterpiece. It takes everything that worked in the first two Halo games and adds in some new things to make it stand out. The gameplay is fun, the graphics are still good and the story's simple yet enjoyable. It's overall a blast to play through and a must-have addition to everyone's collection.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Campaign: I really enjoy we are Chief during the final offensive of Human-Covenant War also the stakes are very higher as we try to stop the Covenant from Unleashes The Ark also one of the most epic scenes in gaming is the Arrival Of The Forward Unto To Dawn accompanied with amazing score by O' Donnells & Salvatori's Multiplayer: Has some of the best of multiplayers i remember having a good time at Halo Lan Parties playing this game This Is The Bar For Video Game Threequels No Matter The Genre In Gaming 10/10.. Second best story I've ever play (rdr2 is better) but still very good and the best is the multi-player with the second best I've ever seen (overwatch is better) and the best protagonist in gaming for me and overall a amazing experience.. this game is one of my fav games of all time gameplay 10 / 10 music 10 / 10 graphics 8 / 10 the game looks still good and the art style is great level design 10 / 10 the best in the genre multiplayer 10 / 10 so much content and the maps are Amazing overall 10 / 10. I met a guy with a rocket launcher and he was cool and he jumped on the back of a mongoose and we both got on it and we jumped onto a big crab and he shot the rocket launcher at its legs but he feel off and I killed the big crab but then I searched the floor and found the rocket launcher but no body and it was sad rip rocket launcher guy. This game it's just perfect and it aged like fine wine something that most games haven't done. Not my favorite of the halo games, but still very good :) I recommend but I do wish it had something more…. what are we talkin about basically one of the best games ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!. HALO 3 is a game that defined an entire console generation. With its bombastic campaign and fantastic multiplayer that set the bar for online shooters for the 7th generation. Along with Its forge and theater modes that really brought the entire Halo fan base together in what were new creative ways. Halo 3 improves upon Halo 2 in almost every way the weapon sandbox has been expanded and improved on. New vehicles are fun and iconic in the series. The game visually still holds up pretty well for a over 14 year old game. The story managed to conclude a trilogy in a satisfying way and fulfilling way, But if I had to criticize Halo 3 I'm not a fan of the prophets voice change nor his change in character as he feels more like a one dimensional bad guy in this one. And the fact there's no arbiter levels is a shame as it felt like he didn't really have much to do in this game. I would of liked him to playa bigger role in the game and I would of liked to see more characterization in the elites a s a whole such as the shipmaster. While I'm talking about Elites the switch to brutes as the main enemy I'm not a big fan of. They are fun to fight nut not as fun I feel and the elites in this game you just don't see enough of them and there kinda more doofy in this game then previous titles. Other then that the campaign is a great time non the less. And on a final note the multiplayer in Halo 3 is some of the best in he series and I cant count the many hours spent playing in my life.. Best Videogame ever, Multiplayer changed everything in the industrie. 170 mio in 24h. This is the best halo game ever The multiplayer is good The story is stunning Thanks to bungie Unfortunately they are no more making halo :(. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even though many people don't like this game's campaign because of the storyline, at least you can admit the multiplayer is fricking brillant.. Halo 3 is a true successor to both of its predecessors, being everything that fans hoped it would be. The campaign is **** finished the fight...a Great ending for this trilogy!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Top tier halo game. Fantastic campaign with coop or solo. The online PvP matchmaking is just purely some of the best ever. For the 360 and the era, the graphics are amazing. Only not given a 10 because nothing is perfect. A work of art.. Halo 3 Halo 3 is a very good game in my opinion. the only thing I didn't like in the game was the 9th episode and it had a logic like hit and walk in the 9th episode, other than that it's a very nice and very good game.. Halo is quite simply the closest thing we have ever experienced to a living, breathing alternate universe.. Another forgettable Halo campaign, I honestly couldn't remember much about it.. Great top off to the greatest FPS of all time. Seriously the only FPS that are better than this is Halo 2 and Half Life 2. Halo 3 is too iconic to not play it.. Just amazing. This game story is really good and the gameplay is simple and smooth.. Pros: + epic battles + engaging combat + weapon variety + vehicle variety + scarab fights + end game escape sequence + good ost Cons: - fragile vehicles - bad checkpoints. This review is tailored to anyone who is on the fence about playing the game for the first time, and, as such, it will be subjected to today's standards. Halo 3 was advertised as the ending of the Master Chief storyline. At the end of the previous title, the player is left wanting more, so the question is: Did Halo 3 deliver on that promise? Bungie had everything going for them when starting Halo 3. There were no tight deadlines, the team knew the kind of story they wanted to tell and what gameplay worked and what didn't. The gameplay kept betting on that power fantasy the series is known for, with all the weapons and gameplay additions from previous titles, present, yet again. Now, the player is also able to use different abilities that work as pickups, similar to weapons, that can create new gameplay scenarios, though I didn't see myself using them very often. Thanks to the story from Halo 2, in its sequel your main enemy are the Brutes, however, while menacing, they didn't feel like a big threat, since, when compared to their previous iteration, they're much weaker and their design isn't as interesting. The soundtrack was, as always, a masterpiece and it knew the right moments to play. It felt like the culmination of every piece written before it. The story, however, left me feeling slightly disappointed. The Halo 2 promise of an all out war on Earth was finally realized in this game, but it felt like some elements that made Halo 2's campaign extremely interesting were abandoned. The Arbiter, perhaps due to some of the fan backlash, took a back seat and felt like a cheap copy of the character we were introduced to in the previous game. The same thing happened to the previously established main antagonists, becoming nothing more than some Saturday morning cartoon villains. The level design was so good, however, that the story didn't bother me that much. Overall, Halo 3 left me feeling slightly disappointed with its story and the expectations the previous game built, simply weren't met. However, the amazing gameplay and sandbox, mixed with the simple yet genius mission design and environments made me forget these issues. The ending was a beautiful way to send off the Master Chief until someone would need him again.... Halo 3 mostly recaptures the open and creative feel of Halo: CE, and brings the Halo trilogy to an exciting and action packed conclusion, if one that is not particularly unique.. I'm a tad late to the party however one of the best games I've ever played custom games campaign music multiplayer Simply Sublime. One of the greatest games ever made. It's the quintessential Halo, it's where Bungie got the formula the most fine tuned.. I r gai, who gon teech u leson!!!1!1!11! Haloss 3 greatest games ive plaid in mai entir Xbux alive. The story/plot of the campaign is near perfection, not on the level of Halo 2 or Reach but close. The characters are good but a downgrade to Halo 2's incredibly written cast and the campaign is not as in depth. Where the campaign really shines is in terms of its sandbox and gameplay. The sandbox is incredible with the introduction of equipment and multiple new weapons like the grav hammer and spartan laser. Equipment really makes each encounter more dynamic and fun as it adds another level of thought behind what you do so it feels more rewarding when you utilise equipment well. The guns are the most balanced they have been since CE so each weapon feels viable even on higher difficulties. The first few missions are quite standard and slow but still a good introduction to the game, however the game really begins to pick up after Tsavo Highway with The Storm, Floodgate, The Ark and The Convenant. These 4 missions are 11/10 each being so uniqu",i've heard the story isn't as good but i don't care for stories in games . i'm angry that they suddenly cut the series . a must-play for anyone remotely into shooters .
690.Metropolis Street Racer,"Pioneer in its genre with circuit in real streets. He gave a kick in graphics, speed and gameplay to PSX's Gran Turismo. An offshoot of the tournament/challenge format of Gran Turismo, adding a method of unlocking new races using ""kudos"" points for overperforming on its various levels. It looks nice, the handling is good but there are perhaps too many clock and slalom based challenges compared to actual races, which are much more fun.. A must have racing game for the Dreamcast. Gameplay 9/10 Graphics 10/10 Music 8/10 Longevity 8/10 Score 9/10 One of the best racing games jn the system, if not the best. Spanish: Juego bastante sobrevalorado. Tiene la innovación que se fija en la zona horaria donde te encuentres para que sea de noche o de día en el lugar donde juegues. Pocos coches, conducción regular y nada adictivo. Unos meses más **** salió a la venta Gran Turismo 3 que fue mejor de largo. 7.2/10 English: Game quite overrated. It has the innovation that is fixed in the time zone where you are so that it is night or day in the place where you play. Few cars, regular driving and nothing addictive. A few months later, Gran Turismo 3 went on sale which was better by far. 72/100. I had the chance to play the game back in 2000. It was mindblowing. All the cities, the details, the music. A very arcade game, very challenging. This game paved the way for Microsoft and the PGR franchise. Sadly it wasn't enough to save the Sega Dreamcast !","Gran Turismo 3 is an offshoot of the tournament/challenge format of Gran Turismo . it adds a method of unlocking new races using ""kudos"" points for overperforming on its various levels . sadly it wasn't enough to save the Sega Dreamcast ."
691.FIFA Soccer 09,"Too hard control for pc and I can't connect external Controllers............... FIFA 09 was my first Xbox 360 game. This game led me to believe that Xbox games were not the best and I didn't play the game for a while. However when I got back into this game I realised that it can actually be quite fun and in my opinion is better than FIFA 10 and 11 due to the fact that the ball sounds so fluent and exaggerated which to me is a good feature. The game's graphics were more than decent for their time and it was a real shame when they took the servers down for the game.. Nice, this is the type of soccer game I can recommend, the graphics are alright, and at least they didn't add the curves while players are running but they have to run straight without losing any balance to the ball. I you compare it to FIFA 10, not really, even though FIFA promised that most players moralities would be even higher, but looks like, still the same thing. Anyway on FIfa 09 you don't get as much as bugs as FIFA **** bad thing though is the AI is a bit slow when you want to make slick passes, and it's really detailed as FIFA 10's graphics. Though for game speed it's simple and fast.",this is the type of soccer game I can recommend . the game's graphics were more than decent for their time . the AI is a bit slow when you want to make slick passes .
692.Jeanne d'Arc,"It'sa crime that this game hasn't been remastered for another platform or gotten the sequel treatment.. Jeanne d'Arc is a fantastic tactical RPG that blends French history, and fantasy together. And a game people have been asking for a reappearance, be it on PS Plus, or as a remake, and it's hard to disagree with them. The tactical depth in this game puts it on par with titans of the genre, like FF Tactics and Fire Emblem. There is an excellent attention to detail with the English voice acting, where the French characters have good French accents (despite being voiced by American actors), and the English characters having solid English accents. And it uses excellent quality animated cutscenes. While not wholly original in terms of gameplay, it manages to elevate familiar mechanics to new heights. A must buy for strategy game lovers.. Pros: You can mix different abilities for the characters, making some very unlikely combinations. The mechanic of Transform is pretty cool and turn some characters into a killing machine. Use of Cartoons for the story telling is amazing. Combining Skills system is very fun and makes you want to discover all recipes. Cons: Every match have a turn limit. 20 for standard matches and could get to 40 for some story matches. There is no class assignmnet like FFT or Tactics Ogre. The world stages have predefined levels but there is no way to check what is the level match before entering it. Details: It's a fun and innovative game, but things like limiting the turns on all matches deeply hinders the fun, and it's even worse on end game. In some matches you can be under level and even if you manage through strategy to keep alive, you will not have enough time to kill everyone and you lose the match. Some of the story of the game is told through Cartoons instead of using ingame animation. This idea was great and the Cartoons are very well made and help to give more life to every character. Regarding Stages, if you join a match and you are under 10 levels, you will need to reload. Winning would be very very hard because not only you are underlevel, but you will only have 20 turns to finish. So even if you have strategy to keep alive and hitting the enemy slowly, you will eventually run out of time.. Story of this game is absolutely the best part of it. At first the game is really nothing special and it's kinda boring. But suddenly everything is starting to get very interesting and to be honest I didn't expect that at all. For me it was little bit to long and I highly recommend using cheats to speed up the grind for a little. Gameplay isn't really something extraordinary... It's very simple and we've all seen it thousands times before... But the story is really worth everything! Characters are interesting and unique and the plot is just amazing... A lot of memorable moments... Story telling at its finest! Only if gameplay would be just a little bit more unique and if it could have full voice acting Jeanne D'arc could be really 10/10 game!. This is the best JRPG for the system. Much better than any other game. Of course, is a tactical JRPG, but you need to give it a try.. Very unique in its own perspective and an amazing game on the PSP nonetheless. The game is very entertaining, has an engaging plot and becomes easily very addictive.. One of the best games on PSP so happy I can download it on my Vita! I’ve played over 60 hours on 3 different files. Just so much characters, weapons and attacks to find and use!. One of the shining gems of the PSP era. A great take on the SRPG genre and fills the void for a true successor of final fantasy tactics.. I'm about 15 hours in and the game isn't throwing enough new content to keep me interested in terms of gameplay side of things so here's my thoughts so far... the UI is clunky when combining skills that you find throughout the game, it's practically mandatory to do so in order to get the optimal build for the next mission unless you want to risk failing and losing all your progress in the mission and to keep using the few abilities that you are able to get from drops. There's no way to simply select the menu recipes you've unlocked to just consume the items for the recipe. It would've been much more straightforward if the enemies dropped the items you needed to progress directly instead of this poorly designed UI that you're expected to dredge through between missions (i.e. 1/3 of the game). I kinda feel like the armband ability is pretty unbalanced as it allows characters with this ability to just sweep the battlefield of enemies and accumulate tons of EXP so i end up trying to avoid using it to not leave the 5 or so other characters in the dust since they are needed to carry your armband wielding characters and to leave openings for chain kills. It's like the game wants to punish you indirectly for relying on these character's abilities too much. There's a variety of different character classes to mix and match in your party but you'll find that the characters you are able to use don't really change your strategy much since you'll end up using most of the ones you have available to you anyways since the number of characters you are able to use per mission increases, maybe later on there'll be more available characters so that this doesn't remain the case. There also isn't much incentive to take risks besides the turn limit which hasn't really become an issue as of yet, there has been one time so far where i was at risk of failing due to the turn limit but that could've been just because i wanted to clear the level of enemies first. If the game becomes more difficult later on i'd bump my score to a 6. As long as you keep your characters in formation there is little risk of one dying, the enemies will only focus down one of your characters if they are separated from the formation. Is the game fun? ehhh it's alright. It's engaging at the very least. the game must've been good for 2007 but i don't think it holds up in 2019. Is the story good? There were some interesting parallels between the first recurring antagonist and the protagonist but i am unsure if this is intentional and would be explored in more detail later, the main big bad guy seems to be the evil dark lord archetype that does evil for the sake of accumulating power except it's under the guise of a possessed child *evil yawn*. Other than that nothing exciting has happened so far, it's just been a power fantasy where the protagonist goes around slaughtering English soldiers and demons with minimal effort. her development as a character is yet to be seen as she hasn't seemed to learn anything beyond ""English = bad guys"" though there could be the potential for more interesting interactions as the protagonist is so driven to killing without mercy that she may end up slipping towards being a sort of ""war lord"" and end up killing the wrong people. The music is heavily recycled so that part of the experience is not worth mentioning. the graphics and character portraits are not bad especially for the psp.. I enjoyed this game very much. It was very entertaining for the most part. There were times that it felt like it drug on a bit, and the story is strange, but the overall effect was an enjoyable game that was worth what I paid for it.. You may have noticed the words ""Enemy phase"" in some screenshots of this game. That is because there is no queue to be found, just your turn and the enemy's turn.. A very satisfying turn-based JRPG all-around. The game starts out very slow, but after a few stages both the story and the gameplay pick up. The characters are for the most part interesting, and you feel for the characters when something bad happens to them. The gameplay can get repetitive at times, but the number of characters, variety of skills and gear, and bonus stages keep the gameplay interesting. The only major weaknesses in the game are the relatively low replay value and the fact that some characters are a pain to use and level up.. Jeanne d'Arc was a relatively early PSP release, and an interesting one too. The story may have been borrowed from the past, but there's a cool fantasy twist on it, and the traditionally animated cutscenes are fun to watch. The gameplay is basically what you would see in classic tactical RPGs, but I have to emphasize how polished the mechanics are. The way each character's unique ability fits in with one another really adds to the strategy element. You just have to try this out for yourself. However, it is a little too ""beginner friendly"", as your team usually has the upper hand in most fights to carry you through the game. So, if you're looking for a punishing challenge, you should look somewhere else. Presentation-wise, everything from the colourful visuals to the dramatic voice acting is very high quality. It's a great piece of work, so I recommend picking this up if you're into a unique story driven tactical RPG game.. This is a great tactical RPG game. The main advantage is deep turn-based combat, where you need to use any of your troops and skills wisely, the battles have many nuances. The story is decent though of course it has little in common with real history. The characters are memorable, the dialogues are lame sometimes. The anime cutscenes are nice. Also the game has pretty graphics and addictive gameplay.. Not impressed. The graphics are great for PSP, and I love me some turn-based RPGs. However, what's with the super-archaic turn structure? Super slow heavily-armored knights get to move just as many times as my super fast thief guy (with the exception of Jeanne's special ability, which will have her skipping all over the entire level, killing 4-5 guys in a single turn)? Spells and skills don't have to charge at all? Every single one of my units gets to move before every single one of their units does? Forgive me for making the comparison, but this is nowhere near the strategy level of Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics. It feels like a beginner's introduction into turn-based games (which never needed an introduction). The whole point of mixing which team moves when (one of mine goes, one of theirs goes, 2 of mine go, etc etc) is to give it a vaguely real-time feel. This game feels like the enemy stands there waiting for all my people to move and attack, until finally asking ""is it my turn now?"" Production values are very high (liberties with the story aside), and you can tell it was well-thought out and executed, but given the cons I listed above and the stupidly arbitrary mission-success requirements (ie you have to ""escape"" your enemies by making it to one edge of the map, but you can still fail even if you kill them all), I will probably never end up playing it again.. The most awesome game on PSP, period. Don't believe those who say it's not as good as Final Fantasy Tactics, as it is in fact much better! But don't take my word for it... Quick question: What do God Of War, MGS, GTA, Final Fantasy, and all the other games that are rated higher than this one have in common? Answer: All of them are part of a franchise that was already massively successful, before a new episode was ported to the PSP. As one of the few people who tried the PSP versions of the new franchise episodes with fresh eyes, from not having played almost any of the previous instances from these series on any other platform, I can't help but find that scores are massively biased. God Of War, GTA, FFVII, Persona 3? Meh. MGS? Will never come close as its first instalment on PS1. The only title from an existing franchise actually worth its place around the top on PSP is Ridge Racer. If critics were actually objective, all the others would be much lower rated. But let's also compare with non franchise games: Lumines better than Jeanne D'Arc? Not a chance. The Lumines guys haven't spent 10% of the development time that went into Jeanne D'Arc, and, as addictive as the game may be to some, it shows. Siphon Filter: very good game, which deserves a lot of credit for managing to be highly playable despite Sony's idiotic lack of insight with regards to the second analog stick. But still a bit too predictable and not as polished. And then you get all the stuff like Patapon, LocoRoco, LittleBigPlanet, etc., that tries so hard that it actually gets into the way of the gameplay. Sorry, but this game is miles above the rest, graphically, story-wise and in terms of playability and, what matters most, enjoyment for players. Truly of a class of its own!. Truly a sleeper hit I could easily have missed, if you enjoy tactical fantasy games this is a must play. The theme might seem off-putting but it is actually well handled from a fantasy perspective. From a historical perspective there are someserious liberties taken, but there is just enough true history to make this fairytale a great story and a lot of fun. Graphics and sound are quite impressive to boot.","jeanne d'Arc is a fantastic tactical RPG that blends french history, and fantasy . the french characters have good french accents, and the english characters have solid English accents . there is an excellent attention to detail with the english voice acting ."
693.Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition,"It started really.......really bad, just some nice designs here and there, but nothing awesome, but the game evolved pretty well during the years, to the point at i really wanted to playing after a hard day at work, it deserves a good score.. Loading is too long. Many of the costume designs are terrible. There are few attractive characters and the techniques are difficult to use.. A good Street Fighter, a horrible launch.................................... No other game has ever disappointed me so much. Donation wash. I used to love Capcom products as a kid. Now I despise her. I won't buy another game from them. I have this series associated with something pleasant from childhood. Now I hate Capcom for what they did to the series. Do not buy their products, they have already completely beguiled the coast from greed.. I can see the appeal, but I can't bring myself to enjoy it. I've generally been more of an airdasher enthusiast when it comes to fighting games, but SFV has intrigued me for quite a while, so I figured I'd pick it up, and I have to say, I do completely understand the appeal it has. The footsies in this game are second to none when it comes to the current generation of fighting games, and it lends itself to a really calculating moment to moment decisionmaking process, as you navigate one another's hitboxes, and attempt to set up spacing traps for the sweet counterhit confirms. That said, the netcode is certainly issue, and markedly impacted my enjoyment of the game. There were a lot of matches that were borderline unplayable, even on a wired connection with only the best connections being accepted, which was exacerbated by the relative sluggishness of a lot of the characters. The poor netcode, combined with the input lag and the slow nature of a lot of anti-air options, made dealing with netcode jump-ins a total nightmare. It felt awful to have some games where my opponent and I were on great connections, and were able to enjoy that solid footsies core, but most of the time I was essentially guessing how many times the opponent was going to jump in, as any attempt to stuff out this barebones option was just too slow to come out on reaction. The same goes for throws. I felt as though even though I had reacted that the throw was out, a lot of times the combined input lag would be such that i'd get thrown before my tech could come out. This even happened late into some of my predictions too, not just the reactions. Netcode aside, I didn't really appreciate how minimal the movement options were in this game. Even the characters with less movement options felt pretty limited in terms of what they were capable of. Movement has always been a huge part of why I enjoy fighting games, hence why I'm drawn to airdashers like Melty and Gear, so to not have that wealth of options just didn't sit right with me. Overall, I get what the fuss is about, and I'm glad i gave the game a shot, but I think I'll stick to more fast-paced fighters for now.. This is the game that killed street fighter for me! Street fighter 5 is a glorified rock, paper, scissor game that panders to the brain dead masses and feeds on microtransactions. If you want to pay extra money after purchase for fixing a broken game then sure be an idiot. I remember street fighter was about actual skill whereas this game is about random chance and squeezing every last dollar from you. A monumental fall from grace for scamcom and an insult to street fighter.. Okay, so I've wanted to go ahead and post a review of SF5 here in May 2021 after playing through the main story, individual stories and playing arcade mode, etc. I just finished playing MK11. This game deserves it's decent score of 7. Compared to the masterpiece that is MK11 Ultimate with their lifelike characters (often using real actor voices), quite impressive story mode, etc, I'd say the game is probably more along the lines of a 5. HOWEVER, it's still a decent fighting game. I, like many of my age, loved and obsessed about SF2 and it really ""changed the game"" and introduced a whole era of fighting games. I really didn't follow it too much beyond the end of Super Street Fighter 2 and really didn't play much of the whole ""Ultra Street Fighter Beta Gamma Zero vs X-Men vs Anime"" versions but I think Capcom has really allowed the franchise to be taken in the wrong direction. SF5 is a continuation in cheesy-ness (and NOT in a good way), silliness and obnoxiousness. The character models look decent, but are WAY over-exaggerated with teenage-hormones. Just watch a video of the ""boob physics"" of a pre-patched Chun-li and you'll see what I'm talking about. Every man has super-steroid muscles and every woman has embarrassingly big bosoms that is to the point of being offensive. Is that really what this game is about? The story lines, voice overs, etc are just painfully awful. I mean, it's who came up with these incoherent plots? To make matters worse, clearly no effort was made for the English version and the mouth movements don't even come close to matching the audio. It's like it all was created in Japanese and then shipped overseas for a sloppy conversion. Story Mode: You know that it was half-assed when you install SF5 and the Story Mode is greyed out with no instructions on what to do. Yes, you have to FIND the story in the PS store and install it. Then, you have a mess of story. Compare that with the MK11 storyline that I personally thought was better than the 2021 MK movie. In this story mode, it jumps around and scenes can last for as little as one sentence before loading and jumping to something else. The difficulty is moronically low for most of the game until it cranks it up only at the very end. Sometimes you are playing the left side and sometimes the right: no real pattern. Sometimes you're the ""good guy"" and sometimes the ""bad guy"": again, no pattern. Often, it seems like what you did was totally pointless in terms of the story. Bad and painfully bad. Arcade Mode. Oh okay, so they have where you can play through SF1 through 5, awesome, right? Maybe you start off with SF1 playing only as RYU and play against the original characters and only have the moves that were in the first, no powerups, no BS ""no! it can't be!"" lines, etc? That'd be pretty cool. Maybe make a UI screen that kinda mirrored the SF2 arcade screen, etc. NOPE. None of that. Instead, it's an afterthought. Like playing as Street Fighter 2, it has kinda a mixture of characters and the only thing authentic is an attempt to have the basic costumes and backgrounds. Pointless. I played Ultra Street Fighter IV (released 10+ years ago on the PS3) and frankly, it comes pretty close to the experience of V. That's pretty pathetic. Finally, lets talk value. MK11 Ultimate retails for $60 and contains everything. SF5 Premium Pass Bundle for $60 includes the Champion Edition + Season 5. It doesn't include: Season 3 or 4 ($30 combined) nor any of the MANY DLCs for costumes like the Pro Tour Packs (2016-2021, $10 each), etc. So... it feels like a money grab and that's TODAY and ignoring the joke that it was years ago. So, I mean, it's worth it if you can tolerate the silliness and idiotic plot and lines and such, but it's jsut not THAT good and not where it should be 11 years later after the release of SF4. NetherRealm has shown what GREAT games really can be with the Injustice games and MK11. Maybe it's just time to let the Street Fighter series die.. Load times are very long on the ps4, there are momentary lags and the content is lacking.... Street Fighter V is one of the best games with a amazing competitive scene, amazing online, updated game, and new characters every couple months. So bad Bad design Unbelievable glitches and bugs, even during the cinematics Aged terribly. best street fighter game probably ever made.This game easiest Street fighter game ever and it was need.Because it was too difficulte game in the past. character designs are incredible good especially females characters. gameplay it has most characteristic characters ever. countless customization options are availeble online is good even netcode issue. Story mode was also good for fighting game. I bought vanilla SFV at launch because I'm a longtime fan. I've been trying overcome my disappointment by believing the DLC would make this game better but, so far, it hasn't. The only positive aspects are that the graphics are good and some of the new designs are beautiful. The rest is either super boring, or unfair, or simply lazily done. - Some characters will always overpower others no matter what you do or how good you become at learning your favorite character. - Character story mode is ridiculous: a couple of awful pieces of artwork and text in between fights with a brain dead AI. - Many classic costumes we all love (like Dhalsim's, Balrog's and Vega's) are either DLC or only obtained through their lootbox gambling system. To make it worse, the only money you can use to gamble is Fight Money, which can only be obtained through their boring/unfair online multiplayer or by performing many ""missions"" (A.K.A. doing boring actions several times) that only yield a bit of FM every week. - At the end of Arcade Mode you get a boring comic strip of something your character does. Remember in 1991 when we got fully animated endings? - At the beginning of a match, there's a plane that goes left to right from one flag to another. Remember in 1991 when we got a full map? - Many of the new characters are uninteresting and I wonder why they would choose Falke, Ed, Necalli, Fang, and G over other many fan favorites. The game overall feels empty, soulless, and a huge step back from SF4.. arcade edition is pretty nice and fun, maybe a bit too late but its a good game. This is the gaming equivalent of a Hollywood 'remake' that nobody asked for. Think Robocop 2014, but with no technological advancement over its predecessor. If you missed SF2-4, then go and play them - they're cheap (sometimes free!) and much better. If you're bored of those games, then you haven't really played them. If you're capcom - congrats on the 30 years of awesome Steet Fighter games you made - how about you remake Final Fight next time? plenty of dead horses to flog and I don't think there's anything left to flog of this one.. They did it again! Capcom can't stop screwing this game franchise. I'm done. By the way, what's the point of selling a physical media of the game if, in order to access it's full content , the player have to download it with a online activation code? SF is over to me, thank you, Capcom!. Street Fighter 5 suffers from typical modern day fighting game tropes( balance changes in patches, DLC characters being OP) But its biggest let down is how it has no identity. Overall poorly designed, but a little fun to play for what it is. Hopefully SF6 is much better and more like SF4. Still laggy without any of my favorite characters. Staying exclusive on PlayStation and nerfing anyone who had been good in other games like Juri and Ibuki, this late I to the series is not acceptable. This game can barely play online and neglected to create a ps4 pro patch as well. Also being covered in advertising for something that has been paid for along with over priced dlc every inch of the way for let down seasons after left down season. This game is just a giant let down.. 50/50 grabs vs attacks. Slow gameplay. Lagswitch competition. Broken netcode. They nickel and dime you, the whole game is pretty much microtransactions. Most important here is gameplay and the mechanic ****. blocking shold be a button not going backwards, there should also be simple combos into special moves like mortal kombat. there should also be alot more mechanics into the fighting in general. the entire game is based on way too simple movement, and people just goes for characters that can be played in the most coward ways. the trophies are too grindy. soo the entire game is a **** disaster! i hate it! The graphics are bad, the characters looks ugly compared too older games. skins are not good enough. they should learn from netherralms development and its ability too try something new with the same iconic characters! streetfighter is maybe a fun offline game, but you have too consider the game as whole. and in that way it ****!. the series is good but this one unfortunately is bad , i bought a full game so what is the need to buy players also .. This game is terrible. After you purchase it they place ads every time you select a character for some European brand that is equivalent to Target. If you think you would like to compete with your friend, be prepared to see ads for underwear before every match. The company thinks that they are in the business of selling trash to people who paid to play a game. My hope is that the CEO, Kenzo Tsujimoto, starts to take responsibility for actions of this company. There are better USA based companies, stop giving these people your money when they treat you like garbage. It is sad because I loved this franchise but they just see me as someone who wants to buy underwear from the Japanese K-mart. Don't waste your money on this game. Go play Fortnite instead. At least they don't make you watch underwear commercials just to select your character.. Just like street fighter is supposed to be, hard to learn, hard to master, you really need to learn a few combos,thankfully, conbos are very satisfying.. Weakest entry to the series, possibly even weaker than Street Fighter 4. The combat seems dumbed down in all the wrong ways, the top tiers have tools other characters can only dream of having, let alone deal with, and the game just feels like it accentuates too much offense, and not enough other variations of play. There are a variety of modes with this update, but you could have 100 modes, if the core gameplay just isn't there, what is the point?. Do not be pushed back by negative reviewers. SFV is one of the best fighting games in this era. Althrough, 3 years ago it had a drawback at launch because lack of content and characters, but now the current state of SFV is nearly perfection. There are many characters, Arcade mode and General Story mode). Graphic is superb, Characters are well balanced, Online matchmaking works well. You can crossplay with PC gamers. Finding match is easy if you play on prime time. The only bad part is, though, the netcode, which sometimes cause unstable connection, so be warnned. I hope Capcom could find a way to improve this. Some new characters will have to be paid or grind to get but if you buy Arcade edition you will have 12 additional characters more than Standard edition (which only has 16). With Arcade Edition, you will have most 70% of characters here. The price is cheap now and has been discount many times, so I suggest buying it when sale 50-60%. By the way, If you are beginners and want to play online, my suggestion is only play Ranked match because in Casual match, there are many smurfs lurking around. If you play Casual, you may get bodied by them. Even online Ranked match at low level is very completitive. The game has steep learning curve. Diligent work is required if you want be excel online. This game is just trash!! Capcom failed big time with this game smh.. The pros only play it for the money.. What did i get for my money this time? And how many more i need to spend to play game i bought for full price when only 30% is unlocked? Its 30% **** this time. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. I just bought this game 4 days ago and am disappointed. I saw the hype around and was immediately wanting to buy it because I had bought and played USFIV. I was thinking this could be great and I realized something. This game is really **** You wanna know why. Well, they've simplified the systems, given little content compared to previous SF games and other fighting games, and honestly, I am not surprised, because this is capcom and they also ended up destroying games that could have been amazing like MVCI or Deadrising 4.. Amazing Game fun to play love SF. Fun to play good graphics but when you pay your fee for the game you get like 40% of it. You gonna buy every year a new seasson for new characters . its kinda annoying.. Same awful netcode, same short limbs on every character. Nothing's changed.. sf2s (9) sfAlphas (8) sf3 (7) sf4 (6) u can guess d next n a progresiv dcliv /misses d art dn creativity n a sad way. If this was the game released at launch I wuld have bought it. There are so many modes and options to play that it has hooked me in and Tekken 7 is deleted. There is another season of fighters of which I have unlocked 3 of them and a few stages for free throgh fight money. Not one free unlockable fighters offered with Tekken. It can be a grind though and real money seems to wanted for the extras but if you want only some fighters like me then spending extra wont be needed.. Capcom saved the game in this update, cant get tired of playing G, they just need to balance the game and it will be fine. This is not even a game. It's the worst possibile chapter after one of the most competitive fighting games ever: Street Fighter 4. This garbage is totally random and brainless. Thanks Capcom. I will never ever buy another Street Fighter game at day 1. This crap ruined all.. Game is amazing and has a lot of content. Online is great but takes too long to get into a match sometimes.. I have been playing sf since sf2 and this is one of my least favourite entries in the series not because the gameplay is bad but because of the almost doa5 levels of dlc in this game. It will nickel and dime you every chance it gets fight money was nerfed you can get some stuff for free but clearly they want you to buy items with real money. It’s mobile game like approach is just awful and it’s not a f2p game capcom has really messed up its not all bad the gameplay is good but with so many other options for less money why bother?. 1st off you can easily tell this garbage game was made in less than half the amount of time that sf4 was made. everything from the lack of stages ,characters ,supers, special moves, voice acting, terrible netcode and gameplay mechanics. and don't forget about that next gen banana hair. this game is not only a disgrace to the sf series but all fighters in general !. I really wanted to like Street Fighter V but there is so much to dislike about it. Gone are the days of a complete (fighting) game and SFV is leading the pack: What I liked: .The game is gorgeous, with amazing backgrounds, vibrant colors, SOME great character designs. .Laudable attempt at a larger story mode even if it was not the best. .V-Triggers are a nice idea. .Much more accessible to newer players. .Some great musical tracks; Rashid's is so amazing I put it on my main menu as soon as I found out I could do that. What I hated: .You want a new character? Pay us! .You want a new stage? Pay us! .You want to buy those things with fight money? Psyche we took away almost all ways of making in game money. PAY US! .Unlocked a new in game costume through your characters story mode? Want to use it? Hold up playa, you got pay fight money for that! .Those titles you used to get free in USF4? Pay Fight money! .Crush counters are TERRIBLE! Why? Because some characters benefit far more than others. Urien, Bison, Karin, Cammy...AKUMA!!! .V-Triggers are imbalanced, with some being amazing and others being laughable! Again Urien's Aegis is game changing while Zeku's V Trigger 1 **** made this v trigger!??! Capcom has brought a free to play payment method into a game that is not free to play and it disgusts me! People will jump to defend it and say, ""You can pay fight money!"" but as of recently that is no longer viable, with fight money now being a constant grind for 50 fight money in online ranked/casual (Only on wins) or leveling up your character through matches, their story, demonstrations or trials. I paid full price for a fighting game but you are telling me I have to buy 4 seasons worth of content, (each separately) for 19.99 to 29.99 to get the full experience. So my 59.99 becomes a 100.00+ investment? I am baffled people are okay with such methods! It would be fine if you could test drive characters like some free to play games allow you to practice with them but you are buying and hoping this character is awesome. If you do not have the character unlocked you can not practice with or against them in training mode, so good luck. Akuma, Menat, Abigail, Kolin, Urien, Balrog, Blanka, Guile at one point or the other were ""top tier"" but also behind a pay wall of, Season Passes. I paid full **** is this!?!?!? The Character Balance is so terrible, though this has not changed since...well Capcom made fighting games. I have pumped hours into this game online and offline! This is coming from a place not of hatred but disappointment. USF4 gave you EVERYTHING...where did that all go? The game is a decent fighting game but lack of balancing, Capcom's nickle and diming along with some questionable design choices makes this game a pass for me.. Two years later, this is still Scam Fighter V. Don't get fooled by the gaudy coat of paint this game got, or by the journalists that played its singleplayer modes for a couple of minutes - the core issues this game had remain the same. TWO YEARS, and all they did was to turn a broken rushed mess into a bad game that only works offline. Of course, traditional anti-airs feel more consistent, the ridiculous comeback mechanics have been toned down, throw loops have been fixed, and the new characters have provided the game with a wider array of playstyles, sure, but a fighting that has basic mechanics that actually work is not a miracle, it is just what should be expected from the most famous fighting game series. The most important gamemode - the online - remains barely functional. 70% or more of your games will have crippling lag, which makes the whole experience feel unresponsive, frustrating, and amateurish at best, forcing you to constantly blacklist most of the people you play with just to get a chance to have a decent match every once in a while. Imagine waiting 3 to 5 minutes per match, only to get unplayable sets against lag-teleporting opponents that base their strategy solely on lag-abuse. Waiting is the verb that summarizes the whole SFV experience - waiting for new characters, waiting for the patch that will make this game 'good', waiting for the new edition that will change everything. This game's whole existence is based on people waiting for the next big thing - that they will have to pay extra money for, of course - waiting for things that they should already have in the first place. SFV is a gambling game at its core, all you do is throw money and time at it, and hope for the best. The same could be said about its core gameplay. Even if you take the lag out of the equation, what's left is a game that lacks any spark. The turn-based flow of the combat, the overall lack of decent defense options, and the way the game balances its core mechanics creates a very shallow set-play heavy experience, where clever decision making in the neutral is often punished rather than rewarded. No matter how well you understand your opponent's every move, big risks followed by re-heated set-play will always get you further than playing interactively. Matches feel mostly like a button-mashing competition as players try every trick in the book to get a fast stun for massive damage. A simple innocent mistake can put you a disadvantage loop that can cost you a round in less than a couple of seconds, even if you played perfectly for a whole minute without taking damage and countering all of your opponent's moves. The truth is that playing random and stupid is the only way to actually get a chance to survive the way this game structures pressure and turns. As a result, winning doesn't feel that good because you know that you're just forcing 50/50s and boring mixups on your opponent over and over again without much thought, and losing feels terrible, because you know you didn't even get a fair chance to get back on your feet. Using your brain actively to solve problems and overcome challenges as they come - which is one of the greatest pleasures of fighting games - is almost forbidden in this game. When you play smart, you often find yourself waiting for your opponent to make mistakes so you can punish them, but punishing obvious bad choices achieves nothing compared to actually making a series of highly punishable moves that work because of lag (which makes even the most basic of punishes way harder than it needs to be). Even if you know how to condition your opponent, you know a random choice is evetually going to stop you on your tracks and completely reverse the momentum. It boils down to how well you can play randomly against other people playing randomly, which is a very uninspired and simplistic take on what the genre has to offer. SFV was already the worst big fighting game of its generation, and it's 'second chance' is shaping up to be just a symbolic improvement. With every failure to do what has to be done to fix SFV Capcom is making it harder and harder for people to actually care about the future of this game.. It is complicated to rate this game. On the one hand it is the fighting game that continues to be the best in the game mechanics. But on the other hand the Capcom DLC policies are really abusive and it is never possible to have the full experience of the game unless it is paid. This company only thinks about taking out the money to their clients and that is why I never buy a DLC.. This is absurd! This is the worst Street Fighter ever, I will not buy another one Street Fighter title. It cannot be compared to Street Fighter 4... This is a big Screw You for the fans. One of the major complaints about the original SF5 release was the lack of content. There is a lot of content in this package now. 6 different arcade mode paths with more than 200 ending illustrations to unlock. Extra battle, an ongoing CPU character challenge where you can unlock fight money, experience points, and classic Capcom inspired costumes. Cinematic story mode, a nearly 2 hour, fully animated CGI episode featuring the cast. Individual character story chapters that delve into each playable character's history. Team battle mode (local). Survival mode. Demonstrations, trials, tutorials for people trying to learn the game. Gallery mode, to collect all the artwork and trailers in the game. Also, this package come with the season 1 and season 2 character passes, so you can download 12 characters as a bonus (note: it's not on disc, the codes come with the box). And, any time you want to step outside of single player mode, feel free to join us in online VS, where the Street Fighter series shines: competitive play!. What street fighter V should have been in the first place. With the added characters, revamped ui, faster loading times, balancing, added v triggers, and finally arcade mode it now feels like a new game. It's now up there with the best fighting game this generation.. It's obvious that this site has paid reviews, to suppress the true score of this game. SFV is terrible it's just as bad as it was when it first released, it's still like fighting under water. You will rarely find yourself outplayed, or outwitted simply out classed at character selection and out mashed by cheesy button smashing players with tactics that would get them destroyed in any decent fighter. SFV gives some characters really good moves speed and priority that are spam friendly hard to block and seriously nearly impossible to escape. If you watch the pros you will see they get caught by the same cheese spam as you do. Don't buy this game unless you just want to have mindless fun. But this is not a serious fighter and certainly not worthy of the Street Fighter moniker. The graphics are nice, the music is nice and the character designs are really cool. But mechanically this game is a **** show.... The trailer look cool the graphics and game play mode look different to the first one.. The character roster, arcade mode, story, trials, and fighting mechanics are great. However, this game has a free to play model (even though I payed for it...) where future characters, costumes, and stages, are locked behind a paywall with micro transactions. For example, I don't like the default costume for Ken and prefer the SF2 version. So I beat his story to unlock his story costume in the store, but I still have to pay fight/real money to unlock the costume. It doesn't seem like there is a realistic way to unlock all this stuff with fight money (especially since I just want to play arcade mode, not online) and would have to pay real money. I miss the old days in SF2 and 4 where all you had to do was to beat arcade mode to unlock characters. I didn't have to pay fight/real money then.. If you stop listening to those who live to hate Capcom, Street Fighter V : Arcade Edition is a sweet, sweet fighting game that does justice to the franchise after a rocky start with the first version. If you already bought SFV then all the new content is a free upgrade. If you haven't for the retail price of Arcade Edition you get A LOT for your money. It plays great, the existing roster is great and getting even better, the single player modes and general content is more than enough to satisfy all (apart from haters), graphics and animation is sweet, plethora of ways to gain Fight Money (again, don't listen to the haters or ignorant people) which means you can get new characters, stages, costumes etc for free as long as you put the effort, time and patience into it. Netcode is much improved and among the best out there for a fighting game and with Capcom's commitment to the game to extend well beyond normal game cycles this is the best entry point to the SFV. Things are looking good :). I might start by stating the obvious: 0 or 10 reviews are completely unhelpful, though they do tend to ultimately cancel each other out... As for SFV Arcade Edition, I cannot possibly give it a positive review. Although I will say there is a clear lesson to be learned from it: don’t buy Capcom games on release. As a big fan of the series, I purchased the original release. And in its magnanimity, Capcom thanked me for my patronage by updating the incomplete product they sold me free of charge. However, it doesn’t come with all the features, most notably the seasons 1 & 2 characters. Which means that I would have to spend an amount nearly equivalent to buying the new version in order to have the same game. Oh and Capcom has also slashed the amount of in game currency gained from missions, making it even harder than before to amass enough to unlock all characters. This grind puts Korean MMOs to shame! As for the “well you’ve been playing it for months” argument, I would argue that I have not. The online matchmaking system is not great. And once I was done with story mode, I barely touched the game again. So the lesson here for gamers: if you keep playing ball and buying unfinished products or pay 2 play games that operate on micro transaction models introduced by free 2 play games, or the even worse pay 2 win model, then developers will keep making them. They would be insane not to! I really miss the days where there were just 3 options: buy the game, rent the game, or ignore the game. Subscription were one thing (looking at you Blizz), but this is getting out of control.... At last, this is the game, that would've killed it at sales if it were like this at launch. We have to remember that at launch there was a.) only 16 characters, b.) trashy small story mode c.) survival mode d.) no demonstrations e.) basically only survival mode which was broken and f.) mainly only online modes. As someone who was new to the genre, I spent most of my tim","the footsies in this game are second to none when it comes to the current generation of fighting games . the input lag and the slow nature of a lot of anti-air options made dealing with netcode jump-ins a total nightmare . i can see the appeal, but can't bring myself to enjoy it ."
694.Sea of Stars,"If you never played this type of game, please buy the game now, start playing it, and don't read any further reviews. You will enjoy it, PERIOD! Now that is out of the way. Game is slightly over hyped, I don't see how this could score higher than a 7. Sure, on a indie scale it is impressive for what they did with their budget, however it doesn't compare to any of the retro-classic games it tries to copies and definitely doesn't stand a chance against a full AAA game. My reason for saying this, it really does manage to capture that old school feeling, but after a while, you just want to play the classics. Sea of Stars does nothing to improve the formula.. - Graphics: Carefully crafted pixel art, full of details and diverse locations that are visually appealing and encourage exploration. - Music: The soundtrack perfectly complements the game’s atmosphere, leaving a lasting impression and enhancing emotions during gameplay. - Combat system: While interesting at first, it quickly becomes repetitive and lacks depth, which can make it feel monotonous. - Sense of progression: Character development and exploration are too limited, resulting in a lack of satisfaction from achievements or progress.. Very fun turn-based RPG. The pixel art is breathtaking and winks at the old-school games, there is plenty of side quests content and quirky characters/dialogue. At some point dungeon puzzles feel quite repetitive and don't really provide much of a challenge. Combat is fun, especially thanks to the insane amount of enemies and the need to time inputs to boost attack and guard. The wheel mini-game is great, and although it is to some extent luck-based, it provides a cute diversion.. IT'S A TRAP! Nice graphics but... HORRIBLE story. Flat and surreal characters. Absurd mechanics, you can't escape from the fight in progress, you can't teleport at will (unlocking points of interest) but only in a few cases after an exhausting USELESS backtracking. Avoid if you are looking for something more by pressing random buttons while looking at beautiful backgrounds Don't fall for this.. this is the definition of rose tinted glassess nostalgia bait.. its aright nothing special. feel the party member just tag along no input to overall story... This game is pretty fun in its first 10 hours, however, when you progress further, only a few skills is avaliable in the full game and the plot is nothing markable.. Beautiful Game. The sort of game you play and you remember that video games can be works of art. Not a dull moment from start to finish. Highly recommend and hope more people give it a try!. this game is not bad, ive played for a few hours but its very oordinary and doesnt give any new experience. This game is vapid nostalgia bait. Please dont listen to the critics who just have nostalgiia for the pixel art JRPG past that was replaced by better systems. They yearn for simpler times when they were 15 years old. Those times aren't coming back. I'm tired of these people being unable to look at things objectively and propping up retrogressive crap like this. I was so bored that I couldn't finish this cutesy snoorefest.. Visually perfect. This game is a top 3 indie game for me. So much fun from start to finish. A ton of love was put into the game and you can tell. Everyone needs to try this game at some point.. It took me back to my childhood and is the best-looking pixel art game I've ever played. Excellent OST and a decent combat system. I felt the story started with a lot of potential but kind of fizzled out towards the end of the game, but I did really like the setting/world. I felt the weakest aspect of the game was definitely the writing; while not as bad as Chained Echoes in this regard, it's still levels below what you'd expect. While definitely not perfect, it made me feel like a kid playing the JRPG classics for the first time again.. Overrated. The game is ok, the characters and story are dull. Combat is simple and repetitive.. i played on easy mode took me between 30 to 40 hrs to complete the story. story 10/10, gameplay 9/10, music 10/10, performance 10/10, visual 9/10, content 9/10.I usually do not enjoy games with the visual and gameplay games like sea of stars but i played the game since it was free to play on playstation subscription. the story is masterpiece and the platforming and gameplay is great not perfect but those will keep you engaged definitly recommend playing the game. Sea of Stars tries to appeal to fans of old-school JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, but fails to deliver on any of the qualities that made those games so beloved and unforgettable. The game's only redeeming quality is its gorgeous pixel art style, rivalled only by the likes of Octopath Traveler. But even when compared to other modern pixel games, Sea of Stars stands out. The music is also fine, but does not offer any catchy tunes that will stay with you long after you finish the game. Aside from these two points, the game completely falls apart. The combat system attempts to combine the team-based commands of Chrono Trigger with the reaction-based inputs of Super Mario RPG. This sounds great on paper, and is admittedly fun for the first few hours of play. However, combat does not evolve during your journey and remains the same throughout your playthrough. Characters only have !!! three !!! basic abilities and one ultimate ability. That's it. You don't unlock a plethora of skills for your characters that open up new strategies and gameplay. Nope. No customisation whatsoever. For 25 hours and beyond. It's just tedious and boring after a while, as you'll see all the possible combos in no time. The same goes for the enemy variety. And then there is the story. A whole bunch of cardboard cut-outs with no character development or memorable moments. Zale and Valere are probably the worst written main characters I've ever seen in a JRPG. Sabotage Games had many opportunities to make them grow and act like reasonable people, but no. They don't think about their actions, they don't interact with the world and they don't act according to their circumstances. I would only recommend this game if you want to see an example of beautiful modern pixel art, but if you want a good time that lasts more than a few hours, you will not be happy with Sea of Stars.. I loved the Chrobo Games an enjoyed Sea of Stars. Great battles and riddles.. I can't, in good conscience, give this game a higher score than a 7. My experience with it has been closer to a 8.5 or a 9, but that's my enjoyment, and not based on the very real problems the game has, that didn't bother me as much as they probably will others. After a long time of getting lost in large, sprawling game worlds, Sea of Stars' relative simplicity came as a breath of fresh air to me. It is the furthest thing from perfect: there are glaring unresolved plot issues, the game relies on the player having played ""The messenger"" for some narrative tie-ups in the end. The main characters Valere and Zale are cardboard cut-outs, but the cast around them is very well written for the most part. The biggest issue with the game is the 'true ending gut-punch', which is to say, without spoiling: being able to actually fight the final boss of the game comes with some frustrating hoops to jump through. You cannot finish the game's true story in one play-through. Luckily the game makes sure to let you know about that, but it is very dissatisfying nonetheless. Overall, if you like Super Mario RPG's combat, you WILL love this game's systems. It has gorgeous visuals, a STELLAR sound track that i often listen to in my spare time, and it is a 40 hour experience that will be done by that point. There's no pointless grinding, no side-quests that keep you for hours, the game is linear and tells you where to go. You'll find equipment upgrades gradually as you progress through the story, so there's little need to worry about money. The game offers a lot of accessibility options as well in the guise of collectible badges. These badges can be enabled whenever in your menu. They have all sorts of different options for customizing your gameplay experience. There's the simple option for 'rewarding perfect timing' which simply adds a VERY satisfying shooting star + sound effect every time your perfectly time a block or ability hit. It is purely cosmetic, but let me tell you that it makes a huge difference if you like feeling rewarded for doing something well. There's options to lower damage, increase damage you take + do, disable the need for perfect timing some abilities. A parrot that tells you which collectibles are left in every area of the map, etc. As for the story: It has some real high points in the story, it is best getting into blind, even if it isn't the most trailblazing story out there, I think I got a real kick out of some moments because I had no idea they were going to happen. The biggest flaw in the story is its ending, but the second biggest flaw is that the enjoyment of it hinges too much on your opinion of a single character: Garl. Because the main characters are such wet blankets, they are outshined by every other character they meet, but the heart of the story lies with Garl, and if you don't like him, then this story will not pull you in. At the end of the day, I recommend it highly for its simplicity. It's a game you can easily put down and pick back up, if you've got a weekend to spare that may even be enough. It's got wonderful atmosphere, and I am hoping that the teased upcoming DLC for the game will manage to solve some of its glaring flaws.. Art and music is something that follows you for the whole game and can surprise you with its beauty. As well as the story which has so many unexpected turns that some new locations might feel like from the other universe. On the other hand, the problem comes from the rather generic characters and fight system that have not enough complexity for such a long game.. i find the battles boring and the puzzles boring. music is good and graphics are nice. The game is so good it made me sad that aren't enough games like it. I gotta be honest Sea of Stars didn't put a foot wrong in the 40 hours I spent beating the campaign. The ideas are just so refined and the story honestly took me by surprise at quite a few turns. Just when I thought the road ahead was straightforward and predictable, things became even more interesting. It does a lot for an indie game, really impressed with it.. One of the best RPGs I've played in recent memory! From the art-style to the soundtrack to the environments, this game was made for me personally. I rarely give 10/10 on metacritic, but this amazing turn-based RPG deserves it. The game has everything you could wish for: a great, complex and deep story; charismatic characters that develop throughout their arcs; solid mechanics; tons of content (~40 hours) and a wholesome indie atmosphere with fairly polished visuals. The combat system is both engaging and cognitively challenging, specially if you play the game on hard mode (using amulets to increase difficulty), which I recommend. There could be a couple of extra features (ie. Quest Logs, Wikis, etc), but I believe the game is solid enough exactly how it is. Please do yourself a favor and play this thing, if possible on hard mode, and paying true attention to the story (inc. Side Quests and Extras). This one delivers very inch of hype it received. Best!. Disclaimer: I do like RPGs. Sea of Stars is one that has its combat heavily based on timing, that gets repetitive and annoying five minutes later and still is repetitive and annoying by the end of the game. The story is mildly entertaining, but the gameplay is dull. The writing is so-so, with some video games clichés jokes and interesting stories by the campfire, but otherwise inane. No clear objectives sometimes, interrupted flow and no maps available in the dungeons nor in the world mean additional frustration. While the graphics inspired by 16-bit RPGs are really nice, the music is so-so, with some exceptions. Some of the songs are as tacky as Tee Lopes's original work. In any case, you can tell that this game was crafted with care, love and time. It's packed with tons of different enemies, a secret ending and it's charming enough to be played because of the graphics, animation and story but, ultimately, it's boring and routine. It didn't make me feel anything at all until the second half and I don't mean just emotions but also interest. The writing and the gameplay are its worst enemy, from the many it has in store. 6/10. The graphics? Gorgeous. The tunes? Absolute bangers. It’s like they’re screaming, “This is gonna be epic!” But man, once I got into it, it was like expecting a gourmet meal and getting fast food instead. The characters? They’re kinda there, but not really making me feel anything. They’re supposed to shape the world, but everything just felt… meh. And the fights, they started out cool, but didn’t go anywhere. It’s like playing the same level over and over. Plus, there’s this one character who keeps breaking the fourth wall, pointing out all the clichés. Just let me get lost in the game! I really wanted to get into Sea of Stars, rooting for it to be my new obsession. But it’s like it’s stuck in the shadow of the old-school legends, trying too hard to be like them without bringing anything new to the table. It’s a feast for the eyes, sure, but it doesn’t hit you in the feels like the classics do.. Just like ready player one the movie. It's beautiful and full of nostalgia and that's it. The gameplay is boring after 5 hours and the story have been written by a 6 years old... It looks like they tried to make a long game by any means possible. So many empty unskipable milk-and-water dialogs already during quite long tutorial.. Sea of Stars initially captivated me with its art, leading me to try it. After 25 hours, I've quit. It's a simple RPG with repetitive combat, and while the story is somewhat interesting, it's not enough to keep me intrigued about what's next. Everything is top notch in one of the best JRPGs in recent memory. Art, level design, story, and characters all flawlessly executed.. one of the best indie games I have ever played l think it should be shorter some missions are repeated i feel bored but overall its amazing I like it more than Baldur's gate. Looks and sounds like a classic JRPG, except the actual JRPG part. On rails Press Button To Confirm simulator. Combat seems engaging at first but gets old fast, and the timing for bonus hits and blocks is terrible. ****, 'cause it seems really cool.. An extremely solid old school RPG experience that is definitely directed at a niche market rather than the gaming world as a whole. It features pieces inspired by Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, and other 16-bit era RPG’s. The turn based fighting system is engaging, well done and like a more challenging Super Mario RPG. I personally like turn based RPG’s way more than live fighting one’s. There’s something so engaging and timeless about using strategy over button mashing. I hate that turn based RPG’s are seen as archaic rather than an essential part of the genre. It was an absolute sin to turn Final Fantasy VII into a live action RPG in my opinion. There’s no greater friend to a great JRPG’s than a patient, peaceful, highly strategic turn based system. Secret of Mana is/was one of the rare exceptions but is an outlier. SOS can be hard but there’s an option that makes it easier by increasing hit points and refilling life after fights. What bothered me is this increased difficulty level and overall design choices made it somewhat difficult to do my favorite RPG past time- XP/Gold/Item farming. The designers for some reason seem to think that farming was a 90’s JRPG burden rather than a vital aspect that drove the fun and strategy. There‘s something I asore about spending hours doing nothing but repeating the same advantageous honey hole battle(s). I also didn’t love that the character progression was lumped into 1 team rather than individuals. It just felt too simplistic. I did however love the Super Mario RPG inspired leveling-up upgrade choices you were given in which you got to choose where to allocate a small but pivotal amount of points. I added a Christmas morning effect to leveling. Its overall feel is Chrono Trigger-y with Secret of Mana’s graphics. The reason I say that is because Chrono Trigger’s graphics and world as a whole were superior to Mana’s. The way you navigate the world is like Trigger. The graphics are really the only thing holding SoS back. I realize it was going for a 16-bit aesthetic but they still could’ve done an Octopath Traveler type look that made it feel 1/2 old school, 1/2 new. You can tell the developers hit a wall when it came to their graphical capabilities or budget and did a lot of cut and pasting of visuals that made areas feel overly similar. The relatively rare but present cut scenes were the only way to tell the game was made in 2023 rather than 1993 but they were so limited and rarely inserted that they may as well have not existed. The way they were integrated also felt oddly random and without rhyme or reason. The characters and story were solid and functional but not on the level of its inspiration- Chrono Trigger which had an unparalleled time traversing story of immense consequence featuring an absolutely incredible team of compelling, dynamic, interesting, and likable characters. It could’ve really added to the experience to get to a wider array of usable characters. That said, Chrono Trigger is a Top 5-10 game of all-time and the finest JRPG ever made (by a wide margin). So, it’s a little unfair to compare it to the JRPG GOAT. But it did inevitably invite those comps when it used CT as its primary influence and inspiration. Had this been released in the early to mid-90’s, it wouldn’t have challenged Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III for best RPG of the era despite being a great play. It might’ve however topped games like Earthbound, Breath of Fire III, Illusion of Gaia, and Secret of Evermore and been a game we still talk about to this day. Overall, Sea of Stars is definitely a niche game that will appeal to hardcore RPG’ers but not main stream gamers like a Chrono Trigger did through its shear perfection in design. CT was a genre audience expanding masterwork while SOS is laser focused on the current JRPG audience. With evolved, eye popping Octopath Traveler inspired graphics, it’d have been even better. They really missed an opportunity to do more visually. You can’t help but feel it needed a little more polish, creativity, variety, and modern look. At times, all I could think of was how much better the game would be with slightly better graphics. They can come off pretty ugly at times. I’d definitely say it was well worth the 50-60 hour investment. It’s a great example of how deep video games have become as a result of the populous amount of smaller studio games. They help offset the lack of quality and depth with AAA titles in the 2020’s and fill a gaping hole in an industry in which development time has become so absurd that you’re lucky to get a AAA title in a series every 4+ years. Sony’s version of game pass, which this is part of, is an absolute steal and the only thing propping up a pretty directionless industry right now. SoS isn’t just some would be $10-$15 game. It’s a $60 experience to JRPG junkies that’s part of a roughly $20/month service. So, in closing, if you’re a fan of the genre, it’s well worth the investment.. Everything is perfectly realized in this game, except for the fights. But unfortunately, the fights make up a good half of the game. And they last so long! — Combat animations are drawn out (I often gave up on an optimal move just so I wouldn't have to watch a 30-second punch animation or bother with boring timing clicks). You've seen one fight, you've seen them all. Yes, there will eventually be shields, character stealing, and other variations - but none of them will affect the player's strategy: pick the best strike from a couple options and wait 30 seconds for the next move. I like most of the things the game does. But unfortunately, the magic didn't happen for me personally — after 10 hours of strenuous combat, the game turned into a ""podcast game"" for me, and with that lost any chance of deep immersion.. The best JRPG I have played. It has a great, original, unpredictable story and a beautiful art style. The gameplay is exciting with many fun mechanics like timing, magic without magic, ultimates and the lock enemy system. The music is wonderful, I even started listening to some of the soundtracks in my free time. The level progression is good but not that difficult, although early in the game, you unlock certain customization options so you can adjust the game to your own liking, with things like timing indicators or modes that make the game harder and more.. Looks good, controls are good, music is ok if it an annoying at times, combat is alright but not great. The main issue with this game is a huge lack of creativity. It’s very linear, story is extremely basic and boring, characters are very flat and have very little arc, the puzzles in the game aren’t really puzzles because it’s so linear it’s almost impossible to mess anything up or go the wrong way. It would be good mobile game but as a PC game it leaves a lot to be desired. Had much higher hopes, and even though I knew it wouldn’t be on the same level as like CHRONO Trigger I did think it might at least get near there.. pros: graphics, art, music, good supporting characters cons: combat not interesting enough, the two main characters seriously lack personality and development. Old-school turn-based Rpg (my favorite genre). I should love it but I'm a bit torn on this game, it's a good game - but maybe not quite as good as the reviews say. Some of the minor complaints/wishes I had - the game is a little too bare bones imo - Enemy scaling (never liked it in games) - can't escape from battle (should have the option) 7.5 score (I wish Metacritic could update their scoring system). Though the game obviously looks wonderful, the game itself is dire. This is an incredibly bare bones ""jrpg"", with next to no character development. There is no reason to grind and the developers went out of their way to make it a chore to do so. If you just want to experience the story/journey, then you may enjoy it. But there is very little actual RPG elements here to speak of.. Amazing RPG. In my opinion one of the most accessible and easy to play Turn-Based RPGs I've played. The combat-system is simple enough to pick up for newbies like me, but the learning curve is steep and rewards you for actually planning out your attacks. The game does a good job making you feel like your actions as Solstice Warriors have a direct impact on the world(s) you are fighting in and it does well in keeping your attention high by slowly unraveling its lore. I think besides the story (that indirectly ties into the world of Sabotage Studios' previous game ""The Messenger"") the game's big selling points are the beautifully crafted pixel-art graphics and its wonderful OST. I had a hard time coming up with any negatives, but if I had to name one, it's the lack of a dungeon map. The dungeons are well layout, but navigating it especially in late game can be extremely tedious without a walkthrough to hold your hand. This becomes apparent when you are trying to go for the game's 'True Ending'. In order to achieve this, the player is required to complete all available Side Quests, one of which is finding an item 60 times in chests that are hidden all over the map. I would think here it is where Sea of Stars loses a lot of players, but considering it is only an optional requirement (even though the True Ending is much more satisfying than its normal counterpart) it is only a small critique. Nonetheless, Sea of Stars is my favorite Game of 2023 and I'm happy that is has been getting its recognition.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sea of Stars Sea of Stars is a beautifully animated JRPG with likable characters, mesmerizing music, and a touch of sorrow in a heart-warming story. However, the game suffers from pacing issues and questionable design choices that ruined the late-game experience. Thus, I would rate it a 6 out of 10, which means medium with notable merits. The characters in the game are well-designed. Not only do they visually stand out, but all characters have different backgrounds, secrets, motivations, and unique gimmicks in their power. Their commitment to duty and willingness to do good is what drives the story forward. The environments are well crafted. Each place is filled with unique puzzles and layouts that are exciting to explore. Traversal feels smooth and enjoyable thanks to tools like the grappling hook. The story of Sea of the Stars is told with a relatively slow and steady pacing. It is a dreamy journey set out in a world tormented by the force of evil that unable to rival with by its inhabitants. However, unlike many modern games, people in this world are not twisted and distorted by despair. The people living in that world still found joy in life. The Heros and Villains of this game represent the traditional “good” and “evil” duality. They all hold tremendous power, faced difficult situations in life, but made completely different decisions. In the end, the story of Sea of Stars is a tale of kindness conquering evil. It is about seeking joy in the face of adversary instead of becoming a part of it. Once, we no longer fixated on the adversary in life, we are no longer bounded by our selfishness. Then when we “ascend” from our little world, and ride our free spirit reaches the metaphorical “sea of stars”. However, there are some aspects of the game really feels dated or even intentionally dragging what should have been finished, especially the combat and late game quest design. The combat in this game is turn based combat with quick time events. When attacking or defending, the player can press buttons at critical moments to perform follow-up attacks or blocks. Unfortunately, the game offers a very limited move set to each character, three skills plus one ultimate for each character. That means, during the 20-30 hours game play, the player is expected to do the same move, again and again and again and again. In some late game boss fight, the same skill can even be used ten times in the same fight. Hence, even the bosses in late game are very well designed and lost appeal due to this repetitiveness. The quest design is another big bomber. The game is filled with fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. Even when the highlight of the story takes place, what’s after that? Another 10 hours of random fetch quests which completely killed the mood. What’s more baffling than that is the designer locked the true ending under a whole series of hustles including hours of backtracking and finding 60 collectables. These decisions completely ruined the late game experience, with mind numbing repetition and tedious objectives. In Conclusion, the Sea of Stars has really great foundation, but ends up as a frustrating experience due to some peculiar game design decisions. It has one of the most imaginative worlds but it is filled with the most boring quest design. Each enemy comes with its own gimmick but players can only combat it using the tool they have been using in the first few hours in the game. Overall, it amounts to a very mediocre experience with some sparkling highlights. 6/10 (medium with merit). Best JRPG out there and i played nearly all of them. Jdjdjfnrnjdnfnfkdjfn. This is a fantastic game that hits all the feels of the classic JRPGs that clearly inspired it. It is well paced, respects your time, has enough humour to make you laugh but not be overdone and looks absolutely gorgeous with some of the most breath taking pixel art I've seen to date. The only negative I can think of is the story, I didn't feel massively connected to the characters and they didn't seem very deep. With this being a JRPG you might think that a bland story would be off-putting, but the massive positives from every other aspect of the game make the whole package still enjoyable and the story isn't bad, just not as deep and griping as the classics. Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of classic JRPGs, you will not be disappointed.. Over-rated game. Only first 3-4 hours was fun. Especially, poor battle system excluding stretegies, various bgm and escape system was worst.. Overall, it's a good JRPG. I would have loved to give it a 9 or a 10, but there are some things that really don't work well with me. - Graphics: Amazing. Simply amazing, Character design is fantastic, backgrounds are spectacular... vivid, varied, interesting. Animation is excellent. Cutscenes are fantastic too (and, pet peeve, there's no hint of flash-like ""skeletal animation"", which is a huge plus) - Music: Ok. Does its job and it's ""on tune"" with the SNES era JRPGS, but nothing memorable, sadly. - Cast: Bad. I like the two main characters and (despite a common sentiment) how ""plain"" they are. The rest is pretty bad, ESPECIALLY for Garl, who is unsufferable with all his ""AWESOME!!1!"". Only 6 characters is also bad for such a game, especially considering how few attacks they have (and combos often recycle some animations) - Combat: Oh boy. This is what keeps the game down from becoming a classic. It's REALLY bad. Let me just say that combos are AWESOME and I have no idea why only Chrono Trigger did it before, but that's the end of the good part. Combat is not just boring, but sometimes quite annoying depending on resources you need to stop an attack RIGHT NOW and resources you have available. But the worst is having to time attacks/blocks, it's really a stupid idea and stupid design choice. I detest this system with a burning passion. Also, as I already mentioned, characters have too few attacks for the combat to get interesting or tactical, it's mostly just ""spam what you have available"". Also, leveling is completely pointless. - Exploration: There's no map for the zones (unacceptable) and the camera angle often makes it VERY difficult to understand terrain composition, making it very confusing to move around and understanding where you can and cannot go - Story: Meh. Nothing special here. Serviceable, mediocre JRPG story and writing, it's definitely no Chrono Trigger. Also, the first ""plot twist"", just after killing the first big enemy, is VERY preposterous and forced. This game has sometimes been compared to Chrono Trigger, but there's no Chrono Trigger here. The only similarities can be found in the presence of combos and being able to see the enemies on the map before the battle encounter. That's it. All things considered, it's a decent JRPG with fantastic art, but sadly falls flat on its mechanics. P.S.Screw the new stupid metacritic that removes all the vertical spacing on text. Can we go back to the old, superior, version of the site?. Such an amazing game. Feels and plays like Chrono Trigger, with a beautiful art style akin to classic SIERRA games or LucasArts, but much more polish. I was simply blown away. It **** you in and doesn't let go. Great music as well. Definitely scratches that itch to play an old school JRPG in a modern way. Highly, highly recommend.. Game's really good: nice atmosphere, simple and straight as a (J)RPG. And don't pay attention to bad reviews since they mostly come from a ""crystal generation"" were they barely know what a classic style game is since... they never saw it. Give em something like NES Ninja Gaiden and they'll be crying for the rest of their lives. Good RPG overall.. Wonderful game. Great graphics, music, characters, and story. It also allows for difficulty level variations which don't affect trophies. Hi","the game is impressive for what they did with their budget, however it doesn't stand a chance against any of the retro-classic games it tries to copy . pixel art is breathtaking and winks at the old-school games, full of details and diverse locations that are visually appealing and encourage exploration . combat system: While interesting at first, it quickly becomes repetitive and lacks depth, making it feel monotonous ."
695.Astral Chain,"Love the combat system. Monster designs amasing. The anime like game was fun twist for me, opening credits just nailed it. Pls give me part 2!!. This game is super fun, it has a nice story, great combat, and great graphics, I have a few issues like platforming and the co-op mode but its very fun. I've beaten the game and I'm still working through side content. definitely worth your time.. Gave it 2 chances, but can't force myself to continue( I like idea with ""Stand"", but tired from controls and camera struggle more than from bosses. Tired already on ch 3 to collect red things and cyber dimentions areas. Side quests not interesting. Also liked music. Really sad i can't reccomend it.. Simply put, this game is incredible. The mechanics take a little while to become proficient at, but once you do, wow! Visually this is a stunning game. I’d say 30fps on performance, but the game is hood enough to ignore this. Engaging characters and supernatural plot. The action, enemy variety and wild settings make this an amazing game.. what a gorgeous and amazing game!! a MUST PLAY for any switch owner! the amount of content and the aesthetic is really exceptional especially for nintendo switch's hardware. 10/10. I don’t understand why Astral Chain is rated so highly, after a banger of an opener you think you're in for a real treat but the game fails to keep that level of pacing quickly settling in to a meandering pace with uninteresting objectives. The game is structured as “Police cases” and as such you’ll constantly be returning to HQ breaking the game flow and perhaps the most offensive about the main gameplay is the “investigation” work you have to do it is dull as dishwater. The side content if you take your time to find it is often just busywork and some of the side tasks are absolute garbage like having to balance boxes and ice cream – more blatant wasting of the players time in an attempt to pad playing time there has never been, and other side tasks will just flat out make you angry because the game is blatantly cheating in another weak attempt at making it ""hard"". I also found myself getting annoyed at the game failing miserably to introduce you to certain concepts leaving you to trial and error. Worse still is inconsistency with various things, for example early on you learn you can’t fall off things, yet at random later on in the game you can at certain points in a weak attempt to make things “harder”. Inconsistency in a game’s “rules” is a cardinal sin. Luckily the combat, IF you can overcome the disjointed controls, is easily the star of the show with actions being fluid as water. This is also one of the biggest problems for the game as it makes it even more obvious just how weak the “investigation” and side tasks are in the game. The game would have been far better served exclusively sticking to what it’s good at – combat and fast paced action on motorbikes. The default camera and input controls leave a lot to be desired, the former lists around like a drunk in combat and the latter makes you do more finger gymnastics than necessary. For instance ZL summons your legion and R dismisses it, why can't ZL do both and have R assigned to recalling and ""throwing"" your legion? That would make much more sense and feel more natural. This kind of control jank is present in other control aspects in the game too. Considering the amount of options you can change for the camera and input controls also suggests the developers themselves didn't know what to assign each button to do for the most natural feel and worse still they don't just let you reassign the controls as you want only offering presets. I've also encountered issues such as using pillars to whip round corners where entirely at random your character just won't make it and on a second try, doing it exactly the same, you whip round just fine. The developers have a lot of good things going in Astral Chain somewhat ripping off Chaos Legion from the PS2 but they never quite manage to marry the story or combat mechanics together in a cohesive and smooth manner, jank is the name of the game here particularly when it comes to legion controls there are many things certain legions could automatically go and do for you as long as you have your IRIS on to identify these points. Eg; why do you have to guide over your beast legion to a pile of rubble then hit a button combination to get it to “dig”?. As long as your beast legion is summoned and your IRIS active and pointed at the rubble should be enough for your legion to just run over and start digging. It all feels quite disjointed, square pegs round holes, if you will. Visually for a Switch game things look stunning but the one thing that really bothers me is the amount of dithering used on signs and graffiti it looks terrible. Overall Astral Chain is a game that with some more polish and sticking to just the things it's good at could have seen it being a short, but spectacular ride. As it is? Nothing more than an overrated average at best game with occasional high points. I had to force my way through trying to find the fun, and seldom did I find it.. Nice game, i like **** Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup Bip Boup.. Wasn't expecting to like this game as much as I did, gameplay was unbelievably good, don't remember much about the story tbh but who cares about that, gameplay is where it's at.. Astral Chain comes with a cool and innovative combat, that let you mix the controls from 2 characters at the same time providing a good action, this is the most positive point of the game, the characters felt poorly designed and the story could be better. But still, it’s worth the try.. Game would have been an 8 with a better ending. The idea and mechanics otherwise really interesting. Worth a run for sure.. The people who don't like this game, just hang in there! It takes a while for it to finally get good. And for this reason, I can't give it a really high score. When I play God of War, it is good right from the jump, and gets better. Astral chain starts off bad, and becomes amazing. I hope they can fix this problem in the future.. Astral Chain Is an excellent new direction and IP showing how platinum can grow and an amazing action game for the switch. The dual combat is really unique and leads to tons of depth and potential with abilities, setups and a ton of potential. The world design is amazing with anime and cyberpunk like places in the arc that feel rich and fun to play in. This game has tons of content and variety with ""cases"" separation of combat and fun adventures really making you feel like a police officer. So many good elements like bosses, enemy design, style, fun quests and completion, motorcycle segments, the chill investigations and iris, the cats and toilets', the music being fantastic. This game is an absolute gem. While story craziness at end, and not as tight platforming elements and a few other elements like switch locked 30 fps could hold this back from perfection, it cant be overstated how much of a triumph this is. You can pet the beast legion! There is even an great challenge postgame with bosses and tough cases leading to one of the best secret and tough bosses I've fought ever. This game is special, Absolutely one of the best switch games of all time. 9.5/10.. Here is my HONEST, 100% Non Biased review of The Game Called Astral Chain: “Astral Chain reminds me a lot of games like Nier, Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and much more. And with this game, I believe it takes all of that inspiration and evolves it into what we have now. This game is really good, The Characters, The Story, all pretty much flow very well. The Combat is pretty damn good, as well as the graphics. Now I do want to point out that yes this game is 30 frames per second, but I believe that doesn’t diminish the overall picture for this game. I do also want to point out a couple of things: The legions and being to switch between each of them with ease is really awesome, u can call out your legion to perform pretty sick combos or use your legion to navigate places that are harder to reach on your own. Too much talking and tasks, wish it was more fights just like bayonetta. The camera not really good especially when I control the robot. Overall it's a good game. Great game! I thought the combat was new and interesting. It is hard to get used too, but thats because it controls like no other game. It makes you relearn gaming. Thats kind of Platinums niche, they make you feel like a kid again learning new things. My only negative really is information overload and a very long early game process of tutorials and introducing something new and then tutorials and then something new and then tutorials. It felt like I was barely playing and more learning new things before I had truly gotten down the initial mechanics and it kind of just keeps giving you new stuff constantly when you don't feel comfortable with the old stuff. Then going through the game it doesn't feel necessary to even do the new stuff outside of S Ranks. Very fun though, just pacing was bit too much. I kind of like to get the grasp of the game and just go about playing. Simple but hard to master is ideal. This felt a bit convoluted or overdone. Then again would I have had the same feeling of learning and playing a fresh game if it wasn't introducing tons of new things? Maybe not!. This game is arguably one of the best titles the Switch has to offer. Incredible graphics for the console, amazing combat as per Platinum standards, an okay story, memorable characters... From start to finish it's a thrill ride and an emotional rollercoaster. From replaying files to doing the frankly enormous post game, there's a lot of replay value as well. It's a shame nobody really talks about it for some reason.... Along with Nier Automata, I would say this was the best game from PlatinumGames Inc.. Astral Chain is another great Nintendo Switch Exclusive video game with great voice acting , amazing soundtrack and excellent boss fights.. Flawed on some aspects, is one of the best on the genere, a hidden gem with one of the top 50 soundtracks on videogames.. The worst final boss I’ve had to fight in a long time, how this game is rated this high is beyond me And that’s not even mentioning how it’s a game based on giving you so many assets to use during combat, but damn near forces you to use the gun for so many of those combat situations. Disappointed.. LOVED LOVED LOVED this game. Once you get the hang of the gameplay and the buttons (and there are a LOT of buttons in this) you'll fall in love with this game. The storyline is corny in places but ultimately you eventually do care for these characters. Didn't want it to end.. I absolutly loved playing through this game, it is pure platnuim charm but with its own unique twist, i love the action gamplay being divided with detective work were you creatively use the same abilities for both action and detective work, also for a game that essentially only has 2 attack buttons their is a lot of variety in the gamplay. My gripes primarily are the story isnt the best and they barely let you puzzle solve as they constantly have characters just tell you what to do which is a shame cuse when you do puzzle solve it is fun, secondly file 12 is a complete slog to get through just such a boring and repetitive mission sets, this game does not have the enemy variety to fill 71 missions. Other then that tho the gameplay, the set pieces, the variety, the shher ammount of secrets and secret bosses make me love this game regardless.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Two years ago, if you would have asked me who my favorite video game developer was, I would have to say BGS or Nintendo. It was only upon playing Astral Chain that I realized one studio that I have severely overlooked. Platinum Games. After playing through Astral Chain, I’ve purchased all three Bayonetta games(paid $80 for Bayo 2), and Nier: Automata. This is all to say, Astral Chain is a brilliant game that made me change my mind as to who my favorite developer was. Not is the story engaging and well voice-acted, the graphics are some of the best on Switch. A superb game that is a must-own for any Switch owner with an interest in action games.. just beat this game (with some time gaps) but still can say few words about it. So first what i want to admit excellent graphic quality (except absence of Anti-aliasing - all looks kinda too sharp) and art style that is some kind of cyber or future punk. Epic boss battle and interest story another great pros of this game. and some words about cons: as for me some of side quests are similar and looks like dev got gyroscope but dont know how to use it (bring tower of boxes from A to B is one type os mission that they bring to the game). another one is mechanic of pulling the main character with chains to the point - if you try to pull not in the center of platform character will fall of every time. in conclusion game great example of non-Mario or Pokemon game on switch with interest story quest and perfect sound and visual but with some small minusess.. No invulnerability frames, sword mode unprecis, enemy who one shot in last levels, dodge useless, etc.... A game that impressed me from its story to its gameplay. Totally recommended. I hope they bring out a sequel.. This is a full action game. I'm really impressed by how PlatinumGames managed to make a game full of action where you control two characters at the same time and you only have to press few buttoms. It's just crazy. One of the best game-plays of all the games in Switch. Also the characters and overall design is gorgeus. It's a must-play on the platform.. This game is so good, I would bet anything on the fact that there will be a sequel. Everything about this game appeals to me, the music is great, the character design, the amazing story, the combat style, etc. I loved it. I want more Legions.. An interesting game that was a lot of fun to play. I especially enjoyed the soundtrack and art style. Could have used a little more content however.. Incredible music and gameplay, very stylish combat. The visuals are just gorgeous, absolutely amazing for the Nintendo Switch. I liked the Story a lot. I have to emphasize on the music, this game's OST is just a masterpiece.. The coolest animation on a game. Feels so weird that the game captivate me with its running animation. It's just an animation, come on. The combat moves also feels so slick and awesome. Although most of it is just smashing button but the game provide a more in-depth kind of move-set and combo that you can learn and make the combat more engaging(?) I guess. The exploration is decent, not really that great but good enough to make you attach with certain chapters. The game design is good so you won't get lost while exploring the area but you might miss out several side quests because some of them not live on the map. That being said, I understand why some people said its getting pretty tedious as I feel the same way. As you progress in the game, exploring feels more like a chore rather than you explore out of your own curiosity. When in combat, the game always throw you to red places (never pay attention to the naming of that place) which feels that you always keep repeating the combat again and again even thou you are fighting a different monsters in every chapters. The rest of it is fine but why every developers follow that kind of trend where the protagonist can't talk? Is it to make it feels like we are them so we can make our own reaction or response to certain situation in the game? Finish the game and I don't think I will replay or even revisit every chapter to complete it.. Astral Chain delivers on a game that feels “different” from other games. I stuck by the game and beat it, and while I can say it’s a good game, I’ll also say it’s not the game for me. Platinum games does a very good job developing a system that rewards players for perfecting the game/combat. I’m not into fighting combat perfectly—I just want to fight. And the game had plenty of satisfying mechanics and fights in it. My biggest complaint is how the other dimension looked. The color hurt my eyes and there was little variation in color as I had to puzzle my way through an ugly dimension. I was slightly disappointed by the detective side of things since quests felt run of the mill. A good sort of standard, but nothing spectacular. Even then, I can’t hate it because it gave a nice change of pace from the action. This game was a well designed game, through and through—it just didn’t click with me. I highly recommend Platinum Games (which includes Astral Chain) if you like a beat em up game with a skill ceiling that rates your progress.. I think this game had the potential to be great, but just ended up being mediocre. Great gameplay and music, and a very distinct visual style, but this is the kind of game that absolutely NEEDED to have the time to tell its story, which it just did not have. I wouldn't call my experience bad, but it was just completely... unremarkable as a whole. I think if this game got more time to flesh itself out more, tell its story, develop its characters, and refine its gameplay, it would be a lot better for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Astral chain is one of the best-performing games and is in the underrated game lines of the Switch. Great and unique action gameplay, great visuals, and good performance make it an all-around good experience for any switch player. The only thing is that its story may seem a little rushed by the end but the game is still worth the time and money just for the great action experience. this game is so good, you can have fun a lot with this one. i really like it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is awesome. so flawless. i will always love all the things that you can do here. One of my favorite switch game, the combat system is top tier. My only complaint is the camera angle sometime is really annoying, and there is no jump button but you will get used to it.. A masterpiece! You have a switch? You want action? Buy this game! It deserves all the love and respect. A lot of games on switch falls short compared to Astral Chain. Nice graphics nice sounds nice combat nice everything. We need more games like this.. Spoiler-free. Most overrated game on Metacritic, probably. - Story gets only told via text documents and still many things won't get explained. - Silent protagonist ist super pointless in this scenario. - Camera movement is borderline broken. - Fight-System is okay and sometimes fun. - Graphics are very good for a Switch game.. It's an alright game. Doesn't do anything too great. The core gameplay is alright but the story is pretty generic. It's not worth $60.. Astral Chain is one hell ****. I was shocked when i finished it and relized how much fun i had with it. Look awesome and has some great action. Anyone wanting a great action game to play....i must say""play this game"". This game does a lot exceptionally well, but sometimes it feels like it’s doing too much to the point where it seems to have an identity crisis. To start with the strengths: the graphics are fantastic, especially considering it’s on the Switch. The art design is really cool, and everything in the game has a truly unique feeling that it’s hard to compare anything else to it. The environments look good, the aesthetics look good, and while the enemies look good, they feel a little bit like random/generic. The music is fantastic and very creative use of a soundtrack. I would have never considered to use all of these styles of songs on one soundtrack, but they pulled it off perfectly. Everything from the smooth techno of the precinct, to the low tuned background guitar while exploring the city, to the hard rock during combat. The sound design is one of the things that stand out the most about this game. The overarching plot isn’t anything special, but the setting of the world is extremely cool. Playing as a supernatural police officer who uses astral ghosts as weapons that are not observable to most others - super awesome concept. The gameplay is good and engaging while in combat. It starts slow, but as you unlock more summons and more abilities, it really makes it very involved. It’s pretty unique controlling both your character and your summon at once, especially in a twin stick control layout. It works well, despite it being a bit overwhelming sometimes. However, the detective part of the game is where I found it to be very weak. It’s nice because it gracefully adds context to what is happening, but it completely ruins the pacing. 15 minutes of action hack and slash immediately followed up by 30 minutes of walking around and talking to witnesses, trying to find the one clue that is tucked away in the one spot you didn’t look. This is the identity crisis I was referring to. As much as I enjoyed it, I had a hard time really getting focused on the game because it would fluctuate between two vastly different play styles. That and it constantly tried to sneak in RPG elements, but they were so minor that I often forgot about them. For example after an hour long mission of rotating between detective gameplay, platforming gameplay, and combat gameplay, it takes you back to the precinct where you can level up - I completely forgot to do this between most missions because it felt like something that was an afterthought, rather than a core feature of the game. This is what kept me from scoring the game higher. Overall, it’s an extremely unique game that brings a lot of good features, but it suffers from a major identity crisis that makes it difficult to really fully engage with.. this game is SO GOOD. one of the best game on Nintendo Switch and the BEST from Platinum. Great game you must play, almost perfect; great music, good story, the only detail it has is in the game play, the combat sections are wonderful and satisfying, but the research gameplay is very boring and slows down the action. GAME PLAY: 10/10 On battle sections, 5/10 previus battle sections STORY: 8 MUSIC: 10 + VISUALS : 9 PERSONAL SCORE: 9 < A JEWELL>. This game was awesome. The gameplay was fun and it was so cool being to use the different legions throughout the game. The story, graphics and music were all top notch.. Could be fun, but his story is mediocre and the camera problems are unbearables.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It could have been a perfect game, because its art direction, combat, music and presentation are flawless.... but good lord, the investigation parts are AWFUL BORING, without that, it could have been a 10/10, a shame.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game for its graphics and performance is super solid. Its a very beautifully crafted game but it doesn't really teach you much before jumping you right into the actions. The storyline itself is decent or maybe even pretty good but nothing to brag about really.. A fun, fluid and incredibly stylish action RPG from Platinum games and Nintendo. The story is quite clearly inspired by anime and it lends itself well to the overall sci-fi theme of the game. The combat can be hard to get into at first yet when you finally get the ability for synergy attacks and combos it is extremely fluid and satisfying to play when you are able to link up attacks and pull of stunning combos with the various Legions you unlock. The game certainly has it's flaws however none of them detract from what is an incredible experience and a highly enjoyable playthrough.. After 2hrs the game becomes boring and repetitivedue to the chain mechanic. There is no point to upgrade gear. The game has great visuals and nice soundtrack and thats it. The artstyle and music are outstanding! The gameplay is fun and the story is interesting! I just don't like the mission based structure that much.. A huge sign that the Switch has much more power than expected. The story has very good moments and you get to develop empathy with the characters but unfortunately not all of them. The enemies and bosses have a very good design and their battles are entertaining. The control of the LEGION is very good and I can't imagine a better way to adapt the control of two characters in a single player. One of the few downsides of the game is that the ending feels a bit drawn out. I feel like the game could have ended with two fewer missions and it would have been better. Still very good and I recommend it.. Huge repetitive mess!!! It doesnt know when to end. Like 7 times I thought the game would end and then it starts all over again. The director was having ideas everyday and inserting as he pleased. It doesnt know if it is a action hack'n slash, or rpg or stealth. Mix all them together and you have a boring repetitive (including the music) game. story is cliche AF. even naruto didnt have so many cheesy dialogues and predictable story points. You play the chapters already knowing the boss doesnt die and will come back later. All the good score were made by people that played 3 to 5 hours max, and all of them say they will come back to play the game later and just give high score fo this **** Even critics didnt finish this game or got to half of it to realize how bad this exclusive game is. Buy for 20 bucks if you can, Not worth full price.. Astral chain is a must-buy for Switch owners! The gameplay is really fun as you can pull off a lot of combos and advanced moves on enemies. The setting of the game is really great and has great world-building. The dimensional jumping is very cool and gives this game a great spectical. In conclusion, this is a must-play Switch exclusive!. Great presentation & graphics especially for the Switch but I'll say the gameplay was kinda off at the start but it really gets better & better as you progress & rewards you for being as efficient & skillful as much as possible which is exactly the right way, awesome soundtrack, & great replay value, the story is really the only part where the game is kinda effy, otherwise hopeful that one day there'll be a sequel & it will perfect this novel formula. It's very reminiscent of Wonderful 101 with how it's trying to mix a lot of things together from the studios past efforts with one central freshing mechanic. Overall a really great game worth your time 9/10. this game is awesome i love the setting and the story is fascinating the combat is fluid and i love the soundtrack and the art style is beautiful as well. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Astral Chain is definitely one of the top 5 Switch games available for the platform. Also one of Platinum Games best titles to date. There is little to no flaw with this game. Any Switch owner needs to have this game in their collection. Everything from graphics, sound, story (very anime, but good), controls, fun factor, gameplay, etc. This game delivers with such polish and high quality.. I started this game and it was really exciting but also so forgettable. I played about am hour and then forgot about it. I do this about every 6 months. I play it and then lose any interest to put it on again. It's very Hollywood. And Hollywood **** balls.. Astral Chain is a mix between Bayonetta and JoJo, and it works out amazing. The combat is very unique and I love the aesthetic of the world. However, the story is boring and the framerate drops make the combat worse than it could be.. Its literally almost perfect. From the graphics to soundtrack and the refreshing take on combat astral chain is easily one of my favorite games to date. the platforming. . . can use some work though.. This game is awesome! The enemy design and the music are perfect. The epilogue sets all for a future sequel that I'll wait anxiously.. Great game. Loved every minute of it. The combat is something you have to get used to, but when you do, oh, it pays off big time. Interesting story, twists and turns, all the good stuff. GET IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT. Took me 27 hours to beat.. I do not understand what is the hype around this game. Nowadays people become fanboys just because and true gaming experience is being lost. I must say that I absolutely love Nintendo and their exclusives, and Nier Automata is one of my favorite games ever and I'm a huge Bayonetta fan too, and Astral Chain, this piece of crap is SO FAR away from being half as good as previous Platinum Games. PROS: - I personally like the combat system and gameplay, if there was enough action in the game - Graphically it looks very original and well presented (I just think it was a silly idea to make this around COPS, yes you are a cop) CONS: - I absolutely hated the endless and LAZY chores you have to go through, the side quests are not enjoyable or entertaining AT ALL. - The map system fails very often and you get to be lost very easily while doing stupid chores (not fun at all), on top of it the character cannot jump, or get through little babies obstacles, making it even more frustrating. - Most of the game you will be talking to NPC's and completing boring tasks and then all of the sudden you fight a boss for 3 minutes, then you start another stupid quest-chore that will take 30-60 minutes and then start another loop of silly quest, gathering clues and other stuff that really takes away the fun, to the point that it makes you regret the purchase. This game is freaking $59.99! I wouldn't even pay $5 to ""play"" this so called ""gem"" - I'm OK with linear games, but this one is linear and BORING, don't expect to have freedom at all. - Characters are not mesmerising not memorable at all, in fact, many of them are annoying, predictable and scripted. - You get to have limited customization but most of the items are useless, I completed perhaps half of the game, gotten all the legions and got a lot of items stored that really are not essential to fight battles like you did in Nier Automata or great games like The Witcher series. Besides the methods to use/equip items is very irritating. - It gets old VERY FAST, you may feel it is cool the first few days but you will get bored fast. - Oh boy the story is utterly predictable not memorable and 0% exciting. - NO REPLAYIBILITY - I came to the conclusion that I'm playing this crap just because, but definitely wouldn't play it again nor getting any expansion if there will be any. All in all, do yourself a favour and save $59.99, you can get like 5 better games in the Nintendo's Great Deals library. By the way, this is my first review here, to give you an idea of how much I hated it, maybe it helps someone save money and most importantly YOUR TIME. I still do not understand why and how this game gained such good scores, I would give it a generous 2 out of 10. Cheers!. This may be my favorite game in switch. I've spent 65 five hours on this game. It's a very additive action game with RPG elements (Legion customization) and achievement challenges. Combat is very fun and requires ability to master all the legions and their combos, combos that can be very spectacular to see. It's usually compared to Bayonetta, I think that Astral chain has its own DNA, Astral chain's combat is more strategic (in my opinion) while Bayonetta can be more frenetic. The plot is very predictive, yeah, it reminds a lot of Evangelion, but yet, the ending is very good, believe me, it was moving for me. The art is great, music is appropriate, the context, the city ambiance is a kind of neo pop very interesting. The Astral sceneries are a kind of digital reality clearly alien to people's own reality. And absolutely the ending leave a cliff hanger that makes me desire an Astral chain 2. Excellent game.. cool gameplay at first, and after 6 hours just boring, story that didnt click with me and ended in an anticlimactic and very open way, and **** endgame, just grinding 50 boring missions with an already boring spammy combat to g","i've beaten the game and i'm still working through side content . i'd say 30fps on performance, but the game is hood enough to ignore this . the game is structured as ""police cases"" and as such you'll constantly be returning to HQ breaking the game flow ."
696.Critter Crunch,"Nice jigsaw puzzle, you can while away a couple of tens of hours from boredom. An amazingly cute and fun game. For such a low prize you get so much fun. Anyone even remotely intrigued by this game should just stop thinking about it and buy it!. This is a no brainer, it's really cheap and will provide you with many hours of fun! It is one of the best puzzle games I've ever seen and I can't wait for them to come up with a new one. Lots of humor, feel good - and high quality - graphics. Lots of puzzles, nice online modes and the game has a nice tutorials so it stays interesting even after many hours. A must buy!","this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever seen and i can't wait for them to come up with a new one . lots of humor, feel good - and high quality graphics ."
697.Guilty Gear -Strive-,"This is one of the best fighting video game i ever **** is very difficult.. Added censorship to game, which is disrespectful to the players and uncalled for.. Single most stylish fighting game in a long time, combo recipes are a fantastic resource for learning, only gripe is I wish the story had some playable sections and the DLC story was more directly involved. really boring gets really repetativeand the story modeis just a movie, like i didn't pay for a moviei payed for a video game... the combat styem is nothing special either, the grapichs are good i give it that but what do you expect from games like these. One of the first fighting games I've ever played and even after trying out other ones I always come back to this one. Roman Cancel is one of the best mechanics in the game letting you make your own wacky & fun combos. Characters are so well designed, with amazing personalities, gameplay that makes them all unique. There's a character for everyone and the fact that all and I MEAN ALL of their theme songs are fantastic!. GOD THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS SO GOOD! The one issue I have and that many others have is the fact that certain characters you have to pay to play and I think that is super unfair, I already paid for the game full price and now I have to pay an extra 8 dollars to get other characters? Obviously GGST is not the only one that does this, this is a problem in almost every single fighting game.. Panders to casuals and people who don't care about FG. Absolute garbage system mechanics and horrific balance paired with season pass ****. This is the worst GG game in the series by far.. Strive's story might be a little hard to understand, especially if you've hopped in at a later point like me, but the combat mechanics are some of the best in a fighting game, and the soundtrack is a 10/10.. Too many unnecessary VFX, a super cheap arcade mode boss, and a legendary series turned into a gacha-esque game with loads of features and characters locked behind pay walls.. It is a fun game with a lot of charm. I actually prefer the old art style but i still believe this game looks stunning. The gameplay is very fun and the characters have a lot of charisma. Really amazin game. You could literally just play Guilty Gear XX AC+R lmao. If you're gonna make the game all about unga bunga then at least give me a faster air dash and some gatlings so it can be fun. It's insane that XX and Xrd are like DOUBLE the speed and have DOUBLE the defensive options lmaooo.. What a banger! Arguably the best fighting game I've played in recent memory, this game is absolutely fantastic. The gameplay is incredible and surprisingly very simple, it's easy to learn but hard to master, which is great for newcomers like myself. Every character looks phenomenal, they're all so diverse and cool, the character designs rock! All of them play very differently from each other, it's all about finding which one fits with your playstyle and getting better and better. I didn't really like the story mode personally, but the lore is huge, there are so many things to learn about each character and the world, I'm just not sure if it's worth learning because things get very complicated. And probably one of the most important parts of the game, the soundtrack... slaps soooo hard, holy shiiiiii- I love the music so much, and it fits with the art-style perfectly, it's crazy. At this moment, this is the most enjoyable and accessible fighting game of the genre, it ticks almost all the boxes and does everything very well. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. Playing strive is like watching a slide show with the strange low fps of character .worst characters **** gear game aswell. All sex appeal has been removed from females and it mostly a sausage fest.. The number of basic characters is too few and DLC is too expensive. New characters are not attractive. The arcade mode is difficult to play because the difficulty level changes on its own. The character design of the online lobby is terrible.. A poor man's Street Fighter. Cheap graphics from the PS2 era and shoddy game play. Avoid.. This game made me bisexual 100/100 Like, Ky kiske is one of the sexiest men I've ever seen I'm gonna give him what dizzy couldn't 1000000/10. May is far to OP, I say that as a player who's always played May or Bridget since 2000s. Poor take on Bridget, her canonical story would be better left to femboy identity instead of 'groomy' parentals to trans. but hey, fan-cannon is all that matters to whoever wants whatever to be whoever whenever. Truly **** the guy who's idea was to put a impossible secret boss in the game.. A beautiful, fast paced, balls to the wall fighting game. It's a smallish roster, but each character is very distinct in play style. Move sets are not huge, but well thought out and built around synergistic interactions. It might not be great for those looking for lots of single player, but if you're buying a fighter for single player, you're kinda buying the wrong genre. The online rollback based play is fantastic, although I admit the lobbies aren't great. I'd give it 9.5 because of that, but it isn't an option.. Funny game if you love dolphins In all honesty, the animation in this game is phenomenal, all characters feel balanced, and you learn each character without even playing them. The online is dang near perfect (I've played on both wired and wireless connections), the only complaint I have is that the story is a 3 hour long cutscene that no one's gonna watch.. Playing the game online is impossible with the input lag, Its literally saying i jumped when i never pressed the up button, thats how bad it is. Waste of time and money, for a game with no actual story mode *facepalm*. This is the best Guilty Gear game yet! Arc System Works improved the graphics, animations, and gameplay and the music soundtrack is just awesome! Super fun fighting game.. If you ever wanted to learn a Fighting Game. Guilty Gear Stive is the one for you. Aside from the beautiful visuals and rollback netcode. The Easy entry barrier but hard to master gameplay. The methodology of the Redteam is paying off. They made combos user friendly and there's a lot of room for freedom to practice your own. I actually like the online lobbies and understand the idea of meeting up with people. Are they the best No... But it's fun to make your own avatar and meet up with real people and go at it. Just like the old arcade days! The whole point is to bring people together so we can all play the same game and have fun! Gameplay -10 Music-7 Online-9 Fun-10 EASE OF LEARNING-9 Controls-9. Hands down, the most beautiful fighting game I have ever played, and it’s every bit as fun to play as it is to look at. If you’re a fan of fighters or maybe you’ve got a friend and a spare DualSense controller and you’re looking for something new to play together, Guilty Gear Strive is a must own future PS5 classic.. This games whole concept is flawed. Rushdown/button mashing playstyles are more rewarded than composed and steady ones. The people who want to play slow characters for example Goldlewis, Nago and Potemkin have a huge disadvantage compared to others because if you get them in the corner once then it's basically game over for them. The characters are made with the same mindset league of legends balances it's champions. Some of them are embarrassingly overpowered and you need to ""learn"" the match up. I don't know about every gamer out there but a small learning curve is ok, but when you have to watch 50 minute YouTube videos to just understand how to get some other characters down to your level, it just doesn't make sense to put so much effort into something that is not meant to be like that in the first place. Lastly, this game is already dead. There are so many lobbies that are empty and the whole matchmaking process is clunky. The story is also written like a Bollywood action movie with laughably bad and naive dialogues.. This is one of the best looking fighting games I have ever seen. With great animation, great characters, and a great moveset, Guilty Gear Strive proves to be one of the most polished and flawless fighting gaming experiences.. While there is flaws at launch, like connection issues or some missing game modes, this game is still a masterpiece. Best anime graphics ever seen in any game, jaw dropping animations, unique characters and stages, and an accessible yet deep addictive gameplay, makes this game worth a perfect score. A rare fighting game that we only see once in a while. Everytime I get on I quit the game frustrated due to the games terrible lobbies refusing to let me play against people standing right in front of me, which can seemingly only be fixed by quitting the game and relaunching, which is a painfully slow process even on PS5 due to how long it takes for the game to communicate to the server on start up. The game is very fun when u can play against other people, but with the current online state combined with a pretty slim selection of single player options no reason to buy the game in it's current state.. this is my first introduction into the guilty gears series this is quickly turning into one of my favourite fighting games and i feel like i am playing the best of of the guilty gears series i played a bunch of dragon ball fighterz i know how good arc system works are the music in this game is one of the best music i have heard in any game it suits the fighting game the art style of this game is breathtaking i already have a favorite character Zato-One that's voiced by the voice actor Takehito Koyasu he has voiced DIO from jojo bizarre adventure and many other anime characters arc system works animations is top notch it's a spectacle to behold if you love fighting games this is a must play. This and Xrd Rev 2 are two of the Best Fighting games you can find, The music is mostly absolute bangers and The gameplay and depth in this game is Absolutely top tier while Making it more Easier for a newer audience to get into. This game has BY FAR the best Graphics and Animations ive ever witnessed in any fighter period, absolute masterclass in the artwork department, and the Roll back netcode is increadible this is the smoothest online fighting experience you can find but unfortunately the lobby **** ass and Arcade mode Final boss is uh... Well quite cheap if ya face the hardest version of it lol. Its not perfect but it deserves a 10 simply for being as close to perfection as possible in the fighting game Genre absolute must buy!!. Lobbies ****, everything else is perfect. It's easy to pick up, but it's not lacking in depth. The simplest Guilty Gear is still miles ahead of other fighters in terms of expression.. Fun fighting game, not fun Guilty Gear. It’s here for the money and the Smash perverts.. I don-t consider this game a next gen at all, graphically looks like a PS4, also the mechanics are way better in Jump Force.. Truly amazing. it was 100% worth waiting for the years of development! The quality of animation and gameplay makes it not only a playable spectacle in video games, but also puts it at the level of the best anime creations ever created! very enjoyable, I recommend it not only to lovers of fighting games, but to anyone who wants to fill their eyes with the spectacular nature of this product!","one of the first fighting games i've ever played and even after playing other ones i always come back to this one . censorship to game, which is disrespectful to the players and uncalled for, is very difficult ."
698.Crypt of the NecroDancer,"Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. An entertaining combination of dungeon crawler and rhythm game. Although it can be a bit difficult and confusing at the beginning, as the hours go by you start to enjoy better the different games in the game.. Crypt of the Necrodancer blends real-time and turn-based combat by making players and enemies move to the beats of its infectious music. The varying items and enemies all randomly combine into puzzles that need to be solved on the fly.. I'm not sure what people's expectations are sometimes. This game is such a unique little game that oozes style. Indy games like this need to be supported!. The soundtrack is amazing, the replay ability is enormous, the gameplay is simple but original. it has only four levels with each character and yet it takes long time to master the movements of the enemies and the uses of the weapons. I simply don't know why this game doesn't have more people getting into it.. A fun, addictive little game that will give you a big challenge. However I find the replay value to be mixed since its the same 4 stages which even with random generation it can be repetitive. Replay-ability is fantastic, the constant updates are a great benefit, and the music makes this rogue-like different and an interesting play element to keep you thinking and patient at the same time.. Brain-blasting mix of music, arcade and roguelike! Unfortunately I am inevitably killed at the initial levels. I really want to hear how the further levels sound, but my reaction is too slow The first game load and calibration takes some time but the gameplay is fast and not forgiving. Works fine on Ubuntu 18.04. Notebook with Intel HD Graphics 4400 is enough.. Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very innovative game that somehow manages to put together Roguelike dungeon games and rhythm games into one well polished and fun game. So far in my playtime, I have found no bugs or issues or really even anything that felt unfair. The rules of the game make sense, are fair, are fun, and still manage to be challenging. The inclusion of being able to add any song you want to the game really brings this game over the top. On top of that, they added support for the steam workshop for mods. Allowing customizability is always something games should do.. A hardcore roquelike rythm game with an amazing soundtrack. Follows the story of Cadence who enters the crypt in search of her father. This game is very difficult and it took me almost thirty hours with the main character to finally beat it. 16 randomized floors and a wide range of items (could be more though). Soundtrack can be randomized so it does not get repetitive. While difficulty is high the game is never unfair and makes it one of the best roguelikes available today.. Do you want a game with a kickass soundtrack, including a guitar set preformed by Familyjules7x that also becomes rather obnoxiously hard by the end of Zone 1, where enemies do large chunks of damage and provides very little chance to actually heal ever? Do you want a fun rhythm game with a penchant for dragons that'll **** your **** up in one or two hits, force you to go back to the start of the zone and start from scratch regardless of how far you've advanced and what gear you've busted ass to get? Do you want a game that while it has it's fun moments, will make you grind a currency that only spawns here and there to slowly build up permanent upgrades until you have a slightly fairer chance (being generous) and that get taken away when you die and start a zone? If all of the above sounds interesting to you, and you want a game where one mistake, no matter how minute, results in getting screwed over? Crypt of the Necrodancer is for you!. This game is very difficult. It involves random runs in which you will die over and over. The items you come across are randomized, so some runs you will get lucky, and others you won't. It is very unique, and you move and attack to the beat, but is often frustrating because of the high difficulty. It's even difficult to unlock characters and achievements. Cost me $3.74 and played 41 hours. Only recommend if you don't mind dying a lot.. A quite unique rhythm based retro random generated dungeon crawler. Seems like a quite peculiar mash up of genres. In a way you would not expect those particular genres to work with each other but somehow this game pulls it off. It's a very unique compilation. On the outside its a dungeon crawler. You progress through a randomly generated dungeon gathering loot. Once you're dead the only thing you are left off is gold with which you can purchase unlocks, additional crates and items to be found in the dungeon. Any unspent gold goes away and you start from the start. And you start all over on each death with just a bigger chance of getting better things along the way. The combat hover distinguishes it from the normal rouge like games. As its essentially a rhythm puzzle to be solved. In short - each enemy has a movement pattern in which he moves taking a move in the beat. Its easy to learn and tackle a single enemy but when different ones come at you at the same time fending all of them is quite the challenge. It makes for a very unique and satisfying combat when you pull all the moves in the right way. The audio layer of this game is just amazing. Even more so as it's integral part of the game. It's worth getting the game for the soundtrack alone. I have no words to better describe it - just amazing. Well worth a listen to. Graphicly it's nothing special, but nothing bad as well. The pixel aesthetic might not be the best pixel art I've seen but it does the job. Sadly this will not be one of my favourite games ever. Simply because I'm bad at it. Not a big fan of a rhythm based part of it. Moving only on the beat seams a bit limiting and while the combat is quite enjoyable I was more often failing at it than not. In the end didn't feel interested enough to persevere longer than the first layer of dungeon. I do however suggest checking it out. This game does perfectly what it sets out to do and its unique enough to surprise you. It will not be a game for everybody. Great game, just not for me.. Most important thing one should realize: This is actually not really a rhythm-based game. What kind of insane claim is this, one might ask? Well... it falls into that category but thinking about it that way is misleading. I've played through Frequency, have gotten through some 9 feet songs on DDR, so I'm not too bad with actual rhythm-based games. ""Crypt of the NecroDancer"" however, is really more of a ""stress game"". As in - a puzzle game with insane time constraints. Which is horrible for people who need time to think like myself. The Bard and Eli are pretty much the only ""playable"" characters for me. Which is why I don't give it a higher score. The music is great, the concept interesting but there's just not enough content for slow-witted people like myself. Also, there's the frustration because you think for many hours that you will learn it eventually. But at some point, you just have to concede that ""No, my brain simply doesn't work like this"".. Brace Yourself Games’ Crypt of The Necrodancer centers on “Cadence” a girl who lost her mother to a plague that struck her village when she was young. Cadence’s father, devastated, dived into the depth of a crypt in search for a lost treasure that he believed would bring back the life of his wife and Cadence’s mother. Two years had passed since her father left to find the treasure; Cadence felt it was her duty now to find him. In her quest, she fell into the crypt where an evil Necrodancer took her heart and cursed it to move to the beat of the crypt forever. Cadence must now find her father and defeat the evil Necrodancer in order to lift the curse. This story line, while written well, interesting, and captivating at times, is just the cherry on top of this game’s gameplay, music, and visual effects, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-rhythm dungeon crawler that consists of four zones, each with three randomly generated levels and a boss battle. You must complete all of these in order to set a checkpoint in the game and proceed onto the next zone. Each time you die you are reset to the beginning of the first level in the zone. Now, throughout the levels you will find and purchase upgrades like any fantasy dungeon crawler including health, weapons, armor, spells, and enchanted items. Permanent and new upgrades are available for purchase, with diamonds that you have found in the crypt, in the lobby of the game, from characters you save from sick beat prison in zones you have completed. These permanent upgrades include the essentials like better armor, weapons, spells etc. However most of these purchased upgrades come in the form of chests that can be found within the crypt zones, excluding health upgrades which you will automatically have added on in the beginning of each zone. These upgrades can be extremely helpful and can make all the difference in whether you complete a zone or rage out. The game can become fairly difficult and kind of frustrating, especially when you’re first jumping into it. The rhythm aspect of the game and the way the almost “Zelda-esque” grid-style combat is set up, provides a really fun challenge for players; punishing you by sending you back to the beginning of the randomly generated zone but rewarding you by letting you listen to the music again and again, as you will die a lot. And if you like a bit of an extra challenge you can choose to not pick up weapons or health, and even jump on floor tiles that will either speed up or slow down the tempo of the song. And if you find yourself needing some help, the game supports local co-op play, which makes for a great “couch co-op” experience. Once you get the hang of the movement, and rhythm mechanics, you begin to notice and appreciate the crème-filling of the game, the music and visual effects. It is hard for me to overstate how much I enjoyed what this game did with music. The soundtrack of the game itself is amazing and something I’ve found myself wanting to listen to outside of the game. However I did find myself getting rather upset playing through it the first time, dying then having to listen to the same song on the soundtrack over and over again. So my recommendation would be to either not die ever, or download some of the other soundtracks that have been released as DLC. If you decide to get the game on the recent port to PS4 these downloadable soundtracks are included with the game. But don’t let that be the deciding factor in whether you get the game on PC or PS4, as the PC version has easily my favorite feature of the game: MP3 Uploads. On the PC version you can upload any of your MP3 files, the game will analyze the tempo and allow you to play with your own music. This feature is not new to games, but feels brand new and refreshing when defeating giant dancing monsters to your favorite song or even playing through the whole game to a favorite album. And I know some of you may have just a laptop with no gaming potential, and may fear that you will never get to play this game. Well you’re wrong. The simplistic 8-bit art style of the game allows for optimal performance on any platform, not to mention it looks great. Now while the 8-bit art style may look great, it is a style that has been used a lot in the past few years and has somewhat lost its luster of being a “new-retro game”, and the nostalgia factor is just not there anymore. That being said, the use of contrasting color in this 8-bit world creates a beautiful game. The zones are almost exclusively darker toned color palettes to set the scene of being in an underground crypt, but each monster when illuminated by your small torch brings vibrancy and brightness to the world. Not only this but when you kill a monster, your coin multiplier begins, and any time your coin multiplier is active, the crypt floor turns into an ever changing disco dancefloor. So while the art style maybe a bit over played, Crypt of The Necrodancer finds a way to make it fun. 9/10. Part rhythm game, part dungeon crawler, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a well-excuted and original concept that marries its inspirations effectively without sacrificing too much from either genre. While it doesn't dig too deep into either genre's traits, if you enjoy rhythm games or dungeon crawlers you will find something to like here (if you can look past its flaws). The meat of the gameplay revolves around spelunking through four zones of four stages each, with the first three having a small pool of possible bosses at the end. By keeping with the rhythm of the track and timing your actions to the beat, you are rewarded with a multiplier bonus that increases your gold pickups (and which later on enhances some equipment). While this is very important exploring the first two zones (especially as a new player because your loot pool will be low), zone 3 becomes extremely hectic with very aggressive monsters, lots of damage traps, and higher base gold pickups. The coin multiplier is useless except for gear once you reach Zone 4 because the gold pickups are so large that you can ignore it completely outside of combat. This seems to go against the design decision of adding rhythm elements and makes the game feel more like a barebones mobile-esque experience instead of DDR with swords. This might change with other characters (of which there are 10 to choose from), but the zones felt very similar in terms of game design when playing with Melody and Cadence for me. Even though the game only has 16 (randomized) floors, you have a great deal of customization options from the level select hub. Different characters completely change how the game plays; a monk who dies from touching gold, a bard who ignores the rhythm and turns the game into a turn-based crawler, and a miner with infinite kickable bombs are some examples of how the gameplay can be radically modified. CotN is also completely playable with a dance pad because everything is controlled with the arrow keys! This alone gives it my ""Best One-Handed Game"" award for 2015. A level editor and a seeded All Zones Mode are also included for enthusiasts. Overall, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a superbly unique experience that is cheap enough that anyone who has played DDR should dust off their dance pad for. While it isn't the deepest rogue-like or the hardest rhythm game, there is enough content included to sink your teeth into for at least a dozen hours.. The game has been out for a while now, have a large amount of hours on the game and is ever increasing. I'll keep it breif, fun, fast paced, great with friends and action packed. what else do you need!. A music game and a unforgiving dungeon crawler with heavy roguelike elements, all in one game. And it's not just a dungeon crawler with music game elements, or a music game with a dungeon crawl attached, it's a near seamless hybrid of both in a way that I never could have thought would work. But it does, so very well. A soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky means it's going to be good, and the tunes go well with the rapid, split-second pace you need to keep in order to stay ahead of the game. I'm not sure if it's extremely difficult or I just plain ****, but I still have yet to get overly far in it and consistently blunder into enemies as I try to stay on time to the beat so as not to lose my combo. It's embarrassing, really. But my own **** aside, this is a game that's just so much fun, especially once you start getting into the zone and responding to things before your brain can really process them. It strangely reminds me of Hotline Miami in that sense, but with less ultraviolence and more dancing skeletons. It is also now out of early access, and features a whole campaign, tons of unlockables and player characters with different playstyles, and daily challenges to keep you coming back. I must have rage quit this game a dozen times already but I keep wanting more, and it probably has something to do with those infectious beats. Nothing else is like it, and nothing else could do what it does as well as it does.. I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions. You have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done. During your dungeon crawling you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful. There is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them. I also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat. In addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish. Great game in general. Highly recommended.. The quote the Forbes review gave ""you have to see it to believe it"" is almost sums it up. I would propose a following line - ""you have to live it to see just how unfathomably awesome this game is"". The synergistic effects of already tried and tested fantastic retro game style, with a fantastic original idea, creative artwork and utterly genius masterpiece soundtrack leaves a game that swiftly kicked the backsides of all the other games I have played to sit at the top most played and most enjoyed game of all time. I am recommending this game to absolutely anyone, for I believe everyone has the potential to be awed by the experience. Those who are not awed either haven't put the effort (normally not necessary) to see the sheer ingenuity this game is or are completely blind.. This is the most addicting game I've ever played. Danny B wrote all the music, and in my opinion, this is his best work yet. Danny B wrote the music for Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, both amazing games as well. But THIS. THIS IS TOO MUCH. Now, what is it exactly? It is a dungeon roguelike that revolves around the tempo of the song you hear. You need to dance to the tempo while fighting enemies. The difficulty curve is excellent. I never felt like ""this is too easy"" or ""wow this is too much"" The game is perfectly executed in every way and I can't get enough of the music sooo addicted play the game.. This game is so awesome, I can't understand how there are so many negative user reviews, that's why I'm writing this. Maybe it's related to the witch hunt crowd who accused one of the game creators somehow of being friends with the IGF juries (it was already explained that the accusations makes no sense, but you know, everyone is quick to judge nowadays)... I mean, there are no mixed reviews, and the negative ones don't even explain why it's negative. The game is one of the most well made games I've played in a long time. Not only the music is good, but there is such an impressive attention to detail and polish that makes me happy. Maybe I'm biased because I love rhythm games, but the gameplay is fantastic too. I couldn't finish the game with Aria yet, it's really hard, but I like how until now the story kind of fits with the game too.. How to describe this game? An epileptic rhythm game with the best BO you can imagine and where Euclidean division is your only way out through the hordes of giggling monsters.. Really fun, challenging game. Combines dungeons rpg with rythm, and just when you think you are accustomed to a certain rythm you pass a zone to a new one with different style of music, and enemies. Very original in every aspect and nice pixel art.. Exactly what a game should be !! Fun - fun -fun. Move and fight in dance rhythms and fight bosses in their own music styles. Plenty of weapons and upgrades. Rogue style playing is equalized with keeping some abilities-items. I bow to the programmers for simplicity and ingenuity and pray that more games like it show up.. A dungeon crawler mixed with a rythm game: An interesting concept. But this game is not JUST a concept but a fantastic game, with a lot of complex mechanisms, rich bestiary, hundred of items, more than 10 characters who have their own **** music, which is a key point for a rythm game, is absolutely perfect and the final game includes 3 soundtracks ! A must have. I have 125 hours play time in the early access version of Crypt of the Necrodancer Crypt of the Necrodancer is a marvel **** in concept and, most importantly, execution. A turn-based dungeon rogue-like with permi-death that requires only directional keys and is designed to be played on a dance pad. The beat of the music provides the time for each turn as the player make their way through the crypt. Cadence and others will have access to an array of weapons, armors, spells and items to help them battle the various monsters and bosses. Necrodancer is tough but fair. While the mechanics are simple, the game is challenging. Each enemy has an attack pattern that allows even the weakest of weapons (base dagger) to defeat them. How you clear a room will be based on knowing the patterns, prioritizing enemies. and adapting to the items you have while maintaining the beat. The minimalist controls and over-head view give the player maximum control of game play. If you die (and you will... a lot) it will be the players fault. To this end, the game provides a training ground to test any combination of character, weapons, and monsters, so the player can hone their skill. Necrodancer has a lot of replay value. The zones are procedurally created and items are randomly found via purchase, opening chests, creates, and barrels or through the use of shrines. So every game is different. There are 10 playable characters providing addition variety. Cadence is the base character, but you can also play her grandmother, Aria, who dies whenever you miss a beat and cannot upgrade her weapon. Monk dies whenever he picks up gold and Bolt plays at double speed. If one finds all of this to be too difficult, Bard ignores the timer, allowing the player to dance as slow or as fast as they wish. The game is viable for casual play, speed racing, or score running. And, as stated, is perfectly suited to be played on a dance pad. The great music was composed by Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy). And the game includes 2 remixes provided by A_Rival and FamilyJules7x. Furthermore, you can import mp3s into the game and play to almost any song you desire. You can also create your own maps as well as customize and re-skin any of the sprites. Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rare game that is challenging, fun, and open to a multitude of playing styles. I thought the game was worthwhile before the final release which added another zone, some new bosses, a story, and 2 additional soundtracks.","Crypt of the Necrodancer is an entertaining combination of dungeon crawler and rhythm game . the soundtrack is amazing, the replay ability is enormous and the gameplay is simple but original . the game has only four levels with each character and yet it takes long time to master the movements of the enemies ."
699.Tactical Breach Wizards,"Tactical Breach Wizards isn't quite as addictive as the very best turn based tactics games (Into the Breach is still number 1) but it's engrossing gameplay and humorous script still make for a cracking game.. Fun puzzle/tactic game with an engaging story. I wish there were more games like this. Pros: similar to Into The Breach with fun abilities of the characters, loved the dialogues and the storyline. Ok, so it's not really like XCOM or a turn based strategy game at all. It's easy, even on Hard. You simply rewind and mess about and there are many ways to win. Enemies are very passive and most just stand around since the 'challenge' in this game is based on whatever goals you make for yourself; as in 'can I clear this room in 2 turns?'. You can literally just crouch in a room of multiple enemies and that will be enough to be safe from them. Only melee enemies actively hunt you down and there aren't many of them. The game is simply a sand box. I only had to restart a mission once I was almost half way through the game. A couple of missions later I stopped playing as without any challenge it's just a waste of time. The game even lets you skip levels if you choose. It's really made for the 'make me feel powerful while holding my hand and make allowances for me having an attention span of 8 seconds' crowd. The story, like the 'challenge', is also for a modern audience of, presumably, young people who still think Marvel and Whedon-esque humour is great. Everyone is childish, no matter their age or personality. Lastly, some rooms just feel bad because of the lack of enemy agency. In one instance, I had a big tanky enemy to kill that I was pretty much unable to damage so I hacked a turret. I waited for the enemy to come for me so I could use the turret but they just stopped moving and stayed on the other side of the map. If I approached they would throw an easily avoided grenade but apart from that it was basically some kind of bugged out stalemate. On another few occasions I was simply able to wait for many enemies to come out a door and then just shoot them one at a time until I got a victory screen. Yay...... Great humor, short puzzles with self adjustable difficulty, and a surprisingly good story. Try the demo if you are on the fence. This is not an XCOM-style game. It says so in the Steam description. It is more of a puzzle game like Into the Breach. If you know what you are getting into, I think you will like it very much.. Great writing humour throughout, which was an aspect I wasn't expecting to enjoy so much. Just the right amount of challenge. I love the addition of the built in commentary in the special edition.. A puzzley turn-based combat game with an interesting story and some REALLY fun writing! This is literally one of my favorite games, with the freedom to undo as much as I want and try lots of different approaches, it just satisfies an itch I've had for ages!. A well crafted X-com lite. The writing is relatively well executed if a bit too heavy on zingers - it's too Joss Whedon-on-steroids for my liking. The tactical elements of the game are superb. You can instantly undo any of your moves which is a double edged sword. It lets you experiment more and removes almost all of the frustration from these types of games however it makes it trivially easy and means that there never feels like there's anything at stake. A very fun game nonetheless but falls short from being a masterpiece of the genre by being a bit too goofy and there being little in the way of RPG mechanics throughout the course of the game other than half a dozen upgrades per character for your main abilities.. Tactical Breach Wizards is a captivating tactics game that perfectly balances accessibility with depth, Almost every mission feels like it has at least has one of those rare XCOM moments, where a dozen things interact in *just* the right way to create cascade of If-This-Then-That consequences that allow you to pull off brilliant tactical plays that feel entirely organic. This is encouraged by the game’s rewind system that allows the player to freely experiment with new abilites and try wild strategies just to see if they *could* work. This is supported by a constant stream of new abilites and enemies that keep things fresh and interesting, all the way to the endgame. TBW also shines in its writing, with clever humor and deep character interactions, including optional anxiety dream missions that explore each character’s psyche(!!). It’s a delightful, brilliant tactics game that’s as much about self-expression as it is about strategy.. Not a tactical game, it's a puzzle game. Minus 9 points for lying to players. Also, it's terrible. Crashes frequently, looks bad, and there's no challenge since you just rewind until you win. Pointless.. A good mix of “X-Com Chimera Squad” and the brilliant “Into the breach”. The former borrows from the setting, the latter from the game: Predictability of the opponent's moves and wacky actions. Unused setting, good humor, tactical turn-based strategy on small levels where you can puzzle and avoid mistakes with a useful “rewind” function. Nice idea between missions: You create a map with links between events, people and places. Not relevant to the game, you can't do anything wrong, but I like it for further immersion in the story and as a gimmick. All in all an absolutely lovingly designed product, big praise to the developers!",Tactical Breach Wizards is a puzzle/tactic game with an engaging story . it's not quite as addictive as the very best turn based tactics games . the game even lets you skip levels if you choose .
7.Perfect Dark (2000),"had an absolute blast with my cousin back in the day with this game, splitscreen, good old times.... one of the best shooters ever made.. I am still yet to play a first person shooter better than this one, proving just how ahead of its time it truly was. No game has had the deathmatch customization level nor as fun a co-op story. These two modes alone give it an unbelievable amount of replay value- it's one of only two games I have continued to play regularly since their releases. It perfected what made GoldenEye an excellent title, and pioneered many features we take for granted in modern shooters. Easily the best game and ""killer app"" for the Nintendo 64.. Hot take: Perfect Dark is better than Golden Eye. Yes it doesn't have as perfect of level design as Golden Eye, but it makes up for it, with a more pollished and better aged game.. This spiritual sequel to ""Goldeneye 007"" is another masterpiece. A cyberpunk-themed FPS, it looks great, but suffers from minor framerate issues. The levels are wonderfully designed and feature several objectives to complete. Weapons and gadgets are unique and fun to use. There are several multiplayer maps, modes and options. Like ""Halo"", it's a great shooter with a terrific story and memorable characters. Overall, I would rate this with a 10 out of 10.. I could never get into this; even back in the day when I owned an n64, it just didn't do it for me. It felt like a 007 goldeneye clone without actually being good.. This is a great game. After playing the Timesplitters series, this was easy to pick up and play. Controls take a little bit to get used to, at first. However, the story and the gameplay are a lot of fun. I recommend people play this at least once.. The graphics, the music, the sounds, the multiplayer and the main gameplay - all perfect for its time. Its mission are even fun to repeat. The game set standards no other game could match. Best N64 game.. Perfect Dark might be old now, but it is still an amazing game. The influence this game has had on the FPS genre is apparent. Biggest drawback is the N64 controller.. Semi-sequel to Goldeneye with more detailed graphics, better AI and some cool gadgetry. Technically better than its predecessor but it doesn't capture the imagination in the same way that playing as 007 in the Bond universe does. A strong FPS though and one of the best games on the N64.. The only true sequel to goldeneye. the games performance is a bit jarring, but it never really bothered me much. (like 13 - 15 fps in most levels, sometimes more/less) EVEN MORE UNIQUE LEVELS, GUNS, SUPERB ENEMY AI, MORE GUNS, AND CHEATS GALORE!!! the content they managed to fit on a 32 meg cart is mind-blowing. the fully voiced cutscenes albiet bitcrunched, really add a charm that goldeneye never really had. the controls are a huge improvement, the sound desing and new mechanics like shooting out lights, shooting guns out of NPC's hands, and the majourly improved mocap really make this game stand out in terms of atmosphere. Better than goldeneye in almost every way, PLUS it tens to sell for like 30 bucks cheaper if you're a collector. I think, the multiplayer.... Holy moly.... Where do i begin. that alone makes this game worth it. The AI simulats, the large selection of maps, CLASSIC MAPS FROM GOLDENEYE!! and more game-modes, teams, heated battles, guns, and the extensive cheats are the cherry on top. You either love it, or hate it. I first played this game a few months ago, so im unbiased with this one. Id highly recommend.. Great game with amazing atmosphere, there is not much to say apart from just to play it. The only downside is the lack of direction told you by the game, but i guess some people like it bc it makes your game harder and more enjoeyable but in some places of the game it can get rly frustrating and if you are a guy like me who doesn't want to search up the internet right after i get stuck somewhere it can take you up to hours to find the right route. Um what can I say, This game is the Epidemy of first person shooters. Playing as a hot chick who also is pretty hot (And i mean UNBELIEVABLY HOT) in a cyber-punk futuristic setting which is always a treat. Yes.. it is.... Going from taking down large corporations to hunting down aliens is always a treat. And Joanna's surly voice makes me... MEEEOOOWWWW! Best game 10/10. Would rate higher if it had X-Rated Scenes is always a treat. really nice game, i enjoyed so much thank you so much for the design and everything. For it's time I always got killed but I still tried to get through it so yeah great game and I own this on the Rare Replay Xbox One. Back in the day, this was the best FPS. One of the first games that had a really good bot experience in multiplayer. Such a good game. Very nostalgic for many.. This game was built upon the Goldeneye engine, and yet builds extremely well upon it. I spent way too much time on this game shooting the dumb peace sim aliens in the face in the combat simulator. perfect dark is peak shooters, top FPS, rivals doom, but its just great, even with the really really dumb ai. its just good, and beats goldeneye all the way, improves on pretty much everything.. To this day, it is still the best FPS ever made. Amazing story mode, difficulty modes actually had a meaning, best multiplayer customization ever where you can even play with bots, epic OST, lots of things to do and complete while being always fun. This game did everything right. The peak of Rare.. Although the impact was caused by its ""precuel"" Golden Eye, Perfect Dark is better in all aspects, exept for the control, as perfect as the first. I didn't feel Dreamcast graphics that good at the time because of this one. That explains everything.. The best FPS of its era, Better than Goldeneye and Turok. Perfect. El mejor FPS de su era, Perfecto.. Bought this in December 2021. Did I like it although it's so old now? Heck yes! I'm not even a FPS guy but this game kicks butt! The graphics are incredible, pretty much on par with early PS2. The music is thrilling, the story, although a bit simple, does the job (still got me surprised near the halfway point since I jumped in blind though). The controls are what might put some people off since it only uses a single joystick but I found them really good. The game was made with the N64 controller in mind and it shows! They were pretty spot-on as well as the rest of the game. The game is also fully voice acted, which adds to the immersion. It's a little on the short side but it's highly re-playable. I beat it on Agent difficulty and am not bored of the game yet so I'm off for another go on the higher difficulty! The Multiplayer is also really nice. I only tried it with computers (or Simulants like the game calls them) and even then, it was a blast! I cannot recommend this game enough! A real must play!. I waited 5 years for this game and was rewarded with the best, most beautiful, hottest first-person shooter, which also told one of the best stories. Perfect Game, Perfect Gameplay, Perfect Story, Perfect Dark. Joanna is Dark, Joanna is Perfect, Joanna is Perfect Dark.. This from the moment I got to play this as a kid to now playing it on my Xbox One has been one of my favorite games of all time. Id rate it an 11 if I could.. A lot of missions, a lot things to do in them, good story, skedars and maians, was excelent to me.. Overly complicated shoot em up. Nothing special. A bad remake of Golden eye.. I'm still playing this game. Better than goldeneye. Best Nintendo 64 game made.. At the time, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark were really the best shooters on consoles (everyone remembers that the first PlayStation, which in Russia was distributed more than others, could not boast of anything like this, everyone was happy there and the port of the second Quake), but on PC in the year of release Perfect Dark has already released No One Lives Forever. Therefore, if you have always played shooters on your computer, then the remake of the console game in 2000 will hardly touch any important strings in you. Because in a similar scenario — a latex-clad spy, a level with snowmobile racing, the near future instead of the 60s, big-headed aliens instead of Soviet generals with missiles-Perfect Dark completely lost No One Lives Forever. There were no situations so unusual as a jump without a parachute, no characters so vivid, no script and dialogue so stunning (they were increasingly technical), and no gadgets so inventive as exploding compact boxes. Even if you discount the difference in power between the then PC and Nintendo 64, these (released at the same time) games were like on different planets, so it would have been quite difficult for us to admire Perfect Dark even then. It is difficult to do this now, although the new models combined with the old, very simple animation give an interesting visual effect, making you think that the original game looked like this initially (in fact — much worse). Levels, as in many shooters of that time, consist of the same type of corridors that make you remember all the charms of the game design of the 90s-here you often get stuck just because you do not know where to go next and what to do (although, it would seem, all the enemies are killed and the doors are found). Perfect Dark As a shooter, the game is charming in its own way-it's nice to shoot, there are a lot of weapons. In this sense, Perfect Dark is one of the brightest representatives of the console school, which is now almost impossible to meet. The level of difficulty here determines not only the number and strength of enemies, but also the design of locations. Behind the same door at different levels of complexity, you can find both a storage room and a plot-important secret laboratory. And for high-speed passage of levels here give out special rewards, the good enemies are very slow and think for a long time before opening fire. But the success of the original Perfect Dark is due not only to the lack of good shooters on consoles, but primarily to multiplayer, which was then one of the best in the genre. The game could be played in a co-op, there was a split screen for four players and several multiplayer modes. Now they have added the ability to play through Xbox Live, so if in 2000 you really missed the opportunity to fight with other Nintendo fans on the Internet, now it has appeared. * * * However, the fact remains that if you once had a PC, but did not have a Nintendo 64, Perfect Dark is unlikely to impress you — most likely, you have already seen several much better shooters (in the same 2000, we recall, there was also a Deus Ex). Rare try first of all for their old fans who have remained with them since the time of N64 and who in the Wake of the release of Perfect Dark flooded the entire Internet with petitions asking them to release a remake of Golden Eye 007. Those would be happy, but Nintendo does not allow it yet.. An incredible game with an amazing world, interesting characters, great shooting, memorable action and the music, oh god. The music! and of course a story that keeps you interested all the time because there´s always something happening and it´s always exciting! Perfect Dark is one of those games that i can call a masterpiece. If you own a N64 with an expansion pack then play it right now.. Great graphics, great story and arguably the best multiplayer experience ever at its time and maybe even to date. I remember playing this game every weekend for well over an year, maybe even more, with my friends with local split screen multiplayer. There was just so much to do, so many cool maps, so many great and creative weapons (farsight, laptop gun, etc) . All the challenges, the insane number of bots you could add to the multiplayer with a number of different characteristics all of that added up to a virtually infinite amount of multiplayer options. Even to this day I've never had quite the same multiplayer experience as with Perfect Dark. 10/10, no question.. To date, one of the best shooters I've ever played. At the level of half life. Has it all. A great gameplay, a great story and in the technical section of the best of the 90's generation.. This game is one of the great FPS, on the shelf with Doom, Call of Duty, and Goldeneye 007. The suspense element being portrayed through the darkness works really well. The combat system feels refined, and the wide range of weapons helps. A great game to play with friends, or by yourself.. Still my favorite game next to oscerina of time. At that time the best multi-player on consoles ever released. The multi-player is still massively fun in 2019. 4 friends, a couch, and a few beers and you will have an evening for the ages.. The best FPS that you can find in the N64. This video game doesn't have Turok 2 graphics, but it is better in everything else.. Best Ego Shooter of that console that game owns it all: coop story,gameplay, graphics, multiplayer-4player ,modes with bots,KI, challenges , Also there is so much to do ! Btw This Game was my Nr.1 Ego Shooter experience Wow for that all time classic. I gave this a 10, but it should probably be a 9.9, simply because of it's frame drops. The multiplayer is vastly superior to Goldeneye, and IF this console had internet support infrastructure would have been where Halo 1 was.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. Rare's second masterpiece. It's even better than ""Goldeneye 007""! A must play for first-person shooter fans. One of the best N64 games ever made. I would rate this with a 10 out of 10.. The undisputed, best ever FPS game ever. I am playing it right now, almost 10 years on. Nothing will ever touch this game in any way, shape or form. Unless they remake it, and I'm not talking about Perfect Dark Zero. What a poor, poor attempt. This is second to Ocarina of Time, on my Best Games of All Time list. Thank you Rare.. This game is perfect, better than many FPS of new generations, it has a lot of modes to play, the multiplayer and the history are perfect, I cant imagine if this game were online multiplayer, it would be the best. I wish I could give this game a 10. I really do. But no game is perfect. Although ironically this game is pretty much as close to perfect as any game can get honestly... I'm trying to think of bad things but I would just be nit picking... Like how some guns are a bit op... Like how some characters are short and harder to shoot... Things that can be easily avoided basically lol. Some of the missions can be a little cryptic just like in golden eye as well but that can be looked at as a good thing. I would rather have to figure stuff out then be playing a linear game like call of duty. Kind of think of it I would rather play any shooter that's not cod lol. The story is good but gets rather goofy once the alien Elvis shows up but hey... Sci fi is always goofy to a certain degree so whatever.. But onto the good things about the game. Great sound track. Great game play. Great replay value. Great options. Ground breaking features that shooters today don't have for some dumb reason like controllable bots in multiplayer and the counter coop mode. Tons of weapons that all have second functions most of which are very awesome. It's one of the best shooters ever made. It's up there with half life, halo, doom etc etc.... This shooter changed the way we think of shooters like those other greats I just mentioned. And please don't forget to go to the firing range in this game... Something very special about it that I can't quite put my finger on but you will want to mess around in this part of the game for days on end honestly.... One of the best games of generation. Except poor framerate and dispute stealth mechanic in certain levels - all other think are awesome. The Xbox 360 port is strong reccomendation to play. I have never experienced a Nintendo 64 game that manages to get everything right other than the usual Super Mario 64, but then I tried Perfect Dark. Makes me want to play it again.. What I can say the game best shotting ever, one of the best memories of my childhood was this game, the reply value is amazing, the graphics stunning in the time of Nintendo 64, one of the best games ever made in multiplayer, kinda sorta open world to choice missions, sub missions, the downside is just a knock off of GoldenEye in the gameplay, the story is not the best of the gaming but better than EA or Activision plots stories no offense. This game never been so good! Hope they will do more in the future this could be a permanent franchise!. This is the best FPS game you can find. You will feel the big action when playing the Story mode, even on the Arcade mode! You will love the weapons, especially the soundtrack. There are so much to do on this game, like training and hours of fun with arcade and story mode with different difficulties. Lovely courses and atmosphere. Don't forget to try out this game, you will love it!. This game is flawless, Not only does it have a brilliant single player mode, but you can also get friends to play with, or even against you in the missions. Tons of great extras to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours, and an outstanding multiplayer deathmatch mode with heaps of different modes to play on. The pinnacle of game design.. Let me tell you, this is one of the best games on Nintendo 64. It is basically a more upgraded version of 007 Goldeneye for Nintendo 64 but adds lots of different and amazing features. If you were one of those people that always wanted to play 007 with others but couldn't, this is the game to play because not only did it have multiplayer but it had game modes where you could play against computers (or what as they call ""simulants"") without having to play with a real person. It also had characters who could talk instead of having text boxes on the screen to know what they are saying. It had over 50 different guns and some guns could use x-ray vision to see and shoot through walls. The campaign mode is great and it makes a lot of sense. One thing that made the game even more awesome is the fact that you had to have a compatible control pack to play the game because the game has so much memory for the Nintendo 64 to handle. Another thing that was cool about the game is the fact that you can customize the multiplayer game. Also this game takes place in the future. There are over 20 maps to choose from and over 50 different characters to choose from. This game is AMAZING.. Goldeneye is one of the best shooters i have played, but then comes the masterpiece, Perfect Dark: Perfect Gameplay, Perfect Music, Perfect Weapons, Perfect Missions!. If you guys are questioning my 6... keep reading. Goldeneye 007 should be known as a cult classic, and thank god a spiritual successor exists. Pros: -The graphics... holy crap the graphics! this (at the time) was a major improvement on goldeneye, and probably some of the best from the N64 -It actually looks pretty nice, graphics or not, give this game a try -Cool Challenge mode -This game went on to shape one of my favorite games ever made: timesplitters 2 and 3 -The setting is cool as hell! and thanks to the pretty outdated graphics, story missions are AWESOME looking. -You start in the HQ, which you can explore to see many different things about the game Cons: -The A.I. is NOT too great. while it seems pretty good in the story mode, but in challenge mode, the enemy's run into WALLS and when they do see you they run anywhere EXCEPT you location, and only shoot when you're REALLY close, though, the A.I. in this game is better then some of the A.I. on the newer games (Thor god of thunder, the walking dead survival instinct, etc.) -The multiplayer... yeah its great and all but I still think goldeneye had it better. -The story mode is pretty cool, but REALLY frustrating -The controls are not to great... if you like games where if you press up, you look down, this isn't much of a problem, but considering goldeneye didn't do it like this, and how uncomfortable it is ruins it, also, no, you can't change it. -While the HQ is nice and vast... its really easy to get lost in. So that's my review. Don't ask me about zero or what the f*ck the were thinking on that one... because I never played it, nor do I own a 360! This game is a classic, just be aware of the package.. Graphics: 9.8 Sound: 10 Gameplay: 9.8 Fun/Story: 9.5 The natural Goldeneye sequel on N64. Some occasional slowdown but always with nice graphics. A must-have.. The Spiritual sequel to THE BEST N64 GAME OF ALL TIME GOLDENEYE 007, a comparable futuristic female agent with aiming or not aiming options making the game almost unique. The character models were still great for it's time but not revolutionary and neither the setting that a few times may have been too dark. The biggest thing about this game it's the unlocking extra mission content and multi-player content improved from Goldeneye but it doesn't impact you graphically or hilariously like 007 did back in 1997. Despite that the voice acting it's way much better than all of rareware games that I have played before and maybe even after this game so I gave it A 9.254 THE 3rd BEST GAME EVER MADE ON N64.. All hail the greatest FPS ever made. Perfect pushed the n64 to its **** limits. The music of this game is incredible the graphics look AMAZING for a game that game out in 2000. THe sc-fi story theme allows for you to go to some interesting locales such as: RUined Temples, Villages on the cost, Underground labs, ETC. This game is a huge improvement over Goldeneye 007 which was Rareware's last fps on the n64 in 1997. After three long hard years Rare delivered the biggest n64 game ive ever played. I have absolutley no complaints about this game oh before i for get RARE says that only 5% of gamers will beat it on the hardest diffculty so threres that to challenge yourself to so yeah. I give this my completionist rating of : COMPLETE IT. Other than in looks, I fail to see what was so special about perfect dark. It's good, but not so great as some shooters I played in the n64 era. It hasn't aged too well either. By far my favorite game of all time without a doubt. Made by the greatest company ever Rareware it has amazing graphics for its time and so much replay value that I can play this game at any time and not be bored. There is so much customization in the multiplayer for endless amounts of ways to play. The single player is also very well done and is what I play the most. Thanks to the cheats you can just casually play the single player with all guns and just have a blast. Make the enemies harder by giving them shields and rocket launchers for more fun. I can't really think of anything this game does wrong. The beta version of the game was going to allow you to put custom heads on characters for multiplayer which would have been epic.. If you thought Goldeneye 007 was great, Perfect Dark will blow away to parts beyond. Improving on nearly every single thing that made Goldeneye great, Perfect Dark is, for the lack of a better word, perfect.. I felt compelled to give this game a 10. I mean ultimately if you don't give Perfect Dark a 10... then what on Earth DOES deserve a 10? Everything about this game is compelling and satisfying with quality and developer talent dripping from it. Imaginative, varied and fast-paced gameplay, captivating mission objectives and levels, great characters, amazing weapons, just an overall excellent game. The multiplayer is also great (for it's time, not sure about by modern standards as I haven't played it much recently!). As for flaws... some of the mission objectives aren't too clear. Some of the dialogue and story and stuff is a bit cheesy. Some of the levels are weaker than others (inevitably). Overall however, Perfect Dark is without doubt one of the finest games ever made. Perfect Dark is the most perfect first person shooter videogame ever created. I know that is a bold claim, and the game is not everybody's cup of tea. But why should art have to apologise just because it was designed with an ethos some find disagreeable? Do we judge Pink Floyd for not sounding like Queen? Both are masterful music groups with masterful music. Perfect Dark is a masterpiece of video-game design. If players are unable to tolerate the slow pacing, lack of hand-holding, or the science fiction storyline, that is really their own fault. Perfect Dark is filled with features which 13 years of development since have failed to recapture: Destroyable lighting, locational damage on enemies, surrendering AI, an array of clever weapons, non-lethal combat as a viable option, and alternate means of completing common objectives. The story is clever, humourous, and told very well via voiced conversations and cutscenes which book-end each mission. Joanna Dark is an interesting protagonist. I can't think of any videogame with a better female lead. Also of note is the multiplayer functionality, including well-designed cooperative, the combat simulator, and the inclusion of key maps from Goldeneye. Some people complain about this game's framerate. Let me tell you a cute little fact. Perfect Dark runs at a maximum of 50 or 60 frames per second, depending on whether your copy is PAL or NTSC. To compare, Ocarina of Time is capped at 17-20 frames per second. The sluggish framerate is noticable during heavy action in Perfect Dark because the game is capable of running at a much higher framerate at other times. And to be frank, the framerate is not as bad as people make out, and certainly much better than Goldeneye's. It's difficult for me to submit this review. I fear I haven't expressed just how beautiful this game is. It changed my life, and has continued to inspire me to this day. It deserves the title of greatest first person shooter ever created, and I suggest it deserves to be considered among the greatest video-games ever created. You owe it to yourself to play this game with an open mind, and most importantly LEARN how to play it. If you've been bought up on Modern Warfare and Quake, this game will be a plodding, dull experience. But if you have a taste for Deus Ex, and games which require the player to think in order to be completed, you will enjoy it. Just make sure you find a control scheme which feels comfortable first. The default is not particularly good for aiming. That is all I can think to say. I love Perfect Dark.. I bought this game based on the positive reviews on Metacritic. However, the game does not age well. FPS's were not meant to be played with one joystick, and going back to that is just frustrating.. This game was literally on its way to becoming on of the best N64 FPS games, then a little alien known as ""Elvis"" entered the picture. I thought Perfect Dark almost got it right, The game was off to a great start with nice graphics and solid story, but I personally believe Elvis killed the story and pretty much the game halfway through. Set aside from the story, the amazing graphics and totally addicting multiplayer made this game a must have. A lot of the maps are seriously fun and the guns KICK ASS. Perfect Dark did push the N64 to its' limits using the Expansion Pack and overall was definitely worth checking out.. Oh, God. This game is the real deal! People talk a lot about Goldeneye, but this game is even better than that! The graphics alone are the most realistic I've ever seen in a N64 game, and they blew my mind back then. The controls can be hard to get used to, especially for people who have been playing dual-analog shooters, but are extremely responsive and were top-notch for their time. One of the last great gems of gaming left to us by Rareware. Groundbreaking in every possible way.. Perfect Dark is possibly the best game Rare ever made. After the success of GoldenEye, Rare went on to make the compelling story of a heroine names Joanna Dark, an operative out to destroy a rival corporation to her employer. The game was pretty revolutionary at the time and even now, is a fun game to play for anyone who enjoys older games or first-person shooters. It's worth it to play one of the originals.. I never saw the appeal of this game. It's not bad, just not all that good. While I liked the voiced dialogue, which was very innovative for the time, the graphics were stylistically unappealing and detracted from the quality of the game. Moreover, some of the maps were obvious re-skins of Goldeneye maps, which just made the devs look lazy, and overall it lacked the charm of that game. It did offer some interesting innovations though, like secondary modes for weapons,. This is the best shooter i have played to date. When i heard it was going onto X-box i almost cried. It had the best multiplayer of it's time. And was the most revoulutoinary Shooter ever. Every one was shocked that halo 2 had duel wielding so did this game. I still play it today.. The best first person shooter ever made. The best multiplayer. The best singleplayer campaign(I cant even count how many times ive gone rogue and killed everyone on Airforce One cooperatively) and some of the best graphics of its time.. On consoles, this was the height of FPS, then the industry started over with hype and the unrevolutionary Halo. U could disarm enemy's and shoot them with it! A lot of people only want minimal gameplay in their games so they immediately give Goldeneye the nod. i like Goldeneye, but i also keep it real because overall i like FPS games in general.. This game is way better then goldeneye. It has Coop, MP bots, and a better story.. Inspired by the classic 007 Golden Eye game, Perfect Dark adds its own elements. PD shows a pretty long single player campaign, but that isn't everything. PD also brings lots of multi player missions (which you can play on your own thanks to the enemy IA). You can also customize your own game with the IA and have fun for hours. There are 40+ weapons, some of them brought from Golden Eye 007. The only bad thing is the lack of innovation from the 007 game (PD is just the same, but with more elements).. Perfect Dark is the BEST FPS of all time. Sorry to the kids who are coming back 10 years later and not finding it up to your standards. You need to learn to respect where things came from. If you didn't experience it when it was brand new than I am sorry, you really missed out.. This game was another classic. Addicting gameplay. Music is awesome...A game that will be remembered for a lifetime. So much fun with friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. A timeless classic that changed the way fps ar done til today.... they tryied to emulate this king of game many times later, but they have never got closer. In an older and simpler time, First Person Shooters where not very common on consoles back in the time of this game's creation, they where mostly only on PCs. When 007 Goldeneye proved that even on simple cartridge technology that great First Person Shooter single player and multiplayer experiences where possible, the genre exploded at the thought of the possibilities. Perfect Dark is a indirect sequel to 007 Goldeneye in the sense of improved engine, interface and features even though it was not related to James Bond at all. The storyline is beautifully crafted with the ability to play the story mode in single player, co-op, and counter-operative (your friend controls enemy guards). Multiplayerer deathmatch had heavy improvements with the ability to select all weapons to appear on the map, creation of your own character skin and your personal gameplay settings, map selection, save files full of multiplayer statistics and rankings, team settings, AI difficulty and personality settings, multiple game modes, music, specialized deathmatch missions, and the ability to save match settings and load them on a **** conclusion, I'll be perfectly honest here, as a person who absolutely despises the bland, repetitive and uncreative of nature of most games","perfect dark is the best game and ""killer app"" for the n64 . a cyberpunk-themed FPS, it looks great, but suffers from minor framerate issues . controls take a little bit to get used to, but the story and gameplay are a lot of fun ."
70.Ninja Gaiden Black,"This upgraded re-issue of the 2004 release is a near masterpiece. It includes a new Mission Mode, four difficulty levels, new costumes, extra weapons, added cutscenes, an improved camera and the original arcade game. ""Ninja Gaiden"" is very tough, but always fair and this ""Black"" version is a must own for action fans. Overall, I would rate it with a 9.5 out of 10.. Too hard to really enjoy. Every enemy felt like a boss, and bosses were absolutely frustrating.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. frustrating i gave up playing this plus the way it looks is stupid looking so nah not a fan. It's great. It's the best game I've ever seen. The picture is exquisite, the movement is smooth, and the design is exquisite.. Well, 10/10. It was the MOST challenging game of my entire childhood...i don't even have enough words to describe how difficult it was to me, it's not just like ""git gud"" in Dark Souls, it's way above that level. Tomonobu did something incredible and something horribly insane at the same time. Gosh. But despite the fact that it was terribly hard for me as a 11 year old kid, i really enjoyed this awesome masterpiece!. The most challenging game that I have played in my whole life, artificial intelligence is a great game, maybe the best in the whole gaming, the gameplay is incredibly diverse, everything is great. the only problem I had was the game camera could be better.. Here I am nearly 17 years later, and I think a this game still holds up pretty well, mostly due to the combat. Even after I have a ton of gaming experience since 2005, it's still soul crushingly difficult, more so than even Dark Souls. It's probably the most fun combat I've ever played in any game. All the combos, flips, wall running, etc. are all incredible. The OST, level designs, and weapons are all fantastic too. From a modern retrospective (as I just played recently), it does show its age quite badly in some spots. I wish that a lock-on system was present in these older games, it would have helped tremendously, since the camera is not good (and the Sigma remaster also suffers from it too). Lots of enemies have cheesy grab moves with hardly any tell or time to react. Lots of the bosses just flat out **** by today's standards, but they're fine for a 2005 game. The controls for the bow are horrendously bad too, it was especially infuriating to use it on mandatory bow spots like the helicopter boss. One of the greatest, if not the greatest, original Xbox titles. Even better than Halo or KOTOR in some regards.. I love Ninja Gaiden! I am a Master Ninja and i love to be doing those karma runs and speedruns on Master Ninja mode and those challenges in missions doing with specific weapons runs too or no health potion challenges etc. I love this game's so hard but I like it the gameplay is pretty good and one of my childhood best hack and slashing game. Ninja Gaiden as an action adventure game with the primary focus on fast-paced, and rather violent, combat. To be honest I can't really recall anything about the game's plot but its largely irrelevant anyway as it takes a distant second place to the superb gameplay. These days it of course looks a little dated compared to modern titles but, even more than a decade after its release, it offers some of the most satisfying combat in the genre. The legendary level of difficulty might well put some people off but once you get the hang of things you'll find a genuinely great game.. This game will truly test your abilities as a gamer. The funnest action game to date by far!. This special edition of ""Ninja Gaiden"" includes all the DLC, updates and a few new features. It also contains the original arcade game which is a nice bonus (if you can unlock it). The original release was already the best action game on the Xbox. This upgrade is slightly better since it features a refined story mode. 50 mission challenges, extra costumes and two new difficulty levels were also added. This is an action-fighting title for the hardcore fan. It's more difficult than ""God of War"" and ""Devil May Cry"", but also very entertaining. I would rate ""Black"" with a 9.5 out of 10.. I just replayed Ninja Gaiden Black (now in 2019 - normal mode) on my old Xbox (1gen, still working, yeah!) and it did not loose any of its quality, even this many years later with so much more games out there. Im not as a good Ninja Gaiden player as i was with 12 years but I still got it ;). The original ""Dark Souls"" i can say today.. No just kidding, its a hard game for sure, but as soon as you ""get it how its done"" and beat the first boss the feeling is amazing and its entertaining as fu**. I remember replaying NGB at least 8 times when I was young. Not only because its the best Xbox game there is, side to side with Halo 1 & 2, but also because it has a high replay value. Not only cause of the different difficulty levels, but also because of the Golden Scarab collection, the rewards and the new, stronger enemies. Plus the graphics were insanely good for that time, even though today its not that of an eyecandy anymore. And the Cutscenes... damn! Really one of the best games I ever played... and I played a lot of games. 10/10 for this masterpiece!. Hard core fun. It combines the robust comb system of fighting game into a 3D environment vs. multiple endings. Great model design and vfx. Animations are super smooth. Controls tight. Puzzles can be tedious but balance out the pacing. Defeating the brutal bosses are absolutely rewarding. One of top games of past generation.. As for me, it's one of the best games ever! Tomonobu Itagaki is a GENIUS! But don't play Sigma, Itagaki has nothing to do with it. It was made by Hayashi and it's ****. This is easily my favourite game on any Xbox system. The level of difficulty is discouraging at first but the game keeps pulling you in with its amazing story and awesome game play. These addictive qualities drive you to get better and improve your skills until you eventually beat the game. Then you've got the hard and very hard difficulties left to overcome with all new and more difficult enemies to defeat. If you can stomach the gory action scenes it is definitely a must-play.. Its surely on of the best action games out there with endless possibilities and combinations to be done. Its challenging, fast paced and rewarding. However even if action hack n slay games usually dont have a good story, ninja gaiden has a real bad one. Anyway a decent action game.. Damn good **** game. Fun, badass, epic, challenging. This is one of the best games of the past generation for sure, I just recently re-played and I got my ass handled to me good, but God damn once I got the hang of it again. There's not much that can be said, the game is not for the casuals, its awesomeness can only be truly seen by hardcore gamers. Solid 9 out of 10.. Good gameplay, graphics, a kick-ass character, challenging. A gamer's game, and the best title for the xbox.. Great graphic, great fighting combo, great Ryu, skillfull opponent, satisfying lenght, Best game next 2 god of war... Best action game overall... The only reason I bought xbox is because of ninja gaiden.. Some people say d game is hard, I'l just say they ****.. Don't be a ninja dog.. U won't get the best of d game if u play ninja dog... Master Ninja..","""ninja gaiden"" is an upgraded re-issue of the 2004 release . it includes a new mission mode, four difficulty levels, new costumes, extra weapons . it's the most challenging game that i've played in my entire childhood ."
700.Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance,"An almost perfect turn based game. Story & characters were lacking. Demons & world were superb. One of the most fun games I ever played, I lost sleep over this game I was so excited daily to get back on to collect more demons & battle more foes. The lack of character customization was sad, but I guess they had a default character/look for a reason. The map of the city was an interesting new take on navigation, but you hardly ever use it... you're mostly just in the other world running around, it felt tacked on which is a shame because it was neat & would have liked to have seen/experience it more than 6 times in this 60+ hour game. 9/10 game because it's awesome. The high-definition graphics and high frame rate gained after leaving the Switch, combined with the revamped and excellent combat system, make this the best game of the year. However, I really don’t like the new story and characters.. As a long time SMT / Persona fan this game is welcome and very happy with it. the vengeance variant is the version to play and feels Like the definitive one to play press turn system always great visuals and menus on point (the switch lag is basicaly gone now from original version) bosses great QOL features are very helpful i've not finnished this story yet but the orignal SMT was 8 for me this one whole extra story line + original + fleshed out QOL features and performance upgrades yea this one is great if you want a Good JRPG that can be as tough as you want it to be or easy as needed with a decent story this is it i've played PS5, Switch, and pc versions now if this was not a HS setting i would likely rate it 10 but im older now and the High school starting point i just wish Altus would move past (college or job ) would be preferred at this point will be working on Metaphor next. Not as good as Persona but still an amazing game with tons of content to sink hours of time into.. Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance is probably the best game of 2024, the new story is really great and it feels more complete. Everyone says to play the vengeance route and never play the creation route. While the vengeance route is way better, playing both routes will make for a more complete experience. (The DLC is not as bad as P3R). This game is a must Play it got a great Story and great characters and good Soundtrack.. Coming from a Persona 3/4/5 background, I expected this game to be inferior (in terms of storyline), but to offer a similar gameplay. Well, the story is ridiculously shallow and the gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced and repetitive. To the point that, after about 10 hours I decided it is not a good use of time, and started playing Persona 5 Royale for the second time. Keep your expectations low, especially if you are coming from Persona background.. The story is ok and the music is very repetitive. The gameplay is very slow and grindy with you slowly progressing through a repetitive environment, but still pretty enjoyable as it has the SMT demon collecting fun. That fun is quickly zapped away by how cheap the game's difficulty is. I have never been a fan of the silent protagonists or instant game overs when only the main character goes down and so those aspects bring it down a lot for me as usual.. Having played Shin Megami Tensei V at its initial release on the Nintendo Switch; I am thoroughly enjoying replaying through it again with the new content, new demons, and new storyline. And most important of all, those buttery smooth framerates (the Switch version was a bit…..rough). With Innate skills, a sort of passive effect each demon has, the game encourages you to experiment and come up with a team that synergizes well with each other. I did notice some camera issues during combat skill animations, but not enough to impact my playthrough. If this is your first or hundredth time playing this, there is without a doubt much more to explore and enjoy in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.. ""Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance"" is a title that has raised high expectations among fans of the series, promising dark, challenging gameplay and a deep story. Unfortunately, while the game has its strengths, it ultimately falls short of all the hopes placed in **** of the greatest strengths of ""Vengeance"" is its well-known combat mechanics. The turn-based system remains tactically complex and satisfying, and the wide selection of demons to recruit and fuse offers plenty of opportunities to create unique strategies. For fans of the series, this is familiar territory that can still provide a lot of fun, although it lacks major innovations that could refresh the **** plot of ""Vengeance"" unfortunately does not live up to the standards that the series has accustomed us to. The theme of revenge, which was supposed to be the core of the story, turns out to be surprisingly shallow and underdeveloped. It lacks emotional depth and engaging plot twists, making it difficult to fully immerse yourself in the hero's fate and his journey. As a result, the story becomes more of a backdrop for the game than its driving force.Graphically, ""Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance"" presents itself solidly, but there are also some shortcomings here. Although the design of the demons and locations is atmospheric, the whole thing suffers from a lack of variety. The game world, although impressive at times, often seems too monotonous and lifeless, which makes exploration quickly boring.Another problem is the level of difficulty. Although the series has always been known for its high level of challenge, in ""Vengeance"" the balance between satisfaction and frustration is sometimes unbalanced. Some moments of the game may seem artificially difficult, which instead of motivating you to continue playing can effectively discourage **** sum up, ""Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance"" is a game that had the potential to be the next great installment in the series, but in the end it leaves mixed feelings. Solid combat mechanics and a familiar atmosphere are not enough to cover up the plot deficiencies and graphic shortcomings. For fans of the series, the game may be worth a look, but for others it may prove to be only a moderately satisfying experience.. Music: 7/10 \ Story (CoC): 2/10 \ Story (CoV): 5/10 \ Characters: 3/10 \ Battle system: 6/10 \ World/Exploration: 3/10 \ Design/UI: 4/10 \ I can’t state enough how much of a huge downgrade in quality this is from both SMT IV and Apocalypse. Never at any point in SMT V (in either Canon of Creation or Canon of Vengeance) does this feel like an epic struggle for humanity, never at any point do you stare into the abyss. The weight of your actions as the Nahobino, and the events of the main story and sub quests, never feel heavier than a feather. Canon of Creation is nothing more than a boss grindfest and Canon of Vengeance is about picking which girlfriend you prefer. That’s it. Da’at is just one bland recolor of ruined desert city after another. All the NPCs that aren’t the principle cast are faceless, an odd design choice that makes whatever happen to them somewhat inconsequential and without feeling. The game assumes too much that you should like and care about the other primary characters (Sahori, Amanozako, Miyazu, etc), despite barely knowing anything about them. Their relationships with you (and to each other) seem paper thin or straight-up nonexistent. You’re literally handed Godhood on a silver platter within the first few minutes of starting the game, which makes all the challenges you experience feel a bit hollow. Throughout the game, you’re guided by reassuring father figures who guide you by the hand to the throne. You have no reason to fear demons because you’re told from the moment you take Aogami’s hand that you are literally more than they are. Where is the cosmic fear? Where is the horror of permanently becoming something inhuman? Where is humanity’s struggle and eventual hope that showed so prominently in all prior SMTs? It’s wiped clean in SMT V:V. That said, the music is a definite highlight (no surprise from Atlus) and does the majority of the heavy-lifting here, but still is not enough to make either story compelling. Some of the new lore is interesting, but some of it (and a lot of the story of Vengeance, particularly near the end) relies heavily on modern anime tropes, something this particular MegaTen series has not been known for. The base SMT battle system is still enjoyable as always, but marred by safety features like Magatsuhi, unique skills and overly-generous demon negotiation. There’s something a bit underbaked in SMT V:V. It’s like Atlus forgot how to make games that are enjoyably challenging and with a story that makes sense. Makes me concerned for future titles.. Absolutely phenomenal and a huge step up from the original game in every way!! Highly recommend this game if you’re a fan of Atlus games.. It's exceedingly rare that I start a game that I think I'll enjoy and never finish it. I have some OCD that prevents me from leaving a game unfinished. This game I just had to stop playing after the 12 hour mark and that felt so strange to me but it still felt like the right decision. My top gripes with this game were the story and the environment. I'm not talking about the graphics (which are terrible on Switch by the way) but rather the post-apocalyptic Tokyo desert that is this game. It's SO boring and dismal. I just couldn't take another crumbled building, another hill of sand, another field of dirt. Everything is a disgusting shade of gray/brown. For those of you that will say ""Oh the story picks up pace later on!"": Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't. I'm not sticking around to find out! I did choose to ""save the girl"" at the beginning to experience the new Vengeance storyline, which everyone claims is an improvement on the original storyline. Wow... I can't imagine how bad it was originally. I genuinely felt like my time was wasted and I can't believe that this game is so well regarded. I switched to playing YS VIII on Switch instead and I'm having a great time with that game.. Why couldn’t we have this as the original! Anyways! Takes from the original and makes it 10 times better! And it being on pc makes it an entirely different experience, love this game!. (MY SCORE : 8.8 /10) An upgrade from a game released in 2021. An exciting JRPG game that is not too difficult because apart from having 4 Difficulties, there is also an Auto-Battle feature. In this game we become MCs who we can name ourselves. And I named my MC Ardhazz Ardhazz. In the Route Game that I played, in the middle of the round, the Qadistu consisting of Lilith, Naamah, Eisheth and Agrat managed to defeat Nahobino and his Allies, namely Tao Isonokami (who was killed, but will later rise again to become Nahobino's guiding Goddess) and Yoko Hiromine, and succeeded in resurrecting Tiamat! Until it was finally revealed that Yoko actually belonged to the Qadistu group. Nahobino also had to let go of Aogami, an artificial figure who was integrated into his body and gave him the power of the Dragonslayer! And Hayao Koshimizu, Chairman of Bethel Japan and PM of Japan, became Tsukuyomi to replace Aogami, merging into Nahobino's body and giving him strength! Unfortunately, after gaining power from Archangel Mastema, Ichiro Dazai turned evil! He killed Yuzuru Atsuta and left with Abdiel who became his Ally! Approaching the End of the Act, I have to destroy Ichiro and Abdiel, before entering the Ending Act in Empyrean! Reportedly there are a total of 6 endings in this game! And I myself got the ""Chaos Ending"", where automatically, my Main Character, Nahobino shook Yoko Hiromine's hand instead of Tao Isonokami's hand! After that we will face Archangel Mastema, Tiamat, and ENDING BOSS: LUCIFER, in Dragonslayer form! Yup, Aogami suddenly appears and reunites with Nahobino's body! After Tsukuyomi's power was released in Nahobino's body and he re-formed into Hayao Koshimizu who was seriously injured when fighting Tiamat. In his dying state, Koshimizu still had time to heal Yoko's wounds.. ATLUS has a record for churning out amazing turn based combat games, and this is no exception. Adrenaline pumping hard fights combined with a killer soundtrack makes this experience as close to a turn based dark souls as one can get. While the story is nothing to write home about and the gameplay a bit repetitive, running around a ravaged wasteland with free-flowing blue hair is pretty fun.. WARNING: If you are a ""Casual"" gamer, do NOT play this game on ""NORMAL"" or ""HARD"" difficulty. I barely beat this game on the default difficulty, it's really that hard! REVIEW: I'm divided with this game story because CoV is a good story, but CoC is a bad story. At least the gameplay is fun, and there is a ton of variation with unique enemies that have cool designs. I recommend this to experienced JRPG gamers. But for casual gamers like me, all I have to say is to beware of this game's difficulty.. Genuinely a masterclass of an RPG. I don't know how anyone could be on the fence about this game if they are a fan of RPGs at all. Only issues with this are the Plastic like graphics developed for the switch, and how wild the difficulty scaling is. If you've ever played an SMT game you know what to expect. This game is fantastically dark, with much more depth than damn near all other monster taming games.. If you ask me, the best game ever made. Combat, fusion, music, choices, and story are the best they've been across the series. This game will absolutely make you think before heading into battle, choosing a skill, fusing, or making dialogue choices. I only wish it were a little bit harder. everything gives too much xp. Maybe Atlus can add a DLC difficulty later? Please?. One of the best and most addictive games I've played in the last few years. Excellent style, music, as well as an interesting and confusing plot. A great pleasure comes from collecting demons, which in turn are not similar to each other. They have their own character, their own style. A huge number of abilities and builds will make a small number of people bored. The combination of these factors, although it does not put this game on the level of Persona 5 Royal, will definitely give a huge amount of emotions and pleasant memories.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As someone who loves the original SMT V on Switch and us playing the new one again on Switch. The way they have fleshed out the characters and story just by adding a few things here and there throughout and theBIG changes they made in the new canon of vengeance arc this game is an absolute masterpiece for me now. Play it on 4k screen the graphics detail improve like A LOT vs switch oled,i dont like where this is going its like the game infested by persona viruses,theres a lot people now on every cutscene it feels strange if you already played the original,the developer holding your hand too much Now(give you a human companion with advantage skill specifically for upcoming boss/item that can heal all member and a LOT of many other),the title should be smt 5 with friends not vengeance,if you havent played the original(9/10 for me)its still a must play,but if you already played and like a challenge kind of player,for me this one feels flat and missing a lot of that intense feeling from original(especially the new abscess system felt not rewarding anymore). Better by every measure. The og was amazing, save for the mediocre story, but the new canon of vengeance storyline really rectified this. The bosses, demons and content are some of the most enticing reasons atlus has given us to buy their game for a second time, besides the fact it is on more powerful hardware this time around. Which, in and of itself is a pretty big reason.. My first ever SMT experience and I'm happy to say that it's a modern-day JRPG masterpiece. To me this game is better than Persona 5. Atlus should use this game a template for all their releases going forward. The atmosphere. The aesthetics. The music. The lore. The story. The turned-based battle system. The demon/pokemon system. A Masterpiece! It has character! A must play for all jrpg/rpg fans 10/10.. I gave the original 10, and I am still giving Vengeance a 10. It's just a wonderful RPG that beats Pokemon out of the park (in my opinion). Words are not enough to describe and explain this RPG. You have to play for yourself to understand how awesome it is.. SMT VV isn't without some issues, including somewhat monotonous side quests, and the occasional bouts of RNG not being in your favour, but it improves upon the issues from vanilla SMT V. Better visuals, and on PS5, runs much smoother than the original release on the Switch. It also has a larger variety of demons, and the Vengeance storyline does add even more replayability to a game that keeps you coming back for more. Demon collecting and fusion is very satisfying when you get stronger demons, and improving Nahobino makes the game a bit easier. If you liked vanilla SMT5, or are a Persona fan who wants to branch out, I'd strongly recommend SMT5 Vengeance.. Shin Megami Tensei v vengeance is the best way to experience the story of smt v but still this game especially story wise leaves a lot to be desired. This game is combat heavy but I say that’s probably the funniest thing to do on here is fight point out enemy weaknesses and gain and strengthen you **** story just feels a bit lackluster like there multiple plot points that just don’t get satisfying endings. Ichiro feels like a ripoff of junpei in the beginning but once they actually give him something to do he comes into his own. The voice acting can be a bit rough and monotone sometimes but on the plus side this is the best smt v has ever looked . The monster taming aspect is so much fleshed out here then other titles in this series . Overall one of my favorites of the year even though it does lack some quality of life features and a lackluster story. Atlus trying to lure pokemon fan and 10 year old persona player crybabies,now the game became too easy,EVERY SINGLE THING that makes it difficult,intense/that can make you game over and play with more serious they remove it. Best game i've ever played. Far better than any modern persona and i really enjoyed my time with modern masterpiece. The best jrpg ever made. Masterpiece. incredible narrative, incredible gameplay, incredible EVERYTHING. More than i knew i wanted, as the improved version **** that i already loved, even if it was far from perfect... Now it pretty much is, and i hope this becomes the template for the core SMT series... A part of me even wishes older titles like SMT3 and 4 (or even 1 and 2) had proper remakes using all the QoL found in Vengeance.. One of the best modern Jrpg.... Atlus keep doing great games.... Good story good gameplay good music. This game is a true success story that takes all the good and bad things from the original and improves it all. Original game had a lot of potential but was let down by a meh plot and some confusing choices. Vengeance fixes all of that and becomes one of the best JRPGs of all time.. SMT V is one of my favorite games of all time and SMT V:V has enhanced the experience to the next level. The amount of improvements, new story, new soundtrack and much more makes this game into a masterpiece. And the most important thing, it is very fun and addicting.. I will say that the game is very nice. battles and combos make this awesome and there are very challenging enemies even if you are max lvl you will need to have different teams in order to beat them. Exploration is nice and more thedemons are very well designed. I was waiting for this long for this game to move to other platforms. Now I have 2side of the game to play since it is needed to have the best demon of the game.. Masterpiece of JRPG, a well-developed turn base combat system which is verified to work by all Atlus games in thirty years, both the map design and hints given allow players to enjoy all of those interesting points step-by-step. Maybe this is what Pokemon supposed to be.. Praise be to YHVH, for Atlus has indeed kept us well-nourished this year with their exceptional offerings. Their games continue to demonstrate a mastery of intricate storytelling and compelling gameplay mechanics, ensuring a deeply engaging experience for fans and newcomers alike. Each title showcases their commitment to quality and innovation, solidifying Atlus's reputation as a leading force in the gaming industry. Their contributions this year have not only entertained but elevated the standard of gaming excellence.","the lack of character customization was sad, but I guess they had a default character/look for a reason . the high-definition graphics and high frame rate gained after leaving the Switch, combined with the revamped and excellent combat system, make this the best game of the year . as a long time SMT / Persona fan this game is welcome and very happy with it ."
701.Legends of Runeterra,"I would love the game, but the exclamation marks have no description. So I need to have this page open all the time to search what they do: ""**** My game is german, so I even need to find them by picture. VERY ANNOYING!!! And so easy to fix put the necessary info, a description of the exclamation mark, into the game to stop to annoy your players!!!. It's just the wish version of Hearthstone. this game is not fun or anything else.. **** game made by riot, made with rng everything except they make you lose on purpose so they get you to spend.Greedy company that is owned by Chinese company that wants your money. Don’t play and never play a riot game, they are legit aids and ****. The only good thing is the lore, gameplay wise it is ****.. The strategy you will/will implement is really important. You have to use the cards correctly. some cards even have a first attack bonus, and yes, even you have to use them correctly. Although it's like a side game of LoL swamp, it's better than LoL. By the way, you don't need to have played LoL to play. not p2w. Better than Heartstone in my opinion.. Really good mechanics, stunning visuals. The PVE campaign ""Path of Champions"" is a lot of fun and a good way to learn. Good job Riot!. It's a brilliant game. Top 3 TCG. It has a fun game play, complex meta game, and it is very accessible resource-wise. The only con I can think of for this game is that it is not at all beginner friendly, and learning the game overall or all of its intricacies is very time consuming and I understand why it would push a lot of new players away, but it is very well worth it if you are a card game fan who is looking to spend a lot of time and little to no money on a TCG.. A solid F2P card game with great presentation and a solid progression. Decent variety and creativity in deck building.. Legends of Runeterra is a really well-designed card game. It is also very f2p!. 2/9/2022 Today I played lor, I played LAB mode. A mode that fights with Ai with characters like Yasuo Jinx Jayce to choose from. I have played Yasuo until Victor. Before reaching the Viktor stage, I had to pass a level where it was random, every turret Round start. I'm going to tell you that **** is so unbalanced I'm stuck at level 3 4 times and still haven't passed. I think what 1. Unbalanced is a card that Ai randomly gets and still gets a Key word. Key word is this. It pisses me off a lot. I randomly hit through and the one that hit through is a T-Rex 8/8. 2. The card I have The gad I randomly picked up some important characters. 2.1 Cleared the whole board (this one I'm okay with) but what's not okay is when the main character is dead What character? to defeat the T-rex 8/8 Overwhelm. 2.2 Random Gards Gards that can make me play easier won't say. For example, if I do a Yasuo + Yone combo, these gards won't come out. End. I'm dizzy. I'm totally out of mood playing this LAB. I wasted 1 to 2 hours. Played several rounds, but still did not pass.. This is about as good as a TCC can get, I think. I especially love the story mode, but there are so many things that always bothered me about other TCCs, especially digital ones, that this game does so much better.. its simmilar to tft, but worse. TFT, but not that good. It is a card game .. The game is something between Meh and OK. F2P friendly, nice Graphics/Artwork and regual new content makes it fun for a game now and then. The biggest let down for me are Bugs, Metaplay and communication. Bugs appear on a dayli base and range from grafics glitches into others to cards wont work or you cant place them (even though i encountered gamebreaking bugs very rarely). Bugs stay in the game for very long until they get fixed e.g. Shurima came out 8 Months ago and Azirs voice lane is still cut during the lvl up animation. Communication means, i have the feeling they only hear positiv feedback and ignore negativ feedback/player suggestions, one reason i post my critic here. Imo the Report Side is not comfortable (i was not able to use it for a long time) and i dont like the big chatroom on discord, i feel ignored. There are a lot builds you can play but only for the Memes, not for winning. In ranked, you can see only flavor of the month, the Metagame is very strong in this one. Off-Meta builds are really not fun to play and the few Meta Builds change on every patch. Power Creep is a huge problem in LoR, every patch, the new Cards are way more powerfull then the ""older ones"", either by having way better Stats/cost ratio or have the same stats but really good keywords. The game makes no secret that it has its focus on fast games, thats why rush decks are Meta and lategame or control decks feel useless. E.g. Seamonsters needs you to throw 25 of your 40 cards away ,literally(!), to have theyr keyword work. The only reason i do sometimes recommend it to some die hard League fans is its because its F2P. EDIT: New expansion is out, tonns of skinns, new power creep no balancing.. Good f2p / nice gameplay. Great game for new players. Feels like modern version of MTG.. Unbalanced, and don't know if the game is more luck than me but it always got a card to beat me just in time all the time, and the cards too op, then riot just add more op card, overall: almost trash. A breath of fresh air, with mechanics from a bunch of other card games, again familiar heroes. Healthy free to play, no random pack, interesting art style, interraction between card, but still have bug, and unbalance card, like old grand plaza and this time is concurent timelines card, still i believe they will change it just like what they do with grand plaza.. The best card game in the market by far. And trust me on this one, I've played almost all the card games out there.. Good for nothing pay to win antics game created to trick players into buying cards that are way overpowered making it impossible for players to play against and win. A good for nothing pay to win video game that you rather not play unless you have nothing else to play in which I have to say ""get a job"".. Recently the game went through updates, and I came to update the note. We have new current features in the game that made me raise that grade. The game started to get a lot less pay to win with new visual elements the game got a better mechanics too. Competitively the game is ready to be launched in an eSports world, just wait to see new card mechanics and new regions to know if the game remains balanced and with several incredible mechanics that have been released along with the regions, for example, Targon.. As a former Hearthstone & MtG refugee, I am amazed that this game has combined the best elements of each into one amazing card game. The mana system is beautiful and elegantly designed, using a spell mana system that can carry over unused mana into the next turn (only to be used on spells rather than creatures/followers). This game is interactive and competitive, but still casual friendly. It's casual friendly because the business model makes it easy to gain all the cards for FREE within a few months of play (I play casually, took about 4 months). However, the games are intense, with room for so much counterplay, giving you a feeling that each of your choices either win or lose you the game. This can be stressful for some. The best part is that the game has a very, very diverse meta and set of archetypes. There are so many good decks to play (current meta has something like 15 tier 1 decks). Finally, they release cards at least every 2 months, which can really shake up the meta, giving you the diversity you crave in a card game.. Nice card game I spend a lot of time for this buat never feel boring. wowwww. Never thought a card game could be so friendly to users who doesn't want to play. The cards looks amazing and are even better designed. There has been a few problems with balancing, but has always been fixed shortly after. If you are a fan of card games and league of legends then this is a must play. The lowered score is for them selling out their lore friendly cards integrity for k-pop (I'm not kidding). really horrible, a game has to be fun, not a frustrating job , when everything comes down to winning, investing hours, money and looking at the best decks on the internet. a game made without passion just another business attempt. This game is amazing! Great artwork and endearing themes. The strategy will get you hooked in an instant.. Having a fun to play CCG, with great balancing, you can go 100% F2P is really the top selling point for me.. Game is for sure the best card game, who can really make peoplete compete.. 0 rng and a good economy for having new competitive decks.. One critic earlier mention those below and i agree with him mainly on these points. Game is also very cheap to play without huge p2w mechanics as of this time of saying with that being said however, Music and Art is great as with all of Riot Game's work. Mana-efficiency of cards is all over the place. Some cards have OP stats with their mana while some other cards have terrible cost. You have for example, a 7 mana 3/7 that draws you miss fortune but gets removed by one culling strike at 3 mana, On the other hand, you get a 2 mana 5/1 that can challenge a 5 mana unit and even some 6 mana ones. Due to this and slightly powercreep cards coupled with game RNG like nab can be a huge deciding factor on who win and lose. AFK behavior is basically a punishment for the active player, instead of the other way around. Bugs and glitches as far the eye can see. Reporting those bugs and glitches to them only get them to acknowledge it but doesn't fix it. Lackluster missions and points for winning matches. Even worse: the more you play, the less points you'll get over time. It is the first game I have encountered, that punishes active play. And thats their MMR system very nonsensical.. I recently started playing Hearthstone until i realised after a short while the matchmaking was completely fixed and no matter what you did climbing ranked is next to impossible unless you spend money, so i uninstalled. Then i started playing LOR and guess what the exact same thing. Gaming has died, the game developers of this world are greedy and corrupt just like the rest of it.. Solid mechanics, nice art style and card balance is fairly ok. Without the 1 major cons it would be a 8/10. HOWEVER the 20 hp that the players have is JUST NOT ENOUGH in my opinion. Why make expensive, decks (why buy or grind), when you can just go ""Noxus"" / ""anything else"" but i recommend ""Ionia"" to just go ""face aka. Nexus, and win in sometimes 3, usually 4-6, and at most 8 turns!? Ofc. you can go meta Heimerdinger/Vi or something similar, but again...WHATS THE POINT?! Because of this kinda game breaking thing (easy to fix, yet still isn't: Nexus hp 20 -> 30) its VERY CHEESE, very EASY to dominate casual players and to grind up EVERYTHING in 2 weeks (inc. Bildgewater). So yea after 2 weeks i'm left with: ok, what now? NOTHING really. So w8 for next big updates / uninstall, that's it. PS: If you play anything else, it will take you MONTHS to get everything. Some of my friends stopped playing it all together after 2 weeks because ""its too grindy"" / ""too slow to progress"". When I told them and showed them my method, they were like "" F OFF!!!"". Some came back and finished their grind in a few days, some swore to never touch this game again EVER! In either case, you MIGHT have a solid 2 weeks of fun (by that i mean Strategically and tactically go ONLY Face/Nexus like a totally skilled player. Units live or die? Doesn't matter! Amount of cards in hand and/or deck? Doesn't matter! Mana cost/efficiency? Doesn't matter, only playing with cheap BS units and everything comes on curve 97.50% of the time! Leveling up Hero units? Doesnt matter, if it lives or dies! Strategy, positioning, synergy, tactics? DOESN'T F-ING MATTER!!! FACE FACE FAAAAACE like a total moron. Aaand it actually WORKS XD). Would usually rank it higher for that fact alone, that I had 2 weeks worth of fun, but we are talking about a company that has a lil. bit of che ching ($$$), so nope. League of Legends wanst made to last 2 weeks. I mean COME ON someone rewrite the 2 to a 3 (20 -> 30), if its mixed up! is it THAT HARD? Yes it is :) 3/10 THREE/TEN. Solid and polished enough card battler that does a good amount to distinguish itself from Hearthstone and other CCG/TCG of years past. Not sure if it feels like it came out 3-4 years late, or if it's ultimately better off for having waited for the digital card game fad to die down a bit.. Definitely the best CCG game out there. The economy is really generous and the mana system does not punish you for not developing units on the first and second turn since you have spell mana.. Beautiful card game, stunning effects, great voice over and thematic game play. This reminds me of Duelyst but with less pay to win and less grinding. The downsides are minimal rewards for ranked games and periodical game modes, as well as bugs that freeze my client every time I hop into the game. Hope to be fixed soon!. Another pay to win card game in the same vein as Hearthstone and Gwent. If you like Hearthstone but would rather play a card game set in the League of Legends universe then this game is worth checking out. Be forewarned though, just as with Hearthstone, you'll either have to spend a lot of money up front or spend a copious amount of time playing the game over the coming months to be able to build a competitive deck. Matchmaking is abysmal and deck balance doesn't exist. The game seems generous at first with rewards, but you quickly learn that the rewards aren't the powerful cards you really need to compete. And if you decide you do want to spend money, then I hope you have plenty of cash to burn because it will cost quite a bit to build a competitive deck or two with how the shop is structured. Card balance and mana costs need a lot of tuning, which is surprising since I would have assumed they would have gotten this more balanced before going live. Some champions are absolutely broken, Tryndemere springs to mind. He's insanely powerful and once he's on the field it's a guaranteed win. Doesn't require any set up or intricate card combinations to pull off, just play him and you win 95% of the time. That's not well balanced, and that's just one example. Stay away from this game unless you plan on spending a lot of money, or don't plan on having a competitive deck for several months, because it will take at least that long to build with the reward system currently in place. Riot also employs Bots in ranked play.. Hi, this is coming from a League of Legends player and a HearthStone player. This game is not awful as it still has room to improve but right now the game is unhealthy. The balance of the strength of cards is vast. However, the game is still new, so balance patches can still save the game before its too late.. They finally did it. They copied heartstone formula to fix outcome of games. I have seen since last patch (never once before last patch) 90% of my games with stuff coming out that is 1 chance in 100000300403002020. Pathetic. Skill is no longer relevant. Lets aim to make everyone as close as 50% winrate as possible. What a joke. it was pretty obvious this was happening in HS and hard to debate that they could do it after certain cards allowing you to fetch the ""perfect"" card were **** holy smokes is it even more obvious in this game with 40 card decks. Player tossing 90% of his deck in the first 3 turns but somehow not only started with all the toss cards but managed to not toss any of his combo finishers and good cards. Its astonishing that I had literally 2 copy paste games where the opponent drew exactly the same thing, played the same cards, tossed the same cards and ended the game the same way with the same cards. Astronomical odds of happening....happening in 2 of my last 6 games. lol. You got more chances to get hit by a meteor particle in the left eye and develop an eye infection that attracts a lightning bolt generated by a anormal electro magnetic field due to 2 planes colliding with a fire truck in the sky. disgusting how they all ruin games in the sake of making bad players feel like they are good 50% of the time to drive mtx. This game WAS so good. They ruined it. Not mentionning that you may as well make a net deck now because 99.9% of decks you will play against are the same 3-5 decks.. Extremely fun, zero absurd rng, beautiful card design, tons of unique and fun mechanics, lot of content, pretty good meta (very easy to climb in the ladder with no-meta decks), the developers listen to the community, the most f2p friendly game in the genre (I can craft 2 meta decks per week being 100% f2p). A really really good game with a very bright future. Tons of new cards are coming, along with new game modes and events. The game is constantly improving, with gameplay improvements and balance changes every month. My favorite CCG game to date, Magic being the second one. Hearthstone is **** trash compared to LOR.. Well done riot. You managed to beat the titan that Heartstone was. You provided a solid yet unique experience. Really great idea to fit it into the same universe riot was working on in past years, it works perfectly. One of many arguments I see is the argument of meta being too narrow, I agree with these statements but at the same time I understand that this problem is in almost every card game, true og heartstone players will probably remember Y'shaarj deck. So in my opinion, when it comes to runeterra's brotheren this game is relatively balanced. The only - I see is the heavy grinding. From beta they did come a long way of making it easier to gain new cards but it still feels like new players are forced to play 1 of 3 decks over and over again for about 2 weeks at least in order to gain enough cards to make their own. Other then that, I see this game as a good title in the TCG department, let's see where it goes.. Nice game, good art, for me the best card game i had played and its worth the time if you are one of those competitive players. With the rewards you can have a lot of cards, but its a little slow because you need to invest some time to get the cards. i have played the beta a few days and when it was out i played almost everyday and i can say that with 2 o 3 months you can have almost all the card if you do the daily mission and if you win like 3-5 match per day. (i have like 95-97% of the cards including the ones in the last expansion (rising tides) The game still need some bug fixes because there are a few that are annoying and only 1 bug make me lose in one match, it was patched later. but some of the little annoying bugs are still there, so it needs polish and a some new mecanics that could make this a better game.. I do not know much English and therefore translate from Google. I put 4 out of 10 developers on the aspects that the game deserves a month after the release, let's go through them. When the game was released, a wild fall of the servers began, the loss of the donation currency - support scripts - which responds quickly, but does not help properly. Since the game is still open-beta testing very poorly, constant crashes, relapses into the game. Then we go to the system of avatars and other favorite things that players love, avatars are broken - the patch was fixed, but still they bug every other time, we take bugs which still doubled with the release. We follow the meta - patch balance in the CCI once a month. We still have a lot of work to do, well, while the game still looks like in the developers, there are already many promises and so far few people believe in it and everyone is waiting. They are great guys and all that - the gorgeous game I play - but still the quality of the product is at a very low level because it was made at Unity. I’ll summarize the results of 2020 - if all the shortcomings are removed I will give it a better grade, but for now it’s 4-5 out of 10, no more, because I’m not playing the Riot project, but the indie studio project.. The Art and the music is beautiful and it really makes the game play fun, also de cosmetic changes the music background, that is a really nice touch. The balance overall is pretty fine, obviously there is always the annoying card but that is always prevalent in any card game, right know there is the most diverse meta game that has ever been in all runeterra. Every single faction has his way in the top tier list, a lot of different archetypes to have fun with and most importantly TO WIN WITH. The balance team is super accurate, always know what and how to change it The communication with the community is awesome and for last instance is TOTALLY F2P FRIENDLY, I have been f2p since beta and right know I have every single champion and almost any card in the game, in 3 weeks maximum you will complete at least 1 competitive deck but that's only if you want to build to complete different decks with different champions. Overall a fantastic game for F2P players that want to enjoy a fun and balance Card Game. The negative critics from user reviews are really lame,offensive and lack any kind of objective review. The game is frustrating, unplayable, unbalanced, mechanics that should not exist, cards that should not be created at all, bugged, I should write a separate review about this funny matchmaking, always choose the most expensive cards from the deck, no matter that you have a deck filled to the brim with cheap **** always will you choose what you don't need, and your opponent always say, always has what he needs, how the **** do I ask? Errors that often lead to your defeat, and do not write about the mistakes you make, but about those ****ing bugs that make the opponent's unit invisible from the beginning of the game, or the graphics of the unit that you got rid of 5 games ago! the glow that hits your eyes from some cards is so bright that half the screen is invisible, so you can't play unless you get rid of the cards from the hand that is responsible for it. I play from the beta and I think it will stop, I can't stand this carousel of frustration, first Elusive, then Burn Aggro, now Unyielding Spirit, Rito, get down to work and you don't promise a pear on a willow, first fix it and then add content because I'm ****ing it can't be played, I know that I wrote a lot of bad things, probably most of what I wrote here happened only to me, but seriously the **** like me can't win even 1 game per hour what is to be said by a new player who is delighted with the positive reviews will come to LoR and will get after all this, **** up on the farm to collect cucumbers and not the ****ing cards. If you've read it to the end, then good luck on your journey through the dung heap called Legends of Runeterra.. The best new card game in a long while. If you're tired of HS/MTG/others, this is the game Artifact was supposed to be.. A great game to play with friends. This format takes trading card games on PC to a new level, and I cannot find anything to criticize; it does not use the 'pay to win' formula, unlike a lot of card games for PC today, and if you are a League of Legends player, it crosses over great. would recommend, but it is very addictive. Really beautiful game, and really impressive universe! the game economy is very good, easy way to get cards.. Game is pretty but gameplay wise its one of the worst games developed,the decision made for some cards are so unhealthy for the game, not fun to play and not fun to play against.. Very F2P friendly, very new player friendly, BUT also very skill expressive. Uses the digital aspect perfectly. Easily beats Hearthstone and I like it more then MtG and Gwent.. Ftp friendly like no other, and way more fun than I ever expected. Definitely the best mobile ccg I've played.. Too beginner friendly and holds your hand wayy too much. Plus poro **** at being cute.. To start, Legends of Runeterra is a pretty good game all things considered. Its in game economy is cheap and you win a really good amount of stuff via weekend vaults, quests, expeditions, and region loot. The interface is gorgeous. The base mechanics of the game are reallygood and require a lot of thought. However, this game is an absolute nightmare when it comes to competitive play. The meta right now is entirely RNG and your success will come down to if you win or lose the dice roll, if you open well (bc if you dont you just lose bc it snowballs out of your control), and if you dont come up against an auto loss matchup, which there are many for many decks. LoR is a game with a bright future, but riot needs to iron out some things before i can say id recommend it. Really beautiful game, and really impressive universe! the game economy is very good, easy way to get cards.. Game is really beautiful and feels really good to play as expected from riot and i quite enjoyed the tutorial section which is really showing you all the different mechanics of the game. However this game really needs to be more balanced, and not by just adding more cards to outperform the previously op ones. Then i'm also quite disappointed by the way you get cards, you can get a lot of cards early in the game just by following the tutorials but they're just basic cards. If you really want good cards you have to level up all the different factions, and doing so takes a long time and you will most likely end up against player you won't be able to counter because of the balance problem mixed with your lack of cards. I would also mention that i was expecting a better shop to get cards. Getting the rarity you want is a thing, but the cost is ridiculous for only one random card. TL;DR Game is beautiful, as of today i only came across one bug but i think it is only on it's way to becoming a cool card game but i hope Riot finds a way to fix it as a card game should be and not as League of Legends is fixed.. I really cant think of any flaw this game has: Economy : Well i managed to get all the cards through the beta stage without paying a $ and not only that but i collected enough resources to start the new expansion with many of the new cards. All these just by gaining 3-7 victories/ day and doing my quests. The conclusions are yours Art: The art is simply great and not only that but you can have many interactions between the different cards, so many that you might actually discover a new one every day Gameplay: The gameplay combines hs simple mana system with MtG s creativity and strategy while adding some important new things of its own like the champion cards, spell mana and of course the the whole ''respond'' thing each turn (if you play you ll get what i mean). Deckbuilding: There are trully many and different ways to build your decks, the meta (at least in beta stage) is everlasting changing and the generous economy of the game makes it so that you can always try new stuff you might consider you like. I m giving this game a 10/10 and no, i m not overreacting. I really enjoy the Universe Riot Games created with their main game League of Legends. Which is why I tried staying positive about any flaw I found while playing in both closed and open Beta. Sadly, they remain untouched. Here is my honest view on the game after putting in dozens of hours: Music and Art is great as with all of Riot Game's work. And just as such, the game-play itself is lackluster. It fixes many issues other games in the same genre have, while adding a lot more. Mana-efficiency of cards is all over the place. Region limitation handicaps creative decks and makes matches very predictable (if not boring) once you have gotten enough experience. AFK behavior is basically a punishment for the active player, instead of the other way around. Balancing issues haven't been touched since the closed beta. Instead, they added more cards to then ignore balancing again. (Which I should have expected from this company). Bugs and glitches as far the eye can see. Lackluster missions and points for winning matches. Even worse: the more you play, the less points you'll get over time. It is the first game I have encountered, that punishes active play. Summing up all of the above, I couldn't be more disapointed by a game so proudly labeled to have a fix for other card game issues. How about instead of fixing their problems, you fix your own first, Riot?. I like artworks and that I can see any card image full-screen, it's really cool! Very good app quality — works fast from any device, UX is better than in other collectible card games. Difficulty between MTG and Heartstone. Mechanics not so interesting for me compare to Magic:The gathering, but i like lore and amazing animated movies about it. Game and lore looks very fresh and original, that's why I will continue to play and recommend to my friends","the only good thing is the lore, gameplay wise it is **** . the only con is that it is not at all beginner friendly . it is a solid F2P card game with great presentation and a solid progression ."
702.Pokemon Sun,"This was a horrible generation. The only saving grace looking back as that this was the last game before Dexit. Would have reviewed lower at time of release but gen 8 was so bad it makes 7 look a little better.. The only good thing about this game was some of the new Pokemon in the Pokedex were cool. Getting rid of regular Gym battles which is basically what the Pokemon games have built themselves on is such a daft move on the developers part, these trials were some of the lamest gameplay I've had the displeasure of facing. Skip this one & play a better Shin Megami Tensei Clone. (the first monster catcher game, for any youngin who doesn't get that reference). A welcome refresh in the series! Good story, amazing dex, and a better battle facility than XY. Although it has a terrible pacing, sometimes is so much explanation for intuitive things that fells like the game thinks that children (the target audience) is all dump.. This game had so much potential but there are some problems.Lets start with the good:The island trials is a fun new idea. The 4 Islands instead of a big region, They fixed the problem with gen 6 gym leaders not having a 3d model in battle. The story is pretty good in this game **** problems: There are not enough island trials, 7 types dont have trial. Poni Island is horrible. And this game is too handholdy. This game started the overuse of cutscenes and black screens and lazy hallways but this isnt the worst of it. There are too many lazy and bad cutscenes. 6/10. For me, the best main story of the saga, with what is possibly the region with the most personality and with an excellently designed pokedex and initials, to this day such a good pokemon game has not been made again, perhaps the map It is somewhat linear in the way you progress, which is a throwback to Unova and Sinnoh, even so the progress is enjoyable and has acceptable difficulty peaks for a Pokémon, for me the best game in the main saga to date. The game runs well and very fluid but the same problem occurs as in Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu, which is that every 2 seconds a battle appears, which is quite annoying when you want to advance in the story and continue discovering the cities. Otherwise it is a great game, I have very nice memories of when I played, since I was little, although I had it until I was 12 years old. If you like Pokemon and you have a Nintendo 3DS it is a must for your game collection.. This game does have some great elements but they are slaughtered by inhumanely slow pacing and annoying characters.. Generally, a very enjoyable game. The story line is very engaging and no battle is too hard, but it can be very difficult to figure out what you want to do during the post game. I had to look up a checklist.. slow and boring at first and does not end strong, not that interesting of a plotline either #SavesSoil. This game is the definition of below average. First of all,I'd like to say that Nintendo made a fatal mistake by just developing the game on the switch and not the 3ds, as the console lacks with the performance. The game would've looked so much better on the Switch. Gameplaywise, this game feels like a step back from Pokemon OrAs. The story is just boring and forgettable and the gameplay feels so slow and boring. From a not Pokemon like World to putting away the Mega-evolutions. Gamefreak has put in some fatal design choices and this game has just no replayabilityvalue. Its sad to see that thereslittle to nothing to do after you've completed the story.. The Alola region looks cool, but is pretty bland and empty besides the pretty decent new Pokémon. The amount of cutscenes this game has takes any enjoyment I had with the story and trashes it.. Loads of nostalgia because it was the first Pokemon game I played. I loved the story and characters.. Best game on 3ds. Extremely Mediocore.. Pokemon Sun (Generation 7) is the second best Pokemon Game of the 3D era. Replacing the HMs was an important step, removing the Arenas for a fresh new method was also necessary. Some of the Totem and Kahuna Battles were really difficult. This was especially good after X and Y were so so easy. I'm also a huge fan of the story: Lilly, Lusamine, Gladion, Bromley and Kukui are really interesting and well designed characters. Most of the side characters were good too, but I wanna exclude Hau here cause he's annoying af imo. There is one huge problem with the story and the first Island though: The amount of unnecessary and unskippable cutszenes. I don't really know why GF did that. I like most of the Pokemon Designs and the OST is just so so good (Top 3 Pokemon OST imo). Rating: 88. Many road blocks annoyed me, but the worst were the hints that led you anywhere you had to go. No exploring, no thinking, just following the ""!"". I'm not going to lie, I'm not the biggest Pokemon fan. A lot of Pokemon games have a great concept but fall very flat in execution, the best Pokemon games are ok while the worst ones (aka 90% of the Switch releases) are abysmal. 'Pokemon Sun & Moon' was the biggest exception. The gameplay, whole functional, is not too different from the other games. although I have things that are worth praise: 1. Z moves working for everyone: the idea of Megas only working for specific pokemon (and none of the generation it was supposed to represent) was nonsense and limited a potentially great gimmick. Z moves are more limited than Megas in concept, but they are executed much better. 2. Totem battles: finally no more triple battle luck fest, totem battles are much more skilled are require more strategy rather than just spamming your best moves. The plot is the best in the series by a wide, and I mean WIDE margin. Besides having the best world building in the series, the main characters are fleshed out, develop on screen (can't say the same for the previous gens) and are more grounded overall. Lusamine is the best villain in the franchise and the most well written character: a crazy woman who went insane after losing her husband and started loving Ultra Creatures more than her own children to the point she wanted to reach their universe and merge with them. The Pokemon is the best generation yet. all 3 starters have great design and ooze with personality (especially Incineroar) and some of the best Pokemon like Mimikyu and Tsareena. There's barely any bad Pokemon at all. The cutscenes, often criticized for being ""awful"" even though they're nothing atrocious that other games didn't do, help the game to feel more immersive and visually interesting than chibi sprites that barely move. This game was a great experience.. I cannot believe these people at game freak actually thought that ditching the very successful mega evolutions and replace it with z moves. I mean it isint BAD but what the heck. mediocre boring game riddled with unskippable cutscenes and useless tutorials which fans of the franchise would've rather skipped. (imo) worst designed mons of the bunch, forgettable rival team, only redeemable qualitiies is a change of the original formula which was ditched for the next entry, and the rise in difficulty. probably the worst entry of the franchise on the 3ds.. The first game to finally remove gyms and let me have a different journey for a change.. Best 3d pokemon game with great story cool new mons and a national dex and without hms. Finally a Pokemon game that doesn't look like a recycle of the previous one, the graphic change and that it no longer has a gym is a change that comes in handy, although it still has simple stories. The best thing that the franchise could have in all its years was to change the MO movements for mounts speeding up the game and your Pokemon team.. This is just the same as Pokémon has been for years. The last decent games were omega ruby and alpha sapphire. After that, just mediocre. It's a shame as well as it is based in England (my home country). There's is a little bit of fun here, but the majority of the exploring in this game is boring. I got to admit that running around on Taurus is pretty damn fun. it's a shame that you can't use him all the time, because traversing normally is boring. The Z crystals power moves were a nice touch, but definitely not enough to redeem the game. And honestly, some of these Pokémon have stupid or bad names.. Not really sure why this has such high ratings, everything about it is simplistic and just low effort. The soundtrack is forgettable, the dialog is bad at best. The battle system is about as basic as rock paper scissors types of games can be, and even worst it's 1v1 battles. I'll keep it short and stop here.. This game has an amazing story, great character development, and one of the best worlds a Pokémon game has had in a while. Although the game may not seem as much at first, It gets Better and Better as you progress. The new battle animations and styles are so wonderful that sometimes I walk into battles just to see the animations. If you have a 3DS, you must try it out!. It's a great Pokémon game but compared to other games, or even RPG's it's slightly above average. It's nice to see they tried new ideas in this installment.. This game is an amazing Pokémon game. The graphics are great, but when they zoom in on the faces, you can see the pixels. An overall amazing game, but why did they get rid of the gyms?! I wish they didn't redesign all the Pokémon they did, but it's a great game for anyone who likes Pokémon, and I would argue that it's one of the best games to introduce someone to the series. I also really love how they brought back past characters like Dexio, Sina, Red and Blue.. One of the most original and brave entries in the Pokemon franchise, I see why some fans dont like it since its not a traditional pokemon game. Its game decisions are brave and work surprisingly well, its a unique twist from a pokemon mainline game almost being like a more developed spinoff. With all of that in mind I think its by far the best one from the 3DS era and also one of the better pokemon games.. The game is very nostalgic and almost perfect, the only Thing i've got to say is that the cutscenes are a bit long. The New exclusive Pokémon are great and you can Transfer pokemon with Pokémon Bank.. Pokémon SM are good step ups from XY, but nowehere close to being the best games in the series for me. Alola is beautiful, but far too linear and corridor like, lacking the exploration the series once had. The story is pretty good actually and fun. New Pokémon are pretty good, except those awful Ultra Beasts. Music is ok too. Z Moves are fine i guess, but no replacement fpr Mega Evolution. Regional Variants are a fantastic addition, completely wasted beacuse they are used exclusivly on Gen 1 Pokémon, what a waste. This is also a massive issue with these games. The ludicrous pandering to Generation 1 and Kanto is beyond annoying. I get it, ok?! First Generation that started it all, blah, blah, BLAH! The games are also too handholdy.. An excellent game of the few Pokemon I've played. Story (10/10) Characters (9/10) Soundtrack (10/10) Graphics ( 8/10) It's a 3DS. 75/100 Very good Pokémon game. It's somehow overlooked these days because it hasn't Gyms, but it can make you feel like in a journey anyway. PS: Alola is a stunning region. very underappreciated entry, pushing more into jrpg territory with proper story and characters was a good direction for the franchise.. One of the best generations by far, it has a spectacular story and an excellent competitive scene.. Haven't saw much improvement from Pokemon X and Y. Models are pretty all the same. Z-Moves were a huge downgrade from Mega Evolutions. Removing gyms from the game was dumb. With every new Pokemon game, the difficulty of the games are easier and easier. The new Pokemon on the other hand were great. Story in my opinion was a bit more interesting then it was in X and Y. 7/10 Good.. I think this is a really good game, but i dont know, there is something that makes me not enjoy it as other pokemon, i dont like alola as a region at all, the astethic gets repetitive but i dont know, its basic pokemon , the same gameplay with some tweaks, the graphics ook pretty good for a 3ds game, and the world is really big, the story its kinda bad, i dont remember almost anything of it, the characters are forgettable and uninteresting, and the villians are the worst in the franchise, but i think overral its an ok game but just not a great pokemon. The best Pokémon game in the franchise for now. Story is good (the best one for now, with even some little interesting plot twists for the first time), difficulty and level curve is great (and even kinda hard in some parts!), characters are charismatic and less flat than previous generations, music is outstanding (as always), Pokémon designs are great, there are kind of boss battles, real side-quest, is a bit innovative for the first time in forever... This has to be the best Pokémon game to date. It was definitely the step in the right direction, but then they came with Sword and Shield.... Decent game that changes the Pokemon formula. Definetely recommended. Juego decente que cambia la formula de Pokemon. Recomendado.. pretty good game i enjoyed it but i wish their was more gym leaders but still great game.. z moves are really **** the story is **** garbage. the box legendaries are boring. the game is really easy, its not fun, its just boring. I think this is a very good Pokemon game. Not as great as some of the other ones, but it’s one of the best ones in years. The removal of gyms is fine, but it has some great music. I think this game’s worth a shot, even if its dead easy.. While the graphics look much better than ever and the characters are great, I see the road for future pokemon games not much promising. I've never liked the concept of mega evolution, which was introduced in X and Y, and the concept of z-moves introduced in this game didn't get me interested either. It is also clear that Game Freak has run out of ideas on creating more unique pokemon as they have started reskinning the previous pokemon from past gens. Which the battle system is still turn-based and solid, the game has also gone much easier than ever. Pokemon in general needs a difficulty option, for those who want to be challenged as these games become easier and easier.. WAY to many custcenes to start this game. Pokemon is supposed to be about getting thrust into this beautiful interesting world and being left to your own devices to explore as much as you want. The first 3 hours has over an hour of cutscenes and some of them end only for the player to walk 2 steps (i actually have counted several times) and enter another cutscene. The cutscenes have two ranges aswell: 1 boring, unnecessary story that is not needed or desired, AND 2 unskipable tutorials that didnt need to be explained to 6 year old me but apparently need to be explained in depth now. I get this game is built for children but when red and blue came out i was a little kid and I had lots of friends who played these games as well as myself and we got along just fine. Gameplay and battling is actually worse since X&Y because they added in wild pokemon can now call for help meaning if you do not attack first or one shot the wild encounter pokemon you may have to fight several more, because they can call more than just one per battle. Also for some reason most of what the player will random encounter is gen 1 and gen 2 pokemon, and not even the alolan form ones. I saw at least 50 zubats, and 25 spearow in one two hour session at one point. I buy a new game that they could put in over 800 pokemon and 3 out of 5 encounters are from the first 50 of the Kanto Dex? are you kidding? Gamefreak apparently forgot what makes pokemon games fun, cuz this game is bad, especially by their standards.. Only Pokémon game I can't stand playing, it holds your hand way to much and Rotom Pokédex is so annoying, completed it once and never again which is a shame as every other main series Pokémon games have re play ability.. Worst story Worst Legends Worst villains Worst gameplay No gyms NO CHAMPION??? It's the WORST pokemon game to exist, worst than XY & RSE. It doesn't play like a pokemon game. In fact, it's more like a fan game than anything. Thank god Sword/Shield saved the day and retained the old gameplay than the trash new one. Anyone that liked SM over SwSh are piece of trash that doesn't exist. Matter of fact, they're not real pokemon fans.. I swear this game was written by someone that wanted to annoy and frustrate as many gamers as possible. After beating the game it literally won't let you save for like a hour... wtf?. The character models have been improved from X&Y and ORAS. the new pokemons are great and the Alolan versions are a nice addition. There is a good amount of post game content in the form of catching all of the Ultra Beasts.. Too much dialogue and exposition. Alolan forms are a great innovation for the series.. Wow, what an adventure! This game brought a lot of fresh hair into the Pokémon franchise; interesting story, memorable characters and awesome new features. Still enjoying it nowadays :). Got the game upon release, very excited since I wasn't invested in Y or Omega Ruby. It truly did not disappoint, the Pokemon, the music, the story, I had a much better time than previous titles. While the game did lag out offline, it wasn't too much of an issue. Easily one of the best 3DS Pokemon titles.. Metacritic should not allow people to review bombing games like this, last week this game had a 8.3 score and now it's just 7.7 because of Sword and Shield haters. STOP.. Pokemon Sun and Moon are... Decent. If you can get through the horrendously slow first few hours of the game. The best part of the games were, unquestionably, the totem battles. They added an exciting element to the game, and were actually fairly challenging if you're not prepared. The Island Challenge itself is an interesting alternative to the Gym Challenges, as well. The removal of HMs in favor of Pokeride was also a plus, and helped make the world feel a lot more alive and interesting. Additionally, introducing regional variants of old Pokemon was one of the best decisions the series could have made. So what's the problem? For one, as mentioned, the first few hours are infuriatingly slow. And the rest of the game is littered with sections where characters will just stop you to talk for no reason. Not to mention there's not a lot to do once you've finished the main game. You can catch the Ultra Beasts, challenge the Battle Tree, or go online and that's about it. Additionally, the removal of Triple and Rotation battle styles was a big loss for me, personally. I may have been the only one, but I actually really enjoyed those styles. Overall, it's not a bad game, but a flawed one. Stick with US/UM, it's the more complete version.. Some people hating on Sword and Shield is coming here to hate this game too. But let's remember and compare Sun and Moon to SWSH. Because Sun and Moon is far less hand holdy than Sword and Shield, because the story is the best Pokémon has made so far, because this game allowed you to turn off the exp share and enjoy a good difficulty, because this game had much more postgame, because this game had all the Pokémon... Well... Sun and Moon are one of the best game of this franchise, let's not forget that. This game is underrated just because is not old enough yet.. I first played Pokemon Blue aged 10 and I've played every game since then. This was the first pokemon game I've ever disliked. I found it a chore to get through this game, which is a shame given the potential it had. My biggest qualm with it was the hand-holdy nature. I felt like I couldn't walk a few steps without being accosted by a 5 minute cutscene. I wanted to go on an adventure, but instead I was led around by every character in the game, forced to go where they wanted me to go and do what they wanted me to do. The game is incredibly easy. Every trainer seems to only have one pokemon, so rather than each fight being fun and challenging, it's more of an annoyance. Even your rivals and enemies have underwhelming teams. Nothing was ever challenging and after each battle I was told how incredible I was. It all felt very patronising. There's a half hour, unskippable cutscene at the end of the game. However, every now and then you're required to press A to keep it going, so you can't even leave it to play out on its own. Last but not least, a majority of the pokemon designs just don't feel like pokemon. And I'm someone who's liked most pokemon up until now. The final starter evolutions feel more like character designs than species designs. Incineroar is great as a Smash character, but I can't imagine one in the wild interacting with other creatures. As someone who's worked in game design for ten years, it's easy to spot lazy creature design and the failure to keep the creatures looking like they're part of the same world is saddening. In the past, pokemon designs were kept consistant by a few variations in eye design and a mostly natural colour palette. Today, every single species seems to have a different type of eye and the colours are all bright and unnatural. That's not to say a design should never have an interesting colour on it or a new eye type, but when every creature is completely different in style, it clangs. Also, most pokemon seem to evolve by becoming bipedal now. Some evolve by growing facial hair or wearing human clothes. It feels like the designers have lost sight of the original idea of 'evolution' and stepped more into what they think would look cool. That said, almost all of them are good designs, they just don't look like a believable ecosystem of creatures. On a positive note, some parts of the game are enjoyable. The photography minigame was fun (if a bit underwhelming) and a lot of the locations were nice. The general storyline was good, even if it was incredibly poorly executed. I'd say this game was definitely more bad than 'okay' though. It's one of the worst games I've ever played, not to mention the worst pokemon game. I'm baffled by the good scores it has gotten but to each their own I guess.. a great pokemon game with a great story, and not a single pokemon had to be cut.. Too much handholding. The routes are too simple. The franchise continues to decline here.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokémon Sun was one of my most anticipated releases in the series. Prior to release, it looked fresh and new. There was a new gym system, new formes of beloved Pokémon from past generations, and a new gym system. Then, I played it. The game kicked off with an unskippable cutscene and plenty of hand-holding. In fact, my first day with the game was an arduous slog through tutorials in an attempt to play a Pokémon game. By the time I **** out the other side, my interest in the game lay flat on the boardwalk of an uninspired town with way too much water and way too little to do. The rivals were easy, and the gyms weren't a challenge either. By the time I got to the end, I just wanted it over and done with. I felt this game drain my love for the series. It lacked the charm of older games. The fires of exploration and curiosity were quickly snuffed out by unnecessary hand-holding. On the positive side, there were some cool wrestling references, and Team Skull's leader was a solid battle. In fact, he was one of the most interesting characters in the game. The streamlining of HM moves into new abilities meant I could focus on building a formidable party without any weak spots. Even with these improvements, sadly, the positives don't begin to outdo the negatives. First impressions lingered and I felt disengaged for much of my playthrough. As the great Ric Flair, and the professor, both day, ""to be the man, you've gotta beat the man."" This game was not The Man. If I were to put a number on this game, it's about a 5/10.. As with the other pokemon titles for the 3DS, I think Pokemon Sun and Moon are very underrated games. It was a fresh and new consept, which was very fun for a Pokemon game, Trials istead of gyms, totem pokemon, sos chaining and great new pokemon designs and an overall good story. Like the other 3DS titles there is a lot of handholding, and you`re not as free to explore the region as in previous games but it`s still a very fun game. It`s what you`d expect from a pokemon game with a twist.. Simply put, Sun and Moon are best Pokémon games that Game Freak has ever produced. Poké Pelago, the side quests, the absolutely stunning nature of the presentation, it's all a sheer joy from start to finish. Game Freak hasn't missed a beat and has managed to carefully balance the inclusion of new mechanics without totally ruining things for the most hardcore fans. It's got content coming out of its ears, a much more interesting story, and rewards exploration in a way no other title in the series has. Whether you're a Pokémon fan new or old, this is an absolutely essential purchase.. Best Pokémon game so far, this is for me the best entry Game Freak has made for the franchise in 20 years. It's amazing to see how FINALLY they innovated a bit and tried to change the formula, I know it doesn't change a lot, but change the necessary and it feels so fresh. Hope Sword and Shield do something similar and tries new things too. Pokémon Sun and Moon also has the BEST STORY in a Pokémon game ever. Black and White had good ideas, sometimes poorly executed, but Sun and Moon worked so well, developed the characters and even made some plot twists. The relationship between characters, background stories and family bonds is the best we saw in a Pokémon game so far, the mixing of every single topic the franchise has touched was excellent! And we can't forget about the difficulty, USUM made it harder, but Sun & Moon has some challenges with Totem Pokémon and a great Pokémon League, and well, we have even the Battle Tree, as the biggest postgame challenge we had since Emerald. Pokémon designs were excellent in this generation too! As I said, this is for me the best Pokémon game to date!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Music: 4/5 Game Play: 3.5/5 Graphics: 4/5 Story: 4/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall: 4.0/5. First Pokemon game I ever played. Amazing is all I have to say. I feel that Nintendo hit it out of the park with this one.. I have to say prior to playing this game, I pretty much expected the worst generation since Diamond and Pearl. Alolan Forms did not look good to me, I wasn't impressed by Z-Attacks, and overall I thought they were changing a formula that wasn't broken to begin with. Well... Those changes actually made for one of the most unique and best games. I ended up loving the trials and their captains, and the way all of their traditions worked so uniquely in this region. Some of the Alolan Forms were cute and made sense, and I ended up falling in love with Z-Moves. The story was also really enjoyable and had a lot of interesting characters you always wanted to know more about, especially Lillie. It was far from perfect, what with the awful call for help mechanic, some awkward evolutions, and the game taking a very lazy approach towards trials by the 4th island (which was a shame since they were the coolest part of the game in my opinion). But something doesn't have to be perfect to still be good.. This was the only Pokemon game that I did not finish. It was incredibly boring. It lacked any sort of a story, even for Pokemon. The Pokemon in this game also felt uninspired. Also, Z moves felt slightly pointless due to the fact that there are already mega evolutions. I did like the Alolan versions of old Pokemon, but besides that this game was by far the worst Pokemon.. This is by far the best 3DS Pokemon game. Amazing graphics for 3DS standards, best story since the original Black and White, extremely solid gameplay with some decently challenging story battles, a modest amount of legendaries, (8 of them) and game changing quality of life changes in comparison to XY and ORAS, not to mention the 60 or so new Pokemon, the removal of obnoxious HMs, faster movement speed, streamlined breeding and EV training, infinite leveling exploit, super training to max IVs for rare items, (who's collection of can be easily cheesed) and simpler ways to get shines in comparison to XY and ORAS. The only bad things I can say is the very long and slow tutorial, there being no national pokedex, and the battle tree just being another reskin of the awful battle tower from Emerald.. Pokémon Sun shakes the classic Pokémon formula up with new quality of life improvements as well as through the overall theme of the game. Alola is a unique region in that it is split up over four main islands and that it takes inspiration from Hawaii. This is reflected in the great music, designs of the equally great new Pokémon, the likeable cast of characters and even the battle interface. Catching Pokémon is as fun as it's ever been, and catching them all is a fun challenge. As there are now over 700 Pokémon, there are countless cool and interesting designs. As for the postgame, you can catch and raise more Pokémon, trade and battle online, and there are also a few cool moments after the main story is over. However, after you're done with the story, which I enjoyed thanks to the characters as well as the decent plot, there isn't loads to keep you playing, especially if you tire of the grind of finding, catching and raising new Pokémon. In particular, finding, breeding and raising battle-ready Pokémon (including hidden abilities, natures, IVs and more) for the online side of the game can be a little overwhelming but it is completely optional and is there for people who want a deeper experience. On the whole, Pokémon Sun is another great entry into the series with enough new and exciting additions to set it apart from the rest of the games.. The most ambitious pokemon game ever made: every risk they could take with the formula was taken yet: 1- almost all worked and paid off and 2- still feels like playing a pokemon game from start to finish. You have the best story with amazing themes (like the context of tradition and progress) a region that feels like a real world country with background that makes sense, characters with layers from both good and bad side, a new system instead of just more gyms just for the sake of it, a heartwarming conclusion, and smart ideas that honestly should be implemented 20 years ago.. By far the best installment int the main series. It did change up a lot of the formula like the bike for ride pokemon, gyms and gym badges for trials and Z-Crystals, and probably a lot more that I forgot. The graphics got better and the soundtrack is the second best imo in the Pokemon series, next to the og Mystery Dungeon.. A vibrant region, customization of your character, cool new Pokemon added and a near perfect game, apart from some minor issues with frame rates.. - best story in the series - z-moves were a good idea - Alola has many interesting quests and the trials were way more interesting than gyms, specially the idea of a totem boss with buffs and aides. Such a good story and so many new things added, it felt like a long time coming for this adorable game, specially loved the whole idea of ultra beasts. Best Pokémon game ever. Best graphics, innovation and a challenging story mode. The trials were a nice way to do something new but the gyms were better. The new Pokmeon designs are beautiful.. Incredible, good story, the kind I expected from other jrpgs but for pokemon was a first as previous games never got there. Gameplay dynamic and full of places to discover, quests to figure out and pokemon to find, anything that other pokemon games did, was done again as well or better here. Fully recomend playing it to the very end, it has some unforgettable bits. I would call this game, one o",gen 8 was so bad it makes 7 look a little better . the only good thing about this game was some of the new Pokemon in the Pokedex were cool . the game runs well and very fluid but the same problem occurs as in Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu .
703.Sins of a Solar Empire,"Sins of a solar empire is the watered down coke of Stellaris let me **** still drink watered down coke when you don't have anything better to drink, but you still prefer that crisp burn of coke. buy this game at a heavy discount and enjoy the 10+ hours you will get out of it in 2020.. Great rts strategy game. Only two downsides: One is that there is no single player campaign and the trailer made me want one, badly. The second is that multiplayer games can drag on for very, very long in a large galaxy. All the factions are well balanced, the graphics are good, and if you put the AI on insane and let it cheat beyond belief you can even pretend that it's somewhat competent.. 4X mixed with RTS hell yeah count me in. IMHO one of the best strategy games ever made. Great variety especially with mods and expansions. It just works.. Only played 20 hours I love stories and campaigns. This game got ONLY Intro story that seems very promising,, but none what so ever to follow upp, I found this game to be hard to master even at easy. First after i almost completed a eight hour game did i learn how to accelerate the speed. Its very addictive and you want to master in beginning. But as you get no story rewards, no exploration fun ect, i find it very boring I do thinks it quite strange it gotten so high rating. Yes, Sins is a simple and effective addition to the everyday gaming menu. If you have ever built something in a game and moved around units, then you can use this interface with ease. The space atmosphere is mostly provided by sound, since this game's graphics get uninteressant when played from a distant perspective (and that is most of the time). What really matters here is the gameplay, and it is solid. With add-ons there is some more variety to the course of the game and the types of winning. The AI is smart, and quick actions are crucial in advanced difficulty levels. While micro-managing large battles from a closer view is fun and nice to watch, it could cost victory because of delayed expansion. Solid gameplay, good atmosphere. Typical 8. Space bonus: 9.. Sinfully addictive! One of the best tactical games I've ever played. You can feel the clock ticking as you plan your moves, knowing the enemy might strike at any time. And the battles! Epic. Massive space fleets duking it out while you pull the strings...very satisfying.. Horrible effects like shots passing through ships and ships exploding, but you can see the ship just disappears into thin air, repettetive micro managing and then just sending your ships in to an orb with something in the middle asteroids, planets etc... They fight someone wins and repeat. There IS a lot to do, always something to upgrade or keep an eye on. But it doesn´t ever get exciting, its just a matter of how many ships and how good they are. Pour them in and wait, the graphics could have made me stick with it a lot longer but it agonizes me to watch a flak frigate with bullets flying at a 90 degree angle out of a barrel! At least make the barrels point at the targets! Worse even with big ships, beams shooting straight through the hull of the ship firing to hit something to the sides, look stupid and breaks emmersion..... I don't understand at all why anyone likes these games from **** entertainment sins of a solar empire and galactic civilizations both included. They feel like a student project and not a polished retail product, the gameplay and interfaces are so ridiculously clunky and there is never any synergy or flow to the commands. There are way too many extra wasted units and features that don't even feel like they have any use because of the abundance. More content is not always a good thing when the content is piss poor. You can't even land on any of the planets that you encounter even once you have taken them over an ""settled"" them. The only thing you can do is move along an unrealistic 2-Dimensional plane fixated in space. WHICH ISN""T EVEN HOW SPACETIME **** curves more intensely at points of greater mass. This game is a crappy version in ""Space"" of all it's Strategy/RTS predecessors that brings absolutely nothing new to the table and has a completely bland feel with no characters, story line or anything of any importance that is tangible to relate to. If you think these ridiculously terrible games are good then please look at all of the Wing Commander games and Homeworld and the years that they came out. Games that still today are even more entertaining than this completely waste of time hunk of crap. AVOID at all costs!. Just spent hours trying to defeat an easy AI, and I don't think I'll play this game again. Maybe I just **** at RTS games, but it could be much better if there's a campaign for me to really learn the game. Yet still, there are some interesting ideas in this game and I think players who are interested in RTS or space games may find it a good game, so I'll give it a 6.. 4x Space RTS? Yes please. Sins of a Solar Empire was for me a hotly anticipated game, given the potential for greatness that it showed, that is until it was released. While it was fun to play, with stunning graphics and a decent UI, it didn't really have any wow factor and it did, as some other reviewers have said, feel bland. There weren't that many ship models/types either, not to mention the fact that their designs were... unimpressive. I mean come on, capital ships are supposed to be awe-inspiring, but they weren't anything special other than they were a little bigger than normal frigates/cruisers. Although it is fun to conduct and watch massive fleet battles, I do admit. One of my biggest gripes is that there is so much potential and material for a single player campaign and yet there is none, which to me is a genuine travesty. That would have helped me (if done well enough) to get invested in the races. I understand what they wanted was for you to ""craft your own experience"" with each game, but they could have let that happen while also still providing a storyline of some kind. As for gameplay, combat is nice in that if you're more of a hands-on player it isn't too difficult (as long as you prepare properly with control groups and fleet assignments, though even without those it's not too bad) then you can control micromanage pretty easily. If you're more of a hands-off player, you can just send your fleet into the fray and watch the fireworks too. Though it could be argued that it is a little light on the strategy in that you can, if you wanted, simply build as many ships as possible and send them barreling towards your enemy that isn't really the case since I've defeated enemies with bigger fleets before using backdoor/multiple front strategies or simply by having less, but more powerful ships in a battle.. A great RTS game. Could spend hours happily managing my empire. And that's a key point. This game is fun. Very streamlined. A real time sink but an adorable one.. An excellent 4X type game. You really get the sense of massive ships blasting each other apart. Games take a very long time to play out, but if you enjoy the genre this won't matter. The graphics are decent, I really enjoy the multiple independent guns on the capitol ships. The big drawback is that there is no single player campaign.. An excellent strategy game, with great amounts of variety, especially in the upcoming Rebellion expansion. Controls take a little bit to get the hang of, but after that it's fun as can be. Only drawback is the lack of a single-player campaign, but I believe that's being worked on in the Rebellion expansion as well. The other two expansions, Entrenchment and Diplomacy, add different technologies and structures while still building on the backstory to the game itself. In place of single-player campaigns, it has multiple scenarios in varying sizes. Without a doubt a fun strategy game.. An awesome game. To be there, controlling your empire, building your ships, and aniquilating the enemy, it's just priceless. It's a shame there's no campaign in the game, but maybe for Sins of a Solar Empire 2.. How is it possible not to like this game?! Well, maybe multiplayer junkies. Epic space battles, uber campaings (sure they are technicly skirmish games, just get over it!). Who doesn't like an uber battles between multi-hundred ship super-fleets?! This game lives up to its discription. EPIC!!!. Single player game play will consist of skirmishes. You will be leading one of three possible races: TEC, Advent, or Vasari; all with their own well fleshed-out bonuses and tech trees. These tech trees are separated into Combat, Civilian, Defense, and Diplomacy if you have all three expansions; or Combat and Civilian if you have none. Your armada will include ships to fulfill every niche of combat. For anyone who looks for a game's ability to involve strategy and timing: this is your game. I'm not usually one to comment on visuals in a game but SoaSE has them in spades. Space feels massive and beautiful, like it should feel. There is a silly implemented achievement system designed to test your abilities (e.g. beating four or more Hard AIs at once and for winning a map without researching ANYTHING in the combat tree). Really I can't say enough good stuff about this game. Will be a permanent fixture in my gaming library.. The amount of depth, strategy, and amour of stuff you can do in this game is mind boggling. While the story is limited and there is no campaign, Sins offers endless hours of galactic warfare, and getting the Trinity version deepens the experience further. There is also a large modding community and an upcoming expansion on the way!. On of the best all time RTS games of all time, well designed, epic scale, graphics decent for an RTS, runs well on most PC's, been playing it for 3 years now and still enjoying it.. this is my fav game ever!!! so much fun me and 3 of my friends make maps and them play on them for hours this is our third year of having it. in in our load menus we have one game that we are still playing that has 350 hours played on it best game ever if u like strategy games then get this and pre order rebellion support **** and ironclad! so they make more of these amazing games. So glad i picked this up for pennies in the bargain bin of i would have wasted a lot more money than i did. Good: -Style -idea Bad: -Terrible AI -Too tong to play -unhelpful interface -story with no campaign (needed both or none). Another extremely addictive game, not sure which one is more addictive sins of a solar empire or galactic civilizatoions. Anyway that doesnt matter because this is a cracking game which all strategy game fans must try. FANTASTIC.. The people who gave this game a Red review clearly do not understand the Gamer looking for a game like this where you can spend countless hours making a solar system yours to control an fighting other powers to be for domination or other means of diplomacy, The Game has no DRM an you do not need to be connected to the internet to play it last time I checked, So some people are clearly talking out their butt, and need to stop reviewing games just to show they are simple minded an only thing a review matters their opinion. I can put days into large system map game play, countless HOURS! Yes it is a strategy Space game, upgrade tech trees build ships an capital ships your ships upgrade via kill / battle experience. I find the game even more intriguing when you play it on cinematic view an rid yourself of the excess lines an grids. Clearly the 22 negative reviews are people who like they said want to play Master of orion or Starcraft, So simply go do that a game does not just get 130+ positive reviews for no reason. Stop reflecting your hate for a game cause you just do not like countless endless hours of strategy based games, Who cares about a campaign the game is made for mass domination an expansion. Not some cheesy linear story that certain people MUST have in order to allow a game to be something. An TBH, If you want to say starcraft is great cause of its campaign, your simply how shall I say.... Blind.. This game kicks ass. It's pretty much a combination of Homeworld 2 and any regular 4X space empire game. You could also see it as a space version of Supreme Commander, it's goddamn epic. Like, battles with fleets of over 200 ships. Plus, there's absolutely no DRM, if you know what I mean. While I describe it as Supreme Commander in Space, Sins has a much better UI. Supreme Commander wasn't all that great IMO because the pacing was slow as hell and you had to individually upgrade all the tiny little resource poiints which really got annoying. You also do a lot of teching in Sins but it's all very easy and intuitive, without feeling like a chore. The only thing this game lacks is a singleplayer campaign with a storyline, but the open sandbox levels do an adequate job.. fun game to play every once in a while, but the thing that really kills it, is the fact that there is no story mode or single player campaign at all. this is especially important since the game has an opening sequence that seems to hint at an epic story, and then you get to the main menu and find out that theres absolutely nothing.... No story line. Battles are all the same, playing few or many planets. No strategy is needed as the player with the most and biggest ships wins. Diplomacy or culture influence is not needed. For young and mentally less develop player. More a first person shooting than strategy game. Does not even come close to Homeworld, Nexus and other space strategy games.. This game fills a void in my heart. I've always yearned for a game where you fight an intergalactic (well, in this game it's a solar system, but still) war. You manage your planets, built your fleets, conduct research, and wage war. It's a very fun and unique game. It takes place in real time but the pace is slower than most real time strategy games. The game plays unlike any other strategy game I've encountered. The biggest problem is the lack of meaningful ways to change the outcome of fleet battles. In this game the outcome is almost always determined before you engage in combat, and it basically comes down to who has the most ships. Tactics are non-existent for the most part, but the strategy is very much there. Recommended for people who like space battles and nuking planets. (Don't we all?). Amazing game. I'm still coming back to it after four years, and it still feels fresh. I honestly prefer it over Starcraft 1 or 2. The main reason is being that it seems easier to perform amazing intricate strategies, and there seems to be more of them, too. There is a lot of depth that exists in this gem, including many research areas, artifacts to give you an edge, leveling up capital ships, and establishing trade with other factions. There are more factors that play into a successful game, but it would take long to list them. The great User Interface enables the aforementioned ease of performing satisfying strategies that can result in the downfall of the enemy's homeworld, major defense center, or his/her fleet. The graphics are still pretty to look at even after four years, and are scheduled to get an improvement in an upcoming expansion pack titled Rebellion. Watching your plan unfold in beautifully rendered battles consisting of hundreds of frigates is a sight to behold. This is literally the best RTS I've ever played. --PROS-- - Great graphics - Great UI - Amazing depth --CONS-- - Very long matches. No amount of words could possibly describe how epic this game is. Play it. Get the torrent if you want. You will end up buying it. A truly spectacular creation.","""sins of a solar empire"" is a great rts strategy game . there is no single player campaign and the trailer made me want one, badly . the graphics are good, and if you put the AI on insane you can pretend that it's somewhat competent ."
704.Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit,"I went into this hoping for a fresh (albeit familiar) addition to the FNAF franchise, which I guess I did get, but it was also kind of a mixed bag of pixelated nostalgia and some genuinely frustrating gameplay elements that made me wonder if this is going to be a slow-burn like some of its predecessors when it comes to growing on me. I mean, firstly, I didn't find it scary at all. I've seen some people in other reviews here praising the horror aspects and jumpscares, so clearly this is one of those your-mileage-may-vary situations, but for me it was just... eh. Fine. Maybe I've just become desensitised after years of being hunted by animatronics, but either way this one just didn't hit the mark in that department. Plot-wise, it's the usual FNAF kind of chaos with multiple endings that generally left me a little confused more than anything approaching satisfied. That's par for the course with this series, though, and if the past games are any indication the story might start to make more sense to me as I get more context or after a few late-night deep dives into theories, so while I'm not sold on it right now I'm willing to see if it all clicks later. I have to admit, I probably would have preferred another first-person experience rather than a third-person pixel adventure -- I get that they were going for something different, and to be fair it's a refreshing take, but it just didn't feel like FNAF to me beyond the antagonist designs. I missed the claustrophobic dread that comes with being stuck in one small room, waiting for something to get you. The pixel designs are well-done; they nailed the retro look, and the animatronics' sprites are just the right mix of creepy and cool. The sound design deserves a shoutout, too -- it's atmospheric and genuinely sets the mood, even if the visuals didn't have me on edge (though I did find it a little too loud sometimes). Gameplay-wise, I wasn't a fan of the quick-time events and stealth minigames. They were repetitive, and some of them didn't make much sense for where they were placed in the game; a couple of them were also super finicky, so they ended up being more frustrating than fun. It felt more like filler than something that added to the experience. Definitely not a bad game, but not exactly what I was hoping for, either. It's got some solid points -- the pixel art and sound design stand out -- but it doesn't quite capture the FNAF essence for me beyond the familiar faces. Maybe it'll grow on me as I dig into the lore more, but right now I kind of just miss the tension and terror of the earlier pre-Security Breach games.. This game is just incredible. The game has an awesome style and the animations are really smooth. And, if you are a FNaF fan, you will love it, it has a lot of references. The only problem is that it can be really repetitive some times.. What an incredible game, fantastic story, most of the characters are very well crafted, there isn't much to complain about the game, there are some things that I believe should be in the game, but I believe that doesn't make the game better or worse.. Is a really good game is a new step for five night s at freddy s franchise in a 2D game , is increble. After a solid 6 hours in which i've gotten both the 2 and 3 stars endings, I have to say, this might just be the best game in the series,on it's own, the game is graphically beautiful, this sprite work is some of the best I've seen since TMNT Shredder's Revenge, the gameplay is great, even if it can get just a tad repetitive by the time you reach night 5, which is where the game's short length actually plays in it's favor since you don't get the time to really get burnt out unlike a game like Security Breach, I only really encountered one major bug that forced me to quit and re enter the game in which Spring Bonnie's walk cycle when hiding under a table would loop infinitely, but other than that a perfect experience, definitely recommended. Short but fun. Took me 4 hours to do the 2-star ending and the game was very fun. The style is great, and the gameplay is simple but fun. I didn't expect the goriest thing to be a dead rat at the first cutscene but the game can still be scary sometimes.. Fnaf Into the Pit is easily the best game in the entire series, leaving behind that easy horror. This game focuses on a very captivating story and gameplay that feels refreshing for the franchise. In my opinion, it’s the best Fnaf.. Horror fist pixel madness. The last parts were not scary at all, and unnecessary. But this **** can scare the **** out of me.. Although the gameplay gets boring after a while despite its duration, the quality of the story, atmosphere, sounds and drawings make the game enjoyable until the end.. It's bad, because it makes the same mistakes as the previous 4 fnaf games, it's very repetitive and thegame isn't that scary, it's just cheap jumpscares everywhere, And you cant tell me this was written by an adult, it feels more like a child wrote it, the characters are just, there.... A good game, no question. The story isn't the best, but the game looks fantastic. The controls and everything else are definitely okay, the setting is good and the jumpscares aren't 100% scary, but still not bad. The game is really creative and well designed, sound design is also great. Do you love eggs? I love eggs! Do you love cooked eggs? I love cooked eggs! Do you love raw eggs?....... oh, sorry for **** you love burnt eggs?. It was awesome with great storytelling and the terror of getting jump scared was so fun. For its story, gameplay, excellent optimization, true and creative scares, great use of characters, humor and sounds. I consider Into The Pit one of the best horror games of the year, if not the best.. a 100 from 2 critics? Is this a **** joke? This repetitive mess that has dialogue written by a child got 2 100's tf is wrong with critics these days? The ones from 1999-2013 were goats, you know what? Maybe I shouldn't be too harsh since the graphics are atleast superb. Cheap jumpscares everywhere and the writing is pretty darn awful lol, the mechanics are also kinda boring if you want ms to be honest, it's pretty decent though, just take a look at the visuals and sound for yourself, mid overall. The best game in this franchise thanks to his beautiful style, creepy ambience and lots of hidden secrets.. Notice a pattern going on? Go to school, go to the pizzeria, save a kid and try to find your dad while you're at it, get chased out of the building by springtrap, its so boring!! Everything feels the same except for on the last night, so sad how good graphics were wastes on this hilariously badly written dump. Meh, too repetitive and everything is very underutilized, writing is bad, however good graphics and sound design!. Simply the best of the entire franchise, it changes the way everyone in the franchise plays, bringing together gameplay from the first game and the last one released (security breach).. Srry it wasn't that impressive to me :( Me and my sister are die hard fans of fnaf, but Oswalds story wasn't that engaging to us. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game only has two enemies with gameplay that constantly repeats itself and the writing is so brainrot, I can't believe a critic had the urge to give this a 100% they must be a die hard fnaf fan that didn't bother to look at the flaws of the game -_- anyways, I can't give this a lower rating because the graphics are good... This game is the embodiment of a dog's buttcrack, To start off, the dialogue feels RUSHED, there's a moment where Gabrielle goes ""are you alright? You don't look so good"" then ""oh your dad's here, goodbye I guess"" first of all, we just met her, how does she know how mc's dad looks like? Second of all the dialogue has to be written by a Hispanic 8 year old who feeds his dog ruffled chips, but away from that, what's also bad is that it's repetitive as heck, you're always doing the same thing, wake up, go to school, go to the pizzeria, save your dad, you never get introduced to new mechanics and its obvious ALL of the characters are just plot devices except Oswald What is this the 40s? We're not sex toys game! There aren't enough areas to explore and the game is shorter than my uncle's lifespan, I understand the book was short but, wow, the graphics, animation, and sound design are the only reasons why this gets a 4 instead of a big ol' zero, interacting with people in the school was way more fun than going to the pizzeria and doing nothing but run, though you interact with the same Characters so that makes it a buttholic experience too!. Well that was awfully mid, Characters have potential, but ****, and there are too many cheap jumpscares that make no sense. It's not the best FNaF game. This is just the first FNaF game which have a story telling. All of the plot is just repetable, predictable and needlessly prolonged. The AI of the Springbonnie is trash it know where i am all the time but it predict like just it don't know where i am. I just made a sound in a room and hid in a another room, it came to room and just standed on where i was hid for like 5 minutes. For positive ways, QTEs are fun,Animations are great, Easter eggs are fun. It's just it. One of the best FNaF games. It have really good graphics and interesting gameplay.. In my view, this is the best Five Nights at Freddy's game we've seen since Pizzeria Simulator. I appreciated every aspect of the game; the way the story unfolds is commendable, managing to clarify the narrative without becoming overly confusing. Regarding graphics and gameplay, both are exceptional. Megacat Studios excelled with the game's visuals, and the choice of pixel art was spot-on—I loved it. The gameplay is straightforward yet intuitive.Another standout feature is the horror element. In my opinion, this game succeeded where others, such as Security Breach, did not, in terms of delivering genuine fear. It truly frightened me, and I experienced some genuinely startling moments during my playthrough. Overall, I found the game to be excellent. While I noticed a few typos in the Portuguese version, they were minor in comparison to the overall quality, which I thoroughly enjoyed.. So I let my 12 year old son play it, he beat it, and said it was OK, his gripe was that there were alot of cheap jumpscares and the gameplay got repetitive, he found talking to characters fun and the graphics were stellar, 5 out of 10 stars.. what can I say it's a great game with fanatstic graphics. I have not encountered any bugs or glitches during my run.. It's pretty meh for me, not as good as it's previous installments, I think I tried too hard to be scary, with its cheap jumpscares that don't make sense, how did pit bonnie jumpscare us via a phone? We'll never know... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You can hate on me all you want, But this just wasn't as good as the previous installments, gameplay was too repetitive, only redeeming things were the graphics and sound design. There you have it! Into the pit is a graphical beauty from start to finish, Does it really deserve a 10 though? Like one guy said the characters don't do enough for you to like them, Agreed, my main flaw is not the shortness, it's the repetitive gameplay, the game is worth checking out, But DEFINITELY not worth 16$. 10/10 game it met every expectation for what it was supposed to be. length shouldnt be an issue because the book was already short… they also wouldnt change the story to make it longer because that defeats the whole point of it. its meant to be short and sweet the gameplay is really interesting. i love the quick time events that appear when hiding from spring bonnie. i was already **** bricks so it definitely made the game way more intense. the constant traveling from up and down the map to finish an objective is stressful (not in a negative way) it makes the game more challenging, and scary because the animatronics are also hunting you down at the same time. also, the art/atmosphere is absolutely beautiful to look at.. Perfect in every aspect, a great story, great soundtrack, great visuals and overall a really great experience as a whole. Mid game, Can't explain why though, it's just that the dialogue was pretty asinine at times for me :/ And alot of people complain about how short it is, I agree but the book was also short, though they could've expanded the game's story a tad bit more, there were also not alot of areas to explore, And you talk to the same characters, maybe a bigger open world could've helped, It doesn't deserve a negative rate though, cuz of the graphics. Maybe would've gotten a higher score if it wasnt so short, it can be beaten in a blink of an eye, the rest is amazing though. This game is shorth (if you considered 5 hours short) but this isn't a negative point at all, the game fill this 5 hours with a lot of content, gameplay besides been simple, it fit pretty well this retro REALLY terrifing game, the graphics are absolutely breathtaking, the pixelart designs is amazing and the animation flow is stuning, this game is not for casual horrors, you can get a heart attack easily hehe.. Really good game, I like everything about it in every aspect. Exceptttt for these few things, short game, and right at the end it glitched so I had to go to youtube to watch the ending because my game wass softlocked so for that a 9. Into the Pit takes a basic anthology story to new heights with gorgeous pixel art and animation, thrilling gameplay that never leaves you bored, and so many secrets and easter eggs to the wider FNAF franchise and the Fazbear Frights series leaving the door open for more amazing adventures from Mega Cat Studios.. Well that wasn't that good, sorry, graphics were good but the gameplay got too repetitive in the end for me I know the novel is short but they could've atleast made it longer by expanding the story, it also felt rushed,","a mixed bag of pixelated nostalgia and some genuinely frustrating gameplay elements . gameplay-wise, I wasn't a fan of the quick-time events and stealth minigames . it's a fun game, but it's a little clunky at times ."
705.Heavy Rain,"This is the game that made Supermassive Games popular and known. Many people to this day still claim this is the best visual novel/limited movement styled game ever made. However, I disagree. It just has less options to do here than other games and some of the plot progression can be very slow. Also, this is a kidnapping mystery so if you're not into that, this isn't for you. I like those if they are done well and this is done decently. I was curious enough to keep playing but it wasn't addicting like it should've been. I like some of the moments that made you question who did it and some of the clues you find along the way. Overall, there are movements and control issues present and the story is decent but nothing special. You have good moments but they never amount to anything grand.. MY GOD. This game is just beautiful, I've played it just recently without any spoilers. I highly reccomend it for every one. Omg I love this game so much it’s so good I love it it’s peak gaming idk it’s just so good. The game story is nice. The atmosphere is dark and the plot twist is unexpected.. A game that was great when it first released but now it really hasn't aged well because the acting is at times good other times laughably bad, the story is interesting but flawed, a twist that could have been handled better, the controls and fixed camera angles are really clunky, the visuals are still very good almost 15 years later, the action scenes are intense and exciting, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, some characters are likable and some aren't but I would still recommend playing this game even if it has quite a few flaws and hasn't aged very well. Pretty weak game with a moderately tolerable story. Clunky controls, schizophrenic interface, and a constant string of QuickTime events make this game a let down and not worth a second playthrough.. It's a game with awesome plot. Gameplay in this game is harder than in other games of Quantic Dream. A lot of endings is a big plus for games in this genre. ILIKEIT!. One of my all time favorites. David Cage at his best. This game is weird and your decisions matter. JASON!!!. For most of the game I had this as a 9/10. Graphically still looks great in 2023, the story is interesting, the approach of various characters was great and the controls, although a bit clunky at times were inventive. I did have to knock a point off for the ""canon"" ending. The killers identity didn't really work for me and was disappointing. A great game, let down a little at the end.. A very underrated gem nowadays, with a dark and gritty tone, and a gripping story to keep players invested until the end. It’s one of the few games I’ve played where I wanted to keep the story going, rather than wanting to reach the end.. A forgotten gem. Harrowing, moody and dark. Tremendous story, great choice and consequence. Tons of replay value. Go go go.. great visual novel, although a certain thing in the story tasted bitter to me, it is very good that you can choose possibilities and have consequences. REAL SCORE 8.3. This is a very good game. Is not easy to do this type of games but I think this has achieved the honor to be named one of the best of his own genre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Game was poorly made with those choices and not much replay value. Indigo prophecy was better than this. Ambitious but limited game trying to be a movie and ending up as a joke. The cascade of choices is an illusion for most of the game, pushing the protagonists onwards on rails to move the plot forward. It's a rip off of Se7en just with lots of plot holes.. There's some awkward dialogue here and there. However, the overall experience is fantastic.. The story of this game is one of the best in video games. The characters are all great and the scenarios the player is placed in are all superb. The choices you make in this game have very big consequences which adds to the tension of the game. The controls are the main flaw as sometimes they are weirdly angled.. Game like a movie. I'm playing with pleasure. Every character is special and charism. Quantic dreams is a masters of yourself deal. Will be perfect to see second part.... such a legendary game David Cage`s games are always better than previous and all of them are unique stories that are very memorable and hold you with them forever. This game was a revelation for me at the time. I was just starting to play on consoles then, and I could not imagine that such sensations could be from the game. I directly felt in the body of the protagonist and experienced all the events with him. Amazing gameplay and amazing story, great cinematography in its time. This game is definitely a masterpiece.. This game is simply perfect mainly because of its creative plot, the character development is incredible and personally I had a great time playing it. It's such a good story and so creepy. I highly recommend it to this day it will be a masterpiece. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 7 Music: 8 Story: 9 Total: 8.17. Dark crime driven story with plot twists emotional moments and nice interactive gameplay, it was maybe the first time I see such an interactive game turns to be a triple A especially the graphics was great as a 2010 PS3 game. This game could be the most iconic interactive movie for its time, but those sci-fi elements ( such us detective's cheat glasses for example) killed the whole atmosphere of mature grim noir for me. Frequent plot holes and overtly boring characters ultimately corrupted my experience. Due to the absence of gameplay itself the story becomes the most important part of Heavy Rain, so it is unacceptable for writers to spoil it. 6/10 only becouse of that Madison's dance in club. A detective with a good start, high-quality QTEs and well-written characters, but closer to the middle it starts to become incredibly stuffy. stinkyyyy!!!!!!! this is awful game id rather be hanged on my balls than play this ever again. After some time, finally a game that thrilled me with its story. The story is completely complex and will make you think about all your decisions. I stopped the game a few times just to think hard about my decision. As for the characters, they are also well written, none of the characters was such that it would bother me with the presence alone. Gameplay was done in such a way that it more resembled an interactive movie than a game. Although I must say that in Scott's part, opening the fridge was sometimes a daunting task. I also appreciate the ""Move"" version of the game. Unfortunately, I do not have the necessary equipment to try this mode. I also like that the game has a very large number of endings to the story. I can only recommend this game and I am glad that I found a few hours of free time to humble it. I rate the number 9/10.. Cant even get through the shower part nor the brushing part, disc discarded. One of the best ps3 exclusives, the story of this game is compelling, its playability is good and it could be considered a game similar a movie, totally recommended. Story: 10 Gameplay: 8 Music: 10 Visuals: 9 Personal Score: 10 >>> A MASTER PIECE. What a flawed piece of **** the people who gave this higher than a 6 are completely delusional and/or are easily swayed by the graphics which were great on release.. It is one of the best games you can experience in your life. The best example of this genre is definitely Heavy Rain. If you haven't played yet, think of Detroit as less combat and more emotional. So Detroit: Become Human of those times.. Like watching a good detective drama. But you're controlling it. The Good: - Very interesting narrative. Hooks you in. Like a good mystery detective show. - Voice acting is good - many of your decisions will impact the outcome. Not only the final outcome, but outcomes throughout your play. - The way the game does the dialogue is very good. You can always hear what the characters are thinking. Choices are made in real time, so you can't take too long to make a decision, making it feel real. - Quite a variety of settings - the plot surprised me. Very good twist. - Good build up of the characters. Made me quite invested in each. - QTE action sequences were done well. Can get exciting. -------------------- The Bad: - Some of the QTE were awkward - The camera angles can screw with your movement sometimes. - Some of the dialogue options are too ambiguous and may not be what you intend the character to say - holding R2 to simply walk becomes annoying. - QTEs for menial tasks were unnecessary. It simply caused confusion, and unnatural movement. I just want to get in my car and drive away. Not press rotate my joystick to open the door, press a button to put on my seat belt, rotate my joystick to release the handbrake, then roll my joystick again to start the engine. This was ONE menial thing. There are many more.. David Cage knocked it out the park with this choice based thriller. the story continues no matter what? ""dont **** this up"" type of chills go down my spine. so many different outcomes and its totally up to you thats where the chills come from. great story besides the JAAASON section at the damn mall. play this game.. It was like a long movie which you can participate. Story really caught my. I get emotional and always wondered what's gonna happen. There are various endings so your choices make difference. It was a nice experience.. Heavy Rain is a reborn of interactive movie! There is all fine, but this is hard game to pass! :D. I am ignoring the lack of gameplay. But the plot of this game has more holes than swiss cheese.. It is more of an interactive movie than a true videogame and has a slow start. But after this you get an amazing gaming experience. Even after years I remember the story, charterers, plot twists and moral dilemmas. Only a few games got immersive like this. Heavy Rain is best described as action adventure in a murder mystery about the origami killer. You play as Ethan Mars, Madison Page, Norman Jayden and Scott Shelby. Each character has their own motivations, agendas and developments. I will not go into details because spoilers would be a crime. However the story is excellent with branching parts and multiple endings. It depends on you if you are successful, which characters survive or are present at the climax if you even get there. Like I said your success is not granted and there are sad endings. Then there are the moral dilemmas. A fitting question would be “How far would you go to save the ones you love?” Again be prepared for many hard decisions. The plot unfolds really great and I think it is really good with an amazing twist that makes totally sense but will hit you like a truck. There are also some good additional twists and themes. Overall the final question for you is if you like this kind of a more interactive movie like game and can endure the slow start. If the answer is yes than this is a must play. If not than stay away from it. The split reactions for this are valid. It can be the best game for you or a waste of money and time. Try it if you can.. Heavy Rain is undoubtedly the game that David Cage is most famous for, for better or for worse. It takes many of the elements that defined Indigo Prophecy and makes very noticeable improvements for sure. It beefed up it's production values, carried a more grounded story and had real meaningful consequences. In every way it is a far better game than **** that doesn't mean it doesn't have its stupid moments. Heavy Rain is deeply flawed, but I think it is legitimately enjoyable and well worth playing at least once. Hell, fist time I played the game I finished it all in a single sitting. It was that engaging. The game follows multiple protagonist out on the hunt for the infamous Origami Killer, A serial killer that steals sons from their parents and drowns them in rain water. We have Ethan Mars, the unluckiest dad in the world, Madison Page, a reporter, Scott Shelby, the old school Private Eye, and Norman Jayden, the high tech FBI agent. Out of each of the characters, Norman and Scott were easily my favorites. Norman for how much of a smart ass he can be, and Scott for being gruff, yet having a bit of a soft spot. Hell, I think Scott has the most well defined character arc in the entire game, and even has the best attempt at a romance in any of Cage's work up to this point. Ethan is a sympathetic character for many reasons, but often flaccid in personality. Madison, though, contributes very little to the story outside of being a love interest for Ethan. You can honestly remove her all together and not much would really change. As I've mentioned, the game is not without its dumb moments or, worse, continuity errors and plot holes, but on the whole I found this game's story to be far more engaging for more of the right reasons than, say, Indigo Prophecy. There were genuine moments of intrigue, mystery, and even a few heartfelt moments sprinkled in. Far from perfect, but worth playing to completion. It's presentation, while certainly cutting-edge for its time, has aged considerably. Much of that age comes from the characters and how heavily they hit the uncanny valley. Often the facial expressions don't accurately portray the emotions that they are trying to go for and just look down right strange. The voice acting doesn't help matter either. Most of the cast consists of French actors trying to speak English, and hoo boy is it easy to tell. It can range from relatively solid to just downright laughable. Some characters like Ethan and Norman pull it off a bit better than others. Like much of Cage's work, your enjoyment is going to be determined by how much you can tolerate its gameplay. The controls take a lot of getting used to. Rather than traditional analog control, you move characters by holding down the R2 button like they're a vehicle and then influence their direction. Otherwise, you will simply just move their heads to look around the environment for contextual items. It's very unconventional, but you'll get used to it pretty quickly. Like in IP, you will engage in QTEs, but instead of Simon Says you will be activating button prompts, analog movements and motion control movements. It's a hell of a lot more engaging than IP, and not only that but many of them have a very strong risk of your characters dying permanently. There are no game overs. It simply continues from there. That's one of the best parts of the game. How well you perform, how much you explore the environments and what choices you make throughout the game actually hold real consequences that can greatly change the outcome (though some choices are more significant than others). It makes for some tough decision making and the action sequences have more weight to them, making for some truly tense moments. That's one of the reasons why you get so invested with your favorite characters. You don't want them to die, so you are going to try your damndest to make sure they live. Heavy Rain is one of the best examples of something that is jank, yet enjoyable. I seem to gravitate towards these types of games the most. The ones that have a laundry list of flaws, yet that doesn't matter since I'm having fun with it. If you haven't played any of David Cage's work up to this point...well, I'd say go play Detroit first, and then come to this. It's one of the most memorable games in his repertoire for a reason.. Absolutely over-hyped. Story level - mid-level detective tv-show. Horrible controls - tottally broken. Its can be about 8points if not so badly broken controls. Im try to play it about 8 hours and must confirm - its MUCH better ""play"" this on youtube then play by myself. .. Heavy Rain might play out like an interact-able movie rather than a conventional video game, but the thrilling narrative makes up for it and more. The multiple turns the story can take also do a good job of making the player feel invested.. Another excellent graphic adventure from Quantic Dream. In this case with a dark story that goes into the most cinematographic neo-noir genre. If you like movies like 'seven' or 'zodiac', you must play this game.. I strongly believe that this game both revolutionized and popularized interactive drama/adventure games. When this game was released, it pulled at my heart strings like no game had before it. The story is gripping and tragic, the characters are complex and compelling, the action is fast paced and fun, and the fact that YOU choose exactly how everything plays out is incredible writing. This is a beautiful and emotional work of art, and I believe everyone should play this from beginning to end.. This game reminded me how much I like story driven and narrative video games where your choices play a role in the story development.. I couldn't put it down until I finished it in the middle of a night.. Depressing yet effective murder mystery story. Four leads are great and decisions impact the narrative to great extents. Fun play.. This game is objectively bad. If you like this game you: 1) like bad play control or you just don't care about good play control in your game. 2) You like bad movies that make no sense with ridiculous plot holes. Maybe Troll 2 is a movie you'd love. 3) Like to mind the ridiculous amount of pointless minutiae which ultimately amounts to nothing. This is not a good game, people. I just don't understand how anyone can think it is. The part where you're crawling through the sewers was so stupid it's beyond belief. Gameplay was so bad. Anyone who thinks this game is good must be taken by it's novelty. It's a ridiculous one or two trick pony. I honestly believe everyone disliking this review should be hit by a bus. You are the reason the game industry makes trash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favorite titles. I had never played anything like it, and between its gameplay and its plot, I fell in love with Heavy Rain. It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely an experience I recommend to any gamer who really wants a game to convey and tell him something.. Heavy Rain pushed the performance of the PS3 to the absolute max. Amazing graphics at the time and the game was very enjoyable. Got to see all the different outcomes after multiple play-throughs and got the Platinum Trophy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played this game with my friends using motion controls. Great fun and an adventure. And yes, I have played ""Heavy Rain"" second time after that and I saw that lots of choices are simply illusionary and a plot has lots of holes, but... I really enjoyed playing it, even the second time. Good acting, beautiful graphic (in 2010 of course) and soundtrack. It's worth a shot, but just for one walkthrough.. Narrative garbage full of plot holes and obviously cut material, combined with obsessive belief that mimicking mundane tasks like opening doors or drinking from glasses with your controller is a foundation of good gameplay. The game would be better presented as a non-interactive movie - if it had a sensible and enjoyable plot, which it does not.. I admit, when I played this I was a bit of a PS3 newb, and I couldn't work the controls. So while I tried to figure stuff out, the game just wandered off without me and a whole lot of nothing happened. And then when I went back to it, I realised that the story was completely depressing and I really didn't care what was going to happen anyway. Postscript: when this game came free on PSPlus I downloaded it and tried it again. It was worse than I remembered. A whole lotta nope from me.. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're interested in interactive dramas with storytelling so dark and brutal it could be in a Stephen King novel, then look no further than Heavy Rain.. Heavy Rain is an incredible game from the guys at Quantic Dream. It is a great game due to its narrative, but everything great has flaws, right? Performance isn't great, but for the PS3, it's something great. If you get the chance to play it, don't doubt it!. These types of story led game (or interactive movies) have become increasingly popular over the last few years and in games like The Walking Dead and Life is Strange we've seen some interesting, if slightly flawed titles. Following on from PlayStation 2 title 'Fahrenheit' David Cage and his team at Quantic Dream have released Heavy Rain, a title that is certainly bigger budget and more ambitious than other entries in the genre, but not one that even comes close to matching the best examples so far. The game undoubtedly looks good and the story, taking on different characters points of view during the hunt for a serial killer known as the ""origami killer"", shows plenty of promise. Unfortunately everything is let down by the mind-numbingly dull gameplay that largely involves pressing buttons on command to perform actions as prompted and competing QTE sections, a concept that should have been consigned to history long ago. You do occasionally get to make a few choices during dialogue scenes but, as with many other titles in the ""interactive"" movie genre, they have virtually no impact until the final scenes of the game. There is the potential to make a great interactive movie experience, but this isn't it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is an immersive, cinematic experience, not to be confused with the impatient non-stop doing many people might consider gaming these days. Heavy Rain attempts to give one the power of election, as demonstrated by the different paths the story can be divided into, however, it is sometimes trivialised by the fact you’re just flushing a toilet, or sorting a bunch of dishes, or unzipping whatever trousers… these are basically mundane activities that do not compare to the utmost, life-saving importance of drinking or not certain substance, or taking the right turn when you’re driving max-speed. It is to be understood that creators wanted the player to be part of the characters’ experience from the minimally important and to the truly relevant, nevertheless, there doesn’t seem to be some balance. That aside, HR’s story is its strongest point; because of it alone, this is an absolutely recommendable experience—notice I’m trying not to call it a game?. Maybe in 2010 this b-grade potboiler was something for the medium to coo about but in 2018 it's flaws, and there are many, have become too apparent. From its ludicrous plot (filled with so much cringe-inducing ridiculousness that it makes the Saw franchise look like high art ), to its amateurish voice acting, to it's weak-as-piss character dialog, all ends up sinking Heavy Rain faster than a lead balloon in one of the killers rain water ditches in which he uses to drown his victims. I will admit to enjoying it when it first released (there was nothing truly like it) but we have moved along in leaps and bounds which has left Heavy Rain as a depressingly clunky curio that has not aged well at all and, honestly, best left in the past.. This game was a great game, and I think it deserves a 10 of 10 Excellent graphics And a beautiful storyline But the control of the game was a bit hard. By now, I'm sure you've heard about ""Heavy Rain."" Critics loved it, gamers were rather polarized by it. You either love it or hate it. I love it. The storyline is well-written, the characters are great, the soundtrack is outstanding, the graphics are phenomenal, and the gameplay gives you plenty of control and the choice-based system and different outcomes only add icing to the cake of what is a fantastic journey. Even despite the game's insanely high score, I'll admit that ""Heavy Rain"" is not free from problems. Although the storyline is well-written, there are a few plot holes and unexplained plot devices (Norman Jayden's ARI and Triptocaine) and, although the acting is solid, there is some awkward line delivery. Even so, the plot actually manages to keep you thinking and asking questions long after you finish the game and it emotionally connects to you like few other games can. Translation: If you can get past the game's minor issues, ""Heavy Rain"" is a wonder to behold. Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". The first time I played heavy rain, it was a remarkable, original, extremely engaging and absorbing experience. It was like being a part of and co directing a movie like seven. The second time I played heavy rain, 4 years later, I truly marvelled at how superior this experience can be, compared to a movie or book of this kind. Has it ever happened to you, when you watch a movie for the second or third time, to expect things to turn out differently? To expect another outcome, another reaction during major plot points? Heavy rain offers you this gift and depending on how you play, what you will experience ranges from catharsis and relief to anger, sadness and grief. When the credits roll, for whatever outcome, you feel responsible. And that is the beauty of video games, and for that, anything less than an absolute 10 for the experience as a whole is simply wrong.. Heavy Rain is a story-driven adventure game with great atmosphere and passion. Some people have labeled it as an interactive movie, but it's really an adventure game at its heart. The game's story involves 4 playable, unrelated characters whose storylines gradually interweave and affect each other. The overall story arc is about finding a missing boy (the son of one of the protagonists) who has been kidnapped by an ""Origami killer"" (a maniac who leaves Origamis at his crime scenes) in a rain-soaked city. There are also some other mini-stories for each character with their own appeal. This is a game where choices have lasting effects, or may cause a character to die. You can even have all of the protagonists get killed, leading to a game over state. You can replay the game from the beginning and make different choices to see what different outcomes they yield. The graphics do an amazing job to service the game's atmosphere and ambition. All characters have been mo-capped and look great, even though their voce acting isn't perfect. The music is OK. The game's big problem though is the awful gamepad controls. I don't mean laggy or imprecise controls. It's a weird system where you have to push the R2 trigger to move forward in the direction you are currently facing, instead of just using the analogue stick in a straight-forward manner (it reminds me of the tank controls in some old games such as Resident Evil and Grim Fandango). There are some QTEs, but also an abundance of button prompts where you have to push various buttons in the sequence they are shown while simultaneously keeping the previous buttons still pressed down in order to go forward or else you have to repeat it from the beginning. It's crazy stupid. Luckily though, the game's control issues are addressed if you play with the PS Move motion controller. Everything feels better that way, and the prompts make more sense. There is more fun when you move your, ehm, Move pad to follow the general movements of the protagonists. Heavy Rain is a great game on its own, an adventure game and something different from the Call of Duties and the GTAs of this world. There is even an Origami included as a gift in the game's disc. Play with the PS Move controllers and you 'll enjoy the powerful story.. All right , i finished this game today after having it for 5 or 7 year ro so in my libary. i am not the biggest fan off interactive movies , and while this one does it great wit h ag great story ( a little better then tlou, but tlou again has a far better narrative and character development), good characters and character development , great music. The gameplay is simple , following a lot qte. What is good is that there a different endings, and you choices will affect who survives or not. Good game recommended PS: i am pretty stuck if this is an 8 or a 9. I am at 8.5 the question just is i am i closer to the 8 or to the 9 either way a game that is still recommended to play. A beautifully designed game with a very engaging narrative, carefully crafted characters, a heartbreaking story, heart-beating moments, amazing story telling, intense action and thought-stimulating events. It's been six years since this game was released and no other game has yet managed to deliver all that. Highly recommended, not to be missed!","this is a kidnapping mystery so if you're not into that, this isn't for you . overall, there are movements and control issues present and the story is decent but nothing special . a lot of endings is a big plus for games in this genre ."
707.Super Monkey Ball 2,"Great game. If you liked the first one you’d love this one two. It can be frustrating though, some of the levels are really difficult and doing the same thing over and over in 60 second goes can be boring.. I'm rating this game this high primarily because of how good the mini games are. The physics in this game is astounding!. This game is significantly better than original Super Monkey Ball by being able to start with 99 lives at max, a story mode where you don’t have to worry about losing lives, and far better and expanded party game roster that greatly improves on the party games in the original. Unfortunately, it takes an insane amount of grinding to unlock all the party games and especially 99 lives at max for the start, still has a grating soundtrack, and remains brutally hard. Point blank, this game is only fun in multiplayer party games against your friends.. Remember spending loads of time with this game and the first Super Monkey Ball back in the days of the GameCube. Lots of multiplayer options available. Still a party staple (along with it's predecessor), worth playing even today, particularly for parties.. A generously vast suite of minigames places this game far ahead of its competition and easily makes other casual games on the GameCube—particularly sports—obsolete. Unfortunately, the main game suffers from balancing issues, because as soon as you go beyond the Beginner stages, the maps often end up being constant dice rolls rather than skill-based play. Even with cheats, you'll likely find yourself stuck on a stage or two for ages because of the inherent design of it boiling down to luck. The ridiculous scarcity of bananas available to the player does not help the case either, as you never collect enough for them to matter, which disincentivizes collecting them to begin with. You're better off just rushing for the goal each time. Overall, I think this sequel would be best paired with the prequel—you would play the main game on the first and the minigames on the second.. Super Monkey Ball 2 offers great single player content as well as fun multiplayer modes. It has a rather steep difficulty curve, but once you get used to it this game is a blast!. This game was an impactful part of my childhood. The main campaign has fun and exciting gameplay that challenges the user. The party games were innovative and never got old. I think out of all the games I played on the GameCube this particular game was a timeless masterpiece comparatively.. basically, ditto what i had to say about spaghetti manky balls 1. a lot easier this time round, thankfully and unfortunately.. A classic game in this franchise along with the first title. Great graphics, great levels and heaps of fun! Difficulty increases perfectly throughout the game. Awesome Sega game from an era where Sega was a dominant third party developer. Can't help but love this game!. Super Monkey Ball 2 (SMB2) states itself as a parkour-party game. The game is amazing when your playing with others. The 4 player Co-op can be great entertainment when hosting a party or having friends over. On the other hand, it can be extremely boring when playing alone. There aren't a whole lot of options. There are some mini-games you can play, but those won't last a long time. The only way the mini-games can be entertaining is if you actually play with multiple people. The graphics are impressive for 6th generation. The simmering of the light off the floor was a noticeable trait. The soundtrack is forgettable, and you will find the game annoying from the constant screaming of monkeys. Not to mention the creep who says ""ready"" over and over again. Play the game if you have multiple people. On the other hand, this was a promising game which ended in an annoying setback.. The sequel of Super Monkey Ball is better than the original it adds bunch of upgrades that make the game more fun than the original. Super Monkey Ball 2 is definitely in my top 5 favorite Gamecube games.. At first I wasn't a fan of the addition of a story, but I got used to it and enjoyed the more gradual difficulty curve. The stages felt easier than those from the previous game, especially in the expert mode, but in some cases were more creative. This game also has more to do in multiplayer mode than its predecessor, which can make it a good party game. Overall on par with Super Monkey Ball in my opinion, but new players may want to start with this one due to its lower difficulty level. Definitely not a game to play with an uncalibrated or defective joystick!. Better than the first one cause there is more to do and better levels. This game THIS GAME is my 5th favorite game with amazing controls and amazing graphics and amazing gameplay this is easily one of the best games I have every played in my entire life.. If you want a fun and challenging sequel with excellent multiplayer and solo mode, then this is the prefect game for you. This game's predecessor was flawed, and the game fixed any and all issues with the game. You may not believe me when I say this, but this game is literally perfect. This game defined the Super Monkey Ball series for me. The game is expansive and has lots to unlock, to play, and to have fun with your friends. All the stages are great in their own way. But believe me, this game can get HARD. Like, really hard. Beginners, I recommend you try the beginner stages. The game's modes are very unique and are lots of fun both in solo and multiplayer. By far, the best aspect is the simplicity. Even if this is you very first time playing Super Monkey Ball, even a game in general, then no need to crack open a manual. The game lets inexperienced and experienced players alike play the game with ease, though the game gets very hard. The levels are so much more expansive than in the first. Scores Solo: 10/10 Multiplayer: 10/10 Controls: 10/10 Replay Value: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Final Score: 10/10 (God-Tier). its as fun as a barrel of monkeys. you roll through the stages as quickly as you can to get the best score. it is very satisfying to complete these stages, since many of the harder ones will take quite a few tries. the other game modes are a lot of fun as well. the bad thing about the game is that it is strictly gameplay, that's it, and that would have been fine 20 years ago, but during the time of this game, people are starting to expect things such as a storyline, interesting characters and a sensible objective. so in that sense it is an arcade game on a console, and its tons of fun. Fantastic... Very fun and has incredible ideas and graphics for being published in 2002, meaning it was probably the best game ever put out when ahead of its time. It allows you to earn points to get new minigames, and has nice sound effects and music on some of them. Monkey Ball will probably be the best kid/ cute game ever to come out by Sega. It recently came out with a new 3ds game, which allows you to view the gaming in 3d. The new game is not only fun and has ideas that are like the Smash Brothers and Mario Kart put out Nintendo, but is also very cheap. Monkey Ball will probably transfor to the Wii U at some point, and other consuls as well. Super Monkey Ball 2 has already been transfored to the Xbox if you dont have a gamecube, buy this game ASAP.. Such an addicting game. I know I'm writing a review **** that came out many years ago but honestly, It is well deserved. AV never ceases to amaze. Great replay value!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Monkey Ball finds the player as a monkey encapsulated inside a see through ball and then presented with a number of challenges to complete. In single player this largely involves traversing a series of Marble Madness style mazes within a set time period. As one would expect these mazes are relatively simple to begin but soon become increasingly difficult. The controls and level design are excellent but some of the mazes later in the game can seem to rely more on luck than skill and this can become very frustrating. Very few players will see it out all the way to the end. The biggest addition from the first title is the inclusion of a host of new multiplayer games (now making twelve in total) for up to four players. Many of these, such as monkey bowling and monkey golf are good for filling in half an hour or so but monkey target is good enough to be a game all by itself. This sees the player attempting to land the monkey on targets floating in the ocean with points being awarded depending on where you land. As other players can knock you off the target it often becomes very tactical and is superb fun with three other players. Overall Super Monkey Ball 2 is amongst the best multiplayer games available on the Gamecube and since it can be played on Wii would make a great addition to anyone’s collection.. A fun game with friends.. I don't understand why, but the gamecube has the most cute and addictive games ever. Animal crossing, and then now this? Great game for its time, including a plethora of minigames. This includes rowing, on rails shooter, and boxing. There's then the main story which has ~100 levels i believe. Cant remmeber","a generously vast suite of minigames places this game far ahead of its competition . the main game suffers from balancing issues, as soon as you go beyond the Beginner stages, the maps often end up constant dice rolls rather than skill-based play . the main campaign has fun and exciting gameplay ."
708.Thief II: The Metal Age,"I didn't have the opportunity to finish it when I was a kid. It was partly because I was afraid, and the game was too complex for my age. As an adult, I went back and finished the game last week. Thief II is a great game, especially with its story. Although the first and third games have the same mechanics as the second and provide the feeling of theft, they lag behind in terms of narrative. Secondly, it is a wonderfully enjoyable game to play with its medieval steampunk setting and the story of enslavement on which it is based.. The second top notch stealth action with improved level-design. Gameplay: combat mechanics 7/10 stealth 10/10 atmosphere 10/10 Gameplay as ****: 10/10 Story 9/10 Graphics 7/10 Sounds & music 10/10 . The final chord of Looking Glass.. For the sake of brevity and as a gesture of respect to the older audience (myself included), I think ""Thief"" and this sequel are pretty genre defining titles that have forever left a mark on the industry, even as that very industry seeks to undo more and more every year of what it built upon so many, many, many years ago. That all being said, these games are totally obsolete, even archaic and without outright saying anything negative to anyone SPECIFICALLY, if you enjoy them in this current year then it might be time to change your calendar and or start shopping for walkers. Some kidding aside, Thief 2 is incredibly old. Its kind of like breaking out a very old jigsaw puzzle where some of the pieces are missing chunks, or have been covered up by stains, or are just simpy missing after years of putting the puzzle together and then placing the pieces back in the box. It isn't a bad game by any means, but it will require a bit of imagination to fill in the blanks, such as the A.I. being about as intelligent as a Dumbo rat skittering about a small room with the lights switched off. Or the sound design reeking of that ancient EAX reverb that sounded like two plumbers banging on your water pipes in your basement while you were one floor above them, and don't forget about the absolutely labyrinthine levels that are deceptivally tiny, but were made difficult to navigate on purpose so as to pad out the runtime. I suppose their is also a ""plot"" to the Thief games, but since that was flushed down the toilet since the ill-fated 3rd installment, we can pretty much self-insert as Garrett at this point, and honestly isn't that what the original developers intended? I think so anyway. All the charm of Thief 2, very quickly fades away as soon as you realize how dull most of your objectives actually are. Your first ""mission"" is mostly a tutorial, but you can't even mess it up and your actual opponents a.k.a. mostly rent-a-guard's- are even less suspicious then they were in your first outing. Thief 2 has larger levels, which unfortunately totally breaks the A.I. routines, meaning they won't even do a lot of what made the original game so interesting. Gone are the days when guards would actually investigate odd noises, Garrett's tap-dancing rat shoes or torn tapestries.. instead we get guards turning on a dime back and forth on the same set path, which is about as easy to avoid as a comically thrown custard-pie. Quite simply it totally ruins the original's attempt at having knowledgeable (or at least its attempt at convincing you it was) artificial intelligence. Texture-wise its much like the original game with some modest improvements. Lighting or lack of lighting is improved with a better sense of what constitutes patches of darkness for Garrett to slowly crouch or sneak in and the dialogue is just as well written, as their is more of it to begin with between many NPC's and other characters. The music is still probably some of the best in the stealth genre with a lot of building on eerie soundscapes that builds the further you explore and loot or the nearer you get to certain areas of levels. However, its the gameplay itself that has been usurped. Its not like picking up ""Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory"" or ""Metal Gear Solid,"" which are honestly just better paced then any of the Thief games could've ever hoped to have been. So in earnest, I've never gone beyond the first mission in Thief 2, the original is still pretty endearing, if not just kind of like peering into a time capsule of 1998, but the second mission in Thief 2 just completely grinds the game to a halt. This large warehouse, with coded padlock doors, and multiple entrances, and multiple objectives, and multiple enemies just irks me in a way that is well.. boring. Its boring to play and if its not compelling or interesting or isn't presenting me with new ideas? Then yes its going to be pretty darn difficult to care about progressing. Lets leave Thief as a reminder of what we strive for in stealth games, but it shouldn't be lauded in this current decade as something that can stand the test of time, otherwise we'd all still be running Windows 98 and personally I can't find a harddrive small enough to be bothered to try it anymore. Tfix, for those who have heard of it, is mostly just a way to actually play the game beyond Windows 2000, and though its a great effort in many regards- it also permanently wipes out the original engine and its intricate quirks. Old dark isn't New Dark and vice versa. Their are just some things that are more interesting the more ""pure"" they remain. This would be like modding ""Doom"" to be a more modern FPS (oh wait they already did that). HD ""mods"" and texture packs don't really make the games less obnoxious or finicky to traverse and they certainly don't make it look much better by today's standards. Your mileage may vary with Thief 2, but that isn't a recommendation to bother playing it either.. One of the most significant hidden gem games of the whole videogame history. All those ideas taken from previous part were improved and enhanced. Creepy atmosphere, steampunk aesthetics and complex level design — everything was made very professional. The only thing that irritates me is that it's too easy to play it stealthy (even on extreme difficulty guards are not much of a threat — for example they won't wake up from blackjack stun even after half an hour of real time ). This game aged like a good wine though . 9/10. It is an improvement over the previous game. In terms of graphics, it's about the same, maybe a bit better. In terms of gameplay, it's mostly the same however for me personally it's better because it's more focused on stealth compared to the first which was on some levels more action-focused. The story is better and the sound and ambient is top notch. The fun factor is high at least for me. Overall great game. Best stealth game ever made with great steampunk medieval story , sequel ideal.. Pretty solid game even nowadays, but quiet tricky for players who are not used to stealth games. Challenging game with a few mistakes, decent storyline and brilliant playability. The biggest problem for me was stereotype of the game, every mission was almost the same with the identical purpose. After long hours of doing the same thing again and again it was not that fun as in the beggining.. Thief 2 - The Metal Age is $7 on Steam & my dirt cheap laptop was able to run it no problem. Thief 2 is better than the Dark Project because it doesn’t have annoying zombies, maze like level structure and poorly drawn maps. All of those are fixed. Thief 2 came out in 2000, so you might have to download the fan made “Tafferpatcher” to get it to run on current windows operating systems, but all you have to do is google “tafferpatcher” and it will be right there to install it’s SO easy. Also, on Steam you can hook up your Xbox controller, it’s a little finicky but it works. 1. AUDIO. It’s amazing, you’ll want to use headphones. The enemies’ footstep sounds are omnidirectional, so you always know where enemies are based on their footsteps, when they cough, talk, or whistle etc. you’ll know how close or far away they are. You can stand at a door, lean into it and hear the footsteps or talking on the other side. Modern games’ sound engines are not able to do any of this. Modern graphics are so demanding that they’re not able to map sound realistically. Thief 2 creates it’s environment to interact with sound in a real way. Sound waves bounce and carry differently based on the materials and design of the space. So if there’s stone everywhere, sound bounces and echos and travels far. But if there’s a steel door, it will be harder for sound to penetrate to the other side. And if you can hear enemies, they can hear you, so you have to walk on wood or carpet, if you walk on loud marble they’ll come looking for you. 2. SHADOWS. You don’t have a radar system like in metal gear that shows you where the enemies are and their line of sight, and you can’t see through walls like in dishonored, all you have is a “light gem” at the bottom of the screen that shows how visible you are. If you’re in shadow, the gem is dark and you’re invisible, and if the gem is lit up everyone can see you. Your weapons consist of a useless sword, your trusty blackjack (knock out people that you sneak up on from behind), and a bow and arrow. You have normal arrows, rope arrows (can stick to any wooden surface for you to climb up), explosive arrows, moss arrows (used to soften your footsteps on marble), and most importantly, water arrows! These put out torches making more shadows for you to hide in. So as a thief, you are much stronger in the shadows, whereas the opposite in a horror game like Doom 3, when you see a room full of shadows you get scared of what could be lurking in there. The design is so ridiculously detailed, that when you’re crouched in shadow you shouldn’t have your sword out because it will light up your gem and enemies will see you...because light reflects off of metal! Duh! Lol The money you steal in each mission is used to purchase your gear for the next missions (stock up on those water arrows!), and you get more tasks to do the more you increase the difficulty! So on easy mode you’ll have 2 tasks, hard you’ll have 5 or 6 etc. 3. LEVEL DESIGN. They make each level feel like a real place. The opening mission blew my mind with how large it is. It’s a full mansion and it’s built like a real sized mansion. There’s another where you rob a bank...they feel so real I could draw you a complete map from memory from exploring all of these places, and they’re so detailed that all of the loot is accurate to the locations. There won’t be money in the kitchens, but you’ll find some in a safe in the master bedroom. But there are notes to read everywhere, and enemies having conversations, that provide more detail and context to the world and the places you’re robbing. You’ll find a note or hear a conversation that says the chef has been stealing money and where he’s been hiding it in the kitchen, then you go to that location and steal it from him. I’ve played this like 6 times, and still have not found all of the hidden secrets. The Prima game guide to this is a great thing to order on amazon. There are so many things I could say, like how there aren’t any quest markers like in all modern games. You have a crude, hand drawn map that doesn’t tell you exactly where you are and you have to explore and completely immerse yourself to complete levels. The soundtrack is AMAZING and so original. The story is mature and subtle with beautifully hand drawn cutscenes. The main character’s voice acting is addicting perfection, you can’t wait for the next time he talks. It’s all incredible you will have the time of your life. For a 90’s game, even though it came out in 2000, it has the same design principles as the first game from 1998, you have complete freedom of movement, no invisible walls, you can go anywhere and climb and jump on anything while slithering through the shadows. You’ll be amazed with what you can get away with in a game that’s almost 20 years old. The majority of modern games can’t claim that. 10/10. The best thief in the series IMHO. Some ""ease of life"" improvements go a long way, for instance the maps are much easier to navigate through and this time youre actually fighting mainly people and not zombies or monsters.. So, I finished Thief: The Metal Age and I must say everything that lacked in Thief Gold was built upon in the sequel. I spent many, many hours looking for hidden loot and secrets while trying to kill nobody. This game highly rewards the non-confrontational type of players and stealthy manuevers gives an immense amount of satisfaction for doing so. There are many new toys for Garrett to play with in these huge mission areas and also some of the encounters are hilarious. The story was amazing; I will not dive in but it has great morals and a few familiar faces will be present. Once again the sound is spot on whether Garret is going down a steep hill or a long climb everything syncs pretty greatly, not to mention the music is very fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere. On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running on par with some games today!!!. Was expecting a game similar to the first Thief, Ended up being one of the worst gaming experiences ever. It's more of a linear stealth puzzle game designed to make you waste as much time as possible. Cheesy gameplay, awful opponents, and non-period correct architecture/technology made it a really dull experience. The first few missions are fine, but once the ""main antagonists"" come in to play the game gets ""Nintendo hard"" and really wasn't fun. I see why this franchise failed.. A great game in it's own right, Thief II unfortunately was a step back for the series. Sacrificing some of the mission variety present in The Dark Project rather than taking the time to improve it, what we're left with is a section of the original that's been polished to a fine sheen. The infiltration and sneaking aspects are at their finest, but at the same time while it's got a high gloss it's missing some of the charm of its predecessor. It feels like a part rather than a whole, like someone picking the chocolate chips out of a cookie. The narrative is choppy and incoherent and seems to just facilitate Garrett going to cool locations for levels rather than an over arching plot, and the aesthetics general feel cold and clean, missing some of the dank grime present in TDP. A great game, and certainly one I recommend, but ultimately a bit of a let down in the grand scheme of things.. Sometimes, a game comes along... And blows you away! I for one am new to the series, having bought the trilogy online during 2012, I was simply expecting an average stealth series, but to my surprise, they are amazing. Thief 2, set in the same City as the first one, follows the events of Garret, the master Thief. He is sarcastic and an utterly likable character who is just **** by in a dark, brooding, steampunk world. The plot is very deep, as goes the other two... It questions the morality of industry, individualism and religious beliefs, and evolves a massive conspiracy involving a head of a religious sect and a corrupt general of a massive police force. Everything about this game is impressive, ranging from an excellent soundtrack done by Eric Brosius, non-linear and exploration based level design, a well written and menacing plot/setting... And not to mention the crazy Mechanists, a fascinating offshoot of the already insane Hammerite religion. Positves: Excellent ambiance and soundtrack. Deep story telling and stylish cut scenes. A much higher focus on actual stealing. Massive, open ended level design. Compelling plot and fascinating settings. Huge amount of detail. Negatives: A couple of levels that are too confusing to navigate. Some shoddy voice acting. Lighting a bit shoddy at times. Overall: 9. My favorite game of all time. This is the second installment in the incredible Thief series. Dark and sinister. This time there are walking mechanical machines. This game has so many twists. This is a masterpiece.. Absolute perfection. Immersive stealth gaming, brilliantly structured story, gorgeous animations and cinematics... there is little to complain about in a classic like this.. This game was somewhat of a disappointment to me after the great first installment of the series. It has an interesting and fascinating scenario and the story is well written. The problem is, that the introduction of the metal elements make this a somewhat sloppy steam-punk experience. The real issue for me was the second half of the game when it became really tedious to continue with the thief-style game-play in a high-tech environment. Other than that, the game is worth playing but I still consider it beneath the other parts of the series.. This game wa a solid improvement on its legendary and revolutionary predecessor! Thief has a unique and gripping atmosphere (This time with less horror elements, focusing on Karras and 'His' machine servants). It has one of the most memorable and charismatic main protagonist in gaming history: Garrett, voiced by the legendary voice actor Stephen Russell. The stealth system work as a charm! The graphics are very good (the game was built with the Dark Engine). The maps seem to be bigger than in Thief:TDP. I can only recommend this game! If you like stealth games it is a must play!!!. Thief 2 is a strong candidate for being one of my favourite games of all time, and I don't say that lightly. The follow up to the flawed gem that was Thief The Dark Project may seem familiar to those who played the first one; the interface is more or less the same, as are the slightly ugly graphics and overall gameplay. Taking away the irritating mandatory combat in TTDP, Thief 2's strengths such as the sprawling non-linear levels, engaging stealth, brilliant writing and characterisation shine all the brighter. The characters all feel unique; even the guards have an endearing daftness to them as they flamboyantly make conversation while you watch from the shadows (keep a look out for Benny, especially). In fact, I'm hard pressed to say anything bad about it except nitpicks; the gameplay doesn't add much from TDP, the graphics are a bit ugly (even for 2000) and it's not quite as tense or original as the first game. But any criticism I have for the game is quickly overshadowed by the sheer brilliant of it. This is a darn good game, and I urge you to buy it.. A huge step up in atmosphere and depth over the original. This game is gold plated. And remains the pinnacle of the series. And yes, these games have not aged that well - however compared to other games released in 1998, what is on show visually is still impressive once you put aside the blocky models.. if you've never played the thief series then you've missed out big time! without doubt or hesitation my absolute personal #1 game franchise; if you've never played the series: you play as Garrett, a master thief, always on the lookout for loot and missions; G is hardly any good at fighting, but that's exactly the point - you need to sneak and pay careful attention to your surroundings to avoid detection; at your disposal you have various tools and non-lethal weapons to ease your quest by for example creating mossy carpets to drown out noise from footsteps or water arrows to extinguish torches; if I could, I would give this a 9.5 - it's not the perfect 10 that its predecessor was for me, but also definitely not as ""bad"" as a 9.0; THE GOOD: * the graphics engine was greatly improved compared to Thief1 (of course, no comparison to modern games) * mission maps are typically bigger than in Thief1 and missions longer * compared to today's often generic background story, this one is immersive! while the fanatical (at least so you thought) hammerites were the focus of the first thief's story line, now it is karras and his mechanist followers * your arsenal has grown slightly, allowing for more varied gameplay, but also some (IMHO) cheating (slowfall potions anyone?) * typically more enemies, now even mechanized - greatly helps immersion by making the Thief universe even more bizarre; but also meant that zombies are gone (that's a CON in my book) * and most of the previous awesome aspects have been retained if not improved (at least the german version that i own contains some hilarious exclamations made by some of the guards when they chase you); * oh, and thank god, a character that can and does actually speak! (stephen russell is kind of a thief celebrity) * IMMERSION - you really become **** into the Thief world because you constantly have to pay close attention to your surroundings and actions; visual cues, sounds, and lighting all are important sensory inputs in this game and thus to enjoy this game you automatically become immersed in it; just make sure that you play in a dark room with surround sound setup - and make sure no heavy or expensive objects are around - hysterical arm flailing is included in this game! THE BAD: * in general - nothing much; if you're looking for psychopatic mass murdering, you're at the wrong address; * the -0.5 i dock off for several reasons: first off, no zombies! perhaps the most awesome enemies in the first thief - scary, loud, slow, and it's possible to blow them up! what's not to like (unless you have weak nerves); the story - just not as immersive and fresh as constantine's plot in Thief1 - that one had mystery, betrayal, and revenge in it; this one only a constant fanaticist (karras) and not much more; finally, my biggest complaint - not all the playing styles that were possible in Thief1 are possible in Thief2 - even the second mission is impossible to 'ghost' (getting all loot and items without detection or even arousing suspicion); later missions just compound on that other thoughts: also used to (and to a limited extent still does) have a very proliferative fan community - check out 'thief - the circle' (no longer updated but still accessible) and if at all possible get komag's DVD sets (i think he offers a torrent somewhere) - tons of those missions are just incredibly well done, some perhaps even surpassing the original missions (calendra's legacy, T2X, 7th crystal & many more) in immersion, while others give it an entirely new spin (hammerite deathmatch, some of the unreal tournament style missions) IMHO, the Thief franchise created a wholly new type of gaming style and as such revolutionized pc gaming; much more so than other hallmark games such as crysis or half life ever did (for me at least); how good is it? i've played through Thief1&2 countless times with different styles in mind and the very first games that always get installed on any new computer of mine are the thief and system shock games!. One of the few cases, where the sequel **** or movie is even better than the original. The originality of the setting, the characters and the story are accompanied by some of the best levels ever seen in computer game history. Places like Angelwatch stand way above any other experience any game in the last eleven years since ""The Metal Age"" has provided for players. Almost a decade after this release no other game (maybe except Deus Ex 1) even came close to the value of Thief 2. For me this is a masterpiece according to which all games should be made. It is sad Thief 3 failed and Thief 4 probably will fail to recreate the undeniable greatness of Thief 1 and 2. The time such games were made is regrettably a long gone one.. An amazing sequel to the original Thief: The Dark Project. Thief II: The Metal Age takes everything that made The Dark Project great and expands upon it. Even bigger levels, more items and more ways of traversing the environment to get the loot you desire. The game also has a great story.","""thief"" and ""looking glass"" are genre defining titles that have forever left a mark on the industry .

709.Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power,"Just a great DLC that fills in many gaps. I mean, you get a scheme revamp, adventurers and the cherry on top being the administrative Byzantine add-on..

71.Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3,"Of all of the classic Mario platformers, Super Mario Bros. 3 aged incredibly, with its level layout reflecting the intentionality and design philosophy that Nintendo tries to put into all of its games nowadays.. I love Mario games it so mush funBeing the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24 years old. While it has not been made official, Daisy has been rumored to be Luigi's romantic interest. In Mario Kart Wii they are seen in statue dancing together. She was his caddy in NES Open Tournament Golf, as Peach was to Mario.. In my opinion Super Mario Bros. 3 is a really nice and classic Mario jump n` run. It`s a revolutionary game with very fun and engaging levels, an awesome first Worldmap and an unique charm. All worlds, except world 3 and 4 (these are pretty lame), are really nice to play and you should still play this game today (I played it for the first time in 2024). 8/10. I really like this game its Mario 3 on the go, but it's screen crunch is bad, but the e-reader levels definitely make up for it. This is why I think Super Mario Advance 4 Super Mario Bros. 3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the greatest platformers of all time. While this game is great, later on it does get quite difficult, you'll need some serious Mario skills to beat this one.. Fun fun fun and more fun!I like the older mario, can't wait for the revolution.. can't find anything wrong with this game. its Mario bros 3. not a perfect game but since is 9 or 10 it gets a 10. Like the other titles in the Super Mario Advance series, this game is a remake of a classic, in this case: Super Mario Bros 3 (it is the seccond remake of this game to be exact, if you count the All-Stars version). The original game is already perfect, being one of the best 2D platformers ever made. So, how does this version surpasses it? One of the things that makes this remake so great is that it does not suffer from the weak points that most of the advance mario games do, like the inferrior soudtrack and burst graphics. Furthermore, the main campain and level design are bassically the same from the original with a few quality of life improvements (like being able to save anywhere). The biggest highlight of this game however are the e-reader levels. These consist of over 38 new levels in a new campain (sort of). They are incredibly well designed and are very challanging, felling as a natural expansion of the main levels. However, the coolest thing about these levels is that they feature power ups, mechanics, and enemies from other mario games. In my opinion, this is the best 2D platformer ever made. Maybe is the best remake of all time as well!. This Game is incredible it is one of the greatest Mario games of all time. The gameplay is fun and responsive the levels are great and very fun to play good game over all. FINALLY! ive beeen waiting for this game for my entire life! and it just released! and its good too!. Such a bad Game!. Beated 100% on my GBA and l love the challenging of this game. I don’t like how modern Mario games just became a bit challenging when you try to collect star coins, and how easy they are to get 100 lives. Here life is the thing you have to collect, this game is a bit hard, but not impossible, It's nice to know that the difficulty is solely based on completing the level, and 100% isn't about collectibles, but about completing all the levels.. I definitely love Mario, and this is one of the best games in the franchise that will bring you fun, a little difficulty, and hours of entertainment if you really want to delve into everything in the game.. Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 successfully brings the timeless classic to the Game Boy Advance while preserving its charm and engaging gameplay. With its solid platforming mechanics, imaginative level design, and additional features, it offers a fantastic experience for both nostalgic fans and new players alike. If you're a fan of the Mario series or platforming games in general, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a must-play title on the Game Boy Advance.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Another fun platformer but it's more linear format and comparative lack of variety makes it feel like a step backward from the previous two instalments.. Super Mario Bros 3 is one of the most fun, addictive and greatest platform games ever made. I can't recommend this game enough.. One of the best Mario games ever, I think there is not much debate here. A pity that they do not maintain the level. I liked it back then I don't know about now I'm over these rubbish looking graphics from the 90s now we're in 2023 and I'm not so into these graphics much anymore but for that time I was a fan not so anymore. It does what it says on the tin - it's a faithful remake of the original Super Mario Bros. 3, and give it credit, it nails it. 90 expansive levels, unique world layouts that allows you to choose your own adventure, and loads and loads of secrets - if you have your GBA, grab this when you can, you won't regret it.. It was a great game and a good remake. I dreamed about the game before I got it like I used to not pay attention in class because of the game. It was worth the hype. I just wish that the e reader cards didn't cost money but I'm glad that it was included in the wii u version.. I'm a fan of the super mario bros 2D games,and this game is a BLAST!!! It is a large improvment over the original game,lost levels and super mario brothers 2! this game's introduced some of the most iconic Mario 2D mechanics. A must have on the GBA and an amazing game all round with mechanics, level styles, and moderate difficulty of the game itself. I enjoyed playing this game as a kid and enjoy it just as much being older now!. It's so fun and inventive. It's pretty much a classic now and I remember how creative this classic could get. So wildly good.. Fun game, Mario jump good. Honestly only reviewing as a personal 10/10 anchor for any other reviews I make. Mario do fun good jump yes, play game. The best Mario game of all time. A great remake and it works amazingly on the GBA specifically the SP. I would definitely recommend this game to a Mario fan. Even if you've already played it.. this is a all time classic but better with more power ups stages just the only problem is there is a slight screen crunch but play this one if you like plat formers. This game is... JUST WHAT I NEEDED! Jokes aside, this game is quite the joy to play. Super Mario Bros. 3 was a big hit, and this remake is a step further.. The second I got this game in christmas 2003, I loved it. The game is so perfect and is the best out of the four.. Excellent remake! The only downside is that they included the same Mario Bros. game as a bonus in each Super Mario Advance game.. Super Mario Bros 3 is simply one of the best 2D platformers of all time. Despite its age, the level design still is solid and there is quite a bit of creativity. The way Mario controls is amazing. He has great momentum and new power-ups like the tanooki leaf are super fun to use. The frog suit lets you swim underwater easily but makes your movement on land more clumsy. The tanooki leaf lets you fly above the level when you get enough momentum. The hammer suit lets you chuck hammers, which is pretty darn fun. I absolutely love this game's sprites and the art style is still charming to this day. It's amazing to play this game portably and I'd recommend this masterpiece to anybody. Have a great day/night, folks!. Having nostalgic memories doesn't mean this game is good. The controls are clunky, the bosses, besides Wendy, are boring and repetitive, there are some awful level designs, and some of the power ups are useless.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The original NES version was great, the All Stars version for the SNES was even better, and this version of Super Mario Bros 3 on the GBA just might be the definitive addition of this game (or possibly Wii, Wii U or 3DS virtual console depending on your tastes). The game introduces a ton of new enemies with a wide variety including Boomerang Bros, Fire Bros, Chain Chomps, Spikes, Rocky Wrenches, Buster Beetles, Microgoombas, Boos, Stretches, Baby Cheep, Blooper Nannys, Jelectro, Missle Bills, etc. The Bowser boss fight is MILES better than the original Mario Bros, and seeing him cause his own demise and plumet into the void is all to satisfying. The worlds are memerable and have some branching paths with challenges and rewards between them on the overworld. The music is fantastic, the level design is superb and the powerups would win any list that they're in. The game is easy to pick up and diffucult to master, and it even rewards you if you know what your doing with for example warp whistles that allow you to warp to worlds 5,6,7 and 8. Super Mario Bros 3 was the golden jem of the NES, and truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this, or super Mario world is the best 2D Mario game. this game also has the super Mario all stars updated graphics.. This is one of my most favorite mario games I'd ever played. It has all the elements **** classic mario game. The level design is awesome as always and it is hard enough to get you frustrated but not discouraged. I somehow keep going back to this great game. I'd give it a 10.0 overall.. This game may have been good when it came out, but it really isn't fun to play today. It's so simple and it's really outdated, playing this game almost feels like a chore.. Apart from nostalgia, can anyone give a good reason as to why this is a good game in 2017/2018? I didn't think so.. Best Nes Mario titile on the go with improved graphics, you just can't go wrong with this one. The difficulty level can't let me give it better score.. Amazing game that is ageless, still very playable to this day. This game set the standard for all future Mario releases. All gamers must play this classic.. This game is one of the best Mario games you can buy. The story is unique compared to other Mario games. The graphics are great, the music is very catchy with lots of instrument variety, and the level design the superb! Mario controls perfectly throughout the game, so you should NEVER die to unfair level design - all deaths are your own fault, NOT the fault of the game. The power-ups are all creative and varied, so the game never becomes stale. The bosses progressively get more challenging, and the final boss is one of the most unique of the entire series! After you beat the game, there is plenty of replay value. You can revisit all the worlds to beat any remaining stages (doing this will unlock, there is a updated Mario bros arcade game in which you can try and achieve a high score; and there are 38 additional e-reader levels and 3 mini games with those e-reader levels (these are only playable on the Wii U virtual console version though). Also it's possible to play the game with either Mario alone or play as Mario and Luigi (do note that Luigi controls differently to Mario). Finally, this game does have multiplayer! One player controls Mario and the other controls Luigi and you play through the game in a similar fashion to the Super Mario all-stars version of Mario 1. Overall this is a superb game which I highly recommend to Mario fan, fans of platforming games, or fans of multiplayer games.. Super Mario Bros. 3 Is one of those rare titles that was made by a spark of inspiration instead of a spark of violence. The game takes you to a variety of different worlds that each have its own charming scenery. The gameplay is magnificent. It isn't like Super Mario 2 where you throw vegetables at enemies, instead its like the original Mario where there are Goombas, Koopas, and Fire Flowers. The story isn't ""Save the princess"" anymore. Its now ""Save the 7 kings and the Princess"". Its a moderately hard game as well because of the floaty controls so you will have a challenge. There are also many secrets in this game that each allow for a new item to be unlocked. This game introduced my favorite Mario enemies, the Koopalings. Each Koopaling has a different, hard airship that is so fun to navigate. I recommend this game to anyone 10/10. I know most people say this is a more annoying remastered version of super mario bros 3 and their actually right.However the good thing about this game is that it hits you right in the childhood.Your memories of playing this game on your NES come back to you quickly.Overall this game still remains one of the best GBA games of today.. The Game is a must buy for anyone who has a gameboy advance. Amazing levels, fine story, superb gameplay, Tons of good power ups. It's a masterpiece. This was a huge step forward for the Mario series. So buy the game.

Well, this game could definitely use refining. It has issues with slippery controls (Am I the only one who feels like they're walking on ICE when playing this game?) Plus, what's so good about Super Mario Brothers 3 originally? The game-play was the same, and it was an obvious downgrade from Super Mario Brothers 2. Games like this shouldn't have any sort of ""universal acclaim"" the picky gamer would likely throw this in a dumpster if they see the bad quality of this game.. If you're looking for an awesome classic mario platformer for your GBA or even DS, this is it. Massive re playability, huge worlds and tons of unlockables and secrets.. Well, it's Mario 3 with slightly better graphics on the GBA, whats not to love? It doesn't have much new content, but it is still a great port. Recommended!. Greatest game available for the GBA so much fun must buy if you love Super Mário. Originally released in Europe on the Nintendo Entertainment System way back in 1991 this GameBoy remake serves as a reminder of why it is still heralded as the greatest platformer in video game history. Many have tried to imitate Mario Bros 3 but Nintendo's attention to gameplay and innovation in level design is yet to be matched. Following the template laid down in the original the game provides eight different worlds, each containing several levels, which provide a huge amount of challenge and entertainment. Every world introduced new ideas, enemies and power-ups ensuring the game never became repetitive or dull. Unlike many early 3d games the graphics also still stand up to today’s standards with some clever visual effects throughout. In conclusion Super Mario Bros 3 is still the pinnacle of 2d gaming and remains amongst the greatest games of all time.. If you liked the classic Mario platforming games and if you played the original, then theres no more words I can say to get you convinced.....unless you hate Mario , but thats very dumb idiotic .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]","super mario bros. 3 is a really nice and classic Mario jump n' run . it's a revolutionary game with very fun and engaging levels . the screen crunch is bad, but the e-reader levels definitely make up for it ."
710.Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together,"Classic charm in an upscaled package. Everything I love about the old game with plenty of improvements.. I like tactic turned-based strategy games, and I like RPGs. This is a really good game; but my only issue is that I compare it to the simplicity of Final Fantasy Tactics (which, I swear is the only game that nails the genre 100%). For fans of FFT, this game is for you.. TACTICS OGRE is definitely one of my favorite games of all time! It's so much fun!. The combat is meh and basically boils down to having two knights in front blocking the enemy's advance while your army of archers shoots everyone. Lots of sidequests but I couldn't be bothered because of how meh the combat was. Battles take 30-45 minutes long, sometimes an hour. The story is decent enough but there is only like 1-2 hours of cutscenes in this 50+ hour long game. That being said, the story is much more satisfying than Final Fantasy Tactics, as the story of warring kingdoms is not hijacked by demons half way through the game. I wouldn't recommend that you play this game based off of the story alone, though. You really have to like the combat. Doubt I will replay this game.. I have gotten this game about 4 times and every time I will put thousands of hours into this game. It is absolutely beutiful and my favorite game.. I loved Final Fantasy Tactics, so was excited when I heard about this game. The good: At first, I was very much in love, it has quite a few quality of life improvements over FFT: you can save during a battle (of which some can last over an hour), you can put your archer/caster back to it's initial position if you moved to a bad position but didn't finish your turn (which was a problem for me with archers/mages in FFT), etc The fact that the story branches based on your decisions is also a plus for replayability. The mediocre: It was also nice to be able to deploy over 10 units, but in the long run it makes battles too long without much added use. Story started also ok, but became less interesting and engaging than in FFT. Same with battle scenario's, there is a lack of unique setups in this game, which is a problem when you have to fight a lot. You are also encouraged to level up by grinding extra areas since you might otherwise be underleveled versus the next boss, which I did but that made my end part way too easy without any challenge or difficulty. The bad: Last number of battles was really a slog, extremely uninspired to have several battles facing an uphill enemy which didn't pose a challenge but took 30 minutes to get through anyway per fight. By the end, I couldn't care anymore, even if the final battle was a bit more unique. In short: Good game, but too drawn out... This is a masterpiece - definietely my favourite game of all time. It has something for everyone from total beginners (it was my first SRPG) to really advanced players, such as myself on my double-digit playthrough.. One of the best games I've played and I wish it would have a remaster. Awesome writing. One of the best games of all time. I couldn't believe the sheer breadth of complexity this game has in terms of story and gameplay. It will forever go down as the best strategy RPG ever made. This game is actually terrible and it is entirely because of the ill-thought out mechanics. FIRST and most important, the leveling system is completely broken. If a character is about one level above another they will do 30-90 damage to their victim, said victim will do 1 damage seemingly regardless of the class or ability they vainly attempt to use. UNLESS you're playing archer, whom just annihilates everything in his path with infinite range and zero remorse. So that's OK right just keep your characters leveled right? WRONG! You can't level your characters you can only level the classes they use. This makes playing any other class than archer, mage and soldier completely pointless unless you want to grind every time you earn a new class and you WILL NOT want to grind. Grinding is incredibly tedious and time consuming. It's really time consuming to try and trigger a random battle and even if you do you probably won't gain any exp for the brand new shiny class you just earned anyways. The AI does everything in its' power to annoy the hell out of you without actually trying to win. After all, one archer one level ahead of your enemies can completely decimate their forces. Trying to level a new class is about as fun as chewing chalk. The AI mercilessly targets your weakest character with really zero strategy beyond that. This makes it stupidly frustrating to level new classes because they will just die instantly and you'll gain no exp for them. This game blows because it takes everything great about Strategy RPG's and spits on them. There is no incentive to play creatively, character building is far too tedious to be fun, and it's also dated because this is a butchered port of a snes game. The worst part is that there appears to be a ton of potential, the skill and spell system appears deep and full of content, but you'll never use it because it's incredibly sub-par compared to that archer. So sub-par, you'll lose miserably attempting to play with them. The verdict is play Final Fantasy Tactics. This game is actually fun and challenging but it has several annoying flaw that made it less enjoyable than it should. This is my biggest problem with the game : - Horrible guest AI with Perma death if you fail to keep them alive. - Atrocious Crafting system.. i really like visual presentation and story in this game. The only complain is battles become very hard if you don't invest time grinding levels for your party.. I was really excited to finally buy this game, getting a PSVita recently. I've beat Tactics Ogre a few times in the past on PSOne. The new systems and graphical changes were refreshing at first, but it all seems like a half measure. The portraits are great, but the sprites are lazily low-rez. All of the new features are things that modern SRPGs not only have, but have advanced upon further making Tactics Ogre still feel 2 steps behind. What killed the game for me is the pace. The game is easily 40-50 hours, but to be honest 20-30 of those hours could be removed if battles weren't so slow. You have low damage, low chance to hit, and the board is flooded with enemies. It can easily take 4-5 hits (assuming you hit with 40-60% chance to hit) to kill one enemy. The trajectory system also drives me nuts. 9/10 maps the enemy is given the high ground, making it very easy for their archers and casters to hit you. Having the low ground you're going to constantly hit your own units. What's the point of having a knight protect a wizard if the wizard is just going to keep hitting the knight in the back? There's also no real alternatives to grind your characters to speed it up. Ultimately I started questioning why I was playing the game when I could play something like Disgaea 4 or Fire Emblem: Awakening instead. Despite the upgrades, the game still feels just slow, old, and a waste of time.. I was one of the very few people who played the original when it came out before Final Fantasy Tactics, and the original was awesome. This game is even better. Amazing story, very likeable characters, and TONS of end-game content. This game is like Final Fantasy Tactics on steroids. Once you actually ""beat"" the game on your first playthrough, you are only about 15% complete with it. There's a 115 level deep dungeon, that branches off different paths, and has secret rooms. This dungeon you will have to descend twice to complete all the content it has to offer, and this is just breaking the ice on end-game. Beating this deep dungeon is a requirement to complete CODA 1...just so you know, yeah... there's 4 CODAs.. There's preparation to be done before you even begin the first descent, which is very lengthy. And to top it off, there's like 5 deep dungeons in this game. That's right, FIVE! This is honestly the best game I have ever played, and I knew that they would not let me down in making it, because the original has been my favorite game of all-time, until the PSP remake came out. The music score was done perfectly. The music creates an atmosphere of drama, enjoyment, goosebumps, and awesomeness, basically everything to be rated about this game is above a 10 for me. I have been waiting for nearly 2 decades for this release. This does not come without a price however. The game is insane honestly. The end-game content is the most in any sRPG there has ever been, by about 10-fold. (this does not including ""endless"" games like Skyrim, because this game ends), but let's get serious here, the original was WAY ahead of it's time back in the mid 90's, and the original set the standard for sRPGs. If you just want to enjoy the game without any fuss, you can simply beat it on all 3 routes and stop. If you are a masochist like I am, then you can complete all of the end game content with it. But expect to be spending upwards of 500+ hours on JUST the post-game. Not only is the post-game fun, but it's hard and extremely time consuming. There's a TON of classes to choose from, as well as recruits that are awesome. There's sidequests to get Draconic Magic one of the ultimate magiks of this game, and you will grab some in each deep dungeon you go through, along with insanely upgraded gear, recruits, legendary crafting books, legendary materials to craft, and unique gear, when equipped, will provide a baseline increase to certain damage or defense. (It's really strong stuff) You will spend many grueling, hair-tearing hours trying to get to this equipment. Matter of fact most people don't even get it all and give up before they complete it, because of the insanely MASSIVE dungeons this game has to offer, and not only this, but the freakin' game is so big that you need a guide to grab **** even WITH a guide you are going to have to do a lot of backtracking, A....L..O....T!!!! Play this game, seriously. You are not experiencing perfection in sRPGs until you have experienced this game and it's post-game to the fullest. But be warned, this game will come at a price. But if you manage to best it, you will end up playing it again. Until you get the strongest gear, this game is a challenge. You can't just mow your way through it. This game envolves tactics, preparation, terrain disadvantages, weather disadvantages, class disadvantages, gear disadvantages, and long grueling dungeons that you have to farm drops inside, while experiencing all of this. GET THIS GAME! PLAY IT!. The game has a good premise, but a very flawed execution. The first few battles your characters will be lagging behind, relying on the guests, since they have very low damage and piss poor accuracy. (60% chance of hit from the back!) Your units are blank slates, and the game expects you to work and make them useful. This would be great if wasn't for the obnoxious and low resource pool. To make them useful you need to unlock skills. To unlock skills you battle. Each battle is very slow, due to the high number of units and the low damage output, and gives you just enough points to unlock about one skill. To use the skills you need to set them in slots that also need to be unlocked. And each slot unlocked makes the next one even more expensive, making the already slow process even more insufferable. Skills also have levels, but it takes to much grind - you need to use a skill about ~150 times to level it once. Equipment have damage type, elemental affinity, and weather performance. But none of this adds strategic value, just bloat and time. Now and then you will need to protect a Guest. They have have two AI patterns: Moronic - casting harmful spells on you - and Suicidal - rushing towards the enemy giving your an early game over. Menus are bloated and excessive. Shops don't have an option to compare your equipment. Class system is uninteresting. Battles are too slow. Damage is too low. Accuracy is too low. Tactics Ogre is slow, contrived and poor. The developers focused in adding too many subsystems and forgot to balance them.. I've only created an account to comment this: PLEASE SQUARE, PLEEEEASE MAKE A REMAKE FOR PC PLEEEEAAAASEEEE T___________T My PSP media is corrupted after too much use, and i'm afraid it can happen again. I need a digital copy, ask steam, ask origin, anyone, BUT DO IT. And yes, this is my favorite game EVER. And I am desperate too... Sorry for my bad English.... I find this standout game to be much better than Final Fantasy Tactics. I am a diehard fan of tactical rpgs and I really like how you can load out with almost a dozen characters to fight all at once with another dozen. This is what battle is all about, particularly on the maps without elevation. The music is wonderfully rendered on the Sony PSP's superior sound and the menu is completely accessible via the Select button.. This is a timeless classic. It is one of the best tactical rpgs of all time and also a prime example how a remake should be made. The story is deep and engaging with twists and your decisions will lead to different routes / outcomes. The battle system is a master peace with tons of job classes, abilities and combinations. There are a lot of recruit able characters, some with unique skills and job classes. The value of this game is very high as you can get hundreds of hours of playtime.. I realize this review is a bit late, but this game really resonated with me as being a high quality classic, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for not just a good strategy game, but one of the best games ever. Tactics Ogre: LUCT is a remake of Tactics Ogre for the SNES, with more content and a much improved translation (seriously, the dialogue would not be out of place in a fantasy novel.) I can really like a game that has excellent gameplay, or a fantastic story. Few games, in my opinion, pull of both at once. I believe Tactics Ogre does, I'll break it down below. Gameplay: If you've played Final Fantasy Tactics you're in for (roughly) the same gameplay experience, but with some noticeable differences. It should be noted FF Tactics was the spiritual successor to Tactics Ogre. I think it's a damn shame the Tactics Ogre series has been laid to rest, but I digress. The game both on and off the battlefield requires lots of micromanagement, and in the later game you might spend more time than you'd like grinding levels or crafting powerful weapons. These facets might seem unappealing and to many they likely are, but you get out of the game what you put in. You could speed through the story with minimal grinding and still enjoy it, but the side quests and optional characters are just as engaging and worth your time. I will warn you some of the sidequests can be very long, at least one of the optional dungeons has over 100 levels contained within. I found the game challenging but fair, the hardest levels in the game are the ones where you must keep a friendly NPC alive, as they prone to suicidal charges into the enemy's frontlines. The story: I could gush about how much I loved the story but I'll try to keep the fanboyism down. The story is mature, dark and surprisingly real. I won't include a synopsis as you could find one elsewhere and I don't want to risk any spoilers. Just be prepared, friends may die, they may betray you, they may leave you because they disagree with your decisions. The men you fight may be more honorable than the ones you serve, and as the main character comes to realize, ""To lead is to stand alone."" Additionally, the characters are excellent and have three dimensional personalities. The decisions you make have REAL consequences, and they will dictate who lives and dies. There are also multiple endings, and I will admit my ending on my first play through was not ideal, but it was pretty cool to see such a dark ending in a JRPG. Will all the content, the excellent story and just general grade A quality, this is an easy game to recommend. I have inducted Tactics Ogre into my top 5 games of all time, and while Final Fantasy Tactics is very good I would venture to say TO is superior. I bought it off of PSN and play it on my Vita, do yourself a favor and check it out!. Not as good as FF Tactics which has much more refined game play. TO, is overly anal, and very irritating the anal part makes it irritating. They got some strange ideas on who can use what spells for example a cleric can't use all the light spells it seems, there are both level requirements and mystery (as in makes no sense) class requirements. Some maps are set up to really make you mad with undead that come back to life and only way to kill them is you must have some one who can cast one single spell called exorcism, if you don't pick that before hand forget it as another guy just keeps summoning more ghosts, all this in very begging part of the game. Then another map where you must rescue some AI NPC who runs suicidal towards the enemy, better have a good healer with good movement close by or it is game over. Why can't you use magic point blank is beyond me, you almost need archer range to cast a spell, what? since when? Stuff like this is just irritating. I guess if you really like this game type them go for it, otherwise it will piss you off guarantee.. Amazing content, great gameplay, and works the brain. This game is able to deliver a full experience that lasts long and fulfills the player's money spent.. I really like how the player can change the course of events given the decisions, you make while progressing in the game. Its even more astonishing given the fact, that the original game is over 15 years old. Beside of that its a good strategy rpg with a good battle system and some nice new features. Every fan of strategy rpgs should at least play this.. Final Fantasy Tactics - but so much more. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together is a incredible good Strategy RPG. The game works similar to Final Fantasy Tactics(What to expect from pretty much the same developers). Tactics Ogre, just like FFT is about medieval politics, warfare, the split between races and different classes in society(Nobles and the rest). What makes Tactics Ogre more fun, and also increases the replayability is the fact that there is several routes and several different endings. Not to mention that you usually can have up to 12 units on the battlefield(Comparing with Final Fantasy Tactics 6 unit cap) You get plenty of choices in-game, but most of them are just whether x guy will join you or not. i.e not that important choices. The exp system also works well. The exp is well divided between the characters and the class level is shared between all the characters. So basically if you recruit a new warrior, so will his warrior class level be the same as every other warrior you have. This however is a bit annoying when you unlock a new class and see that it's level 1. Though they level up fast so it isn't really a major issue. There are however a few things I dislike, or rather prefer how it is in other games. First off - the class / job unlocking system. You unlock new classes by either buying or looting class cards. You can alternatively recruit someone with that class on the battlefield. But basically - I prefered the FFT system were you leveled up your classes and unlocked new ones. Instead of getting new classes the further you reach the game. Second - The crafting system is incredible slow. It is nothing game breaking, nor do you need to use the crafting system. But it just felt like a waste of time to buy alot of ores and then sit there and watch the crafting animation for the next thirty minutes.(But it was so worth it having upgraded weapons for your ninja) Graphics - Good, the sprites, art, effects,etc are all well made and fits in very well. Gameplay - excellent. The combat is fun and very smooth. Sounds/Music - Also very excellent. Story - Glorious.. story is amazing, probably the best medieval fantasy I've seen in a videogame with subtle, well done political intrigue and a great cast of characters warren report encyclopedia is dynamic and grows as the story moves along, I can lose myself for hours going through and reading the intricacies of the story main problems is some facets of the battle -AI is sometimes stupid, casts the same ineffective spells over and over -large armies and large levels means you will spend a few turns just moving your units across the map, can be time consuming -level up system is a hassle when you find a character with a unique job, as you must level them up from zero by having them tag along in fights where they cannot be of much use. Guest characters (AI characters) are suicidal - simply the worst AI (or scripting) in recent years. This became a deal breaker for me when on one level I was giving the choice to save a AI-controlled character in an impossible situation. After several hours of trying and searching internet for tips, I found out the only way is to cheat the system or let her die by making an out of character choice. The illusion that I was in control of ""battle tactic"" is but all broken at this point and the rest of the game matters little. Don't call it a tactic/strategy game if the only way to play is by developer's design.. It was a masterpiece back in the days, and this remake is so polished and well thought that newcomers and veterans alike will surely love it. Tactically deep, full of choices and optional contents, challenging while providing ways for newbies to enjoy it, full of post-game quests, extremely good from a narrative standpoint... Tactics Ogre is all of this, and much more. Let's hope Matsuno is able to continue the Ogre series.. I may not of played the original, so I don't know how much of the game's mechanics are new to the PSP release, but if SRPGs were this good back then, why hasn't anyone learned and improved? In a lot of ways it seems like it tries to improve and upgrade modern SRPGs. Units grow and become more powerful as they become skilled, offering the player plenty of customization options. However fresh recruits are far from useless. The story is open-ended, well written, and the characters are believable. The art style also really fits the theme. Forgive me if I fail to articulate what aspects of the game really make it for me, but it's been a long time since I felt like I played a game this substantial.. If you have been waiting since Final Fantasy Tactics for the next-thing and have been disappointed by everything released since then (including Disgaea and Agarest), your wait is over. Tactics Ogre for PSP literally picks up where FFT left off and is without a doubt the spiritual successor. Again, if all the tactical/strategy RPGs out lately have been total let downs for you, this is the game you've been waiting for. This game also has the added bonus of not being polluted with schoolyard scenes and juvenile themes to appeal to a younger crowd. This is a game you can play without feeling like a total molester.. Let me start off by saying the original Tactics Ogre is on my top 5 favorite games of all time -- And the remake is even better. If you are a fan of Strategy RPGS, BUY THIS GAME. The story is by far my favorite of any SRPG. When I first heard about a remake, I figured it was going to be like all the other remakes and have very little new content. This game feels almost completely different, with tons of changes, additions, and notably the removal of the training mode. This review will focus mostly on the changes. One of the most noticeable changes is the fact that you level jobs instead of individual characters. So what I always did was have 1 character per job so that you can keep all your jobs leveled. Because of this change and the fact that there is no training mode, I found the first couple battles (after your training buddies leave you) very difficult. Also, experience is gained throughout the battle and at the end it's divided up through all your characters. This is great, because when you begin leveling a new job they can basically stand in the back at level 1 and not risk getting killed. Another change during battle is the fact that you can retrace your ""steps"" or character moves. If you've played the original you understand the fact that sometimes these battles can last an hour, and one wrong move can cost you the battle and lose a vital character. So in order to aleviate a lot of the frustration you are now actually able to backtrack to any move you want (up to 50 moves) by pressing and holding the ""L"" button. A lot of people will consider this cheating, but this is just an option, and if you're a die hard fan -- just ignore it. Another important change is the fact that you can customize each individual character by buying spells and abilities. This feature resembles Final Fantasy Tactics and the use of Job Points. The difference is that you are only able to hold a specified number of skills and abilities. Because of that, each character is unique -- sorta. This feature was probably the first feature I did not like. It grew on me as the game progressed, but originally I felt like I was basically buying the same skills for my melee and the same skills for my mages. The act of trying to make unique characters ended up just being repetative for the first few chapters. The fact remains that these skills are crucial. Without knowing what you're doing, the first few battles were difficult to me until I mastered the purchasing of these skills. Probably the most important change to me is the fact that you can replay the game by going back to specific points where you have to make game changing choices and pick a difference choice to see the other outcome. Now die hard fans like me, already did this on the original but this was done by restarting a new game and losing all your hard work. In this remake you can take your party of characters and go back to those important moments. This basically allows you to recruit all those members you were unable to get to form the perfect party. One other sidenote is the music. The music and sound effects are AMAZING. I remember when I was a little kid, whenever I heard music from FFVII or Xenogears it would have a great effect on me. I would get so excited to play it, and even to this day there's a sense of nostalgia. This game has THAT type of music. Although this game isn't for anyone, if strategy rpgs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Advanced Wars, Jeanne d'Arc, etc. are appealing to you, then you have to try this game. And if you loved the original, but you're still debating about buying the PSP remake, just remember -- It feels like a new game, plus there's characters you always wanted to recruit in the original, that you can get in the remake. I won't give it away in this review, but a simple Google and you should be able to find it.","the combat is meh and basically boils down to having two knights in front blocking the enemy's advance . battles take 30-45 minutes long, sometimes an hour . the story is decent enough but there is only like 1-2 hours of cutscenes in this 50+ hour long game ."
711.Diablo II: Lord of Destruction,"it's my all time favorite, it's design overkills its ""so called"" successors.. The best game ever made. Period. Sadly Diablo died after Diablo 2, RIP Blizzard. I better game than Diablo IV for sure I spend more than 5000 hours in it and I recommend it with warmth to anyone. The best diablo game ever existed. A timeless classic. If you still haven't played it, you are missing a lot.. Upgrading of something that already is great is im possible, and yet, they did it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Blizzard game ever made! There will NEVER be another great Diablo game so play this one as much as possible!. Tons of games claim a ""dark, gothic"" atmosphere, but for a real definition of what that means, look no further than Diablo 2. Totally unique classes, the epitome of ARPG gameplay, fantastic and immersive atmosphere, beautifully orchestrated music and sound, this is the main candidate for best of all time in my book.. Who can name all items when you see them? That is the definition of love, you knew it.. An astonishing game that should be never forgotten. I spent hundreds of hours playing it and after those X years I would prefer to play it again instead of a new low-quality PC (not meaning personal computer here ofc.) hell dictated games.. The excellent add on for Diablo 2. With this it improves the best hack and slash RPG of its time. It adds a lot and makes some good improvements. Lets start with the additions: There is a new fifth act with the culmination of the story. It is set in a new region, has new quests and challenging new enemies atop on impacts on the lore. Then there are 2 new character classes with the Assassin and Druid. The female Assassin focus on traps which are deadly in numbers, claw weapons and has charge attacks. The Druid has magic spells which are a bit more indirect, can shape-shift and summon animals that help him. I like both classes and the Assassin became my favorite class on par with the Necromancer. Of cause there are new weapons and armor pieces including set items. (Should be a no brainer with a loot porn style system in place;-). There are now runes that give bonus and these are comparable to gems and new recipes for crafting items. Some rune combinations might lead to something even better. There is a new class of items called ethereal items. These are better but less durable (Absolute worth it for me). Almost forgot that there are charms that add bonuses to your character if stored in the inventory (= less inventory space). These are sometimes useful but beware better effects mean bigger charms. Gameplay wise there are some neat improvements like for example a bigger item storage, hirelings can now kept through the whole game, a higher resolution and an alternative weapon slot (Useful for some classes but not equally for all). Presentation wise the game was well done for its time. I think I will go to my conclusion. Overall this improves an already great game and in total it is the ultimate hack and slash experience of its time. It is no wonder that fans want a remaster for years and that there is still a loyal fan base for the game.. almost in 2021 still best game for long time fun and grin. just i love this game. sometime you need look at google for some info but still good game. Diablo 2 is easily one of the best games ever made. Building off of the masterpiece Diablo 1, Blizzard North has succeeded in every way possible. The expansion makes it even better.. one of the best pc games i have ever played, its worth playing even to this date because it have the best quality, good gameplay, and now with the dlc its even better. there are only few thing that are bad but the game itself its really solid. if you want to play without having to connect to the net, play this.. The perfect game. Never gets old. Hopefully Diablo 4 will have a similar look and feel.. The best game ever, solid even for the 2020 standard. There's no better Action RPG in existence as of current. I highly recommend this game.. i would give it a 10 but i never beat it but i still love the game to death! over 3000 hrs played. Amazing game that stills worth to play today. The new classes and a new boss give a new breath to the game.. My all time favorite, most addictive game ever. No other games has made me play 1000 hours+ other than d2. a game, that has passed the test of time is worth returning to it after 18 years. Immortal classic in the RPG genre. Great atmosphere, very interesting plot and good game-play. That case when the ad-don to the game was worth the rating for the whole game in general.. A monument in gaming and pioneer creator for many features in modern games. Memories of the adolescent times.... This is badass hack and slash as it should be. So many hours spent, either alone or in multiplayer. Sad diablo 3 wasnt this good.. Masterpiece, one of the greatest games of all time. The expansion adds two new classes and many new items and features. Must have if you own the original.. Follow to one of the greatest of all time, the greatest expansion of all time. So much game play to be had here, an absolute must play.. Seriously this game (and its base game Diablo II) is still in my honest opinion, one of the best games out there still playable today, in terms of story, content richness and balance.. How is diablo 2 ranked 2 points higher than plants vs zombies and 18 points higher than Lord of Destruction? First, LoD made diablo 2 the epic game that people still play in 2018. and it completely out ranks half the games in the first 200 on the list. infact you ranked it #206 and #224 for LoD. Either you never played it or your **** some studio's E-D. It has been running longer than World of Warcraft without expansions or story changes. same ol' classic epic game.. This game is one of the very first games I ever played and it was so good.I play it even today , because it's more interesting than the re-skin of sports games and CoD.. I love the game Diablo 2 Lord Of Destruction because it has awesome challenges in the different levels and areas you play even though I have played Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls on PS3 and PS4 which is also an awesome game but there is one I have not played which is Diablo. Best game of the series an one of the best game ever. You can deploy several build for each character and discovery even a new ones. Control are quitly perfect, level balancement was in progress for years of support. There are no two runs of the same: playing this game is ever a new experience. All games should be like that.. Diablo II LoD - I still play this game after about 15 years of playing off and on. It is still the best ARPG on the market. I've spent more time on this game than any other 9/10. Most things are well done, this game would be a 10 if they could get rid of the bots on battlenet.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Most definately a worthy expansion. Adds a ton of content and, of course, more Characters! Once u install this, there is no way you will ever play Diablo without LoD. Awesome!. Started playing D2 when I was *young*, and sure I got rushed through all the acts. Me and a buddy decided to bro-quest the game and beat it without outside help. Just the two of us. He played the paladin, I played the necromancer and we both had a great time. Honestly, just a few cheap but solid rune words make the game more than beatable. One thing worth mentioning is that the online experience is made so much better by the online economy. a site called d2jsp, a trading forum, is one of the best places to find things worth doing. After, or maybe even part of that, it's a lot of fun to really theorycraft yourself some interesting character builds. In my mind, this game was the perfect experience.. Expanding on the original game, Lord of Destruction adds two new classes and a fifth act to play through as well as new monsters and items. No reason to not pick this up if you enjoyed Diablo II.. Best game ever, Awesome story with movies. The expansion gave so much to this game,lots of uniques,runes,runewords. I love trading in this game. You do repetative things in it,but they are fun,and you get rewarded..(unlike some wannabe sequels) From personal experience,i played hundreds,thousands of games,old and new,but this is the only game that has the **** never bores me.. The ultimate hack-n-slash game full of diversity, great character progression, story, ATMOSPHERE, memorable characters...CLASSIC! If you've played it, you know how hard it is to play another hack-n-slash game.. This game sets the bar that other hack and slack games are measured against. And it sets the bar very high. Single player is a passable experience, and it lets the time go by while you wait for some program to run/download/update/whatever, or while you watch a TV show at the same time, etc. However, the heart of the game is multiplayer, either LAN or Online. Then it becomes a fun fest of spells and melee. This is a strong contender for being the best LAN party game, because players of different skill levels can roughly keep up with one another, and there are several ""easy mode"" build options for beginner players to play. Advanced players can keep coming back again and again to find and craft the best loot possible and get every damage point possible out of their build. The down sides to this game are that it's sometimes hard to get the graphics right on newer versions of windows because of compatibility issues. Some of the skills are just very poorly balanced. The item customization isn't as intricate as it could be. There's places where this game could be improved in a ""HD re-release"" type of scenario, but it stands tall even without modernization.. Single Player/MultiPlayer (2/2) (If the single player is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no multplayer) (If the multiplayer is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no single player) Gameplay (1/2) Visuals/Story (0/2) (If the visuals are better than the story, review this section as if it had no story) (If the story is better than the visuals, review this section as if the visuals didn’t matter) Accessibility/Longevity (2/2) (Review this section only on Accessibility if the game has no longevity) (Review this section only on longevity if the game isn’t accessible) Pricing (2/2) Wildcard (0) This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. What else can You say about this game? It is absolutely the best game in the universe. Still after so many years I am playing it. Great gameplay. Mother of all hack n' slash games. It is beating in every way Dia3. Amazing, simply amazing. Danger: once You try this one, You will never stop.. THE ARPG, this is probably my favorite arpg ever made. Great story, loads of fun alone, on LAN, and online, a truly great game that should be played by any fan of ARPGs.. Interesting game play and story.Diablo 2 Lord Of Destruction is a game worth playing.. Simply the best ARPG of all time. The graphics are dated now, but no D2 clone has come close to the replay value and fun of D2:LOD. **** set the standard for all ARPGs that followed it.. An 8 for sure because of gameplay is good but a lot of people just hack like tommorw with bot hacks in duels or flash hack that gets on your nerves a lot but an excellent game 4 boring acts to do though I want more like WOW game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Blizzard North, Matt Uelmen, just an amazing and fun game that has lasted the test of time - no other PC game has been selling off the shelves of retailers for the past 12 years and continuing. One can only imagine if this superstar team had made Diablo 3..... One of the best in the history of humanity. Nothing more to say. If I would have to choose ONE game to take with me to a lone island to play for the rest of life - that would be Diablo II (of course with Lord of Destruction ;) ). Much better than Diablo 1 by far. Playing as a barbarian doesn't take 10 years to chase down 1 ranged enemy anymore. Sorceress is still overpowered in my opinion, and I simply used one spell the entire game. Adding reasonable sprinting is very nice. You have too much gold in this game than you can spend. The game was considerably longer than Diablo 1, and the quest system is 10x more useful. This is the first true RPG feeling Diablo in the series. The game had some annoying parts such as Baal at the end taking forever to defeat, but Diablo dies in a few spells. Still, overall much better than Diablo 1, and the story seems to continue onward even though I have no idea how it continues after the Lord of Destruction for Diablo 3.. L.O.D adds so many good things to the original game that you can't imagine Diablo 2 without it. We can only complain that the new chapter (the 5th) is too short, its storyline is not very interesting and the added cinematics are not as great and dark as before.. Diablo 2 LoD may very well be the best game ever made. In as far as today's standards go, the graphics may be lacking, but it would be unfair to rate an 11 year old game in such a manner. Gameplay, items, hostility based PvP, it blows everything else out of the water. It, at it's prime, had such a strong community, and even by today's standards has an excellent multiplayer layout as far as chatting, game creation, ease of use, etc. is concerned. By seperating it's two forms of **** (Open and Closed) it allowed you to play ""legit"" on Blizzard's Closed servers, and still allowed you to explore the game mechanics and edit characters and bring those ""hacked"" characters in for amazing PvP on the P2P Open **** servers. Favorite game of all time, hands down.. One of the best games that have been made. Great gameplay, great story, great atmosphere. It is a great classic that every gamer should play. I still think Diablo 2 LoD is far better than Diablo 3. Well done Blizzard North, you shall never be forgotten.. I've always played Diablo II + LOD together so I don't have much to say as for this add-on alone. Great game as a whole ... any RPG fan needs to have this game handy.. The kind of game that i wouldn't start playing on other difficulty than easy. It is a great game, but on a second run i just used trainers, and even like that, i didn't finished the story again. But i know is the type of game that calls me in from time to time, and that's just what a good game does, it stays in the back of the mind. On other words, LoD is a good lesson to learn when going for Diablo 3: there WILL be an add-on that will radically improove/enhance the original. So whi buy the original at the initial price, when i can get the battlechest later?. One of my all time favorite games, and a must play! If you ever think you are bored.. it's because you are not playing this game=] lol =] If you played Diablo or not do yourself a favor and immerse yourself into hours upon hours of L.O.D. VERY good game. probably and unquestionnably the BEST RPG game out there. Dungeon Crawling originality, Item Hunting, Character builds such as Hammerdins, Smiterdin... Overall, this game is a nice and quality game, even as of 2012. I still play it from time to time, still waiting on DIABLO III. Hope they will stay true to the series, as for Diablo II i am giving it 9/10, simply because there is nothing else i can do on the game, i now it sounds ridiculous, but whatever. Still a VERY good game. Highly awaiting Diablo III. Brilliant game. Simply the best hack n slay rpg. Could have been a clear 10/10 if it had adequate online support. Somehow blizzard just pretty much accepted to have people running 10 mf bot sorcs, duping runes and they even left those bugged items like siggards belt on their closed bnet realm. Ofc such environment affects ingame trading systems and harms players personal satisfaction while playing.. Best game of all time Limitless replay value, great story, pinnacle of hack and slash RPG gameplay BEST GAME OF ALL TIME Skyrim,Final Fantasy 6&7,Mario,Zelda and even my dear Mass Effect EAT YOUR HEART OUT !!. Couldn't be better. Long life, fun as hell, never surpassed as the king of action-RPGs. This expansion was the cherry on top of the best game ever. At least for me. The huge amount of playing hours in coop or solo speaks out for itself.. The expand is the best thing blizzard do to this game, new act 5 new classed and new items and more. Now the expand was the biggest upgrade for this old game diablo 2. Why the expand because people are getting little boring to keep killing diablo over and over again. So the added a extra boss. With new bonus sets of armors allot of new mobs and so on. Best expand ever.. This game was the first game I ever truly played. It all started when my Papa (grandfather) got diablo and then Diablo II. He used to wake up early in the morning, fix coffee, and kill demons. I WAS HOOKED. I played this all through highschool, and was truly addicted. I thought about it all day at school, played it with my quarterback (and best friend) on the football team. In fact, after our games (on thursday) we'd play all night and go to school the next day with zero sleep. THATS a true testiment to a great game. Ive probably put in over 1000 hours into this masterpiece. The music is phenominal, Matt Uelman (sp?) is a great composer. The graphics are dark and gritty, and the ambient noises are the icing on the cake. This game does not get old unless you are playing it all alone. It has a huuuuge item inventory, and many different ways to play a character. Runewords are an awesome addition to the mix. The storyline is FANTASTIC, the cinimatics were way ahead of its time, and the commutity is STILL alive... almost two decades later. This game doesn't deserve a ten, CRANK IT TO ELEVEN. Hope this helps out some people.. I'll cherish memories of my Papa and the great times with my football friends as we killed demons together, and cherish them forever I shall.. Diablo 2 has one of the greatest loot, stat and talent systems in video games and has been very influential in the industry. The character classes are fun and interesting and give the game great replay value. While there are some awesome locations and enemy designs, I didnt find the story, atmosphere or enemy design better than the original Diablo asides to a few exceptions. Many of the enemies were stupid - cats warriors, little jungle tribe imps, bug swarms in the desert and the demons Mephisto and Bael looked pretty dumb compared to how awesome the demon Diablo was. The story has some good memonts and ideas but was not as compelling as the more simple but superior original Diablo with its more traditional demons, terror in the cathedral and memorable characters in Tristram. So in the end Diablo 2 is great but I cant help but say that some aspects were better in the orginal Diablo.. anyone else notice how the only guys giving this a bad score sound like they're kids that only play open battle net? one of the greatest games ever in my opinion.. Diablo II LoD is amazing Action RPG game. This is one of my favorite games and i love this ;) Really good gameplay = + 1000 h played :D. DIABLO 2 LOD Diablo 2 is my favorite game to this date the LoD Expansion was great is really helped to extended the life of this game's community which is still Thriving to this date. Blizzard better make DIABLO 3 Epic to top this we had a decade of Diablo 2 gameplay the change is going to be way harder than that of Diablo to Diablo 2.. Best game of its kind. Lots of classes/skills. Still has tons of people playing it 10years later. If you are looking for a Top-view RPG id highly recommend this game.","diablo 2 is my all time favorite, it's design overkills its ""so called"" successors . sadly Diablo died after Diablo 2, RIP Blizzard . the excellent add on for Diablo 2 improves the best hack and slash RPG of its time ."
712.Pikmin 4,"I love this game ! The RPG-like approach is refreshing New pikmins are great and really original Night mode and Olimar's tale were the cherry on the cake. First Pikmin game I played...nowIwill have to play everyone. I am a now a super fan! Such a great time playing such a great, unique game. When you get out of the 3 hours or so of incessant tutorials, you get one of the most beautiful, detailed, memorable and fun experiences on the nintendo switch, while some of the caves are kinda long, when you finish this game you will be wishing they were even longer. I 100%d this game and recommend everyone that plays this game to do so.. This game is nearly perfect. Tons of things to do, simple but intriguing story, predictable difficulty changes, tons of help options for those who want or need it, super fun gameplay, great soundtrack, customization choices, and beloved characters introduced or returning. The only point I will take away is relating to a minor detail with the combat system, but I won’t say too much about that. Play this game, I promise you won’t regret it.. ""Any gamer that hasn't played Pikmin 3 can never truly be considered a gamer"" - Tom Clancy The Pikmin franchise is by far the most underated one of Nintendo's game franchises. Each game that Pikmin releases, it gets stronger. This one in particular took elements especially from Pikmin 2 and only made them better. Mainly by adding a dog. Oatchi the Dog is Nintendo's attempt of both adding a new and interesting gameplay element, while also trying to advertise to a wider playerbase. It's unfortunate that so few people have played a Pikmin game, but it does make sense. It's too stressful and messed up to be called a cozy game, but to fluttery and cute to be targeted to a hardcore audience. It's unfortunate because of how good **** Pikmin 4 is! It's a Real-TIme-Strategy game filled with micro managment and combat, but is also serene and calming. It's also difficult to market because it's a game you need to play to get. If you try and explain Pikmin to someone it'll sound over complicated and boring... But it's not... It's Fun Overall if you haven't played this game you are doing a disservice to yourself, bescause Pikmin may be one of the most interesting game concepts ever.. Pikmin 4 is a well made game. While I personally had more fun in Pikmin 3, there's no questioning to love and passion that was poured into this game. The game mechanics are well designed, the visuals are some of the best on the Switch, and I can't help but collect everything to 100% the game. For me at least, difficulty options would have greatly increased my enjoyment of the game as in its current state can ironically, be painfully easy for most of its runtime. That aside, Pikmin 4 deserves its success and acclaim and I hopefully this means will see a new game in less than a decade this time.. very relaxing and charming game ever since the first game on gamecube it's great. love this must play for switch I never get boring when play this game, alway hit frist when I open my switch. The game is sold with a PEGI 3. Wanted it for my 4 years old daugther with supervision. i played pikmin 1 long time ago and really enjoyed it. This game is filled with annoying dialogue nonsense.I wanted to try it first. But i got bored trying to read the story and ended up skipping dialog after less less than 1 hour. It's not i don't like the dog mechanics, but too complicated for learning child.. After almost finishing the game, I was surprised to find that the entirety of Pikmin 1 is included in the game as a side quest with the new mechanics. Gotta say this is now my favorite Pikmin game due to all the QOL stuff and how easy it is to keep the Pikmin safe on Oatchi and Moss.. this game goes HARDD Like the graphics are very good, gameplay is fire buuttt the only thing holding it back from being a 10 is the difficulty its SO EASY. It takes what every previous Pikmin game does right and more, this is the perfect Pikmin experience in my eyes.. Almost perfect. Would love to see difficulty mode. After playing Pikmin 1, 2 and 3 the game is a bit to easy the first half. It gets tougher though.. Truly the best pikmin game in the entire franchise. it was so worth the wait.. a really good game, all the pikmin types return and the nigh missions are a great was this game avoids habitulation, really fun game. Why did oachi get all the hate. a fun game, only a few mistakes short of being perfect - it's a stealth reboot - nintendo seems to insists on textboxes and slow transitions everywhere - the doggo is a great and fun addition - but kind of ruins the point of the whole game - ditching being able to control multiple captains is also a letdown - the night missions are not fun and just time wasters (also subjective) overall I feel this game was not made for the fans of the previous games but was made with a new generation in mind who never heard of the pikmin before. Loved it. 48+ hours of main story. Worth the money for sure. It has many side quest like night missions, to mix things up. Collecting diamonds to purchase power ups for you and your pup. A+++. finally 10 years after the release of Pikmin 3 and it was actually worth the wait. There is really nothing to say bad about it, but at the same time it doesn't really do anything special as it plays it too safe. It's enjoyable and going through all the levels is engaging, but it's the kind of enjoyment that is a slight head nod level of satisfaction when you do things. If this game was a drink it would be a slightly cool drink of water, not even ice cold.. Pikmin 4 is a game that never expect to be this enjoyable, relaxing yet challenging at the same time. Pikmin 4 is truly a masterpiece from Nintendo in 2023. This is truly Nintendo takes on RTS genre which to me feels phenomenal. The game rely on day mechanic where you have to collect treasure and save castaway within the time limit that you have in 1 day but the game never force you or set the maximum day you have to finish all of that. Because of that, the game is challenging yet relaxing at the same time. The game also perfect for completionist where you can aim for platinum badge in every dandori challenge and battle. On the other hand, you can play Olimar adventure where the game gets challenging in my opinion if you didn't set your time properly. Overall, Pikmin 4 is a fun ride and I truly enjoy it from start to finish. Looking forward for the next Pikmin game and what's new can Nintendo bring to the table. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I like it but it is so slow moving. I hate clicking and reading. Aside from that I really like this one. It is very colorful and easy to navigate through. I've played all 4 Pikmin games and this is my favorite by far.. A complete blast to play from beginning to end. I’ve been playing Pikmin since GameCube and Pikmin 4 may be my favorite. I’ve played through it at least 3 times and have spent hours trying to collect all ship parts in A Shipwreck Tale after completing the main game. Dandori battles add even more value. Pure fun!. At its core it's a Pikmin game but it's way too overbearing and restricting. Feeling like I'm still in the tutorial 10 hours in (based on the near constant screen-covering dialogue about basic mechanics), Most Pikmin are basically useless, the side content (caves, dandori challenges, etc.) being required but also the worst parts of the game because the core gameplay is exploring and finding stuff that way, etc. So much stuff just feels pointless. Also not really a fan of being forced to rush through one of the areas because something is chasing me when I've been able to 100% every area in the first attempt up to that point.. Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Game Mechanics: 9/10 8.5/10 The game is great, like the others. Enjoyed the different approach with this entry.. There is a decent amount of water to be found (plus me liking this game a lot but ignore that) but there is water and water creatures which gives it an 8/10 I decided. This game is amazing! I recommend this game to novice gamers and full-time gamers- there is something for everyone!. Since trying games like Pikmin 4, I want to say that everyone who has a Switch must play this game. Great idea, new game style, very good system, excellent graphics.. Pikmin 4 is very good. Very addictive. But it's not a masterpiece by any standards. The environments are very beautiful and the pikmins are still very cute... ...but it is very repetitive and the new pikmins and ability don't really do much to break the monotony. Also it's very annoying to get back to the hub at the end of every days to upgrade (with loading times that are much too long) Lastly the controls are pretty annoying (especially with the dog) and I found myself sacrificing pikmins way too often because the wrong type was auto selected or some automatic order was triggered So... it's a fun game... it's rather well **** it's definitely not a 90% game it's a very solid 70% game. Well polished but lacking. Early on I was unsure about this game. The tutorials are overdone and the characters interrupt you a lot. Luckily, it gets more interesting as you go through the game, in particular in the caves, some of which are long and punishing, the last one especially. The bosses found within are generally enjoyable to take on, too. I wasn't sure how to feel about being able to rewind time for a while, as it felt like it was reducing the pressure to keep your pikmin alive, but a lategame encounter with Empress Bulblax made me very glad to have it... Having every type of pikmin from the series available in this game is a nice touch as they all have their own advantages, however, it would have been nice to be able to have them all in our squad at once, limiting us to 3 types seems unnecessary and it could have at least been limited to 5 types. Continuing the negative tangent, the music is forgettable, and the castaways have little personality and end up just feeling like another collectible. However, there are two new additions that are fantastic. Firstly, Oatchi and his new abilities change up the gameplay nicely. The ability to collect the pikmin up to sit safely on his back prevents a lot of deaths compared to a big crowd of pikmin following you around, while having him be able to jump means you have to think strategically about which tasks to take on yourself and which to have Oatchi complete. The second addition is the night exploration, which totally shakes up the formula and feels really great to play. This tower defence-style mode has you protect Lumiknolls from rampaging creatures, challenging you to defeat them quickly. While earlier missions are a little easier, later ones get intense, not least when the music goes loud if a Lumiknoll is being attacked. Overall, this ended up being my favourite game in the series, so don't be put off by the slow start, stick it through and it gets really good.. This is a sweet and nearly perfect Pikmin game. It combines the dungeons and the overworld perfectly. I also really like the the new pikmin and the new night mission. The only flaw is that the blue pikmin become really irrelevant after time.. Gamereactor is wrong and is for babies. This game cured my depression for a week.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pikmin 4 lived up to the nostalgia hype I had. I remember playing it back on the Gamecube in a friends basement and this brought back all those memories. I wish there was a bit more variety in the Pikmin's abilities and I found myself using the charge attack everytime to take out monsters, but overall it was a good time!. I never thought when I started playing Pikmin 4 that it would take 50 hours of my time, but to my delightful surprise there was simply that much to do and I have no regrets saying I did it all. Pikmin 4 is to the franchise was Super Mario Odyssey was compared to Galaxy, or what Breath of the Wild was to Skyward Sword - The next giant leap to expand the franchise. From the beginning story plays a much bigger role than any Pikmin game before it, with more cutscenes, characters, and dialogue carrying you all the way to the end, which can scarcely be called the end at all due to the plot continuing straight into the post game. Even the post game can hardly be called such with how much unresolved content remains otherwise, down to the game's best challenges awaiting you along with a proper final boss fight. The loop of starting each day with characters to speak with, a bigger world than ever to explore, and more variety of things to do with each expedition created one of the best addictions in games I've played in some time. The amount of content here cannot be overstated; in addition to exploring the world and finding treasures, caves also return for additional exploration, as well new dandori challenges that pop up from time to time. There's also an entire new type of exploration you can go on in a day, as well as whole sub-game only available in the post game, which unlocks ANOTHER challenge mode! It's insane just how much you can do in this game. If I had only one minor gripe, it's that everything before the post game can feel a bit easy. Your companion Oatchi only gets better as the game progresses, which makes tasks easier, which takes away from the challenge factor especially since enemies do not respawn. Still this is only a minor complaint as the main game feels like preparation for the more challenging (and fun) post game where all the best content happens. New Pikmin types, new camera angles leading to more immersive exploration, quality of life improvements like auto-targeting, and a more vibrant world all with the same feeling Pikmin always provides made this game so delightful I rarely wanted to put it down. Many Nintendo franchises have made a giant leap to the next logical step, and I was thrilled to be apart of Pikmin's glorious transformation from something small and charming to big, beautiful, and filled with so much content it would not be a stretch to call this game the best in series to date. 2023 has been one of the best years in gaming history, and Pikmin 4 definitely deserves to be listed amongst the best.. this game made my gf so happy! >_< <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3. I think Pikmin 4 is practically the perfect pikmin, and the best in the series by far. Although the game is rather easy, the rewind feature and upgrades are optional so you can avoid them. The co-op is a bit lack luster at times but vs dandori battles are great. The game is perfect for speed running due to its design and reliability. New features like battles, dandori challenges and night missions are fun and ice pikmin are useful. I liked caves in Pikmin 2 so it is nice for them to return and the bosses are very fun to fight. Overall I love pikmin games and how you manage tasks, grow and fight. Sage leaf and shipwreck tale are also really fun for post game content. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best RTS ever made and the game that elevates Pikmin to the Mario, Metroid, Zelda group. This game is a beautiful, dynamic, lively, endearing masterpiece that’s driven by strategy that’s as engaging and dopamine hit filled as it gets. It’s also roughly 3 times as long as any other Pikmin after taking everything into account. There’s even essentially a mini Pikmin 1 as a side part of the game. This game will never win a GOTY award but is one of the funnest games ever made. It’s the 3rd best Switch game behind the 2 Zelda’s.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Although it does not ""revolutionize"" the series, they added so much more to the gameplay it's really worth a shot. Micro-management of your pikmins plays a greater role than earlier games, which makes it even more engaging and dynamic than before. Some phases (Dandori battles) reward good multi-tasking a lot. The levels are gorgeous. The caves' atmosphere and night expeditions create the feeling of insecurity in a very good way. Final boss is beyond fantastic.. PEAK. PERFECT GAME.. One of the best games in my opinion the variety of pikmin and bosses is amazing. Not perfect but it's definitely the most fleshed out Pikmin game. Wish the Glow Pikmin were given more love and their ""minigame"" had more survival-game aspects to it (was kind of the same thing over and over again) and I wish the game was harder. Level design wasn't as good as Pikmin 3 too imo. Overall very fun tho. Pikmin 4 is the opus so attedu by the players. It is a license known for its incredible gameplay and landscape but also for its relatively short lifespan. Unfortunately, Pikmin 4 is no exception and allows itself to remove game modes from the Wii U opus. We also note an absence of the player mode (which is nevertheless present in the Dandori mode) and a difficulty quite absent. Despite some welcome additions (night mode, ice pikmin, the return of the caves). Pikmin regresses by losing the good features of the 3 and the Deluxe by focusing on the main story. The adventure is still very good and is an almost-completion of the license but it’s a shame for the multi.. I had high hopes in this game. I really wish that it would be the best pikmin game with a 9/10 or 10/10 for me. However Nintendo implemented a bit too much new gameplay mechanics and unfortunately the Implemantion doesn't work well. The new night expiditions are a great addition, the rescue pup Otschin also. The Dandori fights on the other hand fells more like ther were added later in the developement cycle. Which as a result does not feel well implemented in the main game. It's the overall structure and the feeling that all the new additions in total doesn't really fit in together perfectly, who prevents me from fully enjoing the game as a whole. One example sums up my issue perfectly. In the last area of the main game there is one treasure which you can not collect, because you need one hundred purple Pikmin for it. To get these amount of Pikmin you have to collect the purple onion to generate new seeds. The thing is, to get the onion you have to complete two optional challenges, which are not needed to finish the main game. It is only necessary for one final treasure in the main game.. Nintendo released a great game on the Switch with the new title ""Pikmin 4"". Above all, fans and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy the title and numerous innovations. Especially the space dog Ochin is simply a joy to play. The possibilities of the new characters and Pikmin are also very well done and round out the gameplay. Thanks to the great controls and pretty graphics, you can experience many great moments in ""Pikmin 4"". Unfortunately, the great co-op mode from the predecessor has been dropped. If you would like to experience a new and interesting game on the Nintendo Switch, you should definitely check out the fourth part. In addition, there is a free demo version of the game to test.. A great addition to the pikmin series. However the tutorial is a painful experience.. You see me and my friend Pre-Ordered this game to see if it can improve the first three games, but to me and my friends it went down as a failure as it had numerous glitches and the controls were awful and so was the story.. Very addicting at first. I had a blast exploring all the big areas, looking for survivors and also treasures to make the ship's radar work 100%, but it may be archived too soon. After it, all items are revealed on the map and all you have to do, is ask the dog to sniff and show the exact position of any stuff you're looking for, automatically killing the challenge of exploration. Also, I find that the night and caverns segments are a bit repetitive. But anyways, very good overall, although it loses stamina from the halfway on.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good additions eh QOL. Controls/QOL confused/hate. New controls fair, no control binds. Newcomer friendly/no both audiences annoyed. Enemy health change fair. Moving bases great. Core QOL changed for 4 silly, newcomers play 1-3, confused with different controls/core mechanic changes (flowers/onions/snap aim, etc). Can adjust, but annoying. Area 3 water level detail. 3 Pikmin type bad balance excuse. Grey Thermometer hidden in charred magma hard to see. Piklopedia good, info/arena to view. Castaways missions for sparklium. Easier controls to learn, did lose features like dodge, rush is upgrade, multiple captains (Oatchi now) & more. Cast fine. Dialogue heavy. Some set scene, some not, when 'informing you' always ignored & don't need a reminder. Can't turn off. Not as frequent. Singleplayer + 2nd player assisting cursor. No Oatchi/crew for 2nd player for some reason. Play Dandori for 2p competitive. Or 3 Deluxe for co-op campaign. Dandori in story mode/side mode & can be challenge later (to showcase other mode/padding, fun though). Fair addition of side content/difference in caves. Caves are smaller/similar as 2 I think. Quick actions d-pad good, don't remember what assigned but on me. XD All 4 d-pad buttons & L stick in can bee rebound to menu options. Ice/Yellow in caves, Onion for flowers to change to flower priority? Lose PIkmin colour, game over. Rewind time. Bosses ok. Final ok but tough. Olimar fun mini Pikmin 1 mode. Candypop buds change Pikmin colour yay. 2nd area, specific cave in? Why? Main flowers change confused, do cycle in areas. Hub all red, newest onion colour though? No onion, hard early for Blue/Ice/Rock units. Pikmin throw limit, annoyed if want throw more than need, delayed once hits limit, wait then throw. Better camera/Aiming not. Level design good, exploration/objects (map many markers), problem is unlike past games where can go 'ok I can't do this/need to uncover' some days limit early on, annoying. Pikmin AI is fair/same awkward times. 'When' Oatchi can swim (5+ days in, earlier drowning/scared), or Ice Pikmin get Blues. An upgrade later to dive. Have the strength of 10 to 20 to 100 Pikmin is fair, rush, swim speed and other benefits. Less replayable, slows game down more. Have to wait for days to happen, caves to enter to allow new Pikmin (want ice pikmin to be able to get blue onion (thought needed pink flying Pikmin in later area but nope, learn in a first area cave). Constantly halting progress & 'when can do things' opens up once done. The tutorial is fine. Path to hub is fine, first area is extended tutorial. Let players learn as go. It's story/in battle 'when' can I do things 'Other M' problem in area 1. Opens up, odd start hours. Character creator fair options. Prefer preset character. Flowers change confusing why balance it? Once the onion of Yellow/Blue, etc. is collected of said colour it's fine. But when you don't have it the games is picky on enemies/flower pellets so caves only to start. 1-3 better. Until later areas? What odd change. Which if Ice/Yellow/etc. die (newcomer or not) that's unfair. Oatchi (upgradeable, early on 3 Pikmin strength in 1 strength, later 5 by default once grown up a few days in then with upgrades can go to 100 and helpful for water once they changed a few day in) 100 default unit count now 20 start. No 60 hard or 100 easy of 3 Deluxe. Now upgrades Not fan. Games show you can work without upgrades. Some helpful Oatchi/player. RPGs/upgrades can help, but felt like padding or 'follow industry' don't like. Felt lazy. Cut corners/time/copy paste then a smart decision. Not everything needs skill tree/shop. Pikmin isn't typical strategy game with buildings/other focus so upgrades makes sense. Why shop & organic day 1-5 Oatchi changes? No consistent rules surface/caves. Pikmin follow cave rules, then surface rules. Why? 2 counts (player/max) then 3 saying overall (onion only view). Crew (talk to, to view menus like treasures/gadgets/upgrades, Oatchi upgrades & more depending on the crew/castaways) Caves, while small & little different as Pikmin 2 are back. Night level are mini defence, fun, Glow Pikmin good use. Pin missions. Ice Pikmin (berry like obstacles/freezing water, can float, can't swim so balanced for Blue Pikmin, Oatchi when can dive and the rest their uses still). Sparklium used in gadgets/items/bridges (some core mechanics in past games, bit annoying, some nice & helpful, some new, some not). A joke, 1 cave had gap, pick up items, send in, return to gap, why? 1-3 bridge immediate.. Motion controls worse then 1-3. Snap & move around. A button throw & move around. That's not useful, it's restrictive. 'No option to change to original' so stuck with it. Old stick cursor (wish more flexible, ok in all games). Can swap to a gyro control cursor, but use case is restrictive, not ideal gyro aim change. Pikmin 3 Wii U controller/Wiimote aim higher, 4 limited. Upgrade for this? Nope. 1-3, 1+2 all control better.. Best game of the year so far! I enjoyed it even more than Zelda totk.. Pikmin 4 is a cute and charming game but handling all the different colors of Pikmin and a dog might be too much for kids. It's stylized graphics are lovely and the controls are mostly great though it still took me a while to get used to them. Even later in the game I fumbled them a bit. Difficulty is low but it still makes you feel bad in an otherwise soothing game, for messing up and killing those unquestioning loyal little critters, even as they die. What I didn't like are the unreasonable long loading times, given it isn't that demanding on a technical level, even considering it's a rather outdated hardware. Not even Tears of the Kingdom, which is a much bigger and more technical demanding game doesn't load as long comparably. I also HATE that you only have vertical splitscreen which is insufficient and confusing to play with, for a game that requires so much micro-management. I need horizontal splitscreen for a game like this to adequately keep track of all the things going on in those duels. It makes it even worse is that it's a solo thing too and an NPC isn't really that impacted from the lack of overview as a human would be, making it a disadvantageous predicament to the player. It's alright if you just wanna win it but not if you want to try for the gold or even just silver medal. If you want any better than Bronze, which is the minimal requirement to beat them (and progress) you better be VERY good at multi-tasking and micro-management. If you want the best medal - platinum, you better be (or become) a god in multi-tasking and micro-management. Not worth the suffering in my opinion. I personally would like that the game doesn't restrict me to 3 kinds of Pikmin in the levels because it means I have to keep going back and switch out my goofy little helpers. At least you get multiple bases, where you can place the dispenser to at least slightly improve it. I didn't like the Auto-Aim much. It got in the way more often than it helped and pretty much became useless as soon as 3 or more objects where near each other. If your on an over-tight time limit, with a limited number of Pikmin you need to micro-manage fast, it only causes problems that your Pikmin automatically start to carry objects when they touch them while walking or have other problems with path finding. A manual save (without quitting) would also have been appreciated but the system as is, is fair enough so not that big of a headache. You can even rewind the time a bit in case you did a major screw up. What is a headache though, is the timed challenges, even for just winning them you have way too little time. They should at least give you 15-30 more seconds, depending on the challenges. Otherwise it's a good difficulty but kids will likely find it too hard in parts and experts too easy and you cannot adjust it in any way. Over all it's a fantastic game and I still like it a lot. While there is no ""perfect game"" it could have a better quality-of-life to add to the enjoyment but it's a fun play that can be as short or as long as you want it to be. Until the postgame it's a 8/10 but the postgame timed challenges dumps it down to 5/10 because it accumulates all the flaws, minor as they may be by themself during normal play, in a hellish agitation. In the end though I settle with 7/10 because until post-game it's pretty good and while the post-game is part of the over all experience it's not the main intended game.. This is a 95% game. All Pikmin have returned in this game. You can use your pup, Oachi, to help you defeat enemies easier. You can use Diamonds to buy some items for you to upgrade for yourself or for your pup. You can also upgrade Oachi's techniques and abilities when talking to the captain. If you don't have enough pikmin to carry objects, Oachi can help them carry the objects much easier for you. You can ride on your pup to smack enemies and objects out of your way. When exploring, you can't just go anywhere you want to in the game. When you reach a certain area that's supposed to be a bridge, there is no bridge to cross. You have to make sure that you have enough diamonds to reach that area and have enough Pikmin to help build it for you. Your Pikmin have to go into one of the spaceships in the base area to recieve the bridge parts by making them pay for the diamonds first. You have to be patient when you're doing that, which I like. Going into the underground caves are a great way to recieve more items, beat tougher enemies, face bosses and find Castaways that you have to rescue. It's amazing that you have to use certain types of Pikmin depending on where you're going sometimes. The only thing i wish i saw in the game is when you have to collect fruit to make yourself a smoothie after the day is over each day. That was another to survive in the game. You had to make sure you had enough smoothies to drink each day. Dandori battle is the funnest mode in the game and it's another way for trying to rescue a castaway. You have to collect the most points as fast as you possibly can by having your pup and Pikmin snatch items from your opponents. Your opponents will do the same to you too. The music in the game is very relaxing. The only problem with this game is that sometimes its on the easy, but its excellent nonetheless.. This game takes pikmin 4 to a whole new level. You can wobble them. you can own a dog. louie is still mentally instable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing game. So far the best Pikmin game I've played. The immersive area, the enemies, and the introduction to Oatchi. Pikmin 4 is like the Super Smash Bros Ultimate of Pikmin. Everything is available, and it's amazing. It brings a good amount of challenges as well, not making it too easy. Although the survey corps can be a bit annoying, they can help you out as well, but always are bombarding you with messages and cutscenes. Although the game has a few flaws, it's still so amazing that Nintendo pulled this off.. this game is good the caves are better than 2 there are all the pikmin expect bulbmin my child where are you but this game is good. Amazing game! Hadn't played a pikmin game before this, but was really excited to try a pikmin game for the first time, and this game absolutely delivered. It was so fun to play through this game, still going through the post game though and it's been great so far. 100% would recommend 10/10 game. I feel like my summer vacation ended with this game. I really enjoyed this game, which was like a culmination of everything I've done so far. I like 2, but this time the system was really good. I am looking forward to the next one. Legendary game, cured my Dandori issues. 10/10 must play. If you don’t play it Fiddlebert will be at your house.. A BANGER!! I spend very good time on this game, and it was so cool!!! I really enjoy it!! All is perfect in this Pikmin 4! Congratulations Nintendo!. You are not a true gamer untill you play Pikmin -Videogame Dunkey This game is an odd one, as Pi",the pikmin franchise is by far the most underated one of Nintendo's game franchises . this one in particular took elements especially from Pikmin 2 and only made them better . it's unfortunate that so few people have played a Pikmin game .
713.Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Personally I don't get why this so critically acclaimed. It's not really a game at all. It's a visual novel with some point and click aspects. The plot isn't that great, doesn't go anywhere or have much of a coherent story. Your dialog choices don't really matter as far as I could tell and there's only one ending. Yes you could spend about an hour thinking about the meaning of it afterwards, but that's not really what gaming is about. The devs behind the game are art students, who were clearly more interested in making something that should be an arthouse film than a game. It's not unplayable or the worst thing out there but I just don't get the critics who believe this is the best thing ever.. Had this one wishlisted for a while and was excited to pick it up on sale, but I found it very underwhelming. The story didn’t have any real purpose or depth. It’s weird just for the sake of being weird and nothing else. Maybe I’m missing the point but this one’s definitely not for me.. I found it incredibly difficult to rate this game. I played it because I had previously played Mutazione and several reviewers of that game claimed that Kentucky Route Zero was a clear influence. I loved Mutazione so much that I paid the rather hefty price tag for Kentucky Route Zero but was ultimately disappointed to discover there's no real siilarity between the two games at all, beyond the fact that they are both essentially point & click adventures … which would be like saying that Monkey Island and Grim Fandango are similar games. They're really not. It gets even more difficult to review because, after a little while, I did start to get drawn into the game. I wanted to know more about the characters and what was happening. I was immersed, even if only for a short while. But sadly as the game went on it got more and more confusing, more and more abstract, until eventually I had literally no idea what was going on and it ultimately turned into a grind to simply reach the end. It was, however, very pretty in its own distinctive way. And the dialogue was compelling. It was just the story was so meta that my Switch nearly folded itself in half. A few other reviewers have compared Kentucky Route Zero to David Lynch's work, and I'm inclined to agree: I think that's a good comparison. If you enjoyed the likes of Rabbits, or the fever-dream inspired parts of Twin Peaks, then this game will be right up your alley. For everyone else, sadly, I'm not convinced there's very much to get excited about.. Conway works as a delivery man for an antique shop, and his final job before the shop closes for good is to be made 5 Dogwood Drive in Kentucky. After getting lost he stops at a gas station to ask for directions, and thus begins his adventure... Kentucky Route Zero is a point and click adventure that contains very little in the way of traditional puzzles, and instead focuses on telling it’s story. There is no doubt this game will divide opinion, and even as someone that liked the game, I have to admit there are times where it almost seems intentionally dull. On the other hand it’s unique style of storytelling routinely offers fascinating and incredibly memorable moments that’ll stick with me for a long time, and overall this proved a more than worthwhile experience.. I found kentucy route zero boring and tedious. I pushed myself to play for 2 hrs in light of the positive reviews but starting ACT 2 and being made to ride an elevator up and down several times to simply find an address without any real story or character development became far too monotonous for my liking (and i endeavour to always finish games I start). i had to give up on this one.. Some of the most poetic writing I’ve read in anything, let alone a video game. But it could only exist as a game, never a book or a movie. It lives in its medium perfectly, with unique perspective changes that may or may not align with the written words, and choices that make the player feel like a creator, while leaving one curious what they missed in choosing one answer over another. The music is inspired. The visuals are **** message speaks perfectly to the broken world we live in, the one not repaired since the 2008 recession that inspired this game. When someone asks if video games can be art, this is the game I will point to in response.. a grab bag of 20th century theater apeing and david lynch fanfic without any real art in sight, utterly painful. A dense piece of deeply experimental interactive literature, Kentucky Route Zero was released over a period of seven years. It's a unique game that touched people in ways that no other game could. PROS: - SETTLES THE ""ARE GAMES ART?"" ARGUMENT: You might debate whether KRZ is a game, maybe–but there's no doubt that it is art. The game's relentless, uncompromising experimentation resonated with a surprising number of people–and that's a reason to be hopeful about games as an art form. - GORGEOUS GRAPHICS AND SOUND: From the obsessively detailed low-poly environments to the fantastic sound work, there is a lot of beauty to savor in this game. - IT TAKES YOU PLACES: Kentucky Route Zero didn't always engage me, but when it did, it did it with power. Some sequences, especially the ones that involved songs, will be hard to ever forget. CONS: - THICK SYMBOLISM: The game sells itself as ""magical realism"", but it feels more like surrealism–and ten hours of surrealism in a row can be overkill. The most plain and mundane dialogues were often a welcome break from the endless waves of oniric weirdness. - SUBVERTS ONE EXPECTATION TOO MANY: The game takes joy in continuously subverting your expectations, and throws more experiments at you than a dozen experimental games. Sometimes that might be a bit too much, and alienate you from the story's protagonists. - TOO VERBOSE AT TIMES: Some sequences, especially in acts III and IV, simply drag out for too long. KRZ wouldn't have lost anything if the authors had cut one or two hours of content. I play games mainly because of the pleasure they give me. KRZ was beautiful, but not always pleasant–so I cannot honestly give it more than an 8. However, if you have any interest for interactive fiction or ""art house games"", then this is a milestone game that you can't miss.. More interactive novel than game, and that's a good thing. The depth of imagination on display is astonishing. A perfect experience.. This is a tough game to recommend because I know its appeal is niche but personally I loved it. One of my favorite games of 2020 :). If you're a fan of the magical realism genre then this is definitely worth considering. Be warned though that this is a basically a visual novel. You can walk through areas, interact with objects and make dialogue choices and there's some very simple vehicle sections but you're playing it for the story and the artstyle. The appeal for me comes from the strong character writing. I love how i'm able to shape a character's backstory as well as their choices and how that influences the story. It feels very much like i'm part of a living novel. The way different characters see their reality is conveyed in some interesting ways as well. It's a very unique game with some great music, a wonderful art style and a world which captivated me. Not for everyone but it might make a very big impression if you're the right audience.. Bar none one of the worst games I’ve ever played. Pretentious annoying claptrap that could be forgiven if there was any gameplay to speak of. Horrible. I have a **** felling gamers who are blown away with this game probably simply never read a book. Same as with ""What remains of Edith Finch"", this is not a game but a visual novel. KR0 might appeal to David Lynch fans - everybody else should approach it with suspicion.. This game is a masterpiece. But people should not expect the game to have some kind crazy wild gameplay. This is more relaxing breathe of fresh air where you can enjoy an immersive world. Narrative wise, this game is amazing. I mean i'm a gameplay kind of guy. I like to play games that have satisfying and innovative gameplay and this does not deliver them. But just from the game's narrative I'm willing to allow it. People need to understand the context of what this game is. It's not trying to wow you with gameplay but what it's trying to do is to create an immersive storytelling. It's not a game for everyone but I would advise to have everybody to at least try it once. It's a game where you can just chill with others while playing it. Wait for discount if you don't want to play for full price, but I would say this is a must buy.. An atmospheric game set in Kentucky that has some bad things to say about capitalism without meaningfully addressing a couple of capitalism's - and the setting's - connected comorbidities: racism and settler colonialism.. KRZ is more than a game, it’s a total artwork. Conceptual, cinematic, theatrical, poetic, musical, audio-visual... it’s an amalgam of the arts in video game form. The dialogue unfolds like poetry in motion, and the story goes to some unforgettable locations that seem to hang between dream and waking life. There’s an exhibition interlude, and several in-game concerts, stage plays and film pieces that the player watches or takes part in. A surreal masterpiece that transcends the format.. Doesn’t even classify as a game. Clicker on a rail. It started out well written and promising but each subsequent chapter made it obvious there was never a vision for the project from the get to.. **** boring! People should rethink about the word masterpiece...this is just a bla bla bla with no gameplay. Is not a video game, it's a time waster game. This game is one of the most beautiful, artistic and tragic games I've ever played. It's more like a great book than a video game. I loved every second of it and I can't wait to play it again.. The David Lynch analogy has been played to death, but I think it's apt in this case. Playing ""Kentucky Route Zero"" reminds me a lot of seeing ""Twin Peaks"" for the first time. I haven't seen something like this before, I'm not sure if it's ""good"" but I really, really like it. It tells a story in a way I haven't seen in any media. You KNOW that Kentucky Route Zero will change something for the game medium, but it will not spawn a lot of clones because it's to unique. Perhaps a different tone, a ""feel"" or just open up for new ways to tell a story, or even a new wave of art. You may very well tell your future kids about how you played Kentucky Route Zero back in the days.. Kentucky Route Zero is an absolute masterpiece. The characters and themes will both keep you up at night and put you soundly to sleep. I hope this game gets studied in literature classes, as its metaphors and character work and unparalleled even by works in other mediums. This is one of the many reasons the video game must be appreciated as an art form, and I have no doubt this game will be something to tell your kids about years ahead, or years soon to come.","it's not really a game at all. it's a visual novel with some point and click aspects . the plot isn't that great, doesn't go anywhere or has much of a coherent story . the story didn't have any real purpose or depth. it's weird just for the sake of being weird ."
714.Final Fantasy XVI,"One of the best games of 2023. really really enjoyable. It's also one of the best FF games easily. FF7 Remake/Rebirth are on same level.. Great addition to the FF series, this game made me cry, square is always gonna give you characters, story and a world to fall in love with.. This is not final fantasy anymore. This is devil may cry. But we want final fantasy like before just better in 3d with great gameplay and graphics. And graphics is like on ps3, too bad. I didn't finish the game, I sold it. Ff7 rebirth is much much better game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Meh. I've always loved the FF games and was excited for this one. There's a lot to like at first but the game gets very repetitive and boring. The maps are small and not fun to explore and not the combat is repetitive, no elemental weakness, no strategy, just dodge and use eikon abilities. The overall story is good but the cut scenes drag on and make me want to skip through dialogue. The side quests are boring. The best part of this game are the Eikon battles, they're breathtakingly beautiful and a lot of fun. I personally enjoyed FF XV much more than I did this game. The gripping story, (Even a bit disjointed as it was), the breathtaking scenery, dungeons, and hidden treasures made me want to explore every bit of the gorgeous map. Sure the combat was a little wonky but, the exploration into a truly living and beautiful world made up for it. This game had none of that and the combat system was not much better. The Eikon battles make it worth playing but, it's definitely not as much fun as FFXV or FF7.. Absolutely jaw dropping legendary beautiful story that will make you cry. Please play this game.. Game looks ok at a technical level, but it's overall a very bland, gray, boring world you evolve in. Characters are some of the most uninteresting in the FF series, and battle are way too easy. Or probably it gets a bit more challenging or interesting towards the end, but after 40 hours I started asking myself why I'm even playing this game, and I just put it aside. This is surprising how boring they made this game when you compare it to the FF7 remakes which are so much fun in comparison. It's like day and night. Given the high rating of this game I'm sure there's an audience for it though, maybe if you like more ""dark"" or ""adult"" games. They did put more blood and adult themes than in other FF games, but it just felt forced and most heroic fantasy games and media are already like this anyway these days, so nothing original.. This game is an excellent example of a story-driven action RPG. If you take FF7 Remake and skew it towards God of War style gameplay, you'll have a rough idea what to expect. It'd be a 10/10 if the music wasn't phoned in. Most boss fights use the same music, and it's awful for each and every single one.. One of the best Final Fantasy games I played in years. And this is coming from an avid FF fans, since FF 7 to this title, I have played them all. At first we can feel a bit boring due to the ""weak"" enemies, but the story make up for that. And boy you really have to have those DLCs, since that is where the real fight begins. Level 50 enemies like you never seen before. All in all a perfect score for a perfect Final Fantasy game. Cant wait what they will bring in FF 17, since it has the 7 namesake in it lol. Cheers!. Honestly one of the must mundane and generic games I've ever played. The story is great but the gameplay is basically mobile levels of depth. You spend more time watching this game than playing it. Such an overrated game.. Final Fantasy XVI takes a very different approach from its predecessors, both in terms of its battle system and storytelling style. As someone who has been a fan of the series since Final Fantasy VI, I’ve experienced entries that I absolutely loved and others that didn’t resonate with me enough to finish. First, let’s talk about the positives. The graphics are stunning, from the jaw-dropping Eikon battles to the richly detailed environments. The visual design truly elevates the experience. Some of the battle music ranks among the best in the series, offering thrilling and memorable tracks during key moments. Unfortunately, outside of those standout pieces, the soundtrack as a whole isn’t particularly memorable. My main issue lies with the storytelling. Initially, the pacing is excellent, pulling you into the narrative effectively. However, around the 30% mark, the momentum falters. The game begins to introduce numerous unrelated tasks that feel more like filler than meaningful progression. Many have compared it to an MMO RPG in structure, though I can’t personally confirm this as I haven’t played MMOs. Character development also feels lacking. While the characters are engaging early on, their arcs don’t have enough depth to carry the story through to the end, especially during the 40–50-hour runtime. By the final 10 hours, I found myself forcing my way through, hoping for an incredible conclusion. Unfortunately, the ending felt underwhelming, lacking the substance needed to tie everything together in a satisfying way. Overall, Final Fantasy XVI is still a good game, particularly if you’re looking for an action-focused experience. However, I wouldn’t classify it as an RPG in the traditional sense. I’d rate it a 7.8/10.. Bougth it on steam sale, And just got to say its one of the best games i played. The story is amazing with good build up to major events. Combat has a good flow and gets even better the more you progress. I Recommend playing it for sure!. Despite everything I'm about to complain about, I loved the game. Contradictory? I admit that the beginning excited me more, the political issues involving the Eikons eventually got sidelined by the whole 'Final Fantasy' thing, the end of the world, etc. Clive, for me, is the best protagonist in the FF series, truly incredible. As for the gameplay, I didn't like the crafting system, I hated the fact that you can't control or command the other party members, and the enemies not having elemental weaknesses (what was that idea?), the side quests are pretty weak. However, despite lacking these elements, which I always eagerly awaited when I played, I had a great time, devoured the game. But I wanted more. It could have been more.... Amazing Game Great Storytelling and Great DLC as well and good soundtrack and also great voice acting by Ben Starr. Cutting those meaningless time-consuming side quests off and it would be a great cinematic game (with extra 6fps and interactions). And ""no DLC planning"", haha knew that SE won't give up the easy money. Just use english voice and don't play on PC ported version.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the worst Final Fantasy game ever, it's a beautiful game, but the combat is horrendous, the side quests are ridiculous and even some main quests are ridiculous too, how did Square manage to make a game as good as FF7 and then come up with this ****. Boring plot, boring gameplay, boring characters. Gave up after Titan because it was so disappointing.. As someone who’s never played a Final Fantasy game before, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but Final Fantasy XVI blew me away. The story is epic and emotionally gripping, with complex characters and high-stakes drama that kept me hooked from start to finish. It’s a tale of war, betrayal, and redemption that feels both grounded and fantastical at the same **** visuals and graphics are absolutely breathtaking. Every cutscene looks like a high-budget movie, and the environments are so detailed and vibrant that they pull you into the world. The battles are another highlight—fast-paced, cinematic, and packed with adrenaline-pumping moments. The Eikon battles, in particular, are some of the most jaw-dropping sequences I’ve ever experienced in a game.Even as a newcomer to the franchise, I felt completely at home with the gameplay and story. It’s accessible while still offering depth, making it a perfect entry point for anyone new to the series.. First lets talk clearly, this is not an rpg, it is an action game with some minor rpg elements the combat is more like a watered-down version of Devil may cry, however it has all the typical elements of final fantasy; Crystals, chocobos, muggles, Cyd, etc. Clive is an unusal protagonist in the series, he is an adult,and sole playable character. Story starts a bit darker and more mature than most FF entries but ends in a very similar tone. The combat, while not as deep as hack and slash titles, it is a lot of fun and hitting snemies feel so satisfactory but the game shines in its soundtrack, every track is memorable. in short it is a good game just not a typical FF 8.5/10. the era of turn based rpgs is gone and good riddance. the battles in this game are the best final fantasy battles so far. the story is gripping and the characters feel real yet entertaining. it's easy to get lost in this game. I recommend if playing on pc to use mods to lower the output resolution of the game if doing that you should be able to run this on a 1070 and above. personally I played it on ps5 and the demo on a core ultra 5 125u but I got robocop for 30 bucks and I was playing on a laptop and was way out of spec. not that was why. Id probably buy out of spite just to say I could run it but the combat early on is fairly easy I wasn't able to complete the eikonic feats in the demo because that really requires keyboard and mouse. there is too much fuctionality crammed into this game to try playing on a laptop touchpad. is this game worth 60 dollars absolutely though when I could have bought it I think they were selling it for 50 dollars. well worth it. robocop is better though.. Many will say it’s not a proper final fantasy game and in truth there is merit to it but I for one is having a blast (do miss my fishing though) I think characters are engaging and I actually like the flow of the combat so I thoroughly recommend if you enjoy high fantasy media (eg game of thrones ). As a long time old fan of this franchise I had mixed feelings with this chapter. On one side we have very nice characters, a well written and entertaining story (even if not particularly original) a dynamic and stylish combat system, a great world building and an outstanding music score. On the other hand we have a ridiculous difficulty level with no real challenge, the lack of any real jrpg structure, no party management (companions are just mere puppets using boring auto attack patterns), flat fetch quest design for most of secondary ones and spots of bad pacing for the story progression. A final balance is for sure positive because overall it works and delivers emotions and fun, at least in some of its parts. But in my personal opinion there is always this feeling of a big missed occasion for squarsoft in delivering the series in the current-gen. Not recommended to hardcore JRPG fans.. This one is kinda tough. This game has some incredibly high peaks, but can also have moments of torturous slowness. The story is actually really good, the main characters are well written, the world is great, the plot has great Game of Thrones vibes with it's detailed world and fits nicely in dark fantasy without being edgy. The combat is very fun and gets more dynamic and flashier as the game progresses. The game is never really hard (outside the S rank bounty hunts) but it's engaging enough that you never feel like you cannot ever call it ""mindless"". The boss fights are the peak of this game, the spectacle and awesomeness of it is great without it feeling shallow as it very easily could be. One main issue I have is the side quests are so slow, and very uninteresting. A lot of them are talking to people back and forth and occasionally killing some mobs. Not all of them are bad of course, some of them have really cool rewards and some have decent little stories attached. And then there are several points where the main quest just slows down to a halt and it feels like a side quest. Also exploration isn't very rewarding as 90% of chests and stuff you find are crafting ingredients to make a slightly better sword you can easily buy. Since there is never a shortage of money in this game. Also the lack of in depth rpg mechanics is a bit disappointing to me. Most of the gear in this game doesn't make much of a difference in anything. And the level ups become very arbitrary as the stats feel less important the longer you go on. Since the bandits you fight at level 3 will come back when you are level 20 and will feel the exact same when you fight them. The only difference you feel in this game is when you gain new powers which are all cool but not very rpg like and more like a standard action game. Which hey if you are into that it's still pretty fun. Graphics are incredible on PS5 and the music is awesome. It's a solid game but not one I am eager to revisit until maybe I pick up the DLC and I need a break from any turn based games.. Story: good but not great. Characters: mostly good, especially Jill who is one of the best female characters in the series. Gameplay: pretty bad. The game is fairly linear, sidequests are boring and you are limited in what you can do in combat.. Final Fantasy XVI is a bold departure from the traditional Final Fantasy formula, introducing a darker and more mature narrative set in the land of Valisthea, a realm dominated by powerful crystals. Unlike the turn-based combat system seen in earlier entries, Final Fantasy XVI leans heavily into real-time action combat, making it more akin to action RPGs like Devil May Cry rather than traditional Final Fantasy games revolves around Clive Rosenfield, a character whose journey is intertwined with the political struggles between nations, the dominance of powerful Eikons (summons), and personal revenge. The game's narrative is deeply emotional, exploring themes of loss, betrayal, and the impact of power while maintaining the series’ iconic world-building. However, some pointed out that while the gameplay is engaging, the open-world elements are somewhat limited compared to other RPGs. The game is more linear in its progression, which could be a drawback for fans who expect the sprawling exploration that Final Fantasy has been known for in recent decades. Overall, Final Fantasy XVI ful reinvention of the Final Fantasy series, offering an engaging, action-packed adventure with rich storytelling and memorable characters. For those looking for a fresh take on the franchise with a more adult tone, it’s a must-play.. Game is fun to play. Narration is good. Characters are good. Very beautifull. It is more a beat them all than a RPG. You have a hub and you have to teleport. It is not a real journey like other Final Fantasy.. aside from some pacing issues in the mid/latter half of the game it's fantastic. great story, best ff protag by far, amazing cast of characters, great fights. gonna start my ng+ run after this review. Really poor game. Graphics are 8/10 top. The game is absolutely lineal. The fights are super easy. the only cool thing is the invocations. Even the story is poor. The main character is not likeable at all. is not a bad game, but is a bad FF. Great narrative, terrific characters, impactful themes and emotionally hard-hitting story beats. People who say the side quests are a waste of time or that there is no character development in this game have simply paid 0 attention to the story, because it has it in spades. Even the so-called ""bad"" side quests add to the worldbuilding and the lore of the game's setting, and the ""good"" sidequests develop the cast of side characters in the Hideaway and elsewhere that forms a fundamental part of one of the game's main themes: community. That's not to mention that Clive's character progression throughout the game is the most well-done out of any FF protagonist in the series. For me, the action-focused mode offered enough challenge to keep the gameplay fun and engaging throughout, though I can understand how character action veterans might feel it's too easy. The boss fights are the best spectacles I've ever experienced in a game, and the OST is out of this world. All in all, this is one of my favorite games of all time.. This game was fun for around 16 hours, but after that, the developers slowed the story down by making us do a ton of side quests, which wasn’t enjoyable. Also, the cutscenes were frustrating—why do the characters overact with useless movements every time? What bothered me most was that there was no sprint button until almost the end of the game. I ended up skipping cutscenes just to finish the game faster. Overall, it became boring. Great graphics! The music is also great. Use your headphones to hear the sound of Clive's leather shoes hitting the ground. Battle Titans and Bahamut using a 4k HDR monitor. It's an unforgettable experience. The game has evolved so far.. The game has inherent flaws that keep it from masterpiece label. Charscter development is non existent. Equipment i doesn’t matter. Side quest are a waste of time mosty. But some parts of the game aresome of the best game experiences I’ve ever had. The eikon fight cinematography is just insane. Even withthe Dumbfounding flaws the devs made this game is my favorite ff entry bc it’s grittier darker more realistic feel.. The best way to phrase it - genuinely boring and a heartbreaking display of wasted potential and a dying franchise. Visually and musically it is stunning, but it does not make up for a game that pads itself with filler, mostly boring characters (there are some exceptions) and gameplay that is similar to devil may cry but without any soul to it. I do have to compliment the eikon battles though as these were a nice break from the overall monotony.. Definitely a fun game, but lacks content of a true FF game. No fun side games or activities to sink hours into.. A soulless game with no purpose. You just keep mashing the square button over and over to trigger a brief scene, only to have to pause it and press triangle. This goes on like this throughout the entire game. Character development? Irrelevant. Equipment? Also irrelevant. Sadly, this is the last game from the series I’ll be buying…. Started off good but after 14 hrs of playing the gameplay never feel more complex than mashing buttons until enemies die. The characters, particularly Clive, has decent enough writing if not a little boring at times. There's also some annoying main quests that feel like a distraction from the plot. Like going somewhere to talk to 5 different people I've never met before and will forget the second I leave.. Final Fantasy XVI takes a different turn when it comes to the original formula of the franchise. The darker and more mature elements of the story adds to the flair of the game which is backed by intense visuals and an all-rounded story. Characters may seem shallow at times but this is solved by how alive the world feels. The nature of Final Fantasy remains but the tone should not have players treat it as such.. Combat is very engaging, does get a little bit repetitive towards the end of the game with less new enemy types but you buy the game definitely for the engaging combat.. A great action game. The story is superb. The music is phenomenal. If you do not think that this is a RPG game, it is solid 10/10.. I've been waiting for a LOOOOONG time for his to come to **** i can say it's worth the **** even 10 hours in this is just peak gaming for me. The best part is how even my Final fantasy hating friends are getting into this cause of the setting and gameplay....thats how you know you've done good to refresh the series.. FF16 is a game that when it wants to be a masterpiece, it is, but when it isnt, prepare to be bored. The story is above average, characters were fun and plot was there but everything feels off, clive's try for redemption felt very out of character and i wanted to see more of wyvern too, it has a lot of filler too, it semt that they wanted to give a lot of characters deepness but lack of any truly meaningfull quest, acting or moments made them feel very unimportant. Still there are a lot of moments that are really good and that makes you snap out but only when the game wants to be incredible. Side quests mostly **** so hard but the ones that are marked as important side quest are so good that makes you wonder why they arent part of the main story. Gameplay is simplified DMC, combat is really fun and there is a lot of room for combos, id say what annoyed me the most was unlocking the eikon powers which felt fast at the beggining, 1 or 2 powers trough the middle of the game and then the rest at the end. The worst part of this game is the technical aspect, it barely runs on ps5, i dont mind the 720p drop in combat since i cant notice it there and with all the effects and how fast paced it is you really dont note it, only in the tutorial combat because its very slow there and it maintains 60 fps, now open world looks atrocious, very blurry paired with a unstable framerate that easily goes down to the 40s, so then play the 30fps mode? NO this is an action game of DMC caliber playing it in 30 is just worse even if it looks better. RPG mechanics here are nonexistent, you can have more armor, and more weapon damage and thats about it, the only thing that changes the game a bit is the talismans but a lot of them are reduced to better or cooldown or more healing and because of this side quests feel incredibly unrewarding with the exception of those marked as important. It has a lot of annoying things but the combat and the bosses are top notch without a doubt. I must say the tone was interesting for a game, its pretty dark, but for a FF? Really dark and executed well in my opinion. The veredict?, just like the beggining all of those moments, sequences and misions that were made with care is some of the best gaming out there (and it has my fav mission OAT) but whats in the middle of those moments is a whole nothing burger which is only tolerable because of the combat. Id buy at 24 maybe if you are a really big fan 34. Also try the demo.. Yes, the game I purchased my PS5 for in the first place. My excitement for this game was insane, and after platting the game, I can definitely say I was NOT disappointed. This game, from how good it looks, to how fun the combat can get once you truly get it down, and the boss fights that you will never quite forget, is EXTREMELY well made. I can't use the word masterpiece, though. The game does have slight issues. Side quests feel tedious for the most part, some exceptions but not enough to fix the issue, the open areas aren't worth exploring unless you are doing hunts (even then there isn't much to find in the overworld), and the game does NOT have any semblance of difficulty in the base game. Not even in NG+. DLC ramps it up a bit, but nothing to where I was struggling. That last bit is 100% down to preference, but my other two criticisms are enough to knock the game a point, cause they are truly THAT egregious. With all of that being said, I believe those who can experience this game, should. If you don't like a slower game? I wouldn't bother. If you are into awesome cinematic fights, a dope battle system, and characters that will always keep you engaged, this game is worth the spin!. Amazing game. Contender in my mind for the best Final Fantasy game in the entire series. The story is enthralling and for once there aren't any characters that get on my nerves. The lore is deep and is well written. The atmosphere is great and the devs take things seriously for a change. At first I thought the change to action combat would detract from the tone of the original games but I may actually like it better now that i've gotten used to it.. why doesn't anyone care about evidentiary review bombing? Dozens of similar reviews rated 0-1 and no one addresses it. This is how a game is supposed to have a completely different user score and please by this MT, someone fix it.. Final Fantasy XVI Final Fantasy XVI is an excellent game that is worth playing at least once. The story is complex and requires a lot of reading, which is a bonus for lore enthusiasts like me. Typical Final Fantasy fans might need some time to adapt to the changes in gameplay and structure. This game is not an open-world adventure; rather, it features a linear progression with open areas to explore. Gameplay - this isn’t your typical Final Fantasy game. It leans more towards an action-oriented style, reminiscent of Devil May Cry. The gameplay feels fresh, and the boss fights are spectacular and memorable. My favorite is Bahamut. The setting and tone of FF16 are also intriguing, with a darker theme that suits the narrative of war and sacrifice. Graphics and Performance - The graphics are beautiful, and the art direction is on point. I played in 60 fps mode, which can be annoying due to the blurry image, but the game definitely benefits from the smoother performance. Quests and Pacing - The quests in FF16 are a bit of a letdown. While some are well-written, others fall into the fetch-and-kill category. The pacing is inconsistent, particularly slow at the beginning and also in some chapters as well. I would rate this 8.5, but it definitely leans towards a 9 (extra point due to the OST and music in this game is rock!).”. I Gave it a 9, ive played it two times on PlayStation and gotten the platinum, the eikon battles are really the highlight of the game but that doesn’t mean you can sleep on the story, this is a top final fantasy story that I believe can even be built on because of the end if you know, I would give it a ten but the only thing holding me back is the first half of the side quest of fetch quest and are fairly boring, the second half though are some of the best written side quest I have ever played they seem like it’s gonna be another of the same thing but then they turn into something deeper and surprise you and also I feel there is too much filler in between eikon battles, because I played it two times the first time it wasn’t bad but the second I realized that a lot of the time it drags on for too long for little to nothing other then that the game is wonderful and it’s a game I platinumed and enjoyed all the way through!!! I recommend you buy it, it’s worth the 70 dollars and it’s a steal on sale for 30 go get it don’t sleep on it. The game overall looks ok with cool graphics, character designs and the sound/music is good as well. However, it's extremely easy and dull where using shiny combos are just visual for the sake of looking shiny and cool. Overall, it has one of the worst combat systems I have ever seen.. Not quite perfect but with a few tweaks this could've been! Great story, great gameplay, if you wish to engage with it, side quests could've been better and interactions with the world but apart from that its a great entry. (Oh and probably some of the best spectacle boss fights since old school GoW). a beautiful combat system, spectacular boss fights and aesthetics. Too bad everything else just falls apart, from a narrative that doesn't stand the prologue premises to an useless open map structure. A missed chance with some very high peaks. Langston Abdullah on: Final Fantasy XVI marks a bold new direction for the iconic series, blending its traditional elements with a darker, action-oriented narrative and gameplay. Set in the war-torn world of Valisthea, the game follows Clive Rosfield, a young knight whose life is irrevocably changed by the powerful Eikons (summoned beings) that shape his world. The narrative centers around Clive’s quest for vengeance and redemption, delving into themes of fate, power, and **** story is rich and complex, featuring a cast of well-developed characters and a deep, engaging plot. The mature and darker tone is a departure from the more whimsical elements seen in previous entries, offering a more grounded and intense experience. The political intrigue, personal vendettas, and dramatic conflicts are woven together with cinematic flair, keeping players invested in Clive's journey.Gameplay in Final Fantasy XVI is a significant departure from its turn-based roots, embracing a real-time action combat system reminiscent of modern action RPGs. The combat is fluid and dynamic, with Clive wielding a variety of abilities and summoning powers from the Eikons. This system allows for fast-paced, exhilarating battles, blending swordplay with magical abilities. Players can customize their combat style through a range of skills and equipment, making each encounter **** game’s visual and audio presentation is top-notch, with stunning graphics that bring the world of Valisthea to life. The environments are richly detailed, from lush forests to war-torn landscapes, and the character designs are striking and memorable. The orchestral score complements the epic scale of the story, enhancing the emotional weight of key **** of the standout features is the Eikon system, which introduces powerful abilities and summons that can turn the tide of battle. These Eikons play a crucial role in both combat and the story, adding a layer of strategic depth and spectacle to the gameplay. The relationship between Clive and these Eikons is central to the narrative, offering dramatic and visually impressive moments.Despite its strengths, Final Fantasy XVI may not appeal to everyone, particularly long-time fans of the series who prefer the classic turn-based combat and more whimsical settings. The shift to real-time combat and the darker tone represents a significant change, and while it adds depth and intensity, it might not resonate with all **** conclusion, Final Fantasy XVI is a compelling and ambitious entry in the series, offering a gripping story, dynamic combat, and impressive visuals. Its mature themes and real-time combat system provide a fresh take on the franchise, making it a must-play for fans seeking a more intense and action-oriented experience. While it represents a departure from traditional elements, it successfully delivers an engaging and memorable RPG experience.. PROS 1. Beautiful graphics. CONS 1. The Battles are to easy and tedious; 2. Weak and predictable story; 3. 90% of the side quests doesn't make sense. I miss the time when FF are a great JRPG.. This game has a lot of good to great moments in it. There is a very compelling game somewhere in here for some people. But for me, it's simply above average. It has fun combat, good graphics, good music, and high quality production of it's story cutscenes. The characters are flat. There is no party customization/interactivity. There is only barebone itemization. The towns and locations are some of the most forgettable in series history. The narrative is big and bloated, but also somehow shallow. This game lacks heart. It takes 65 hours to complete with over 20 hours of cutscenes. Not too bad. But there's no RPG elements. It's an overly long action game pretending to be a mainline Final Fantasy RPG. Overall, it's still worth buying and playing because it's good quality. It lacks a vision, but it's still fun to play. If you like bombastic, epic, flaming anger and just feel like punching god with a lowercase g in the face, you should play. The game is very, very accessible. If you're looking for an action RPG Final Fantasy to sink your teeth into, with plenty of things to do and engaging tactical gameplay, you should play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.. Such a great story, well written main characters and a wonderful soundtrack, the whole inside a dark fantasy world which has its own aesthetic that doesn't shy away from handling hard themes. However, there is some weak points here and there ; the game can feel a bit slow at times within some parts of the story, side quests are forgettable for the most part and I'd have like more effort put into the writing of some characters that are important in th","FF7 rebirth is one of the best games of 2023 . overall story is good but the cut scenes drag on and make me want to skip through dialogue . characters are some of the most uninteresting in the FF series, and battle are way too easy ."
715.Half-Life 2: Episode One,"The continuation of one of the best games and one of the best continuations. Wake up Mr. Freeman. Half-Life 2: Episode One is the continuation of Half-Life 2's story. It picks up right where Half-Life 2 left off. It's mostly the same of what you already had in Half-Life 2; fun combat and interesting maps. I feel as if in Episode 1 the developers were brave enough to build more creative maps that demand elements which were mostly forgotten about in the original Half-Life 2. Like, for example, during the first part of this game you have no proper weapon (i will get to this again later), and you have to navigate a dark tunnel full of zombies alongside Alyx. In Half-Life 2 you never really had to use your flashlight, but now you need it to bring light into the darkness and enable Alyx to kill the zombies for you. Besides this there a two things i'd like to point out which i disliked:1) This game is a lot more linear, or at least it felt this way to me. In Half-Life 2 there were often split paths you could go down and explore, while this game is basically one straight line. This is further solidified by the fact that this game has wayyy more ""wait whilst the story is being explained"" type moments. More often than not you have to listen to Alyx talk while she does the important things, like fiddling with the computers to get you going. I feel like the orignal Half-Life 2 better integrated these moments into the gameplay loop.2) Is the aforementioned weaponry in this game. There is one achievement in this game called ""The One Free Bullet"". To gain this achievement, you have to play through the entirety of Episode 1 whilst only firing one singular bullet (you have to shoot a lock off at one point). And like mentioned, the only weapon you have for the first few chapters is the gravity gun. I suppose this game was heavily built around this achievement, which, on one hand is pretty cool because it forces you to think of creative ways and use the physics to your advantage, but on the other hand is rather not so cool because Half-Life has a great gun feel and choosing to use the gravity gun should be a decision the player makes. More often than not i found myself cornered and beaten by zombies, because i couldn't properly defend myself with the explosive barrels without killing myself, **** the end, Half-Life 2's Episode One is not a must. If you enjoyed Half-Life 2, and particularly want to know how the story goes on after the cliffhanger, then you should get this game. If you don't care about the story, then don't. Final Score: 8/10. A game riding on its predecessor's coat tails. This chapter was likely necessary to continue the plot, however, it was pretty rough as a whole. It felt like a pretty standard run and gun game made by an indie studio. In the Half Life 2, there were a lot of new mechanics introduced with a bunch of quick action puzzles in between. HL2E1 had 2 real mechanics and 1 puzzle that I can count, and that puzzle was in the 1st level. The first of the mechanics was ""Dark"". Whereas HL2 was pretty well lit with the occasional need for the flashlight, HL2E1 spends half of the game in pretty much complete darkness. The other mechanic was pretty fun to figure out, but not going to spoil it, it involves the ant lions. There were really only 2 wow moments in the game, and they were interactive cut scenes, in the first five minutes and the last five minutes of the game. The game had some pretty rough platforming sections, committing the cardinal sin of putting platforms just out of jump distance, leading to a cheap death. Other platforming sections required some pretty precise timing in a game where platforming is not its forte. HL2 I never felt that I suffered a cheap death. HL2E1 I felt like I suffered nothing but cheap deaths, with mines and kamakaze enemies everywhere. Honestly, a lot of the gameplay elements felt like ""Hey guys, how long is the game? it ships tomorrow."" ""Uhhh... about an hour..."" ""Well then, I guess you will just have to put in a bunch of things to slow the players down."" ""Like?"" ""How about an escort mission that you have to run the same course 5 times."" Overall, the game is honestly more frustrating than fun, and a pretty big let down compared to HL2.. As always, amazing game. I think it is a little worse than the past parts because it feels like a very big part of the game is just in the citadel plowing through a ton of enemies at once which is pretty boring on the long run. Later on, the game resumes to the jumpscares from the past parts. The final encounter and cliffhanger in the end is amazing. Of course a must play for every individual on this planet.. Very good episode and a must play for every Half-Life fan. Play more Half-Life guys!. Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 8/10; Atmosphere: 6/10; Music: 9/10; Summary rating: 8/10. Half-Life 2: Episode One is a sequel to the exciting sci-fi shooter developed by Valve Corporation. However, compared to the previous part, Episode One leaves mixed impressions.Visually, the game can be called excellent. Landscapes, detailing of the surrounding world and architecture all emphasize the atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic Citadel. The Source graphics engine continues to be impressive and presents itself in full glory.However, Episode One's gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. The action and thought puzzles are pretty standard and offer nothing new or original. In addition, the length of the walkthrough is quite short, which makes the game feel unfinished. In addition to this, there are tangible consequences of the lack of a multiplayer mode, which limits players' options.Episode One's storyline is somewhat disappointing. While it is a direct continuation of Half-Life 2, it offers no new twists or reveals important plot details. The characters also remain flat and uninteresting, failing to evoke much emotion from **** game's soundtrack is on a high level. The sounds of weapons, voice actors and music perfectly match the game atmosphere, emphasizing the dramatic moments and enhancing the emotional component.Despite all the above-mentioned shortcomings, Half-Life 2: Episode One remains an attractive game for fans of the series and fans of sci-fi shooters. However, it falls short of the high standards set by its predecessors. In the end, I would give Episode One a score of 6 out of 10.. there are no new guns in this its just more half-life. other then the story its pretty boring compared to half life 2. Half-Life 2: Episode One, released in 2006, continues the compelling narrative of the Half-Life universe, seamlessly picking up where Half-Life 2 left off. This episodic addition to the series is a tightly crafted and intense experience that keeps players engaged from start to finish. The game starts immediately after the events of Half-Life 2, with players once again in control of Gordon Freeman, the iconic scientist-hero. Episode One focuses on the aftermath of the catastrophic events in City 17 and the journey of Gordon and Alyx Vance as they try to escape the city before it's destroyed. The narrative is a rollercoaster of tension, emotional moments, and revelations, and it successfully deepens the player's connection to the characters and the world. Episode One retains the same excellent gameplay mechanics that made Half-Life 2 a classic. The physics-based puzzles and combat sequences are as engaging as ever. The Gravity Gun remains a central tool, allowing for creative problem-solving and dynamic combat scenarios. The game introduces new enemy types, adding variety to combat encounters and requiring players to adapt their strategies. What sets Episode One apart is its focus on cooperative gameplay with Alyx Vance, who accompanies Gordon throughout the adventure. Alyx is more than a mere escort; she is a capable ally, providing cover fire, assistance with puzzles, and emotional depth to the story. The AI-controlled companion is remarkably well-executed and enhances the overall experience. The level design in Episode One maintains the series' high standards. The environments are richly detailed, with a mix of claustrophobic indoor sections and open outdoor areas. The pacing is expertly crafted, with moments of intense action, quiet exploration, and storytelling seamlessly intertwined. The visuals, while not revolutionary for its time, still hold up well today. The Source engine's capabilities are leveraged effectively to create a believable and atmospheric world. The sound design and voice acting continue to shine, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. Episode One's length may be its only drawback, as it can be completed relatively quickly compared to the main Half-Life games. However, this brevity also ensures that the experience remains tightly focused and consistently engaging. In conclusion, Half-Life 2: Episode One is a superb continuation of the Half-Life 2 narrative. Its seamless integration with the main game, compelling storytelling, cooperative gameplay, and stellar level design make it a must-play for fans of the series. While it may be shorter than its predecessors, it doesn't compromise on quality or impact.. Despite some possible system freezes, this game absolutely rocked. I will play it again and again. Hopefully an update will be available soon.. They kinda dropped the ball with this one as far as I'm concerned (compared to HL2 and HL2:EP2 it is not as good), but still a pretty good game. Besides that, you need to play it before you go to Episode Two, which is one of the best games ever made.. What a **** DLC! It's full of puzzles and still has a horrible setting, it's totally the division offered by half life 2004. Really good but has the same style and architecture so it gets kind of boring, some of the bossfights feel drawn out and it doesn't have that same story-building that draws you forward automatically in other VALVe titles and the other Half-Life 2 parts.. I just don't see myself replaying this in the future unless it's for a Half-Life marathon or something. Still good though and I'm excited to hop into episode 2.. Episode One's intense action, seamless storytelling, and improved AI make it a worthy continuation of the Half-Life 2 saga.. THE BEGINNING OF THE END BEFORE WE BEGIN: Half-Life 2: Episode One is a continuation of the story after the ending of the base game, deepening the rivalry between Gordon Freeman and his allies against the Combine forces. Episode One was developed by Valve Softwares in 2006 and is their first game to take advantage of the power of HDR technology, previously tested with Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. ODD VISIONS: The game, being a continuation of a cliffhanger, begins abruptly, seeing Gordon Freeman and Alyx escaping from the Combine tower due to the events seen in Half-Life 2. The player starts off with only the energy manipulator, which soon transforms into its electric version. Being a stand-alone game, the beginning is built to be playable even by those who had not played the first one, offering the typical Valve learning curve. RUN FREEMAN RUN!: The gameplay of the first episode of Half-Life 2 is divided into two focal points. The first is the level design, i.e., everything including the puzzles and the approach to the game map, which is extremely superior to the first title. The introduction of several new mechanics brought a breath of fresh air that the first title needed. The second point, on the other hand, is the lack of new weaponry, which certainly brings boredom to anyone who played the first title and was already a limitation of Half-Life 2 compared to the first one. New enemies have also been added with this chapter, leading to new uncomfortable situations and consequently different approaches to combat. Finally, the plot turns out to be simply a continuation of the combat against the Combine forces, not leading to particularly interesting intrigue and ending with another cliffhanger that will introduce the second episode. RED SKY AT NIGHT, SHEPHERD'S DELIGHT: Aesthetically, apart from the addition of HDR, and thus improved in-game lighting and shadows, the graphics and models turn out to be identical to those of the first chapter. “WE’LL SEE ABOUT THAT”: As with the graphics, the audio part turns out to be the same as Half-Life 2, with the addition of several new original OSTs. BUT WHY 9? PROS: The pros of this title are numerous. The level design has been enhanced and improved a lot compared to the first title, but most importantly it has been thickened so as not to create boring void zones, which were present in the first title. In addition, there are numerous interactions and surprises in the puzzles that are very surprising. In addition, the game areas are, at least personally, much more interesting than those in the first one, even adding more frightening and anxiety-provoking areas based entirely on the use of the flashlight being completely immersed in darkness. CONS: The cons, on the other hand, besides the lack of new weapons, lies in some extremely boring game situations, such as the train part, where the player is required to go from point A to point B more than five times. Also, there are too many situations where the player is required to stand still to listen to dialogues, making those phases much more boring and lowering the tension and atmosphere. RATING Gameplay: 10+ Music: 8 Story: 9 Level Desing: 10+ _. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 8. This is the game you'd expect if you asked a much less talented team to imitate the original. It feels more like a collection of extra maps for HL2 than a real Valve game. There's none of the original's creativity. No new mechanics, weapons, or enemies. No interesting new puzzles. The challenge also feels less organic and more gimmicky. The original kept ambushes to a minimum. Here there's a horde of enemies waiting silently for you around every other corner. The original rewarded you for finding creative approaches. Here you just have to brute force fight your way through every encounter. The original gave you scenarios that Gordon was well suited for. Here there's a whole section that's pitch black, where the challenge comes exclusively from the deficiencies of Gordon's flashlight. Basically, the developers substituted trolling and spam for creative and organic challenge. It's not too hard or too easy compared to the original, but it'll leave you saying ""oh come on"" with some regularity.. Good Things(+) -main Story -gameplay İt Could Be Better Bad things(-) -play time on record:4h. It still good since its half-life, but its not as interesting. Only 1 new enemy and you don't approach differently to other enemies but the dark gimmick is quiet fun.. It starts with one thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mockin' me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so far Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter. (I played this game with MMod.) A continuation of the excellent Half-Life 2 story with a few new levels. The levels are well constructed but feel very much like those in the main Half-Life 2 game. The star of the show is your sidekick Alyx, who is a superb AI partner with a genuinely likable personality. Unfortunately, the grievances I had with vanilla Half-Life 2 remain, which include too many checkpoints (which makes dying inconsequential) and the fact that explosive stuff is disproportionately dangerous.. A good one another HL chapter, but, as for me, against the backdrop of other HL chapters — the most faded one.. Episode One's biggest problem is its short length, but that same downside is the reason for a more focused game with better pacing than the original.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is truly incredible for its time and I fully respect the fans of this game. But I was bored. In this episode finished more puzzles and nothing more. But I liked the finale.. A short little story, but I explained allegedly happened after the explosion of City 17. Back to the Same, ie same graphics, same characters and same gameplay. This does not prevent is good because if it's the same this never bored. It is kind of dlc of that time? Anyway it is a great game, though the name EPISODE ONE is a little weird.. For Xbox 360 Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 8 Music: 8 Story: 9 Total: 8.67. Not as good as the original Half-Life 2 but still an awesome game. Must-play for every Half-Life fan.. Half-Life 2: Episode One is kind of the black sheep of the Half-Life 2 games. It is a good game in it’s own right but it lacks the innovation of Half-Life 2 and it lacks the story of Episode 2 which is by far the best story arc of the whole series in my eyes. So we are left with a good game that is sadly forgotten in the mix by many because it is the middle child. All of the same great game play is back in Episode One. The story in itself is good and enjoyable. City 17 is now a war zone and the game revolves around trying to escape it. The graphics are just as good as Half-Life 2, no better but no worse. The game doesn’t have any of the driving sections of the original. There is however a great level taking place in a hospital which was almost as creepy as Ravenholm. I played Episode One on Linux. It never crashed on me. There are once again some AI issues. This time what happened to me was on a mission where I have to lead civilians to a departing train some of them got stuck in a wall corner and wouldn’t proceed making me have to reload a previous save. Outside of the AI issue I noticed no other bugs. There were 4 AA settings; 6 AF settings; a V-Sync toggle; 9 other graphics options and an FOV slider that went from 75-90. You could change the difficulty level at any time as well as manually save at any time. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t surprising given the game’s age. Graphics Engine: Source Graphics API: OpenGL Disk Space Used: 1.05GB (not counting HL2 base game) Graphics Settings: All Highest; 8x AA; 16x AF; blur off; V-Sync on; multi core rendering on; HDR full; 90 FOV; 1920x1080 GPU Usage: 16-52 % VRAM Usage: 1022-1398 MB CPU Usage: 5-20 % RAM Usage: 2.7-3.3 GB Frame Rate: 137-144 FPS Overall I can’t say too many negative things about Episode One. It does it’s job well which is to further the Half-Life story. It doesn’t innovate but it also doesn’t make anything worse. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty in 3 hours and 48 minutes. My Score: 8.5/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 21.2.5 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 21.2.0 | Mate 1.26.0 | Kernel 5.15.2-2-MANJARO | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz. I can say about the episode that it is very interesting, there are not enough changes, the gameplay has become much more dynamic and the whole game will be accompanied by Alix, who will help us in battle and comment on everything that happens. The main disadvantage is that the first episode is very short. Also appeared, a new type of zombie Zombine,he can get a grenade and run to you to blow you up. Although the game turned out to be short, it turned out to be very interesting for one thing. I recommend you go!. Episode One is a great ride for Half-Life fans but its short length definitely turned down some people at the time. It has some of the most iconic and memorable character moments with Alyx and the adventure feels more gruesome and intense compared to the original title. There's a sort of urgency throughout the game that pushes you to continue through some of the scariest places in Half-Life's dark world and Valve's brilliant art and level design really show themselves during this chapter. Alyx's AI had a great jump making her a real companion during the game and seeing a corrupting City 17 really gives me shivers everytime that i go through it. There are still moments of challenge when the game puts you through some disturbing and unnerving moments making this chapter still a memorable piece from Half-Life's cryptic world.. It was good. Pretty much just Half Life 2 but a bit more. It was a bit short but Episode 2 makes up for it. Play it. The AI also improved well and Alyx is a great character to lighten up the mood.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first episode of Half-Life 2 is more great Half-Life 2 and still tremendously enjoyable. But it's rather short. I finished it in five to six hours in my first playthrough and three to four hours in the next ones. That might be my only issue with this episode, other than that it continues the story flawlessly.. A great sequel to its predecessor, Half-Life 2, but it couldn't beat it, it's a great game and I recommend it for anyone to play.. The first episode of Valve's episodic nature to continue the story certainly was a brilliant piece of first-person shooting but it lacked the true diversity and innovation that Half-Life 2 brought with itself. Episode 1 had some very high moments in particular the hos3and the core and also some meh ones but in general the levels were executed perfectly. The best feature that this game added to the franchise was Developer Commentary; hearing all these fascinating behind the scenes stories was so refreshing. Episode 1 did improve some of the flaws from the base game such as the poor ally AI or interacting with the antlions and etc. In general Episode one feels and plays like a lesser experience but the writing and art direction simply makes up for it; the atmosphere of each Half-Life 2 title just gets better and better and Episode 1 is no exception.. I never liked Valve's idea of episodic entries but hey that was their choice. I'm just giving my idea about it. The first episode of Half-Life 2 definitely puts you in some memorable and immersive moments but it isn't the perfect Half-Life 2 that i was expecting. The episode's length is surprisingly short and i finished the whole thing in two days. The lack of environmental variety and new weapons definitely is present but as this is more Half-Life 2, i won't take that into consideration. Episode one is definitely worth playing but its length may disappoint some of the players.. It's still Half Life, so it's an amazing experience right away.A little too short but a very cool game. One of the best games ever. This is required playing if you love Half Life! It actually raps up the ending to Half life 2 without stringing you along which is always a good thing. Its just long enough to not feel short and there's enough story that i definitely feel like a got my moneys worth with this one. The Gun-play carries over from Half life 2 and still is amazing and it seems they fixed a lot of the clipping issues I was having with the original. So all in all this games deserves the attention it got and still gets every day by the gaming community that loves and cherishes it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really short and not as good as hl2. Mostly about escorting npc's to certain locations.. A little too short but a very cool game. One of the best games ever IMHO. Suggested.. A very nice addition to the revolutionary series. Levels lack some variety but the Gordon and Alyx's compelling journey more than makes up for it. Overall score: 7.8/10. The story of Morgan Freeman continues, and this is a decent expansion. The changes to HL2 might not be dramatic but with each expansion the graphics were slightly improved.. Episode One is just a bunch of scrapped levels sold separately for extra money. Right after Left Behind, it's the worst DLC to a critically approved game.. This game is short and doesn't change much from Half-Life 2. The whole story can be summed up in one sentence. Nowhere near as good as Half-Life 2.. Half- Life Episode One is a Masterpiece and Great way to Continue. Your review must be at least 75 characters long.. Half life 2 continuation... and centered in the best character of all the game!!! Brilliant.. A great follow-up to the cliffhanger HL2 left us with, but the decision to cut the game into pieces is strange.. I enjoyed HL2 EP1 more than the base game the game seemed harder, more arena like and it took me less time to beat it I had less time to get bored. I remember being at the and saying this is a great time for it to end and it did so I feel like the game did it's job.. This will go down in history as one of the greatest shooters of all time. Epic story, great blend of extremely dark setting with sprinkles of humor, insane graphics/voice acting/environments for its time, and great blend of puzzle solving and shootout arenas.. BRooooo that ending thats pretty epic I think this is better than episode 2, but that game is phenomenal. If you love Half-Life 2, its Episode One is an equivalent sequel. Cool story, beautiful graphics, impressive physics and dynamic sound. Fine!. Succeed continuation of remarkable game. Short campaign, but diversed enough with few memorable moments. Technical develop is rather unnoticeable. Most of missions are interesting and exciting even today. Like HL 2 game is linear, but the action is well distributed, using Alyx potential to be a great comrade. There are some movement issues (especially blocking on another character) which still were not solved. Episode One's quality is similar to the one from HL 2 and it is definitely worth playing.. Episode 1 feels like a polished form of Half Life 2 (HL2), albeit very short. This game picks up on what I thought was a satisfying ending in HL2, and has a cheesy way of bringing us back into the story. However, once it gets going it is well written and feels more enthralling than HL2 and ends on a solid cliffhanger that makes you want to play episode 2. The puzzles/map design and fights felt just as if not more difficult. Different parts of the game often gave me a since of urgency whether it was trying not to die or the writing of the plot. Overall, this game is a short but very sweet, unnecessary addition to HL2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent, first because I found the levels very well elaborated and the story of this game despite being relatively simple, because it was just the protagonist Gordon Freeman and Alyx trying to escape City 17 made the game quite short, but in compensation it made me have a good time more than the previous Half-Life 2 itself.. Of course it isn't as good as Half-Life 1 or 2. It never was going to be and it never planned to be. Its a great continuation of the story from HL2 and very entertaining and satisfying in it's own right.. Half Life 2 Episode one is in short terms a DLC that expands and continues the story of the base game after it ends in a cliffhanger, and it still retains great combat and the puzzle solving from the base game... sadly it does to little to improve over it's predecessor and you basically end off playing the same game but shorter. In the whole game there's just one new character or enemy introduced a sort of alien thing that has mind control or something like that... i didn't pay to much attention to that part, and there's one new enemy type... yet another zombie but this has bulletproof vest that makes him handle more damage... out of that there's nothing new. The level design is not that amazing compared to the base game and you play in the same environments which are located in ""city 17"" streets and more streets. The combat remains great, I wish they could have add a new weapon or something like that. But no. The game has a pretty simple premise and objective... escape from city 17 with a bunch of survivors and that it, let see how it end in episode 2. Even that it did nothing to improve, the game stills be enjoyable and fun, and still worth your money... As i mention... it could have been better if they could have add more environments, weapons and more enemies and more new characters, i don't mind the short length.. Not as strong as Half-Life 2, but still provides excellent gameplay and a strong continuation of the Half-Life story.. Great continuation to the original story. Overall gameplay and mechanics were outstanding :) Still enjoyable as hell :) Not a perfect expansion, but still great :). If you went through the first and second part of the game, then the first and second episode are necessary to fill in the gaps of the story left after the second part.. While Episode One is not as good as the base game or Episode Two, it still is a must play for Half Life fans.. Played it on a PS3. Episode One is a very good follow up of an amazing game, it maintains its core gameplay and expands it to a more complex level, the only thing is that is that is very short (like two hours or so) but if you're like me and you're playing this on 2018 you have a little more HL2 waiting for you. My favorite part and maybe in the whole series is when you're stuck in the dark and the thing goes like full survival horror, just sublime.. Few companies tease its customers as well as Valve. 1998's Half-Life ended on an intriguing note, with series hero Gordon Freeman basically being ""recruited"" by the mysterious G-Man to work for him as a dimension-hopping commando. But fans were really caught off guard by the ending of 2004's Half-Life 2, as Gordon and ally Alyx Vance were caught in a massive explosion. Rather than have us wait years and years for the outcome of that cliff-hanger, Valve has taken the series into episodic territory to get us answers more quickly. Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first in a new trilogy of episodes that are scheduled to be released over the course of the next year. (You don't need to own Half-Life 2 to play Episode One, as it's a stand-alone product, though it would definitely help if you did.) And Episode One is a memorable romp through the Half-Life universe, with gameplay that's even more satisfying than that of Half-Life 2. The only downside is that, due to its episodic nature, it's over far too soon.. Episode One was a lot like Half Life 2. Some sections of fun or investment, but even more sections of frustration or boredom, or both. This game didn't do it for me. Episode Two makes this game look like the Old Boy remake. Average.. I liked it more than Half-Life 2. It felt more focused, without any tedious a","""half-life 2: Episode 1"" is the continuation of Half-Life 2's story . the game picks up right where Half-Life 2 left off . the only weapon you have for the first few chapters is the gravity gun ."
716.Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection,"If you get this on PC or PS5 that is a big win. Good games good optimization good story.. This is a 2016 game and Sony, now chasing easy money and politically correctness before anything else, has never come even close to produce a game as spectacular and enjoyable as Uncharted 4.. Why am I always squinting in this game ... for some reason its hard to see things. Anyway this was my first Uncharted game and I loved it! It was super easy to get into without any knowledge of the series, the gameplay was fun and it looked stunning. I found the DLC boring at first and nearly gave it up, but once the open world ended and it became more story-focused I got super into it! I loved the character moments, Chloe x Nadine are best girlfriends.. Uncharted 4: A Thieves End and Uncharted The Lost Legacy are the first two games I played from my PC. Aside from the Nathan Drake Collection and PS Vita's Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Uncharted: Legacy Thieves Collection goes straight to the point of the two games. I don't even know the full story of the Nathan Drake Collection, including Golden Abyss, but I assure you the gameplay of those two games is the same, very realistic, and fun. The scenery in the game glorifies the areas in the game. The combat for melee and range is limited but a bit realistic having to pull melee attacks with just only one attack button but pulling off amazing moves including buddy-up moves and range for having limited space of weapons one for primary and the other secondary which still gives the realistic feel and the climbing system felt a bit more like Assassin's Creed but using a personal rope swing. The boss battles here may be too basic but it was challenging. Mostly the levels in the game focus on climbing so if you don't have acrophobia then these games are something that you need your hands on Uncharted 4: A Thieves EndI don't know anything much about the previous stories of Nathan Drake's adventure but I assure you that fights here in the game started amazing where everything is about the long-lost treasure of Henry Avery. From the point the prologue starts in advance from adventuring to an island the next level shows off young Nathan and the present time mostly like years ago before the island adventure I get to see an amazing prison escape until it reaches a pirate sword fight in the final chapter. Not to mention almost all other parts of the chapters so many interactable parts but mostly in Chapter 4 and the Epilogue. And just like in the previous old games, Nathan writes notes using his book for his adventure. The chapters were amazingly long enough I loved how much the storytelling has to offer based on the previous Uncharted Games which I have not played yet. Uncharted: The Lost LegacyThe same gameplay and combat as Uncharted 4: A Thieves End but unlike the fourth game, The Lost Legacy focuses on the story of Chloe Frazer who searches for the Tusk of Ganesh. Unlike Nathan, Chloe uses her phone for collecting notes by taking pictures and that side mission of finding the Queen's Ruby was worth it so I can see the treasure properly wherever I go only one chapter has an open world level and that part of the game was a bit short and it had a bit few glitches but the best part of this game is that I get to use a silenced pistol I can be stealthy in range whenever I want and I also loved the combat with having flexible animations. In conclusion, both games are absolutely the best temple adventure games with the amazing graphics this has to offer. The playstyle may look simple but it becomes challenging and amazing both at the same time. The only problem that this game does not have is the multiplayer mode.. This **** is the best thing ever play, with compelling storylines and remastered for PS5. Nostalgia hits hard after half a decade deep in this game.. An excellent sequel to the other uncharted games, perfectly updated for the current console age. The gameplay feels great, with both the classic uncharted gunplay and the new grapple hook movement mechanics especially. The story also takes an unexpected turn from the other uncharted games. It is in many ways, a perfect sequel, innovating on the previous games and making it feel new and fresh while containing enough of the original to feel like the perfect next step. It also feels like the perfect capstone for Nathan Drake as a character, while still leaving room for more uncharted games in the future. A must play for anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous uncharted games.. Best game ever️️ I was going to sell my PS5 out of boredom and I thought I was tired of video games until I tried playing this game and literally it dazzled me in every sense of the word. I was immersed in its story and its events and literally every detail in the game was paid attention to the utmost degree and I enjoyed playing it very much.. I wish we had more of these top quality short games that didn’t take forever to make. A great uncharted story!. I played only the Lost Legacy so far. I thought I would like this but this feels like a watered down version of Tomb Raider that is worse in almost every aspect. The game is extremely linear and lacks things to do,it is basically just lots of climbing, some very basic and easy combat, a cutscene, a puzzle, and again climbing. It gets dull pretty fast, and there are virtually no side activities apart from a few puzzles and useless collectibles, no perks or abilities to gain, no gear to collect or improve. Game world is empty, no npcs, except the very same dumb enemies all the time. Also the two main characters are unlikeable, two tough women with big egos who beat all the men with their fists even when outnumbered, yeah sure. Lara was more believable and realistic in this regard. Rise of the Tomb raider did everything better. This is trying to be an interactive action movie but the story itself is not interesting enough for me to play this till the end and endure more boring climbing and trivial combat.. Nice package there.Uncharted 4 still holds the bar high in 2024 and I've been astonished by the level in every aspects of the licence compared to the 3rd opus. Too many collectibles though as always in this type of game. The Lost Legacy stand alone feels like a big quality DLC which does the job refining the well known elements of the licence without twists.. Just a resolution and fps upgrade to the PS4 versions. Fortunately I only paid 10 USD and got both games as I already owned Lost Legacy.. It was great with the PS5 version, I loved it so much, I finished it 3 times, it is one of the games I will remember in my life, what kind **** are you, you are wonderful.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game without DLC it was amazing. One of the best games I played but I don't enjoy DLC.. The more I play PlayStation Exclusives, the more I get angry to PlayStation for not making bangers like this for the last 2 years. Through and through average game that is very similar to Tomb Raider trilogy but worse in EVERY aspect. I'm not saying it's bad, just average. No masterpiece or anything other ppl are saying.. Uncharted 4 is a 17 hour long action movie, made of thrilling chases and collapsing buildings, deadly puzzle-traps and betrayal. But it’s also a 17 hour action movie of climbing (oh so much climbing) and mediocre cover-based gunfights with generic bad guys with guns. Uncharted 4 concludes the story of Nathan Drake, the world’s best – and worst – treasure hunter. He is the best because he has found multiple lost, legendary cities and their treasures by following a series of clues left behind by long-dead historical figures who did not die when or how history popularly described – long-dead lost cities which had surprisingly sophisticated technology for the early 1700s, especially, as in the case of this game, where a city was built by a bunch of pirates. And yet, he is living a middle-class existence because every time he finds some rare treasure, it ends up getting destroyed or otherwise blown up by a pesky band of bad guys – in this case, Shoreline PMC, a multinational mercenary force working for one Rafe Adler and led by Nadine Ross, a ruthless woman who repeatedly beats the snot out of Nathan Drake, but never actually kills him. Assisting him in his adventures are his wife, Elena Fisher, his best friend, Victor Sullivan, and his brother, Sam Drake, the man who drew Nathan into treasure hunting in the first place before being shot and “killed” in a Panamanian prison 15 years ago while working with Rafe Adler. Needless to say, given his position on the list, Sam is alive and well, and the game is kicked off by a desperate need to find the treasure of one Captain Avery, an eccentric pirate captain who loved building death traps used to test those who would “join him in paradise”, which, over the course of the game, you come to learn contains a great deal of pirate treasure indeed (assuming, of course, it wasn’t all spent or sunk on the bottom of the ocean somewhere). Sam was busted out of the prison he’d been stuck in by a notorious, ruthless Panamanian criminal, and it is up to you to find the treasure so that said criminal can be given the 50% of the Avery treasure that he demands, in exchange for freeing (and not murdering) Sam Drake. Thus is launched a whirlwind adventure that takes you fom Panama, through Europe and Britain, and eventually to the tropics. You travel across a variety of different landscapes and settings, all in search of this lost treasure, the treasure always in the next place, just ahead, with Rafe, Nadine, and an army of PMC goons either hot on your trail, or already there ahead of you trying to find the treasure only for you to sneak in under their noses. The game works quite well, with a plotline full of lies, betrayal, tests of people’s bonds (both of friends and family), and of course, a lot of bloodshed. You end up gunning down a small army of goons, though, somewhat amusingly (and unusually for the genre), depicting it as actually having an effect on them by the end – by the final chapter, the bad guy is down to only a handful of mercenaries, with the rest having been killed by our heroes, or dying horribly to insane pirate booby-traps. Because everything is ancient, stuff is crumbling around you all the time, leading to a bunch of sequences where you jump on stuff, grab on, only for it to break, and you going on some crazy little adventure where you only barely cling on and survive or run along collapsing wreckage. And when the ruins themselves aren’t busy collapsing on their own, Shoreline is more than happy to blow it up for you to generate these sequences. These are the coolest action sequences in the game, and lead to a bunch of crazy-looking events – but it also can feel a little wearing at times, because after you’ve seen it happen a half-dozen times, it’s no longer actually *surprising* when it does so yet again – indeed, the game is so eager to do this, it happens multiple times per chapter in most of the game. The game does a pretty good job of keeping things moving; the game switches between moving through and exploring environments, gunfights, and action sequences fairly well, giving you a pretty good variety of environments to fight across and to solve puzzles in. What the game does not do a good job on is combat. The game is a very basic cover-based shooter, and the combat encounters are just not that good. The enemies are just “guys with guns”, and while they try to mix up the environments, in the end you’re just fighting while ducking behind waist high walls and around corners in a very standard cover-based shooter format, with no special powers and pretty bland “realistic” guns. The final boss fight at the end of the game at least tries to mix things up with a unique swordfighting minigame, and it’s only OK. The game is also extremely linear, and while this is not a “bad thing” per se, it is palpable. Overall, this is a good game in many ways, but is held back from true greatness by its mediocre core game. The same master piece from before, but with updated visuals, framerate, and audio. Along with probably the best haptic feedback and adaptive trigger implementation that I've experienced. The only scenario I wouldn't recommend would be if you already played both games. Yet even than I have and I still feel like it was worth the upgrade charge.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Every thing ND does is a masterpiece, who r we fooling? We might have played all these entries were great games in their own right, so this collection is no different.. amazing game, great story, characters, dialogues. beautifull single player experiance. Got a chance to play this game several years after the launch. Have been meaning to play it since I saw the Madagascar chase in a trailer when the game launched. Well it’d be an understatement to say I enjoyed the game. I truly felt for the first time that, I’ve been transported into an action adventure movie. The mix of story, puzzles, traversal, the beautiful settings, action set pieces and the fact that they blend so well made this an extremely enjoyable time. What a delightful experience!. Uncharted 4 is One of the best video games of all time, everything is high-level, graphics, characters, narrative, story, and gameplay. Great game and want to say Lost Legacy characters were great. Especially Nadine Ross.. Fantastic comedy action and good writing. Highly worth buying. A pillar of adventure games. So glad they let us play as the female foils after the main story was over.. we love to see two fire things packaged together. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. didnt finish but it is fun and good history. A great remaster with 2 great games with better graphics and higher framerate. One of the best game ever now even better. I am playing with 120 fps and it's game changer, highly recommen.d.. Game is absolutely perfect but the port for PS5 could have been much better than the PS4 version. In the Trilogy, they remastered the graphics of the first Uncharted. Nobody can tell the difference here in terms of graphics and back in a high price. PS can do better.. As I wrote in my reviews for both of these games, they are just perfection and honestly better than modern adventure movies. Their cinematic scenes should definitely inspired for holly wood movies. And of course another astonishing visual game for PS5 same level as spider-man miles morales.. Absolutely a must play for fans of action adventure games. The best part of this series and these games are the stories they tell. Wow! Do yourself a favor and play it.. (PC Review) Great Gameplay, visuals and highly optimized unlike TLOU2. Both parts are super fun to play with incredible storyline and outstanding visuals.. The ultimate adventure with nice Indiane Jones vibes got a nice look and feel on PS5 too. Played it on 4 some years ago, but it’s worth the time to replay it. A legendary game.. Great game. Probably the best in the entire series in almost everything. Story, Action, Combat reached the highest level. Although Lost Legacy was positioned as a separate game, it still feels more like a DLC. Almost no new mechanics or innovations, except for the semblance of an open world in one of the chapters.. A classic. Was a 10/10 the first time, and I am tentatively calling it a 10 this time as well. LAck of multiplayer hurts the package tremendously, but the games are still terrific.. I enjoyed the story for sure, but the combat ended up boring me after awhile as it's pretty repetitive and pretty grounded.. This collection (even playing them on PS4) is in my opinion, one of the best PS5 remasters I’ve played in a while. Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy are already so good enough that they made 10x better. The one fatal flaw I have is the Platinum, but come on man it’s Uncharted 4! One of best PS4 games I’ve ever played during the console’s lifetime.. (PC review) Overrated game. Linear micro levels with sub-graphics (yes, even on high/ultra) with a plot that could have been written by a 10 year old. Controls are horrible and way to much handholding.. Good game, very fun to play and has a great story. Only problem is it’s too short. (not that short compared to other games I just loved it so much that I wish it was longer). It exactly the story mode i played long time ago of uncharted 4 and lost legacy. No online mode in it. I'll rather play the ps4 version of uncharted 4. Horrible performance, more glitches and bugs than the original game, and not to mention it has the worst two games in the franchise. Uncharted 4 is just Druckmanns excuse to have a game where he can get beat on by a woman.. Great game the major pro to this game is how the puzzles keep you guessing and have a variety of challenges. Also the graphics for ps5 look spectacular and the game play is spot on. If your into 3rd person shooters and action games with a great story line this collection is worth picking up.. Two lavish and excellent Uncharted games given a pristine PS5 sheen. There's nothing luxury or fancy here, but this collection is the best way to play two blockbuster outings in the legendary Uncharted series.. Uncharted Legacy of Thieves is a great game, the visual/audio are top-notch for the time of release, and even today, the story is good, not great but well written safe for a few exceptions in the Lost Legacy part which contain some cringe-worthy feminist moments. The gameplay is what you've come to expect from an Uncharted game except for this time some of the levels open up a bit more to explore, especially in the Lost Legacy, I consider that a big improvement and hope to see more of it in the future while not losing the amazing action scenes the game is known for. I played the PC version which is great for the most part but could use a bit more options to tweak the graphics settings and the game resolution is locked to whatever you have selected on your desktop. This is a small nitpick but the Lost Legacy also ends with an atrocious hip-hop song at the end credits instead of the beautiful orchestral music the games are known for I hope this is not a trend.. a masterpiece at its best now on ps5. The game is still as good as it was 6 years ago. I have never played the prior games or the original games the collection is based on. But as soon as I started playing I couldn't put my controller down because the story had me hooked. I loved the combat and was amazed by the many different set pieces. If you have a Ps4/5 and haven't played it yet, I would very highly recommend it.. nathan drake is the most iconic character in playstation history, one of the best games i have played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a nice enough game, but it's really not the masterpiece Uncharted fans would have you believe. It's entertaining enough, it's polished, got a decent production value, but is little more than a competent and enjoyable interactive movie. If you enjoyed recent Tomb Raider games, it's just that but more bombastic and all around a bit better done.. Developers, can you delete this ""necessary"" AVX 2 CPU instructions? Many of people can't play your game on PC. A cinematic masterpiece. The game runs better than ever now and the loading is instant.. I absolutely loved playing through Uncharted 4 again, perhaps even more than the first time. The enhanced graphics, haptic feedback's and 3D audio help provide a next gen experience! The story is wonderful as always, the game play is impeccable. I would 1000% recommend playing this. It is also a lot more reasonably priced than the most recent The Last of Us Part 1 ‘Remake’ even though that too was awesome. Uncharted Lost Legacy is also pretty good, I must admit that I never played that on PS4 but I wish I had. The characters are great and it is a pretty decent story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best action adventure game in history, great gameplay, great puzzles, great story, great environment design and everything is great.. Uncharted is one of the most overrated game series of all time, with 4 being the worst.. uncharted 4 and this collection game is masterpiece storytelling graphics gameplay everything is perfect best game ever. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What else can I say? Uncharted in stunning 4K. The tight controls and unparalleled action we all come to love and expect. My only gripe is that I had to pay to upgrade. And the story is awful in the lost legacy. The gameplay is great in thar game too, as long as you can get past the boring and lengthy chapter 4. It’s literally over an hour of criss crossing a map. But, a thief’s end on ps5 is video game nirvana, so I’m just nitpicking. Amazing game, and a must-play in my opinion. The graphics, music, characters, and story are just great. The remaster was beautifully done for the ps5.. A Remastering at the height of the saga. Includes Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Uncharted: Lost Legacy. Performance is very good at 60 fps and visually very high level. The Lost Legacy has been a pleasant surprise for me, since I did not play the PlayStation 4 game. Very good games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Graphics: 8/10 Enjoyability: 7/10 Overall: 7/10. Both titles were exceptional in the respective years of release, and in the Legacy of Thieves Collection, both Uncharted 4, and The Lost Legacy are the best they’ve ever been.. This is what Sony does. They repackage Uncharted anyway they can year after year without making a proper collection. Look at the Master Chief Collection Sony! Sony fanboys keep boasting their exclusives but all I ever see are reprints of old games, Naughty Dog reskins and third persons. PS5 is a boring system, and this reprint doesn't help anything.. Already magnificent on PS4, no interest in making these PS5 versions, if not for purely commercial purposes... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Unbelievable how good Uncharted 4 still is today. The smooth gameplay, breathtaking locations and beautiful graphics. The game is still among the best. Add to that the various well-polished performance modes, the 3D audio, haptic feedback and Lost Legacy as an extra storyline and you have a great package to relive on the PS5. Pros: - Well-polished performance modes - 3D audio - Haptic feedback/adaptive triggers - Stories, locations and soundtrack of both games Cons: - Main characters still can’t sprint while in heavy combat - Too bad the first Uncharted games are not included. It would be a perfect complete edition. I played only Uncharted 4 in 2015, now i restarted in 2022 beacause of the film then i played for the first Time the Lost legacy, all of this remastered on ps5 for just 10 euro, thx Playstation what a masterpiece!!. Great game Ghgrc and Bill holding it down during BARRY season (Not a figure of speech we were actually holding this. Fantastic games. I'd totally recommend anyone to try out both of them. Great gameplay, story-telling, characters.. I bought Playstation to play this game, but thanks to #PlayStation I cannot. Add Kazakhstan to PSN, let me buy, play and rate it. #SonyPlaystation, prove that ""Play has no limits"" !. Uncharted's franchise went out with a bang, and the fact it has been released improved with the unfortunately overlooked The Lost Legacy spin off - the fact these improved version of two critical entries into the franchise into one affordable bundle - is an excellent choice for any gamer, and especially anyone who missed one or both of these titles. The series is excellent, and while debatable to not necessarily be its peak, it sure is a send off. Must get if you haven't yet experienced this. If you have, maybe wait as the upgrades over the previous release aren't anything you must rush to get. However this is a definitive upgrade for sure.. They are decent upgrades but I wish I hadn't spent on these upgrades but it's what it is... Great collection to experience on ps5 and pc I’m so glad they remastered this masterpiece with 60fps, this is so great. To be honest, not much to say. This is basically 2 great games in 1. I might have a bit of a bias as I only owned Uncharted 4 and got to upgrade for a $10 fee. Then got to watch the movie which I enjoyed more than I expected, which the ticket I got for free covered me and anothers tickets for it. Also getting Lost Legacy which I didn't own on top of it. Pure win. It's a great deal. I'd suggest anyone just grab a cheap physical copy of either on PS4 and do the upgrade. But yes, there's nothing amazing really added. It's just a slightly prettier version of the same games. Still masterpieces as long as you like a action puzzle adventure game and a great cast of fun characters, outside of boring Sam. The 9 over a 10 is simply because this does feel like it could have been a free game update for the most part and I'd get the same value outside the bonus free game and tickets.. Charging you 10$ upgrade for games allready you have paid full price is brilliant idea,way to go sony keep it up this ****'ll see money again from this player on 2040!. Naughty Dogs is one of the best game studios ever. Love this game so much. Never imagine Uncharted 4 or Lost legacy has 60 fps, awesome. One of the best action game ever !!!. Being able to experience this game at a virtually locked 120fps with motion blur finally being able to be toggled off was a literal dream come-true. All I can hope now is that Uncharted 1, 2 and 3 receive the same frame-rate unlocking treatment and we'll be golden! Fantastic release.. This game is special.. Uncharted for me is a must play for everyone.. I can't find anything bad in this **** complete and perfect. Two of the greatest action adventures looks even better. Sounds a little bit better, but to be honest I don't really feel that much of the dual sense improvement. I am a big fan of the series and this is defiantly worth another round. Getting a little sick of all the remasters and am curious about NDs next project.. amazing game, I loved the shooting mechanics and the characters, also the graphics are insane! Worth a buy since it includes 2 games at such high quality!!!. these are some good games, only knocking it down because it was a paid upgrade when i already owned the ps4 versions. resolution changes and a higher framerate cap dont really constitute the extra $10 and it feels very greedy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. amazing love it great graphics and gameplay, superb performance, worldclass set pieces, quality game. The same game for additional cost. While you tolerate this, they'll continue doing it.. ""A very nice but not quite perfect remaster collection."" Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy are both outstanding action-adventures that I already loved on PS4. Now they're even prettier, more immersive, and more playful in the Legacy of Thieves Collection. So I really enjoyed my trip to Madagascar and India again. I especially liked the 3D audio feature because it makes the fights look even more realistic. Well, maybe it's also because I'm not so easily caught off guard by enemies I've overlooked. Personally, I can also live with the fact that the multiplayer modes are missing, which never bothered me anyway. For some fans, however, this is certainly annoying. My criticism is that more effort could have been put into implementing the Dualsense features. Nevertheless: Very good remasters of two great games.. The game looked amazing and the gameplay was really smooth. ""Uncharted 4"" The story started out good but it felt like it started to drag towards the end. I enjoyed the climbing in this game but there was too much climbing, sometimes I felt like I was playing a climbing simulator. The combat wasn't anything special it was quite basic. I still had fun while playing the game and would recommend it to others. Haven't played lost legacy yet so this score might change.. With the ""Legacy of Thieves Collection"" from Uncharted, you get two more great and super revamped titles of the series for the PlayStation 5. Fans should grab it anyway and newcomers to the story as well. Thanks to the numerous innovations and improvements, the two games have become great. It is a pity that there is no multiplayer mode. Maybe this will come with an update. Otherwise, we can only say that you should get the Legacy of Thieves Collection for your Sony console.. Uncharted games are so cinematic that it's almost like a movie. I enjoy every second of this magnificent game, graphically abnormal, impressive story, masterfully told.. Personally I have expected more visual fidelity, using higher resolution textures everywhere, so I have to leave some points from my rating, especially for this so called „next-gen“ version. Also the HDR isn’t well implemented and leaves some unused potential. All in all it almost feels nothing more like a free PS5 upgrade, very much like we got from other exklusive Playstation titles. Unfortunately this one isn’t free. I expected to get more next-gen for this extra price tag, since I already own every title of this series. This is my biggest concern with this special edition. What doesn’t have changed is, that this series is one of the best popcorn blockbuster of all time. When you don’t have ever played Uncharted, OMG you are lucky, this is now the perfect time to start with.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. its been a long time since i played and uncharted game that nearly forgot how good and funny this titles are. the new features and graphics are fantastic. awesome experience.. As a fan of the franchise, this collection is so nice. Nate in 120 FPS is awesome.. Better Graphics, Better Framerate, Better game that's how it usually goes. I'm so god damn glad this game exists. Not only this game but this package. Not only is this one of the best naughty dog games but this is one of the best naughty dog stories. I can finally play this game like it was intended which probably doesn't mean alot to anyone but that fps cap on ps4 (how I originally played) was really unfortunate and the main reason I didn't return to that game regardless of the great story. That game feels horrible to play in it's original state. Now I can enjoy this package for only ten dollars. Think about it. 10$. It could be a dealbreaker to some but when you truly know what you'll be getting. It's way worth it. 10/10. as an xbox player i have to say that this game runs extremely well on the playstation and i had no errors. simply a masterpiece. One of the most famous and beloved franchises in the history of ps4 comes to the new generation in a better than ever shape.. Looks real nice with the updates for the PS5. It is definitely worth the $10 upgrade.. It's a good game with better graphics what can I say I'm amazed by how they got the game to get to 120fps its simply incredible optimized. These original 2 games were already masterpieces. And yes I think Sony should have not charged a dime to upgrade to this edition and yes I am aware the graphics have only being slightly tuned but the quality of life improvements are stellar! the choice of a native 4k at 30fps for the ones who want their game to feel cinematic and want the sharpest image. A 1440p at 60fps for those who want a balanced experience, this is my setting of choice because unless you are 1 meter away from the TV you won't be able to tell a difference from the native 4k mode due to the amazing anti-aliasing naughty dogs have implemented in these games. And an outstanding 120fps mode that is very solid when it comes to frame rate, I was honestly debating whether I should play on this mode since my TV supports hdmi 2.1 but I decided I would play on the 60fps mode for the sharper visuals. No matter what mode you chose all three modes make full ","uncharted 4: A Thieves End and Uncharted The Lost Legacy are the first two games i played from my PC . the gameplay of those two games is the same, very realistic, and fun . the climbing system felt a bit more like Assassin's Creed but using a personal rope swing ."
717.Gran Turismo 7,"I spent approximately 12 hours to get all gold on a championship (3 races) and guess what? After I won the 3rd race (the most difficult one), my PS5 lost an internet connection. It gave me the prize, etc., and I was super happy, but suddenly failed to save my progress and just showed some error code. And now, I need to play the 3rd track again. What a stupid game where you need to be online even for a single player career mode. I never play online, why would it need an internet connection?Don't buy this game if you don't want to lose your progress.. The most barren dry racing game ever made. Looks great , poor driving physics both on wheel and controller. The story mode is okay. Not enough tracks & a poor selection of cars. The multiplayer is abysmal. Not enough variety to want to keep playing it beyond an hour or 2... There are no four-door cars, but in a racing game there are trucks and vans. There are no famous cars, mostly just ugly Japanese cars. Normal street cars are totally underrepresented, for example there are no Audis, Opels, Mercedes, Volvos etc... The main thing is that the game is full of Japanese and American cars, and giving away junk cars in the cafe menus that nobody wants is also a bad joke, just like the fact that you can't sell them or you only get a choice of 3-4 junk cars at the used car dealer. Not to mention the microtransactions.... Just a disgrace. Good game that has longevity when it comes to online racing. The racing is cleaner than Forza Motorsport, and the car models are levels above FM too. GT7 suffers from a poor campaign mode, but there is a lot of other stuff to do. For console online racing if you are a controller user, this is the game to get.. I just have to be honest **** reviews for this game are straight wrong. People complaining like 'oh microtransactions!' and 'oh no I ranked down because I'm a bad driver!'. Like bro, get good at the game and you won't rank down. And the microtransactions are hardly there. Like if you actually played for a few minutes instead of writing a review after your first race you would realize you are the problem here. This game is amazing, incredible detail, gameplay, everything. It deserves more than 10. Good cars, good graphics, average physics and the most rubbish penalty system ever seen by humanity. People can crash and brake check you but you are going get the penalty and get your rank down.. The game is a blatant example of false advertising. You buy the physical version, install the nearly 100 GB of the full game, which takes up significant storage on your console. Despite this, Sony seems to no longer prioritize delivering fun, focusing instead solely on microtransactions. To make matters worse, even after purchasing the physical game, you are required to be connected to the internet to play. Absolutely outrageous!. What a historical legend this franchise has been. My dad played all games in every Playstation and I understand why now. Gran Turismo 7 is a quite complete with hundreds of cars to collect, tenths of menu books to do, and a great variety of tracks to race. I really liked this because it admires the history of the automovilism. From the 1950's F1 car from Juan Manuel Fangio to the Lamborghini Veneno of the 14´. All of this guarantees countless hours of gameplay at the racing videogame of history.. **** the greedy **** at sony for thinking its ok to charge £70 for this **** piece of **** ****.. without a doubt one of the worst games ive ever played its a **** scam that the **** at sony think its acceptable to charge £70 for this ****. if you think this game is realistic you clearly have never driven a car irl bc if you did youd realise within seconds that the cars behave nothing like they should do bc the **** rat bastard developers think that they can make a game with **** physics and say that its a 'simulator' **** this game **** the devs and **** sony whatever you do DO NOT spend your money on this utter bollocks bc youll end up regretting it. I truely love this game and evrything it offers! Such a versitile and complete game.. When the game out I rated it with 1 point because they wanted to make it pay to win. Now the game is alright.. There are no four-door cars, but there are restaurant cars in a track racing game. There are no famous cars, but there are ugly Japanese cars.. GT7 misses quite a lot of basic features. For example, a virtual rear view mirror in all camera modes. I like to race in cockpit view, but am really missing this simple feature that you find in all other racing sims... And after you finish a race there is no overview on who drove the fastest lap!! Then there are no standing starts. Now I don't mind rolling starts, but some variety would be nice and unfortunately the rolling starts in GT7 are implemented poorly as well. You start too far apart from each other. The way ACC or now even Forza Motorsport has done it, is how it should be. This game feels unfinished and after all these years they haven't added any of these basic features yet. It's like they don't wanna bother, because they've already made most of their sales and are probably focusing on the next installment. What a shame and it's enough reason for me to kinda say farewell to GT and mostly focus on ACC, LMU and the upcoming ACE (which has an open world). Another thing that I don't enjoy is that sport mode only has weekly races. Why just 3 races and why for a whole week? I much prefer Forza's system in that regard; every 20 mins or so a new track can be raced. GT7 could learn a lot from Forza Motorsport when it comes to online multiplayer (can't believe I'm saying this). Also, you barely get any credits for online races in GT7, resulting in having to do stupid races vs AI. I'm honestly really disappointed in GT7.... This is the real driving simulator. Just lol. Do not buy it. Aı is disgrace they go like train. İ dont felt that it is real. Wasted 80 hours and money . Online racing is not racing .all player wants to crash .u wonder why i tell you there is no permanent damage. Go buy forza or something else.. Great game, very nice physics for an arcade game, but it require internet even in single player? Require internet to play game but need ps+ for multiplayer, And i really dont like gambling. Anyways its still a good game tho. This gamewas great until the most recent update. The developers have completelyruined the game. The driveability of every car is ruined.Hardhave no traction anymore, brakes are useless, cars can't evenreach top speed anymore and when they do they rock back and forth so much youcant even keepit straight. This game id a joke now. If you havent played it yet don't start now. Gran Turismo 7 is a triumphant return for Polyphony. A masterpiece of automotive history and driving gameplay.. Trash game & can't believe i wasted my money on this garbage. I thought it was going to at least be close to as good as Forza but obviously not. Back to Forza I go.. Looking at these scores I did not get this game until I could get a discounted copy. Having played now for many hours I think that this is the perfect racing simulation.Worthy of the name. I really do not understand the critics. The most important part, which is the feel of the car, is perfect for me. It really feels like driving.I got hooked by the speed and the responsiveness of the controls.Overall a 10/10 game for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply can't compare to any other racing simulation games! Premium graphics and driving experience.. Great Game in general but the very high prices for cars that basically says ""just buy me with microtransactions"" is just disgusting. Stop buying games like this one!. Giving this zero stars before I can even play the game because of the endless intro that they force us to sit through before playing that we can’t skip. Typing this review as I sit through it so I have something to do. Just let people play the damn games!. An avid GT gamer will find what special flair there is about past GT mostly present in this game, and it’s still a nice introduction into the world of racing/driving for a layman that can sometimes be entertaining, while being a tribute to the history of 4-wheeled motor racing. There is a steady trickle of content (all for free!) and improvements added post-release that keeps the game still alive, indicating that after a disasterous release, the developer made an effort, even if only half-hearted, to make the game live up to its much-loved title, that still continues to this day. And it’s kinda succeeding. Good: Excellent & realistic graphics (from car colours to track lighting/environments), Increased car customization options compared to past installments, Kind-of eclectic choice of vehicles on offer (it’s not only supercars and racecars; there’re minivans, a wagon, and even a Tesla Model 3) Bad: Twisted in-game economy (only a few high-paying races compared to the costs of the most expensive cars), Some (if only a few) cars are locked behind a random lucky draw, Single-player gameplay can get a bit stale (you’re almost always the last/almost-last placed driver given the mission to overtake all cars when racing against the computer-controlled rivals). There are only 2 things that actually bothers me in this game, specially compared to Forza Motorsport: 1st: why the hell do I need to wait 10~20 minutes between consecutive online races? 2nd: Prizes are way too low. You need to play a lot and still can't buy most of the cars, because racing prizes are way too low. I have player +300h and really don't get the bad reviews. I only play with controller. This game looks absolutely beautiful in graphics and the physics are superb. I love every minute of gameplay. Tuning is really something and for the little i have played of scapes modes its stunning. That said of course it can improve in some places: -The races usually end up being a chase to the first position with a better car than the oponents. - Sport mode is really fun if you are at leat an A in SR. If you are below that it ends up being a bad time trying to save yourself from bombers. -I would love to get more cars, but you have a lot to choose from. ITs really fun to get **** car and tune it to perfection.. Shame on them, I'll just say it. For a long time, the Sony company has neither honor nor face.. Speaking as a new owner of a PlaySeat Trophy with LG Pro Wheel I am really impressed on what they have to offer. Put the PSVR2 on and take a seat. Feels almost like a real Car. I drove and still drive many cars like Porsche, Ferarri, AMG, Corvette and BMW Ms in real life and I can tell you they really simulated them well in that **** from me a 10/10 but I am probably a real fan of this setup and experience.. sigh… After almost 3 years I think it’s easily safe to say that Gran Turismo 7 is a disappointing failure on almost all areas that’s not graphics and car models it suffers from the most embarrassing game design choices that haven’t been addressed in its abysmal live service run that’s even more pathetic than anything I’ve seen in quite sometime and what’s even worse is that most of the Gran Turismo community eats up this low effort slop every month because it’s “fReE” even though it’s going to promote more half baked games in the future to gaming studios and put in the saddest effort possible. The single player easily is the worst in franchise history and online multiplayer is hugely lackluster and is mostly just a copy paste job from GT Sport. The car list is a mess plagued by soulless Vision Gran turismo concepts that are just a complete waste of time FIA GT3 cars that are in other racing games and do GT3 cars far better and the most baffling boring Road cars you’ll ever see. All in all GT7 just still feels like a GT sport 2 with no real GT league anymore and Gran Turismo still feels like it’s in some sort of beta testing mode since 2017… and you have got to wonder if Kazunori Yamauchi and Polyphony Digital still have it anymore and that the argument that they’ve easily lost it since the PS3 HD era is getting more and more truer with every release… what an absolute shame. Great gameplay, visuals are amazing, the sound of the cars too. Wrapped in beautiful presentations, nice circuits. This game has it all. Still going ridiculously in 2024. The tuning and customization of the cars is a big part and need dedication to appreciate it to its fullest. The IA is not the best of the best, but if you drive a 900pp car against 500pp, it makes sense that the IA is getting destroyed. Pick a car on the category of slightly less and you'll find challenge.. Gran Turismo 7 is a hyper realistic racing simulator, with a huge roster of cars and decent maps. Despite lack of content in a lot of areas, GT7 has breathtaking graphics and gameplay, making it a must play for the PS5. However, there is not much to do besides it's main campaign, and online play is here yet incredibly watered down. Overall GT7 is fun and worth the money as you can get at least 30 hours without getting bored, after that you may see yourself grinding for credits which is boring. i redon review from the bottom that said difficult licences.. For me this was the challenge( i made them all gold) , that seperate the normal players from the Pro's!!! Great graphics, the Ai opponents need to be more difficult in many occasions and also blue flags needs work. The game is one of the best sims out there. Its not about complete collection.. its only about Racing. if you love sim racing...thats your game... Amazing game, amazing graphics, it’s a great transition from the first game until this one. Why does another amazing game franchise need to be destroyed by greedy corporations? I have played and absolutely loved every GT game until this one. I have over 200 hours into it and can't think of anything good to say about the game besides great graphics. Hate that it requires always online connection. Nothing feels rewarding. Have to grind ridiculous hours just to buy some of the legendary cars. Convenient micro transactions... if you want to spend $200 usd on a $20m legendary car. What a joke. The Human Comedy missions are just ridiculously hard and Licenses have been the breaking point for me. Never had issues with getting all gold trophies before. This game just stresses the heck out of me, just what I needed in my life... more stress. Will never pre-order another GT game again. Thanks Polyphony.. Well, the game is good. Okey **** been made for people without life.I mean, if you want to play a little after work..with **** lost.Strategies, corners, practices i mean wth???They should have made the bronze lower and if you want to develop, fight for silver and even gold! That's the player choice, but don't obligate me to.... As on the old GTs, here I'm not having fun at all, quite the opposite. I get stressed and angry. My daily life is stressful enough, this is more for me. I know there are some updates from time to time. It would be good to normalize the weakest difficulty a bit. Will I buy again?... Don't think so, future games would a lot harder. You will probably need to have completed a formula one course for third place.. Yesterday for 700pp I had to build a car all day long for like 6 hours to get second place on a 5 lap track, because you loose a lot of time on the corners with joypad.. People complaining about AI and the economy of the game simply don't know what they're talking about. This is THE racing games for consoles. Way better than Forza Motorsport when playing in a steering wheel. Online races, specially at higher ranks, are not the mess the other games has.... If you have the possibility of playing it using a PS VR 2, do it. It is a transformative experience.. In game economy totally unbalanced, IA stuck in gran turismo 4 where the main goal was to start from the back of the grid and finish 1st using the most pumped car you had, now you do this but with pp limitations, no challenge, there are no ways of improving your skills except for some driving licenses and racing online (where penalties and rammers are a huge problem), roulette system completely useless and frustrating, tons of people still waiting for an invite or more to complete their collections while you can buy a car from the 40s for 20 million without any problem and it's completely useless because there is no race for that specific car, and also the newest GT3 and LMP1 cars are older than many of the fanboys greeting polyphony for this s**t.. This game is one of the best racing games I have ever played! I have never played any Gran Turismo before this one and I love it. I was always playing Need for speed and Forza before this and the realism is so life like! The VR version also is really neat as well. Some cons though are that wheel spins give you practically nothing and some pricing on cars but other than that there's nothing else wrong as far as I know.. Dumb 10 minute intro about cars, horrible music, super confusing UI, playing is boring, really dull, underwhelming experience. I remember playing GT3 for years, this I can’t stand for 20 minutes. Plus the tracks lack a lot creativity. Turning feels like you’re moving a bus. The whole thing ****. Feels like some crappy arcade game.. I like it. I am by no means particularly experienced with racing sims. I play with a controller. That said, the graphics and realistic car physics are unforgiving to the point of my being forced to get better. As I age, simulator games like this are becoming more and more fun to me for some reason. I enjoy the extensive options I have in regards to vehicles and tuning. I will probably never get good enough to compete with players online but the single player mode has been enjoyable for me.. Made an acc just to write this review because I am finally fed up with this game. All I have to say is that we have lost another legendary franchise because of corporate greed. Gaming was once fun and exciting. Now it’s just YouTube which race do I need to grind for 10 hours straight just to afford 1 car. (I’m not joking max ppl are making is 1-2 mil cr/hour driving the same race over and over, some cars cost 20 mil cr). This is an absolutely disgusting push for micro transactions that is on par with what EA is known for. And don’t get me started on the roulette spins (yes there are also roulette spins in a $70 real racing simulator). At this point just grind in real life and buy real cars bc playing GT7 is basically a full time job. Vote with your wallets people so that companies finally understand we’ve had enough of this bs.. AI cars have better handling, better grip, lower fuel consumption, and lower tire wear rate. A lot of grinding is needed to progress in the game after 35 lvl. ****. force to wait 3 hours for install the game same if I have the disc version, and no possibility to skip the intro (credits) ... GOODbye!! never purchase this game. Game is good. I can't believe that people want GT3 or GT5 or any other. This one is GT7. If you like old ones, then play old ones. Simply. EA Games, that is company that didn't fix camera glitch in UFC 5even after 10 months from initial release. Where Michael Buffer looks like a doll and move like a puppet. That company is selling you same game every year like EA FC... With scripts and micro transactions. And you still do a preorder... Look around, gaming is terrible down in this modern time,Top Spin 4 looks like it was made 12 years ago... What are you people talking. This game looks fantastic. And they are working on game and to improve. So don't be so negative and mad about this game. It's not perfect, sure it has some CONS, but it has its own PROS. Developers, please keep your work, and please listen more community in the future. ""You don't need to think to make a good game, you just need to listen community, and you will made a perfect game."" that need to be golden rule for any game.. Firstly, I want to say that I really love playing this game despite what I am about to write. It feels great, looks amazing, the cars are fun. However, the rest of the experience has been utterly horrible and I have never felt the need to write a negative review about a game. In short, as someone new(ish) to racing games, this game is a horrible experience on two levels; first, the fact that it often locks you into cars which are A. expensive to buy B. Expensive to tune, is extremely frustrating. This combined with the grind to get money — of which i can never shed the feeling this was done to promote their microtransactions — makes this an utterly frustrating experience. Numerous times i have gotten stuck for hours because i couldn't win mostly due to my car. Mind you, I don't know anything about tuning and I had to resort to guides multiple times in order to just stand a chance to beat certain races. The straw that broke the camels back, was World Touring Car 600 tournament. I grinded for multiple hours to get multiple cars only to lose because i couldn't compete with an opponent with a near full minute head start. Which leads me into another criticism: the running starts. It feels extremely unfun to always start in last position and having to claw yourself back. It completely **** the illusion of a ""fair"" race.. This should and could have been the best in the series. Kaz and his team killed of the most fundamental and important part **** game the single player campaign. Bad game design and ideas not been fixed. This is not a classic GT campaign mode as promised, RIP campaign mode.. GT7 may have a bad start but it's gets better by updates through the years I really hope get more newer cars that the community wants to see make their debut and return from the PS3 and PS2 era of GT games, Hopefully when GT8 comes out It'll be alot better, Soundtrack would've been better if there was more licensed songs from artists.. Were are all the Lotuses, Gran Turismo 3 and 5 had lots of Lotuses. 5 had a design your own race tracks. The livery in 7 is nice, but I miss all the tracks in 5. 5 had endurance races and drivers which was nice. 5 had a lot more cars too! I still have my ps2,ps3, and a ps5. I play Gran Turismo alot. What's up when you load style from downloaded styles in 7 it nullifies the pp on some cars, so u can't race them anymore. Forcing u to sell them. It's a total bummer.. **** that introI dislike this game off the top because of that **** those developers what a waste of **** time. Full of terrible choices that don’t respect the user. Unskippable 8 minute long intros, micro transactions, awful.. The fan boys say that the ""review bombing"" is only because of microtransactions. That's laughable. I have always loved Gran Turismo games, and it almost breaks my heart that this is easily one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. There are some great things about this game, but the bottom line is - hear me out - THIS GAME IS JUST NOT FUN. The A.I. is garbage, for example. As ridiculous as this sounds, within the first few hours you will wish that they never tried to improve it, and just stuck with the original A.I. that would just follow each other in a straight line. Sometimes, to beat them, you have to deal with instances where they appear to PURPOSELY drive side by side for long amounts of time, completely blocking the track. Sure, you can bump one of them out of the way to get through because it's only a 2 lap race, and you start in the back, but there goes your ""clean race bonus"" that you would earn. This is just one of the many things about the A.I. that will infuriate you. In fact, they appear to be programmed to upset you rather than be realistic (they aren't), or maybe, I don't know... fun? Oh, that ""clean race bonus"" I brought up by the way? I mention that because I have fond memories of grinding to buy whatever dream car I wanted in previous Gran Turismo games. To me, that was the whole GT fantasy. That was the dream. Well forget about it with this game. A lot of the best, and most desirable cars in this game YOU CANNOT EVEN PURCHASE WITHOUT AN INVITATION. Yes, you read that right. The game features a ridiculous invitation system. It's unbelievable. You have to obtain an invitation to even be able to purchase cars like the Porsche Carrera GT, or Aston Martin Vulcan, and SEVERAL others. And these invitations are mainly obtainable through random ""roulette"" loot boxes that give you the worst reward possible 95% of the time. I'm not joking. Look it up online. There is oh so much more unbelievable stuff that makes this game bad, but what I have already written should be enough to make any true Gran Turismo fan sick. I don't wish the disappointment I feel on any other fan of the original games. I really wonder, sometimes, what the developers were thinking. Isn't Gran Turismo 7 a ""game"" still? Aren't games supposed to be fun? Because it feels like they were creating something un fun on purpose.. The most realistic graphics style and colour game in the world,combined it with a very detailed car interior and beautiful location,simply amazing,i never grind even once(2024)like what most people complain and already buy a 1mil car easily+a TON of expensive gift car in my garage,upgrade not too complicated,great menu book system,amazing haptic controller feel especially when the car shift,road surface,gas pedal,100% a must play next gen racing games. Bad Physics. Steering Wheel will not turn full even at lock.Would not recommend.. I've extensively played through many racing games, between arcade and sim race. I can confidently say this is by far the best sim racer I've played. If you want a game like GT sport, this is perfect.. Almost perfect, one of the best chapters ever. Stunning graphics and sound, deep simulation (for a Simcade), almost endless events and competitions, Sport mode, thousands of cars and categories, online multiplayer. Playable with a gamepad too! The only downsides are some unbalanced races (1 out of 100 available) and easy AI drivers. The best GT game together with GT1 and GT3.. Very fun game with a great “story” mode. It does get a bit repetitive but that’s to be expected with this type of game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I bought this hoping for a multiplayer game with my kids, and the description on the box said 2 player. It’s disappointing to see that this functionality needs to be unlocked through hours of grinding, rather than just be an option at the start. My kids have lost interest and despite following instructions to unlock this mode, it just doesn’t appear to work for me. It’s glitchy and ill thought out. So many great aspects of this game are overshadowed by the basic flaws.. nice, fun,thank you. but ithink next game should a open world game.......... What complete and utter garbage.There is no fun to be found here AT ALL. Is this where we are heading, 99% effort in graphics, 0.9% on how to squeeze money out of people and the rest on the actual game. Do yourself a favour, get a PS1, get a copy of the original GT and go have some fun.. Taking away points for missing features on the multiplayer side: Missing the ability to add AI racers when creating a lobby with a friend or two as well as partying up with at least 1 more friend in the competitive daily races I bought it since release and spent almost 300 hrs in the first couple of months having completed everything in the main campaign and with online competitive mode, it was a great purchase, is not perfect game by all means but the support it has received with free content updates and with everything it had at launch, not bad at all.. Gran Turismo 7 had so many glitches, and there wasn't even barrel roll for the cars in the game. Gran Turismo 7 was so incomplete. Game is very polished but there are some annoyances, i.e. clunky UI in some places & bad music compared to previous GT games. Get it, it not anywhere near as bad as people thought it was when released.. 8/10 I played for 10h straight, i'm gonna update when i have more experience. So far the game is excellent, the graphics are good, the handling feela good and the vareity of automobiles are hughe (500 automotives)! I like that there are also many many classics. I don't know why people talking so bad about the game, like bugs, microtransactions, rating system etc. . I didn't have found any bugs and the microtransactions aren't that bad. I've got 1million in an hour, so i think some people playing the game horribly wrong. The rating system is fine, i don't see the problem with gold, silver, bronze... The only thing i didn't like is thatyou can't skip the cutscene when you start the game for the first time, it's 3 minutes long or even longer. And what i also dislike is the ""characters"" that you are talking with... It's just png's, i mean they could jave take the time and make some cutscenes or voice overlays for them. It think they have enough time and budget to do that. But for my first 10 hours i can't complain. (And sorry for the spelling mistakes, my english isn't that great but i think i can help more people when i speak english and not my native language ). (Describe GT7) Boring Stale Greedy Soulless Potential Wasted (Positives) Looks Good. Make all the excuses you want but as GT enthusiast's we deserve better...this isn't it. Check updates for this game (2024) to show you how this greedy obnoxious company fuxked you and expects you to pay for the privilege...grind until your bored out of your skull or eliminate the grind with micro transactions...MORE MONEY NOW! Fans of GT deserve better then this...most of you can't see **** are getting used to getting fuxked with no lube. Check out all the fuxk you tactics... Always online. No promised Ray tracing only in replays wtf? Grind till you die. Game with jpegs for characters when talking? What kind of half baked crap is this? Brain dead/Fakery **** crashes into a wall ? No problem we're back to it ? No tension in races because ai acts like a bunch of granny's lining up for groceries... Live service racing game ? I could go on but ultimately are you serious polyphony? A Shameful Greedy **** hey it looks good right ? Do better....want better. There's a reason this game isn't mentioned or talked about at all... A forgettable soulless husk ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite game. I've completed the campaign (pretty good but not great) but I still come back to this game every day because the driving experience and graphics are the best. What I think sets this game apart from other racing titles is that it also has a deep care and love of car culture, I read all of the information, spend time looking at the manufacturer timelines, and listen to the quotes from car designers in the Cafe. I get that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I love it and just want more of this in subsequent titles. Great game! A lot of content to do and the graphics are amazing! Tha gameplay is nice as well!. Nice game with great content. Play at your pace and forget microtransactions.. When I play a GT game, I play it for the story where I feel like a car collector and a racer. This game's story is pretty bad compared to the old games and some inflated car prices do not have sensible reasoning behind them. The things I enjoy about this game are its stunning visuals (both menus and while racing), its fast-loading time thanks to PS5, and its gameplay. I also like the menu jingles. The Spec II update also brought some fresh purpose to the game with the weekly challenges. Additionally, the monthly updates made the game more enjoyable.. alright game, though could be better, what else is there to say, theres great and amazing graphics, I personally loved this concept of buying cars and stuff, and Vr was again alright, though Im so **** at this game.. Amazing game with lots of content and stunning graphics, it runs well on PS4 and REALLY well on PS5. Gameplay is realistic a","i never play online, why would it need an internet connection? The story mode is okay. Not enough tracks & a poor selection of cars. The multiplayer is abysmal. Not enough variety to want to keep playing it beyond an hour or 2..."
718.Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker,"This is definitely the best DLC of this game, it's full of action and memorable moments, and gives Liara some spotlight. Ultimately it's Liara's loyalty mission, and I really liked that considering how Liara is a very important character but she seems absent in the game's main story. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. bad bad awful. the DLC in this game is terrible design from the interns. the paragon interrupts make no sense, the paragon dialogue options are absolutely NOT virtuous in nature. The skirmish at the hotel is triple bad, it starts you in a pit with no effective cover and throws fast advancing enemies to pin you there, making you flounder like a fish in a bucket. random spawn locations for the enemies is not skilful, it is WHACK, totally lacking in good design conventions present throughout the main game.. ""Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker"": Amazing game, it provides an amazing experience for the player. 7 out of 7. Played it on PC.. Best DLC for Mass Effect 2. 3-3.5 hours gameplay, adding a new race and 2 new locations. A great plot that links part 1 and 2 of the series. Also the appearance of Liara T 'Soni will clearly benefit the game, you can continue with it novel. And boss fight with Shadow Broker proved not simple, plus there are many interesting things on the basis of Shadow Broker. I advise everyone on this DLC.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The fans asked for it, Bioware delivered. And they made their best piece of DLC for any of their games. Lair of the Shadow Broken gives you a chance to go on a mission to find the mysterious Shadow Broker with your old friend (or lover) Liara, in beautiful environments, while listening to some hilarious throwbacks to the original Mass Effect and even gives you a chance to rekindle your romance with your blue companion. When the mission is over, you have access to a little hub, which gives you resources, files on your squadmates and funny video footage of characters from the game. It is well worth the 800 Microsoft Points, you just can't miss it.. Fantastic DLC. Just so much content. Offering the chance to continue the Liara romance was a great touch. Overall: No complaints, a great DLC that should be a mandatory purchase.. I thought this was great, best DLC to come from mass effect universe. Additional time with liara, and more paragon/renegade points. With an interesting speeder chase through ilium. Tons of credits for the taking here. and interesting story additions and conversations aswell. Also shadow broker base DLC was worth seeing just for the scenery while on the ship. interesting new character and profiles on the yahg aswell. Definatley a worth buy especially if youve have a points card for your birthday.. Out of all the DLC I've played for Mass Effect 2 this is the best, it's the longest and has the best story and gameplay, and is kind of an extension of the main quest and carries over into Mass Effect 3, this is a must have DLC, especially if you romanced Liarra in the first Mass Effect, but even if your like me and didn't romance her this is still worth the purchase and a must have, I don't want to spoil anything but it has some extremely awesome moments, my only complaints are the ones I have with Mass Effect 2, I highly recommend you wont be disappointed.. The rare DLC that maintains the high quality of the original game. LoSB is as good as ME2 which means a lot. Environments are varied and beautiful and charting the development of Liara as a character is interesting. In terms of length, it is longer than any previous DLC clocking in at 2-4 hours. After completion, the player is granted access to nuggets of information about the ME universe, a love letter to fans.. Nearing the end of the game, I debated buying this....I don't like handing cash over for DLC when games are already so overpriced. In this case, however, I'm glad I did. This is by far the best DLC I've ever played, and easily one of the funnest missions in Mass Effect 2. The effects of the environment are incredible, and this DLC is very important in character development for Liara. The level creation was so amazing, I really hope whoever was the lead designer for this DLC is in a leadership position for Mass Effect 3. Awesome experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite this DLC being of a very high standard with a unique game play section not in original game, a couple of good boss battles and some nifty, excellently realized cut scenes i can ignore the feeling of disappointment that I completed all this new content in one night. I remember buying the Shivering Isles DLC for Oblivion and being kept busy for weeks, given all the very high review scores that is what I was expecting here, perhaps I should have dug a little deeper and read more reviews. If you are reading this now I guess you are. You should know that the content is excellent, but its short 2-3 (very enjoyable) hours I reckon.. This is definetely the best DLC for Mass Effect 2 yet. (This was written on the 16th October 2010) BioWare really wanted all of their fans to be pleased by adding storytelling, action, plot, old/classic charactors, and those beloved choices that Shepard comes across 'every now and then'. The only piece of negative feedback i can give is that it's pretty pricy, even with all of it's content. This doesn't mean to say that it's not worth checking out, i'm just saying you should be careful with how you spend your money on Mass Effect's DLC's.. This is simply an amazing dlc. The combat is still incredibly fun, the story is astounding, and it bridges Mass Effect 2 to Mass Effect 3. You simply cannot find a better dlc then this.. This add on is by far the best add on Mass Effect 2 has to offer. It is quite lengthy for a piece of DLC and it has a fun story. If you had a romance with Liara and want to catch up on that or if you just want to find out who the shadow broker is then you should download this. It will expand your knowledge of the Mass Effect universe. I would say it is well worth the price.. A truly exceptional piece of DLC from Bioware if a bit pricey at 800 msp (but that's EA's doing). This being the first bridging DLC from ME2 to ME3 I was very keen to experience it and was not disappointed. It brings new elements to the game play such as high speed pursuits and some mouth watering new locations. The narrative itself is typical Bioware: brilliant. Plot twists will keep you interested (if the idea of visiting the shadow broker hasn't already) whilst the stunning cinematic scenes and boss battles make it memorable. A must buy for any Mass Effect fan.. Very solid DLC. Fully rendered cut-scenes, great dialogue, great set-pieces. If you only buy one piece of DLC for ME2, this is it. Head and shoulders above any other DLC Bioware has released. I've played through it three times. It's episodic gaming at it's finest.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Lair is by far the best DLC for ME2 and possible the best DLC I've ever played for any game. The DLC follows the new Mass Effect tradition of incorporating events from past games into dialogue unique for your character. I noticed a significant difference between playing my female renegade (who had a relationship with Liara in ME1) and my male paragon (who didn't have a relationship with Liara). It was almost like playing two different games. Lair also introduces a few new elements to game play such as the taxi mini-game Illium. This DLC is exactly what the franchise needs going into ME3.. After beating this DLC I can say, that now I was playing whole ME2, best DLC and 100% worth of 800 ms / bio points, great story, great action and ... of course Liara :). A bit expensive at 800 Microsoft points ($10), this DLC is worth the cost. Not only do you get some important story and character development, you also get a lot of useful resources, including credits. This will be most useful if you are not already at the end ****, or if you are playing through again (the DLC starts on Illium, FYI). Easily my favorite ME2 mission DLC thus far (beating out Zaeed, Hammerhead, Kasumi, and Overlord missions).","""Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker"" is definitely the best DLC of this game . it's full of action and memorable moments, and gives Liara some spotlight . the skirmish at the hotel is triple bad, it starts you in a pit with no effective cover ."
