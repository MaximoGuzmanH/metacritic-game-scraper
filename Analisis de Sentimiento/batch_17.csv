719.DiRT 3,"The third Dirt game is another winning blend of playability and realism, with the rally sections being particularly impressive. A few too many stunt challenges for my tastes but the racing sections are great.. After playing this game for several hours in total, i must say that this is a very good racing game. Lots of locations, cars and modes, they're all really fun. The only downside is that the controls seem to overreact a little bit on xbox one, especially while turning, but it's easy to get used to. The soundtrack is also pretty good.. Atmosphere: 7 Enjoyment: 6 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 6 Music: 7 Story: 5 Total: 6.33. Even in 2021, if you have a bunch of mates that want to play a hilarious (and seriously competitive) driving game this is the one. The racing is amazing, there's a ton of cars to choose from starting from the 60's right through to 2011 and if you can get 4 or more players together then the Cat n Mouse mode is ridiculously fun. I've chalked up over 100 hours with this game playing it in chunks of an hour or so and they're always 60 minutes of laughter, intense racing and all made funnier if you're using VoIP (game supports it, or DIscord). One final thing, this game is (imho) a perfect fusion of realism and arcade style racing. Some will not like it so much because it's not far enough one way or the other for them. However, amongst my group of 7 friends that play there are diehard racing sim fans and casual racers and everyone loves it equally.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The graphics of DiRT 3 are great. The way that the cars control feels wierd at first, but it feels awesome after getting used to it.. This game is fun but the AI driver **** so much so this was a big problem with me and im going to fill the rest of the characters in this with random stuff -62545094592698931302958r25728592758927659862985629862985798279827598275298379237858923759275987295879275982759259729857984579hi. This game is a fetid pile of crap. There is completely nothing enticing about the races not only because the tracks themselves are uninspired but also because game physics are complete garbage. I can't get over how poorly this plays out. With nothing to carry forward from one event to the next. Also their is incredibly pervasive pay walls (i.e. DLC) preventing access to most of the cool features. Would not recommend to anyone.. Dirt 3 brings more types of racing as well as more varied terrain to a proven formula from Dirt 2. The game is very enjoyable and will give you hours of enjoyment. There are some negatives about the new formula dirt 3 tries to implement. The first being that race types are intermixed, from rally to land rush to rally cross, there is no sense of being a part of a race league. You are just some driver jumping from vehicle to vehicle. The second big take away is that the really unique interface of the race trailer from Dirt 2 has been replaced by generic race selection menus. The final issue I have is that you no longer buy and upgrade cars, you simply win the ability to race them, taking away from the collection process I love in car games. The game is a solid seven, but if you've played Dirt 2 it will feel like a bit of a let down.. This game became free for Xbox Live members, so I decided to give it a try, whoops. I had a terrible first impression, as when I launched the game, it asked if I wanted to purchase an ONLINE PASS which allows for online play and YouTube sharing. The code for the pass is usually included in a NEW COPY OF THE PHYSICAL GAME, but since I got the game digitally, I didn't have a code for the pass! In terms of the game itself, the graphics are fantastic and there are a lot of game modes and customisation options, but the gameplay itself is borderline unplayable! The controls are way too sensitive and there's no way to adjust this! I couldn't play the game to its fullest as it is technically broken!. DiRT 3 is a sizeable upgrade from DiRT **** game has tons of different rally cars,buggies and trucks.Different racing modes like Rally,Trailblazer,Rallycross,Gymkhana,Landrush and Head 2 Head.They did take my favourite race type from DiRT 2 out though,which is Raid. The graphics are impressive,The gameplay is fantastic,perfectly blending arcade and simulation **** career mode is of decent length,it isn't perfect though,the AI's are a bit too easy at times and I'm playing on the medium difficulty. Overall DiRT 3 is a fantastic game and I would suggest it to everyone.. Dirt 2 was a fantastic game. If you want a great racer pick that one up. Let me start off by saying that the core driving mechanics are largely the same. That is a positive. However there is no progression system. You don't get to save up and buy a car, you don't get to race pro's, the menu's are awful and you'll spend more time clicking through them than actually racing, the gymkhana is annoying and the handling is more arcadey to accommodate this new fad. The tracks aren't nearly as interesting and are much wider and easier to handle. Such a disappointment.. You probably won't relate to my score, but for me personally, it's a 9/10. It's one of my favourite racing games of all time. The game's soundtrack is very memoriable and one of the best at setting an atmosphere that really goes well with the game. The car physics are on the arcadey side, but how it feels makes it really fun. The tracks are very diverse from area to area, and really tricky so that acing a stage is one of the most satisfying experiences ever. The truck and buggy race events may not be the most fun things to do, but it makes rally events much more appealing in contrast. Also the party modes online are really fun.. Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I've read through the other reviews, and played through Dirt 2 several times prior to purchasing this game, but I just had to see for myself. Big waste of money. A lot of people giving reviews have been raving about the ""improved graphics"" over Dirt 2. Ok, so maybe the background graphics are better, but overall, graphics are worse in this game compared to its predecessor. The physics in this version are absolutely a joke! I played arcade games in the 70's with better physics than this! No matter what car or what course, it's like trying to drive a brick across a half-greased rubber band. Traction goes from one extreme to another with no rhyme or reason. One second you're sliding wildly out of control, the next it bites like the tires are nailed to the surface, and it doesn't matter what simulated surface you are driving on. Controls are way too sensitive, too. The slightest movement of the controller sends the car into a 90 degree turn. A slight tap of the brakes and it slows from 110 mph to 20 mph in a split second. Cornering is more unpredictable than a ping-pong ball bouncing around inside a clothes dryer, with even the slightest little bump in the road sending the car bouncing 5 feet in the air, even at slower speeds (less than 50 mph). Every vehicle in each class handles exactly the same as the others, so choosing which vehicle to drive becomes a moot point. Sound quality is lacking, and what is heard is mostly annoying. The developers' attempt at capturing shouts from the crowd as you pass ends up sounding more like someone choking a chicken or a drunk with Tourette's Syndrome. Rally? Pfft. The co-driver (when they can be heard over the engine that generally sounds like an overweight bumblebee with excessive flatulence) gives terrible information. A corner of the same difficulty, radius, camber, and surface is sometimes a 3, sometimes a 5, sometimes a 2, etc. I raced rally at the semi-pro level for about 10 years, and if my co-driver had given directions like that, I'd have stopped the car, opened the door, and kicked their butt off a cliff. The ""witty banter"" from Dirt 2, which was annoyingly over-the-top, is no longer a distraction during the race, but the commentary before and after the race is banal and pointless. Upon entering a race for the first time with a vehicle you've never driven before and having your mechanic tell you that you ""didn't even put a dent in it in the last race"" is just plain.....stupid, for lack of a non-obscene word. After the 3rd or 4th event, I just turned off the sound on my TV (since it is impossible to completely mute the voices, engine, or effects) just so I could finish the game without the urge to jab an icepick into my ears. The programmers should have spent more time perfecting the physics and actual handling (or just go back to the way it was in Dirt 2, which was much more realistic) instead of making pretty trees and clouds, which nobody in their right mind pays attention to while trying to drive their brick. In Dirt 2, as well as most other racing games I have played, the emphasis was on performance. You raced the track and other competitors to proceed through each level. This game, you race against poor coding and the inevitable Gymkhana events. Gymkhana? Really? I bought this game for rally, off-road, and rallycross racing, not to do donuts in a parking lot and smash styrofoam blocks. What are we, in high school again? But unfortunately, it is forced upon you in every stage of the game. Gymkhana has absolutely nothing to do with rally racing. It has nothing to do with racing period. It is a showboat ""sport"", much like all the other X Games. Racing is about speed, picking the right line, and passing cars. Gymkhana is about spinning in circles for no apparent reason. The opening and closing sequences to each event are mind-numbingly boring, and again, the developers appear to be more concerned with getting you to admire their ability to render landscapes and shiny cars than they are about bringing you a realistic, challenging racing game. Gutted out the game to the end, and now I will delete it from my XBox and try to forget that I ever saw this miserable excuse for a racing game in the first place.. After running through Dirt 2 several times, I found Dirt 3 to be lacking in many areas. First of all, being forced to participate in Gymkhana events was a waste of time. Handling on the cars was less than realistic compared to D2. Having raced offroad for 30 years, D2 is the closest sim I have found to actual offroad handling. Graphics are worse in D3, also. Where are the rooster tails? Where is the smoke on pavement? Car selection has pretty much been forced upon you for points, whereas D2 gives you the option of several cars for one race, and end points are tallied only on race results, not on type of car driven. Ken Block was annoying in the D2, but having him as the ""star"" is beyond annoying. Sound is nowhere near as good as D2, either. I have not used the headphones, but through surround sound system or just the TV speakers, it just doesn't have the same effect. I can turn off the music, but I cannot turn the engine and effects sound down past 50%. Even with those at that level and the voice level at 100%, I have to strain to hear the co-driver. If you've played D2, don't waste you money on this disappointment. If you haven't played D2, this would be ok, but even so, I wouldn't recommend it.. (My PC Review available as well) I was surprised when I started playing this, realizing that it's a racing game where you actually have to have SKILL. I can't tell you how many times I drifted off the track and crashed my car into some tree, wall, or a random object. That's what makes this game so challenging, and also what makes it really fun. You'll be going back to races over and over again just so you can get 1st place on those events. When you finally do, it's a satisfying feeling. Multiplayer is especially fun as well. This game deserves a 10/10.. Graphics are good, so is the physic engine, no doubt about that. But why is still called Rallye? This fun mods are not what the game should be about(drifting get points and Also The rallye maps are mostly 1 big map, just reversed and/or shorter runs. this maps recycling. Do i drive with my car in my own garden? No!! Disappointment!. After 18 months playing this I had to change my original score of 9 down to an 8, as this game isn't as great as GRID however it has way more options and modes to it. Over time the quality of this game wasn't as good as the gloss made it out to be, frankly I had more fun playing Dirt Showdown. If there is to be a new Dirt please Codies simplify the Gymkhana events or just get rid of them, make handling more like Showdown or make it realistic, GET RID OF THE 'YO DUDE' VOICE ACTING, and cut the padded out livery challenge events. Still a very good game, though it's flaws are too glaring to miss.. Quite simply the best rally game to date and that includes the WRC games and Dirt Showdown (don't buy showdown). I fell in love with this game from the beginning, the tight controls, the brilliant gameplay and the sweet graphics make up for a truly unique experience.. In Career mode, there are a number of different rally styles. There are half a dozen rally race styles altogether. You have to get through each and every one of them to complete the mode. It's really a nice touch that the races are so forcefully varied. It keeps things from stagnating, and helps develop your skills in different areas. Looking forward to Dirt Showdown which will have the destruction derby! [Waddup!] Participating in the contests here have made the wait for Showdown bearable - ****/AMD/app_370166086361523 and on ****/RelianceHVG.. Where do I start? Let's begin with the graphics. The cars look great, environments & tracks are decent but the driver/spectators' faces and some textures in the interior of particular vehicles don't seem to exist. The frame rate is consistent but not overly high like in Forza, so racing feels more intense. The new interface is much better and easier to navigate, and soundtrack is probably THE BEST in pretty much any racing game out there. There are two new modes- Head 2 Head and Gymkhana. While this style-scoring may seem good on paper, it's nothing particularly exciting or entertaining. Luckily the career mode does include some more variations of it. There are now options for assists and money doesn't exist. It's just liveries and cars combined and you get bonus objectives to complete which level up your driver. These objectives can be obtained in multiplayer and the career, and there is now a limit to the driver level (30) and online rank (50). Multiplayer is the most fun aspect of this game. It's consistently rewarding and there is little to no lag. Again, it encourages and rewards clean racing. This is a game where first place is just another position, and you can easily enjoy the game and have fun regardless of your position or skill. One thing to be aware of is that, because you can now use assists in multiplayer, DO NOT turn off ABS because it severely disadvantages you. The playlists, team events and tracks are much improved on DiRT 2 due to the increased variety- you now get snow, gravel, sand, tarmac, snow, woodlands etc.. As too are the cars. There are around 50 cars and there's much greater variety in them too- you get cars from each decade and trailblazer cars include modern and classic hillclimbs. What this game does so well that few racing games manage to do is capture the sense of speed and make racing feel intense and like you're there. To get the same sense of speed going at 120mph in say Forza, you need to be doing about 210mph. The reason for this is that the tracks are tight and you're never sure how fast you can go without parking up on a tree. When you do crash, you can use flashbacks, but these can now be used online too to respawn your car but without having to accelerate up to speed gain. This encourages you to always try to go for the win regardless of how many times you crashed. I once crashed 4 times more than everyone else but because I took the last two corners perfectly I came within 1 second of 1st, finishing in 2nd place even though I would've been miles in first if it wasn't for the crashes. So really I do think that the multiplayer is very balanced, fair and rewarding regardless of skill level. Anyone can play it and enjoy it even if they don't win. Team events in rallies are improved too, so that it's the combined total time to finish the race for all members of the team rather than just the finishing positions. Sadly this doesn't apply to other modes but that's fine. Overall, it improves upon DiRT 2 in many ways but I somehow prefered the simplicity of DiRT 2 and its cars without assists. DiRT 3 though is much better and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes racing games. I can certainly understand why people may dislike the game but all this game does is add content, not remove it. Granted you need an online pass, but that's how games are becoming these days, and the online is definitely worth checking out. I think what makes this game better than DiRT 2 is the sheer variety. So many more classes of vehicles, so much variety in the environments. You can switch between classic circuit racing like in any other racing game to intense rallying through Kenya, Finland, Michigan and Norway. Or breakneck speeds in hillclimb cars. The Gymkhana spices things up, and what's impressive are the DC compount challenges, including a free-roam mode with interesting objectives and collectibles. Unlike Forza, this isn't a game which is repetitive. You don't just do one thing- drive around a track many times. Here, you get a real taste of speed and style without being bored. Leaderboards are much better here as damage is not taken into account, and because most tracks are point-to-point, you can hit the restart button and instantly get back in the action rather than needing to do another lap to get a rolling start. It's just you, the time, the track and the vehicle. There are hundreds of leaderboards for time trials you can go through once you've finished the game, and the variety of multiplayer events is also endless thanks to the party modes and jan sessions. Despite its seemingly miniscule amount of content when compared to Forza, the variety and how well this content is used and intergrated within the multiplayer and DiRT Tour gives it enough credit to qualify this game as one of the most complete racing experiences of this generation.. Terrible game! Got it for christmas, expecting a quality racing game with customizable cars and fun gameplay. What did I get instead? Dirt 3. The commentator is awful, because you cant understand her and she says nothing even relevant to what you are doing while you are racing. Also, you are only allowed to pick from certain cars pertaining to each race, and you cant upgrade it or even change its color! This game is boring and redundant, and it does not deserve positive feedback. Dirt 2 was and is a great racing game. Although the physics seem a bit more realistic at times overall Dirt 3 is much less rewarding of driving skill. Courses are extremely wide to the point of being a bit ridiculous. Car selection is much more limited and confusing often leaving you wonder if your selecting a vehicle with different handling or just different paint. Only one truck and one buggy?!? New modes are all based on crashing into other players and spinning out so if your looking for a racing game look elsewhere. Online play now requires everyone to purchase an add on from xbox marketplace if you don't have a code from a retail purchase. Attempting to play actual races online has often resulted in not finding anyone to race with as they are all either busy playing crash games or perhaps they just couldn't be bothered to get the online play working. Overall it's nice to race new tracks but the online play has been botched by wide tracks, lack of racers and non racing game modes. The number of in game up-sells for cars and tracks is also annoying for such a disappointing title. In the end Dirt 3 is about what I'd expect if Michael Bay had his way with dirt 2.. Pick it up cheap, not as good as the hype behind it, cars feel arcade like and handle like the tires are made of snot...........Still own it, nobdy wants it, Garbage. What a shame a once great title turned into a second rate game. Whilst the rallying is still as enjoyable as ever, especially online the shortage of tracks creates major limitations. Add the awful Gymkhana events create a real schoolboy view of rallying. Whilst more tracks are available via downloadable content they were surely originally to form part of your games purchase price, and look like they were only not included to allow for the lets grab an extra buck attitude which blights a lot of recent 360 releases. If you can pick Dirt 3 up at less than Â£20 and allow an extra Â£15 for the missing content to be downloaded perhaps then it becomes a more rounded and satisfying product, but for myself i will not be getting burnt when the inevitable Dirt 4 becomes available.. PROS:Great visual by far one the best looking racing games. A long tour mode. Great for people who want a racing simulator or only like more arcade racers. Awesome sound track. Multiplayer works flawlessly. RALLY is big part of the game which was absent from DIRT2. CONS:In game garage **** ur not able to see 3D model of vehicle only small pictures with a few facts. Tour mode narrators is very annoying. I am so disappointed.This game is great but Dirt 2 was walking the line of perfection and for every 1 step forward in this game there is 3 steps back.I'm not even going to get into it because its majorly disappointing.Straight 8 nothing more.. Not bad, I miss a lot of physics and features from Dirt 2. Seems more disciplined and forced to race certain types, Gymkhana I feel should be a separate mode and not forced into tour events. Gymkhana is annoying as hell because of that, the graphics seem a little tighter and better but I miss the old tracks. Feels a little more arcade style than Dirt 2 it seems a little too fast compared to the realistic feeling Dirt 2 had. But I guess a good game, I was kind of disappointed over all.. Codemasters ability to make a good solid racing game seems like it's as easy to them as it is for us to butter a slice of bread (apologies to those who are unable to butter a slice of bread, but you see what im getting at). GRID, Dirt 1&2, and F1 have all proved to be great racing experiences that have garnered a loyal fan base due to the developers sheer love of the genre. Dirt 3 is the best of the bunch to date and a title that any serious racing fan should feel ashamed to not own. Dirt 3 doesn't differ that much from its two predecessors but what it does do is refine its own mechanics and level of presentation to even greater heights. The added inclusion of Ken Blocks unique form of freestyle motorsport 'Gymkhana' is an absolute delight. At first its terrifyingly daunting, but given a couple of events and a no clock practice around the Battersea compound, you soon start to feel like a deity behind the wheel of a machine you can do whatever you please with. Dirt 3 is an exceptional package given to us by a developer who's care and attention is now playing with the big boys of the racing genre. What a disappointment! The physics are back to the Dirt 1, free-axis, physics and it couldn't be any worse. You SLIGHTLY turn the vehicle and it goes careening EVERYWHERE. Where are the awesome Dirt 2 car physics? Obviously, it went away this year, just like the ability to choose what car you'd like to race in. Now, instead of getting to CHOOSE which ride you'd like to drive in, you're FORCED to drive only ONE ride. Even in Dirt 1 you had the option to choose the kind of ride you'd like to race in (with, amazingly, very similar competition structure). And there is also a lack of actual courses in this game, but it that would be forgiven because of ""Gymkhana"", right? Too bad with the ludicrous physics, that even becomes MORE of a pain as you never really feel like you have control of the vehicle! To close, I'd like to say to people thinking about buying this game, buy Dirt 2 instead! It has a better structure, an actual choice of rides, more tracks (although Dirt 1 beats Dirt 2 in that category) and the car physics were the best of the current Dirt series (that will actually ALLOW proper car car set-ups). This game just seems like an overly-hyped, shined up turd, and play at the fans of the series by CodeMasters.. its not a bad game, far from it. its just not a rally game! gymkhana is just showing off, sliding around concrete in a ford fiesta. where is the dirt?! very hard to do in inside view, and game forces you to do these races to progress. graphics are great and the youtube feature is a novelty, but a good edition. menus are terrible though, way too much effort has been put into making them cool and americanised. not for rally fans, but for people who want to mess around in a few pretty cars. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is and isn't an improvement over the previous games. The graphics look better, and it sounds really nice, but man is some of the choices Codies made are annoying. The UI, while a step back in the right direction still favors style over function. Every time you want to select a new event you have to wait for the Sick Triforce of Extreme Awesomeness to unfold, and before each race you have to wait for a cutscene to slowly pan to your car, etc. Not to mention the three stooges who ""guide"" you through the game who really just waste time with their stupid chatter every time you win an event. By the way I hope you like the X Games, because Codemasters sure does! (Even though the X Games are no different from any of the other events.) Now on the back of the case it states ""The most rally content in the series ever!"", but in reality it's the opposite, at least as far stages are concerned. The devs only took the time to make one ""big"" stage per location then they chopped it up and reversed it to make more stages. The different times of day and weather help keep things fresh, but do little to change the track aside from the visuals. It should also be mentioned that the tracks in this game are the widest and easiest in the series. The rally stages are often 3 cars wide and there are many places to cut corners. It's a shame when you look at the game's amazing roster of cars, but have such a limited selection of stages. So instead of adding more rally content Codemasters added in Gymkhana and while it doesn't have as big of a presence as the other race types, they still put quite a bit of effort into it. I found to be pretty fun, but you can skip MOST of the events if you want. There are also optional DCÂ Challenges to complete, good luck getting those Platinum medals though. As for multiplayer, I found it to be a lot more fun then the previous games. Flashbacks have been added, which give you a running start if you screw up. This makes online races a lot less frustrating and a lot more competitive. The car classes are more balanced too. It seems every car is competitive in it's class. All in all I'd say its a pretty good game, but somewhat rushed. It's not the rally game I had hoped for.. DIRT. Well the title says it all, because thats all it amounts to. Graphically it looks the business. Thats really about it. Codies have take a once great franchise and put a dodgy American twist and it shows through here, non more than with the gymkhana.....what alot of nonsense. Wheres the mud and dirt in that? Gone are the days of the pure throughabread rally driving and here are the days of ""Ken c*ck Block. Ken Block failed in his attempt in the WRC as does Dirt. This is more like Tony Hawk meets Shaun White in a Max Power Fiesta. PANTS!! If you like that sorta thing. Â£40.00 wasted..... next!!!!. S**t khana.................(I would leave it there if i could, so I'll keep it short) Slightly improved graphics, very pretty cars and maps. Top notch arcade rally action, along the same lines as the previous games. Soundtrack is less annoying than other Dirt games. One new introduction to Dirt 3 is Gymkhana, yes, the Ken Block youtube thing. What seems fun on paper is actually fun for about a minute and then gets forced on you for the rest of the game. Actual rally, awesome, Gynkhana, nope.. Can't believe people have bothered to write reviews giving this a '0'! Felt compelled to write my own to counteract them as that's just ridiculous. Everything about this game is AMAZING, i love it especially with my driving wheel, this has to be the best racer i've played in the last decade and i've played a hell of a lot. Good work guys!. Third attempt at a review score, hopefully this one will stick. Beautiful graphics and well chosen music but the major emphasis on Gymkhana based events halts progression.. For what the game is trying to achieve, it is the perfect racing game, lots of different disciplines, nothing gets tedious, one off events get introduced to keep it fresh, multiplayer is the best it has ever been in a racing game. no idea why people are rating a 0, even if it isn't for you, a 0 is ridiculous. This is a great game! Top Notch in fact.I'd heard & knew the graphics were going to be good,but this has to be the best looking,& dare i say,most beautiful racing game i've EVER seen.. Fortunately,it plays like a dream **** has a good variety of racing events,All of which are playable in Split-Screen & Online multiplayer,Which is great! But in Dirt 4,i'd like to see Split Screen & online in career mode too(hey,why not?),with players 2(+3,4,5,6,7 etc if online)take any positions,points & any other unlocks they earn,back with them to their **** much as i love this game,i do have a couple of **** is why its not a perfect 10.Theres still not as much emphisis on Point to Point rallying I'd have liked.(Would like to see a full Rally Season included ideally).I'm REALLY not feeling Gymkhana at all..I dont find it any fun,it just seems pointless & out of place,& just gets in the way for me..Would like to see that,& Land Rush,maybe scrapped in the next title,in favour of the wide open Truck/Desert events from Dirt 1 & more Rally Stages.Also,i dont understand the games fascination with Youtube!? I cant/dont have a Youtube account,& even if i could,would rather save my replays in their entireity to the Hard disk,in **** Youtube!? Its also annoying to be constantly told ""You should save that 'Awesome' replay to Youtoobe"".Especially when i havnt registered a Youtube account with the game.. Another minor point is,It'd be good in Dirt 4(or patched into Dirt 3 too),if you could choose your prefered driver views for each event,from the game **** example,for Rally,Rallycross,Trailblazer,& head to head,i use the in-car **** view,& for Land rush & Gymkhana(if i really have to),i prefer Bonnet cam.Those 2 events i wouldnt miss if they were dropped anyway,but if i have to play them,setting views for each event type would be nice.Other than that though,& despite my gripes,I'm greatly enjoying the game,& the love & passion the developers have for all things rally,is **** those interested,yes you can configure your own controls & yes you can turn off the racing **** fact theres ALOT of options for this **** can play it hardcore,by turning all the aids off & set the AI level,or have them on to the point that even my girlfriend can play the game,with assists with braking & steering! You really can set the game up to how you want to play it **** great thing is,even when playing split-screen,each player can have their own exact control & driving aid setups.Works great! Have to give one last compliment to Rally Mode in **** first i was gutted that it didnt have'Hot Seat',but found that its done even more realistically in Dirt 3,by having the players do staggered starts,just like real rally.this works REALLY well! & would like to see it better applied in future titles by having a full & dedicated Rally season,withSplit-Screen & ","the third Dirt game is another winning blend of playability and realism . the controls seem to overreact a little bit on xbox one, especially while turning . the soundtrack is also pretty good ."
72.Grim Fandango,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""My scythe. I like to keep it next to where my heart used to be."" (ignore this part for i need 75 characters lol). LucasArts' best point and click adventure. The writing in this game speaks for itself!. Mixed feelings. Story is kinda fun, and I loved some dialogs and scenes. On the other hand - some puzzles were really unlogic and I wouldn't finish it without walkthrough. Also steering should be improved.. An obscenely long oldschool adventure. Has it's good moments, but I've never managed to actually find the willpower to finish it.. Terrible controls and mind numbing puzzles that make no sense and defy logic.. In spite of the outstanding visual and audio design and truly amazing characters, voicing and narration, the game is nearly unplayable due to the ridiculously obtuse and non-sensical solutions required for the puzzles. It's a shame as the design and story deserve so much more from the gameplay.. Nice and classic. Masterpiece Story, animation (at that time), and music made this unforgettable experience. I've completed it maybe 5 times, so I wish it was more forgettable so that I can enjoy it as much as I did the first time. Granted that some puzzles are bordering illogical, it still shouldn't take away from the experience. If you get stuck, just read a walkthrough.. A MORTAL MASTERPIECE BEFORE WE BEGIN: Grim Fandango Remastered was originally developed by LucasArts, remastered and financed by Double Fine, and released in 2015. It brings back several noteworthy graphical improvements from the original title dating back to 1998. The game is 100% complete in its pc version. DEAD, UNDEAD: The introduction to the game's plot is extremely straightforward and crystal clear. The superb quality of art direction that this title has to offer is already underscored by the extremely creative LucasArts and Double Fine logos alone, which always take the style of the reference game and change from time to time. Thanks to the introductory cutscene, the player is immediately able to understand everything that revolves around the protagonist Manny Calavera, a death travel agent dedicated to earning enough to reach the ninth afterlife. As soon as the movie ends, the player finds himself with a fresh assignment to fulfill and can begin his work immediately. The first thing that jumps out at you, or rather, that does not jump out at you is the lack of a HUD, this is because throughout the game it will be the player's job to unearth the interacting objects, making the adventure more interactive and surprising. PURSUING DEATH: The game gameplay is that of a typical early 2000s graphic adventure, with a focus by the developers to move away from what was the usual point-and-click of that era. The Remastered version then made it possible to use the mouse, which was originally blocked. As mentioned above, one of the main features of Grim Fandango is that it does not have any always-on HUD. Like other graphic adventures, there is an inventory of possessed objects and a menu of interactions with objects set up on the map, but unlike other LucasArts titles it is not possible to join possessed objects together. The additional mother feature is, of course, the puzzles. They are varied and almost always require the ingenuity of the player. Some of them, however, rely far too much on dialogue between the various characters. This becomes a problem given the inability to listen to some of them several times, making the solution of the riddles almost impossible to understand and causing them to expire at a mere use of all available options. This forces the player to wander the map in search of often nonexistent solutions. The game plot turns out to be extremely varied. It spans four years where Manny will accomplish various tasks, with numerous intrigues to be solved, both work-related and emotional. DEADLY GOOD: Grim Fandango's graphics, whether original or remastered, are certainly one of its focal points. It still manages to be stunning to this day, with extremely detailed and inspired models. Thanks to meticulous techniques put in place by the development team, many of the models turn out to be well-defined and far superior to those out there. The atmosphere that the art in this game manages to create is unmatched, with styles of Mexican folklore combined with the noire of mystery movies. Of course, the animations belong to that era and have remained untouched in its remastered version, so as not to spoil the authors' original tone. Moreover, the variety of environments, always different throughout the journey, grants a style that is always original and never predictable. The conception of the style and the studies that led to its development are noticeable from the minuteness of the details ranging from the backgrounds to the characters' expressions, from their characterization to the interwoven and branching story; all of which led to the creation of this majestic composition. THE NINTH NOTE: The music side perfectly accompanies what was described in the chapter above. The extremely inspired soundtrack goes to perfectly enhance every environment and scene in the game, as well as catalyze the setting of the noir style. Finally, an incredibly noteworthy point is that of the voice acting, which is excellent in its English language but reaches one of its highest peaks ever seen in a video game in its Italian version, which takes advantage of the numerous presence of dialects to give additional characterization to the characters. BUT WHY 9? PROS: Grim Fandango is for sure one of those games that once played is hard to forget. The number of positive points is staggering. It is certain that it remains a unique product of its kind but more importantly a game that borders on narrative and illustrative perfection. CONS: The real negative point is added by the remastering of the game, which, while adding a myriad of technical and graphical fixes, goes on to create a variety of bugs that are capable of completely breaking the game. Between those that delete game saves, those that completely lock the player out, and those that create amusing graphical glitches, it is almost impossible not to encounter any of them. RATING Gameplay: 8 Music: 9,5 Story: 10 Puzzle: 8 _. Probably my favorite game of all time. From the puzzles and the charming characters, to the environment and the masterclass in world-building. This is the game that, to me, is the closest thing the world of games ever has come to actual art.. this game is something else, I enjoyed so much , thanks for everything guys. A one in a century game Love it though. Wish there was a proper remake or a sequel. One of the best PC games EVER Grim Fandango make you cry,make you laugh and can entertain you. With a subtle irony the game runs fast. Puzzles that make you mind-bending to be solved. Incredible storyline Memorable soundtrack and an immense charm I recommend Grim Fandango to anyone who loves video games. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 6.. Best adventure game to date, unforgettable story and funny characters. Damn I miss old point and click adventure games.. A very original game with great humour, but overly obtuse puzzles (normal for the genre) harm it from getting a higher score.. I remember being 13yo playing this without a supported graphics card and whatever there was a shadow or fog/mist I would instead see inverted colours and weird flashes making the game more eerie and weird for a kid just getting into 3d games. Fond memories. The puzzles are way way too random, illogical, convoluted. At first I was really digging the art style, writing, and atmosphere, then I got really stuck after trying everything I could think of. I looked up what to do online, and it was just such random ridiculous stuff there were no clues for, there was no ""Aha!"" moment.. I played dozens of games from 97 till now. I can say with my hand on my hearth that this game is a perfect 10. There is no other game to match this. I cried when i finished it. It's the only time i cried finishing a game. I truly think this should be the no 1 rated game. It's just too beautiful. I was 13 y/o when i finished it. I still remember the feeling after 18 years. If you have a kid that like video games, give him/her this to play.. The funniest, most difficult and most personality of all the graphic adventures with monkey island that I have ever played. Lucas Arts is definitely the king of the genre. Unforgettable characters and artistic section. Nothing more to say, forced its purchase for fans of the genre.. Great game. i have spent a lot of time on this title. It has a great story with memorable characters. Good gameplay and best cut scenes with good dialogs.. Surely the greatest adventure game of all time ! Beatiful OST, an original story with appealing characters, you must try this game in your life ! A remaster as been releas not long ago, here is your chance !. This game is Tim Burton's Batman. This game is Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. This game is Tim Schafer's magnum opus. The king of adventure games. There is a remastered version out now - in case you've missed this gem.. Pros: really fantastic atmosphere and music, a lots of humour and hilarious story with adorable characters. Cons: impossibly hard puzzles, the control scheme is far from perfect. Potentially even better than the famed Monkey Island games. Although they made this genre famous by bringing it to the masses, in hindsight, this game represents their pinnacle to me. The ultimate product of their golden age. This game is a film noir styled game which touched me much like watching a very good movie, or reading a good book. It lingered for a long time within me even after I had finished it. It finds beauty and comedy in themes that are traditionally not beautiful nor funny. That it stands without a sequel is somehow illustrative of the kind of game it is: there can be no two highest pinnacles, only one.. If you only buy one PC adventure game, strike that, one PC game, no one electronic game period, this should be it. There is no other game which so clearly excelled in use of structure, interface, music, 2d art direction, voice talent, scripting at both character and plot levels to create an imaginative world which is once familiar and accessible, and at the same time thought provoking and full of humor. No tired old sword and sorcery rehash here. This is the ONLY video game that has achieved the level of fine art in all respects. An unforgettable experience. Forget all others: LucasArts had a complete failure of nerve due to this game: it went over its initial market audiences' head. This is the only game on any top gamers list that is commendable for actual grownup adult play.. This game has everything. I can safely say this is my favorite game of all time. It's got a fantastic ambiance, unforgettable music, compelling, funny and witty characters, excellent writing, superb voice acting, a perfect story, hard puzzles, a very lenghty ""campaign"" (I guess that's what kids would call it these days), tongue in cheek references to noir movies, the Dia De Los Muertos tradition and other Lucas Arts games. This game was everything that used to be exciting and great about the video games industry. The pinnacle of the point and click andventures. Even with its clunky controls and out dated graphics, this is still the funniest, greatest game I have played until today.. Grim Fandango is simply the best graphic adventure game ever created, along with Monkey Island I & II. Awesome setting, well written characters, challenging enigmas. It never got the popularity it deserves, but I can assure it's a masterpiece.. Absolutely awesome and classic quest with perfect storyline and interesting **** is the Land of the Dead,old jazz country with weird ****'s see what present will you have after your death!. I could detail the premise, of how this is about Manny and his journey through the land of the dead, but I don't want to unveil any spoilers whatsoever. Simply put, this game is just... sensational. I can't write enough superlatives for it. It's timeless too - every bit as enjoyable to play in 2014 as it was upon release. No game has come close to being as atmospheric, as complete an experience since. The definitive title in a golden age of PC gaming. It took the foundations laid by the exceptional Monkey Island series and expanded on it to create a storytelling experience that is as close to faultless as gaming can get. The art style is sublime and perfectly pulled off, utterly timeless, and the ambient soundtrack is as good as anything you can imagine. The whole thing is just seamless, a work of absolute genius from a very talented game studio. You are pulled into the world from the onset and it doesn't let you go. The puzzles are excellent, if sometimes a bit contrived but not overly so as to detract from the gaming experience. Everything is logical without being too easy, whilst managing to be challenging yet not impossible. The sole issue with the title is that you look at all other games in an unfavourable light next to it. As in it can ruin gaming for you in the long term, as you end up using it as the benchmark for everything else. An insanely, impossibly high benchmark. Make no mistake, this is the quintessential PC gaming experience. You owe it to yourself to pick this game up. The hype doesn't do it justice. Just... get it, seriously. Make it work on a modern system, do whatever you can to invest your time into it. It's a life changing title, one of the greatest of all time and I wouldn't argue with anyone who calls it the single greatest game ever made. So good, that no other point and click adventure could measure up to it afterwards. So good, that at certain times you can't help but actually applaud it. I mean physically clap. Incredible. If you've ever played a FPS and thought, ""is there something a bit more to gaming than this?""... well, here's your answer. Please, please, please play this game.. Easily in my top 3 adventure games of all time. Clever puzzles, great atmosphere, dialogues, dark humor and an amazing soundtrack. There is no way you won't like it. It's a masterpiece.. Immersive and hopelessly addictive. This left an indelible mark on my teenage years. This game is in my hall of fame, along with Myst and the Curse of Monkey Island.. One of the best graphical adventures as well as Monkey Island and The Longest Journey! The plot is amazing, you will love the characters and the ambience is great. This is, without a doubt, and as other reviewers have stated already, one of the greatest games ever made. It left an impression on me in a way that very few games ever had before, or have since. I have replayed it countless times. The plot is nebulous, compelling and exquisitely woven. The art style and aesthetics are beautiful, and fit perfectly in every scene, as does the musical score. Look for critical reviews (from a time when they actually meant something) for a more in depth look at this game. For my own part, all I will say is that anyone who has not played this game is missing out on one of the greatest gaming and storytelling experiences I have ever had.. One of the greatest PC games of all time, this game does not age and I mean it, I am just telling you to go and play Grim Fandango and witness its amazing Story, Soundtrack and Atmosphere, the characters are memorable and the voice acting is great, this game contains Tim Schafers amazing witty humor and some good puzzles, 2d lovers get over it please, Monkey Island and DOTT are my favorite games and I will put Grim Fandango up there with them, this is a great game and still has the adventure feel to it. Get ResidualVM and play this game now. One of the most amusing games I've ever played on PC. It's a creative adventure game heavily influenced by classic noir films and the Mexican ""Day of the Dead"" traditions. It's packed with intermittent dark humor. As a kid I mostly played games on my brother's old NES, SNES or Genesis, or my PS1 or N64. This was one of the first games I really enjoyed on a computer and for that, and for its own merits as a well crafted video game, Grim Fandango will always have a spot in my heart. -Warning. I've not played this game in about ten years, I have no idea if it has aged well or not.. The Best of the Best. Soundtrack is beyond above average. The story line and twists are far beyond the imagination of the motion picture industry. As the story continues you start to fall in love with the characters and this transforms this tricky and challenging game into a rewarding journey. There is a great demand for a sequel.. A true classic in every way. Just installed the game again after having not played in over 10 years and it still feels like new. This, along with Day of the Tentacle and Sam and Max, will never grow old.. Probably my favorite game of all time. Great story and characters. I cant believe its 13 years old now. I really hope they make a sequel. Probably wont happen though.. Virtually all LucasArts Games at the time this title was released are amazing. Grim Fandango is no exception. Incredibly creative, funny and challenging. It creates its own atmosphere and you miss it as badly as you miss playing the game itself. A work of art!. Grim Fandango was one of the most ambitious adventure games Lucas Arts made in the 90s and it does succeed in its noir theme, style, ideas, story and character arc. HOWEVER the control scheme of Grim Fandango is bad, VERY bad, its clumsy and ill suited to an adventure game, even with a controller. The choice to have such a bad control scheme may have come due to the decline of adventure games and the need to make game playable on a console but it doesnt change what is still crappy, slow, awkward and causes some frustration while playing, particularly when you think to what this game could have been with traditional adventure controls. Having said that the story of Grim does make up for it as the atmosphere is pretty awesome and Manny Calivera is to this day one of video games greatest characters. Grim Fandango has one of the best stories in gaming but slapped up in an adventure game with crappy controls. Of course its playable but it does screw up a masterpiece.. A very entertaining game. IF you can get it to work that is... There is a hyper-threading (whatever that means) issue reported by some multi processor users, including me, causing crashes and such, and it's a bit of a headache - but once you get past that! you will be glad you did; It's a very funny portrayal of the afterlife - narrated by the comedic hero Manny as you guide him through his adventures in the Land of the Dead. I played through this game years and years ago, popped it in again just recently for kicks :D and it still kicks hard.. 12 years old and i still enjoy playing this game. Probably one of the best lucas arts games of all time. A sequel would be legendary. A definite must have for any pc gamer.","a MORTAL MASTERPIECE BEFORE WE BEGIN: Grim Fandango Remastered was originally developed by LucasArts, remastered and financed by Double Fine . the game is 100% complete in its pc version ."
720.Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror,"Trot the globe as superspy Gabe Logan in this great little action adventure with just the right mix of stealth and blasting action to work on a handheld.. This game is just bland. There is pretty much no stealth gameplay which i thought the game would have but instead you have a game with just a bland story, terrible voice acting and meh gameplay. Couldn't recommend.. Although I have forgotten the story, I can never forget that I wnjoyed playing this.. In this review, only the negative aspects of the game are considered. The purpose of this work is to help you to get a better decision on the purchase of the game My Rating: 7 of 10 Weak points : - Some parts of the story remain obscure - Bad dialogues and characters are soulless - Has basic glitches in character control. One of the best portable gaming experiences you can have. You don't play a character in this game you become the character. One of the very best games for the PSP and one that all gamers should experience.. Syphon filter dark mirror could have been made better. Logan's shadow is way better than this one! A very big down fall for this game is that it graphics during the videos is very poor. But the one in Logan's shadow makes you feel like you are playing it in a ps3 but in actual fact it is a psp!. Pure awesomeness.. This game is great overall. Perfect story execution, great presentation, and the gameplay and controls for a third-person shooter are flawless. The sound is decent, though the gun sounds are not that impressive. The guns sound underpowered, and sometimes the gun sounds just don't match what the gun should sound like in real life. The graphics are of high quality, and it runs smoothly with no lag (that I can detect). My only issue with this game is some of the graphic details are a bit strange or lacking. For example, some of the guns look strangely small in Logan's hands. Some guns are long enough, but look almost as flat as cardboard. And when you hold the flashlight or the taser, there is not actually a flashlight or taser shown in Logan's hands. Besides that, the story is great to play through, but it's not something I would play over and over again because it can be a little linear. Multiplayer is amazing though. It's a shame that there's not alot of people playing it anymore. The controls work extremely well during combat. Surprisingly, most of the combat takes place at long distances. Players will seldom find themselves circling around their opponent in a chicken fight like they might expect to in a handheld shooter. If you get too close to your opponent to be accurate with your shots, you can always run into them and knock them into the ground via melee attack, and then finish them off with your gun. I think the multiplayer portion of this game is so great, I would choose to play this over ModernWarfare3 on the console. Multiplayer offers true variety and intense gunfights. But how about adding extra modes such as coop, or a mini game mode where you go through maps killing baddies who spawn in random locations? The small shortcomings and issues which I have stated earlier are the only things that are keeping me from scoring this game with a 10. But otherwise, it's a damn fine game for a PSP. The first fully realised game on the PSP - it made portable third person shooters possible on the PSP, paving the way for the Metal Gear Solid games, particularly Peace Walker, and reinvigorated the Syphon Filter franchise, so much so that a new game is coveted still today. The use of face buttons as a second analog stick is simple when you think about it, but it took this game to fully realise the concept and pave the way for other games. It wasn't just the amazing controls either that made this game great - the combat was awesome, and fluid with the player's movements, while there is a plethora of missions, achievements, and a hard difficulty that's actually hard. Also an amazing score by Mark Snow (Smallville) adds to the greatness of this game. This game may not have as many rabid fans as the Metal Gear Solid games on PSP, but for my money, this is the game to beat for 3rd person shooters on PSP, perhaps even the best portable game of all genres. It's that good!. awesome. great gameplay decent plot but hours and hours of gameplay. only thing i didnt like is that it broke about a month after i bought it. should've made it for the 360 or ps3.","this game is just bland.

721.The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I can't describe the suct with which this game captivated me in front of the TV. It wasn't a game like another before or after. Because it wasn't just a game. 2002 I was in Morrowind!. This is a great pen world rpg. There are many interesting things that can be done in the game that you can't do in Oblivion or Skyrim. Revisited this game in 2024 and although the graphics are very dated, the gameplay aspect was still wonderful.. It is much more than just a game. The words cannot explain it. The atmosphere and gameplay are so immersive to the point where you feel like the game is your second life. I would love to see a remaster of this game from BGS, but that might not happen.. Today this game is very hard. If you can't play the game because you are weak and all enemies kill you, you probably will hate this game. But if you try to play and start to look to the world of this game, you will love it. Because the lore is perfect and the game is very fun if you can start to explore the map and understand the lore.. Game is dated, combat is static, magic is practically impossible on console, but the lore of this game is absolutely incredible. The music is the best in the series. The atmosphere matches the setting, and the setting helps immerse you in a strange, far-away land where you are a known outsider. WEather effects, as primitive as they look now, helped with the environmental storytelling in Morrowind that they have never recaptured. Part of the Bethesda magic died with this game, for all it's faults, and I encourage anyone with the patience to learn the system that there is an incredible adventure RPG here, but also an entire world, with it's own geography, politics, historiography, wars, Gods, stories, and mushroom dwellings to find. Huge game and very satisfying experience for me.. I had a hard time at first. Sometimes I got lost in the game. But its world drew me in very quickly. His story is very good. It is a pleasure to open the dialogues word by word. As you get stronger in the game, you start to have more fun. And towards the end, you are now immortal. I've finished Skyrim and Oblivion a few times. I couldn't get started with Morrowind. I had a lot of fun. As a minus. 1_) The physics engine is a bit buggy. But it's not bad for its year. Sometimes the characters block your path and you get stuck. 2_) The map design is too closed in some places. You are staying among the mountains. But it gets easier when you get advanced spells.. The only good TES game with very interesting storyline.Oblivion is a trash. Skyrim is mediocre at best.. The first Elder Scrolls game I have played and still an incredible experience to date. Skyrim is a bit better and easier to get into, but after some hours of buggy Oblivion, I loved to come back to this classic. Overall rating: 9.1.. Morrowind has to be my favorite Elder Scrolls game. Heck, it's one of my favorite games of all time! The ginormous alienated world of Vvardenfell is absolutely fantastic to explore with it's overwhelmingly large texts of lore to get hooked to, with an ACTUALLY GOOD main quest (unlike Skyrim and Oblivion) and endless amounts of side quests to do. Yes the combat is outdated, and yes the game can get quite slow especially with the lack of fast travel, but for a game that was made in 2002, it is a masterpiece. A must play for all.. I have no doubt this game was groundbreaking at the time, but god is it not fun today. First problem: fatigue. Fatigue is like stamina in this game, except everything drains it. Walking drains it, jumping drains it, All attacks drain it, it just gets super low super quickly. Second problem: linearity. This is an open world without the open. Every single trail you go down is almost completely linear, leaving no room for exploration. Along with that, there is almost nothing to do along said trails. So most of the game is just taken up with walking and nothing else. It also doesn't have fast travel, so you have to spend even more time walking. Stealth in this game barely works, You can walk up to somebody fully invisible, steal something from a shelf beside them, and you'd get detected. On top of that the combat isn't that great either. You have a chance to miss your attack if you have low enough fatigue, which you probably do because of how easily it drains, and all you really do is swing your sword over and over again. So really, nothing about this game is fun. The only plus I can give it is that everyone walks like they just **** themselves, and it looks funny.. Even today Morrowind is one of my favorite games. The graphics and gameplay are extremely outdated but the game as a whole is so good that it doesn't matter.. I often started playing The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, but as a child I was simply overwhelmed. Much to read, a lot to understand and a very slow gameplay in the beginning. Now, 18 years later I finally finished this big adventure. And it was worth it! I already played Arena, Daggerfall, Oblivion and Skyrim and every game is a jewel. Of course, the graphics are dated for today´s standards but the story and characters are unique. If you like to spend hours with a great RPG, Morrowind is still a recommendation. A perfect game for cold winter days!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best open world rpg ever and u can play it on Xb1 now with improved resolution /graphics!. The third chapter in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls Saga has a few issues, but is mostly a diamond-solid rpg. The quests are interesting, the combat is good enough, and the soundtrack is also quite impressive too. The main lagging issue with Morrowind are the terrible graphics. They really blunt the experience so fatally that a good amount of people could be tempted to skip this game. Overall, good game, but abysmal graphics that nearly ruin the entire game.. This is the best game RPG I have ever played, as well as my overall favorite video game ever. I understand that nostalgia may be a factor here-I completely acknowledge it-however when I pick up Morrowind vs. Oblivion or Skyrim or any other RPG, I find myself more intrigued and wanting to play Morrowind, even though I've beaten it 5-6 time before. Its hard to eloquently state what makes this game so perfect. The graphics are not good (it came out in 2002), the fighting aspect of it is primitive and the map is overall much smaller than Oblivion and Skyrim. However, there is an intangible aspect that makes this game so much more satisfying than any other game I've played. Quite simply, this is the best and most real RPG world ever created, even considering how long ago the game was made. The world itself is fascinating, the people in it are incredibly unique, and there an effect that is almost eerily creepy, yet very comforting when playing this game. I think it is the music, coupled with the exact layout and style of the world, as well as the incredible amount of detail they put into the game that makes this gaming experience so satisfying. You could probably spend a month just reading the various books they have in the game. You have to deal with people who own slaves yet have admirable characteristics, people who are generally good and people who are generally bad. There is an obviously intense political nature to the whole place-House vs. House, Empire vs. All of the houses, and the temple vs. everybody. I think its the overall nature of the dark elves that makes this game so great. The dark elves were the 'black sheep' of all the races on Tamriel. Their style and culture was considered alien to the rest of the people of Tamriel, they have a naturally reclusive nature, yet they are probably objectively the most powerful race throughout the game series. These factors, as well as the fact that this game was released in a time before gaming companies started their BS, allowed the people who made Morrowind to make a game that was truly an artists piece of work. I would suggest to only pick up this game if you have 100+ hours over the next year of your life to put into it, as well as you should be an intelligent person. I don't think stupid people properly appreciate this game. However, if you are willing to devote the time and mental effort (truly pay attention and make an effort to learn this world) into this game, you will come out feeling more satisfied than any other game you have ever played, and you will probably be a smarter person for it. Something about this game-again not tangible-is so incredibly perfect, appropriate and intelligent. The first RPG world I ever felt that could truly be real.. It is almost impossible to hit someone in combat. I try 10 times and only hit once or twice. After I tried to kill a simple spider and died, I decided to just quit the game.. Not bad at all, great compared to the PC version, has minor bugs when playing it on the original Xbox, but on the xbox 360 I have yet to see any bugs a pure RPG game, the combat is a little unbalanced, but its because the game adds into effect your attributes and your luck, and your skill with your current weapon. has the journal system that the GOTY edition got, so that's good. ---Rating--- Design: 4 /5 (slightly weak combat system, but otherwise interesting mechanics and narrative) Polish: 2 /5 (mediocre graphics and an abundance of bugs, some more serious than others) Value: 5 /5 (standard price, but sets the standard for replay value with its huge in-game world) ---Review--- There are many concrete aspects in regard to which Morrowind isn't all that exceptional, but in terms of the intangibles the game provides an excellent experience. It may not be the prettiest game, even for its time, but the mood and ambiance of the setting feels truly immersive, as much as the Ashlands could really use more color. There are many bugs and glitches to suffer through and/or exploit (depending on how you look at it), and the combat system is a bit underdeveloped, but the game's depth provides the player with countless hours of play. For newcomers looking for something a bit more manageable, I'd recommend the Bloodmoon expansion, but Vvardenfell itself is certainly worth exploring even without taking the many possible questlines into account.. Long before Oblivion and Skyrim took the Elder Scrolls series to the next level, both in terms of quality and popularity, the series third entry (Morrowind) found itself ported to the original Xbox. Many of the series features are already present but little to no effort is made to make it accessible to anyone other than experienced PC RPG gamers. As a result most console owners will really struggle to get into Morrowind in any meaningful way.. The first time I played this game I absolutely hated it. It was too big the combat was clunky and I never had an idea of what I was supposed to do. I managed to stick with it and once I figured out what to do and how to fight and how leveling works, this game turned from unpleasant to incredible. I have been playing the same character since October 2009 and every 3 or so months i will plug it in and play through a quest-line, with over 200 hours long and many more quest-lines to go I will be playing this character for many more years to come.. The open-world RPG that was miles ahead of its time. Being a simple teenager, I first played morrowind a few good years after it came out. So far in fact that the game was beginning drastically to show its age, but that didn't stop me from loving it and becoming a fan of the genre in general (a fandom that i still hold today). Thanks morrowind!. Started playing this game about six years ago and I still play it to this day. It's simply the best fantasy RPG in existence and it tops Skryim, Oblivion, and Fallout 3. Its beautiful landscape, style, and gameplay will affect you like no other game ever has. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is the greatest game ever to be released.. this is the best game I've ever played. I guess modern gamers don't like it because the combat system is bad, also they want lots of action and don't want to wait very long in order to get a character that cannot miss enemies. for me the story is interesting and rich. the feeling and the adventure are best parts of this game. you should find help in the unofficial elder scrolls pages website if you need help with this game. i loved this game if it wasnt for the bugs and glitches it would get a score of 10 from me . the 2 biggest and annoying are the game freezing up once you get about half way done with it but you can cut it down alot if you deleate your save every so often and make a new one . the other one is one of the main quests is glitched and i got all the way to the end but got stuck in a glitch and could not finish it >< . that aside ive never seen a game that gives you so much to do in it and can be so fun . like being a thief is just a blast (even better then oblivion) . i love how you never know whats in any place you explore . it could be some low level thiefs or a nast deadrich cult . the thrill of exploration is just addicting and finding cool and rare items and gear . i love the fact you can fly in this game . the level up system is alittle goofy but after you play it abit and adjust its a real easy system and leveling up is a synch . its just a shame about the bugs and glitches .","the lore of this game is absolutely incredible . the music is the best in the series . the game is dated, combat is static, magic is practically impossible on console ."
722.The Swapper,"Great art game representing ludonarrative concept. Neat story with gaps we all are free to fill. The story is dependent on the gameplay, which is not very hard. I liked the concept, music, and aesthetics.. I am giving it a 10. Many years after I beat it I came to the conclusion that this game is a gold standard for me to which I compare and judge other titles. I've become increasingly aware of that recently. It is just a really quality deep sci-fi story (which is the most important part), a great ""setting-atmosphere-theme"" (second most important), and a very good and interesting puzzle platformer (third). This game has 10 years now and is representative of our industry in that it simply doesn't invest in quality ""not safe"" stories anymore.. with unravel best looking platform game. solving to puzzles and space travel copying yourself feels like portal very deep and complex some times requre to manage gravity carefully. its work on windows xp with 2005 pc even with that amazing looking graphics. this and unvravel so much better than limbo like or ori like games.. The Swapper is a puzzle-platform video game for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It was developed and published by Facepalm Games, a small independent company based in Helsinki, Finland. A science fiction-themed title, the player controls a female scavenger stranded aboard an abandoned research station, and discovers a strange device that allows her to create clones of herself and switch her consciousness between these clones. The player uses this ability to solve various puzzles and learn about the fate of the station's researchers.. The story is quite nice with probably the best ending I have ever experience in a game. Of course the storytelling isn't comparable to the immersive and interactive storytelling like in SOMA, Titanfall 2, Half-Life or Firewatch. I mean it's a 2D sidescroller (logic) puzzle game and the story isn't fully presented via the gameplay, dialogues and environmental storytelling. A part is put in computers you have to find and then read text. So parts of the incredible story are similar to cutscene-like storytelling disconnected a bit in my opinion. But I still recommend.. What is ‘self’? What is consciousness? What does it mean to be alive? Is this a course on ontological philosophy? Nope! It’s The Swapper, a game that will test your mental mettle in more ways than one. At its core, The Swapper is a solid, challenging minimalist puzzler. But it’s also so much more. The game is absolutely dripping with atmosphere. The dimly lit space station is equal parts threatening and inviting, the somber soundtrack which follows the player on their journey could not be better suited to the game’s lonely mood. Exploring the enigmatic station is fascinating in and of itself, but the brief zero-gravity jaunts are definite highlights, and potentially some of the most cathartic experiences in all of gaming. Tying everything together is the weighty, gorgeous, hand-crafted art. Hand-crafted, by the way, is meant here in the most literal sense. Just about everything in the game was physically molded from clay before being placed in the game (think digitized claymation), and the result is a feeling of weight and realness unlike anything you’re likely to have seen before. As The Swapper progresses, those questions I mentioned above begin to quietly come into play. Ever-so-subtly, one snippet of dialogue at a time, the game begins to plant seeds of doubt in the player’s mind; doubt not only about their place and actions in the game’s world, but also about more universal concepts of existence which are very much applicable the real world. The Swapper makes no grand claims and forces nothing on the player. It merely coaxes complex ideas into the light. Whether or not you examine them is your choice. I wish I could provide specifics, but part of the wonder of The Swapper is uncovering both the mystery and the philosophy for oneself. Give it a try.. One of the best puzzle games I have ever played. I really liked the art, design, concept and gameplay. I advise it to anyone who likes this genre. 5hrs on record.. When I first started playing this game for the first time, it seemed to me that it was boring and somehow viscous, both game-play and graphic. But something caught on and, nevertheless, I spent some time going further ... and then even further, and so on until the very end. No, the sensation of viscosity did not go away, but it turned into a feeling of immersion in the atmosphere of some cosmic slow thriller with an interesting visual view of the environment. And the boredom simply resolved, after the first levels, when it was necessary to begin to solve the ""riddles"" of this game ... The plot of the game is revealed gradually, and the climax makes you experience a vivid impression (although it seems that this ending can be considered partly stereotyped, but in this game, an excellent decision was to make exactly as it was done). This game deserves to be called one of the best of its genre (platformer).. A really good puzzle game with a surprisingly remarkable story and philosophy behind it. The puzzles are up front and they are really good with a big variety of obstacles, their gradual complexity feels very well thought out, the game doesn't feel like getting too hard out of nowhere. The game is beautiful and the music is fitting for the ""space and all alone"" theme, and the story is very deep and philosophical, making you wanting to find out more about what happened and what are the aliens. The only problem for me is what happens with every puzzle game, after you beat the puzzle the replayability is really low.. The Swapper is surely a good game. The gameplay is simple, but it have some very good puzzles especially in the end of the game. The story is interesting and for an indie game surely a good one. Graphics does not look cheap, sometimes it is even not bad. The biggest advantage is the duration in my opinion: for few hours you get to know a good game. This sounds always good.. The Swapper is story focused puzzle game. The story is the main draw and is great sci-fi with even better atmosphere and aesthetic. The puzzles revolve around making copies of yourself who are chained to the movement of the player character. The game can beat in under 4 hours but you will probably need a guide to get 10/10 achievements.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. This game kicked ass. Even though I finished it in one sitting, I loved the atmosphere, the graphics, and obviously the puzzles. Easily one of my favorite PC games.. Game's not bad, but too much enphasis on the puzzles, which some times can be unnerving.. The story and atmosphere are pretty crazy though. I preferred other titles like Limbo or Inside. A good and solid puzzly game. While being atmospheric visually and auditory it somewhat lacks diversity. Because of this, the sense of progression in the game is driven by increasing puzzle difficulty and the story; but while the puzzles do indeed become very hard at a good pace, the story is OKish and not enough to move the game along. As a result, i played Swapper for about 4 hours, and while joyful - that was enough for me. RECOMMEND.. Solid Puzzle Game wih good atmoshpehre (sound, light) which remembered me of the Alien movies. Puzzles are not to hard which is totally fine. It is Ok that they repeat better this way than having a to short game. On PC good playable with XBOX Controller (it even asks if you want a PS4 one at the start - but dont know if there is a difference). The Swapper is a nice sidescrolling puzzler with an eerie mood and some philosophical side notes that sort of build a storyline. Better executed than Talos Principle though which was tl;dr with all the reading material it throws at you. The puzzles are challenging and I'd say a bit above average. One I took forever to get right. There's nothing exceptionally good about this game, and nothing bad. The only thing I'd complain about is that there's no setting for sound levels. You like puzzlers? Go for it - don't expect any other entertainment from it though, it's not Limbo.. I managed to solve most of the puzzles on my own. Then I forgot about the game for a year. The goal when I played it today was complete it so I used YouTube for the last puzzles. And the puzzles in my opinion are the least interesting part of the game. The best part is when you've finished it and read discussions on its meaning and ending. The whole story is actually quite thought provoking when you start to ask questions. But be warned; this game might go on for too long and the voice acting is pretty bad. Don't feel bad if you look up the solutions on YouTube. Your actually doing yourself a favor by being able to listen the pops of a fireplace and take in the clay made scenery. Not bad for a game filled with rocks. You'll know what I mean shortly.. After one hour, this seems like a run-of-the-mill platformer with an unique puzzle element that is interesting at first and repetitive very soon. Slap a semi-interesting and semi-crypic story element on and here's another indie-platformer that is buried in praise I don't seem to understand. The thing is, this review could be used for a large number of today's indie platformers. One good idea and nice graphics don't automatically equal a good game for me. To be quite fair, it's not a bad game. It is 'just another game'. Which is exactly what's wrong with it in my eyes.. An awesome puzzle game that is right up there with Braid and the Portal series. Very unique and fun mechanics, challenging but fair puzzles, and an aesthetically pleasing environment. My only knock on the game really is the esoteric story but even that is intriguing to an extent. Love it.. A clever and innovative puzzle game. The atmosphere is immersive and intriguing; The presentation and sound is simple but effective. It is an elegant experience that is both challenging, fund, and rewarding. If you have even a remote interest in puzzle games, you should definitely give it a go.. Solid puzzle game, with a couple ****. 1. The last third of the game is notably easier than the middle third, which contains the hardest puzzles. 2. The story is intriguing and drives the game forwards, but very anti-climactic. It neither resolves the questions raised during the game, nor does it bring much closure. The ending I saw was bleak and didn't make too much sense, tbh. But these are minor points, really. As a puzzle game, it's a solid 7 out of 10. Why Metacritic thinks a 7/10 is a ""mixed"" rating I don't know. To me, 7 out of 10 is a positive review!. The Swapper is a game about philosophy of mind, staring Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers discussion over the question of whether consciousness can exist independently of the brain. This discussion is presented piece by piece, and very slowly. You solve the game’s puzzles by swapping your mind to other vessels, your clones. It makes you ask: What is a mind? Am I my mind? How am I, if I’m not sure if this is my original mind or someone else’s mind? It is a delightful experience from the beginning to the end. The fact that it is made out of clay, like The Neverhood and The Dream Machine, is a very nice touch too. This is an all-time favorite.. Since discovering Portal in the Orange Box, I've been a big fan of puzzlers. The Swapper delivers a unique appearance, a strange story, and some damn hard puzzles. Overall an experience well worth the time.. Tier 1 + Highly creative puzzles with a unique gameplay hook + Interesting visual design (the whole game world was made with claymation) + A creative story and progression married closely to the gameplay ? Narrative has a somewhat flat ending - Some puzzles can be just a bit too oblique to figure out. This is one of the better puzzle games I've played. It offers a simple and straight-forward concept and utilises it to its full potential - create clones of yourself that copy your every move in order to solve puzzles. The puzzles vary between each other, and some introduce new things into the mix. For example not being able to create any clones within blue light, or not being able to swap between the clones within red light. In late stages the game also offers gimmicks with artificial gravity too, which adds a layer of complexity to the puzzles. Most of the game has you solve puzzles in order to collect orbs, and a certain number of these is required to get past checkpoints to another area. I really liked this semi-open feel of exploration that the game offered, and for most of it you didn't even have to solve every single puzzle in order to make progress. You could afford to skip some. However, the very last console checkpoint requires that you solve every single puzzle that's left. Most of the puzzles were really intuitive and felt rewarding when you solved them, but I wasn't a fan of a few near the end. Three of the puzzles took me so many attempts that I eventually had to consult a walkthrough. I think that it would've been better if the final checkpoint didn't require every single puzzle to be solved. Throughout exploring the ship and solving puzzles, there are many logs and interactable computer terminals that shed light on the creepy backstory behind this device that you're using to create clones. In general the story was in the background, but its concepts would leave you thinking of what's morally right, especially with the way it concluded with an interesting choice of two alternate endings. All in all, I enjoyed the game and thought it was pulled off really well. Only the last few puzzles near the end frustrated me. Would certainly recommend it for all fans of puzzle games.. Pretty much perfect if you like metroidvanias or puzzle games or speculative fiction. I really can't think of more to say. The puzzles are sometimes very challenging, but very satisfying to solve, and it's wonderfully atmospheric.. This game is a real jewel. The story about the ""thinking"" stones is really interesting if you follow it, the graphics and the soundtrack add a melancholy feeling and the puzzles are very well done. It's the type of game that you feel you're really inside it. Definitely recommended.. Yes, it is certainly good. But I do not understand the hype. It is a very good indie game but he deserves far from the enthusiasm as had one Limbo. -------- -------------- ------------------ ------------------ ----------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------. The Swapper has a killer atmosphere and an addictive, gratifying puzzle mechanic thanks to it also being part platformer. In addition to the setting & gameplay, there is also a fun sci-fi story with a twist you gradually uncover as you go along. No in-depth explanation of the puzzle system is required as it is easy to pick up. You will scratch your head at some of the puzzles, but all can be solved logically by considering how to work around your limitations. Playing this felt like brain exercise. Outside of the puzzle rooms, it’s fun to clone & zip yourself around as you traverse the map. No traditional, annoying platform jumping. I cannot praise the slick gameplay design enough. I can’t stand how, in some other games, you’ll know how to solve a puzzle but have to fight through clunky controls to carry it out. No problems like that in the Swapper. It is a joy to play. A slick, polished experience from top to bottom. Only a few minor gripes hold this back from a perfect score: - If you want to see both endings, you will have to replay the entire game. It saves automatically and after you choose an ending, the game will only load the credits if you pick “continue”. And neither one is really worth starting all over for, IMO. Not a huge problem since you are allowed to choose an ending and the devs wrote a story into a puzzle game that makes you want to see the ending. And I’ll admit, there is one morally dubious option I think the vast majority of people choose the first time around. Not being able to reload makes it more permanent. - The achievements (on Steam, at least) are virtually impossible to get without utilizing a guide. You have to find a secret console for each achievement, but since there is no description to go along with them, you probably won’t even know you’re supposed to be looking for the consoles. Even if you do, they are ruthlessly hidden. They usually involve swapping up through some random dead end, then over again in a different direction through the wall. This might not be so bad except you better go looking for them before you beat the game, otherwise you’ll have to start all over if you want to get them. - I would have liked a bit more clarification on certain aspects of the protagonist. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers. - It may be a tad on the short side, depending on how long it takes you to solve the puzzles. I only had big trouble with two rooms. One I took a break from, came back the next day and solved. The other was one of the very last rooms and I admit that I cheated b/c it was late and I wanted to see the ending. These are all minor gripes, though, as I said. It is certainly worth $15 and a must-buy if you ever see it on sale. I am hoping to see more indie games like this and less procedurally generated trash like Spelunky. I appreciate how the team behind the Swapper had to sit down and plot out each puzzle room. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I had a great time playing.. Fantastic atmosphere, mind bending puzzles. And story, story is great and leads you through a game. Art style is magnificent, you will fall in love with this game! Do not miss it if you are a puzzler or indie game fan! I'm both!. Gameplay is magnificent, the story is as simple as i want it. The puzzles are great. Really the game is one of the best of 2013 for sure, or maybe one of the best games ever? Time will show for sure, for me it was 7 extremely well spent hours. There is n't something in the game that i didn't like. The game shows the dynamic that right now indie developers have.. Beautiful and eerie sci-fi experience. Nice to see an indie game made by just a few people that is not some kind of infantile pixel art, but truly artistically created piece of art that is beautiful not just visually, but also sonically. The whole experience feels like listening to a good ambient album. The cloning concept is pretty serious material, the story behind it all is interesting enough and puzzles can make your brain boil. Maybe it's too much focused on puzzles for my taste. I would prefer more focus on the ambient environment exploration, the story and the adventure rather than just puzzles, which you end up doing most of the time. The problem is that you can get stuck on some of the more advanced puzzles, solving them for hours and in the meantime the atmosphere disappears, you stop caring about the story and you focus just on the puzzles. 8/10. An excellent puzzle game with a unique concept, pretty much on the level of Braid, Limbo, Antichamber, Fez. Excellent graphics and music. It does get boring after some time, like any puzzle game.. Very nice. 7 Hours playthrough but secrets not found. Very philosophical. Portal puzzles meet space atmosphere. Reminds me of the movie 'moon'. Liked it very much, hard puzzles towards the end of the game. 80/100. The idea is brilliant, but not enough. If we can add some spices to the game and change that world into something more interesting then it could have been much better.. This ~5 hour game is an incredible experience. The atmosphere is built from the art direction, memory terminals, and sound design. The puzzles are thoughtful and challenging. The ending leaves you with an ambiguous choice of morality and forces reflection. The gamepad support is excellent although I haven't played it with K&M. If you enjoyed Braid, Portal, LIMBO, or other puzzle platformers, you should give this a shot.. Amazing and gritty sounds, ambiance, music and graphics that create an atmosphere that fits the storyline perfectly to compliment the exceptionally gripping gameplay that brings something new to an existing genre, pulled off with style. My only gripe would be that I would have loved to have played 10 times longer, but there was only so much to do in the game!. The title of this game fits perfectly, because both story as well as gameplay are about ""swapping"". Great space ambient atmosphere (kinda reminds me an Alien 1 movie) together with challenging puzzles (basically combination of swapping between ""clones"" and reversing gravity) gives you really nice time playing. (HINT: Achievements for this game can be obtained by finding hidden spaceship consoles). Simple idea with a great execution. No need for power ups after the fact or level ups, this just gives you what you need near the start and utilizes it throughout the entire game. Also has an interesting plot to keep all the puzzles interesting.. This game makes you think... In more ways than one. It is immersive, challenging, and definitely worth checking out. The ambient music and desolate environment embrace the tone of the storyline. It is a puzzle game, so completing it without cheating also generates a sense of accomplishment.. The first thing you notice from this game is that it oozes style, the art in this game is simply stunning and really puts you in the theme of space albeit just a platformer. The music blends so perfectly with the game it feels like playable art. Gameplay wise, the game does not lack it either, with puzzles where you swap around bodies to solve can get quite difficult and in the later levels, a serious brain tease. However I cared little for the little story that it presented which was a shame cause I think it could have been told better and that would have enhanced my experience further. A small gripe for me as well were the ridiculous achievements, seriously, they're just ridiculous. Overall a great puzzle game that is simply stylish.. A must play if you like science fiction. A must play if you don't like science fiction. The story, the atmosphere and the puzzles themselves point to the same amazing directio. Everything is coherent, solid and inventive.. The Swapper is a relatively-short puzzle game (~5 hours) that features a basic game mechanic: You can create clones of yourself and teleport to them to move around the map. The game features a variety of well thought-out puzzles. Certain environmental elements can prevent you from creating clones and others can prevent you from teleporting them. The story is bleak and melancholy in an enchanting way. The artwork/music is beautiful and atmospheric. The puzzles get a tiny bit repetitive by the end. However, the game finished quickly enough that I never felt bored during the playthrough. In general, it was a hauntingly-beautiful short game.. The Swapper offers wonderful, creative puzzles with well designed mechanics, an interesting ambiance, and an intriguing but underdeveloped story. Another review here knocks this game for being a 2D portal clone. Well that alone is creative and shouldn't count against the creators, but I would argue that it is still much more than a copy of portal. The mechanic is very creative, as it frees and limits you simultaneously. The designers continue to add new wrinkles to the puzzles at multiple points in your advancement, creating several stages of game play. The puzzles and mechanics are absolutely great, with intuitive controls to match. The art for this game doesn't make a ton of sense to me; why would this advanced space station look like such a depressing, run down hunk of junk? Even if the space station were abandoned, or designed specifically for utility, it should not look this depressing. I really like the look of the game, but the look doesn't match the setting in a reasonable way. The music, however, is absolutely incredible. Especially when you might be working on a puzzle for a while, you do not want some annoying track looping in the background. The music perfectly matches the feel of the game for added ambiance and entertainment. The storyline also feels a bit contrived. It begins interesting, and then just bombards you with more and more of the same mystery for the bulk of the game. What is nice is that the story is extremely secondary to the incredibly well designed game play. It offers a nice break as you move between puzzles. I also love (the probably unintentional phenomenon) that is your clones dying as you solve puzzles. It really makes salient some of the moral issues that come up with the technology in the game, although the game doesn't seem to explore this much.. This was a really interesting experience. It's like someone took the absolute darkest, best of Asimov's short stories and turned it into a video game. I loved it. I had to stop playing for a couple months and come back to it because two of the puzzles were too difficult for me. That's probably a good thing.. The Swapper is a unique puzzle-platformer. The unique mechanic in the game is the ability to clone yourself and ""swap"" places with that clone. This creates an interesting dynamic that was fun to utilize. The game however falls in other key aspects. The difficulty curve is strange. It starts off relatively easy for about half the game, then it suddenly jumps and you'll get stuck on puzzles for a long time, then at the very end the puzzles are all of a sudden easy again. The story is also confusing and relatively uninteresting. The graphics are special, but I certainly wouldn't call them fantastic. The game is also relatively short; I finished it in less than 4 hours. I had high hopes for this game, unfortunately it hasn't lived up to the hype.. A pleasant puzzle-platformer, with above average atmospheric effects (sounds/music/lighting). Great slow-motion effects (and corresponding sounds!) avoid puzzles from being too ""twitchy"" (a plus in my books) However, the puzzles do get somewhat repetitive.. Awesome game with an incredible atmosphere and thought provoking dialogue. I got completely absorbed in it and loved every second. I haven't had this much **** time since Portal came out! Thank you for an awesome game!. Amazing from start to finish. Great setting created by talented developers. A very philosophical game that kept me hooked and stayed in my head after finishing. Also provides a great level of challenge for the player.. One of the best games I 've ever played. Minimalistic and cool artistic style; well thought, original and smoothly executed game play mechanics and above all; it manages to make you feel you are in space, helpless, more than any other 3D AAA big budgeted games even though it's a 2D platformer. One of the most atmospheric games ever. Again, original and clever puzzles that getting harder and harder and more creative by time. Great sounds and music. To summarize, The Swapper is one of the gaming masterpieces. A must play.. Wow! I was expecting a little more, or maybe all the high scores gave me the impression of something grander. I love indie games, platform and Metroidvania games. I was bored with this game. I had a hard time getting into it... everything about it is sleepy... and nothing urged me to want to play, it didn't capture my attention or imagination. Don't play this at night, because it's a great sleeping pill.. A miracle of game... Not a puzzle game, or a pure adventure one... simply the best game of 2013, impeccable and fascinating story, innovative puzzles, moral choices (and the way is only one...)! Skyrim is a great game, this is simply part of gaming history.... One of the most haunting, mysterious, thought provoking games in awhile. Explores the mind, body, soul, and consciousness and the meaning of existence. Very stimulating material. The atmosphere is excellent....great lighting and particle effects. The voice acting, and subtle music and sound immerse you fully into the experience. Would totally recommend for someone who enjoys philosophical discussions and challenging puzzles!. Great game! Fantastic atmosphere, great puzzles, imaginative graphics, good controlls feel, quaite a few iconic moments, and intriguing story although I had to look up some explanations cause not everything was clear to me). Soundtrack not too bad although nothing memorable. Great game for couple of evenings.. The swapper is a very good 2-d puzzle platform game. It has art created from photographs of clay sculptures, so it has a claymation look to it. The puzzles revolve around making clones of yourself and swapping yourself with them. The puzzles start easy and get harder and harder. There is a science fiction story that develops as you progress in the game. The story was ok, kind of inspired by ""2001"" although a bit hokey at times. Some of the story is relayed to you by a narrator who is talking to you over a noisy radio. This means that it can be hard to understand the narrator, so in retrospect it would have been better to turn the subtitles on so I could understand the narrator. I am not a great puzzle-solver, so it took me a long time to solve some of the puzzles, and one puzzle I had to read a walkthrough to solve. My overall playing time was 11 hours, which includes at least two hours spent stuck on a few puzzles. This is decent playing time for an indie title and a very good deal for what I paid for. I would say this game is excellent but falls a little short of my all-time favorite puzzle-platfrom game Vessel. Some of the puzzle solving involved a lot of trial and error in addition to pure deduction. It took me a while to figure out that the right button does not stop the game, it just slows it down a lot. All it all I can strongly recommend this game.. This game is absolutely AMAZING!! Puzzles are challenging and rewarding, but not impossible. The music was awesome, the atmosphere was seriously incredible. This is a MUST HAVE for every Steam collection.. This game is definitely worth the money, even at just 5 hours of gameplay. The atmosphere is great and the puzzles are interesting and diverse. They could have chosen to drag it out to 10 hours, but it would probably grow stale without more mechanics, so I approve of the decision to keep it short and fun.. If you liked Braid or Limbo, you'll like this game also, and should get it for that reason alone, it is of the same high quality. It has the engine/art ambience novelty value that makes it fun to play, and quite addictive once you start. Puzzles are easy bar about 3, which jump vastly in difficulty. It is short enough, and may have no replay value also, so keep to the $10 or less price range. It gets an 8 because though the sound is great, the music is almost indiscernible. And whilst I like obtuse story lines, I'm not sure this one needed it. For me, it would have worked better as a more realistic escape+rescue storyline, with each room to rescue a survivor. But those minor quibbles aside, recommended still.. This game is really awesome! It feels like you're playing an old Tool video. The story took me 2 play thrus to fully understand. The puzzles are challenging enough and the mechanics are seductively simple. I completed the full game in 5 hours. The 2nd time around was only 1.5 hours. I would have given this game a 9 because it is so short. However, the story is so good, the puzzles were a blast, and the graphics unlike anything I've played!. Lovely looking game with a unique & enjoyable game mechanic (the swapping). In general, this is an excellent game which I highly recommend. However, it does have a downside in that there is a fair amount of backtracking involved at times with little to no motivation besides completing the game. This won't be a problem for others but I find the lack of any special reward for backtracking (e.g. to get an upgrade of","the Swapper is a science fiction-themed game for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux . the story is quite nice with probably the best ending I have ever experience in a game . the game is representative of our industry in that it simply doesn't invest in quality ""not safe"" stories anymore ."
723.Pokemon SoulSilver Version,"Overrated game. The core pokemon mechanics are okay but the level scaling is unacceptable. Bad even for a pokemon game.. This game is very good, it is not my favorite but I like it. The graphics, the story...Everything is good except the rival.. The universal a claim game of Pokémon! It's is not wrong think this title as the best of the Series, some will say Emerald, others Platinum or BW 2, but generally this one lead the rest. Johto was for many children of the late 2000's the first trip to Japan, and the legends of this region is unique and beautiful, if Hoeen is about the nature and Sinnoh about world lore, Johto is mysteries unsolved and must be that way. This is the best pokemon remake. This game makes the level curves bette. The game looks amazing for the DS. The kanto region is improved. And they added the battle frontier from platinum. This game added the missing safari zone and added 2 beautiful routes. This game also adds content from pokemon crystal. This game makes the lackluster gen 2 games good. 10/10. The prime of the Pokémon saga were the DS games, a game full of content, a great improvement on the original games, the graphic and playable section is very well polished, it has its problems such as the difficulty curve and the lack of endemic species from Jotho, but we still have one of the best experiences, Kanto feels more full of life than in the original games, with more places and quests to visit, a great improvement and an excellent JRPG. Have played and relayed this game many times because of how fun and polished it is. The newer Pokémon games never quite did it for me but Soul Silver… whew what a magical game. When I need a dose of nostalgic Pokémon in my life, this is the game I reach for— a truly timeless game, in my humble opinion.,. I think it is a pretty good Game but it Van be very boring for the First two Cities.. Play real gen 2 instead. This game is slower than molasses and made all of the characters look worse without making ANY improvements to the gameplay.. my honest takeaway from playing this game for a disproportionately small amount of time is that the cute charm glitch goes crazy (shiny dunsparce shiny dunsparce shiny dunsparce). Peak of the series, amazing remakes, and the DEFINITIVE Johto experience. No remake will ever get as good as this (except maybe Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire). This is why Gen IV is the best.. I give it an 8 which is low for a pokemon game. I don't understand how the community rates the gen 2 remakes so highly on websites like this and ranking from like IGN or whatever will have Gen 2 remakes this high when gen 2 **** so much. The gen 2 level curve with 3 of the last gyms all are level 30ish and then you have to jump like 20 levels in 2 gyms for the elite 4. Also the pokemon pull **** like 90% of the good mons are gen 1 mons. A fun one because the 2-D bit Pokemon games are all quite fun but this gen is easily the worst of the first 5 in my opinion. While not my first Pokémon game (Diamond is my first which was also goated, tho Platinum was a better version for sure), this is definitely my favorite. As a fan who grew up on the Gen 1 & 2 anime, I was very excited to play this game when I finally did. I had never played the original GB games so it was awesome discovering things like Johto and Kanto being connected in one game and how you battle Red as the game's final boss. Plus I always liked Lugia's design which is why I chose this version over HeartGold. And probably my favorite feature of the game was the ability to let one of your Pokémon follow you in the overworld like the way Ash's Pikachu did. Not to mention the OST is kickass. This was also the game where I tried completing the Pokédex and catching every Pokémon I could legitimately, without having any friends to trade with or using hacks. Ironically enough tho, I tried using a friend's Action Replay to get legendaries but it corrupted my save file, losing years of progress. Which led my dumbass to sell my original copy. And seeing how expensive it is to buy a legit copy of SoulSilver now, I deeply regret doing that…. Both HeartGold and SoulSilver offer what most consider to be the definitive Pokemon experience, and while they aren't my personal favourites, there's no denying the perfection of this particular Pokemon adventure.. The entire region of Kanto being the post-game is enough to put this game at the top honestly. Johto itself is crammed full of content too, with the best aesthetics and music of any region. Adding following Pokémon was the single best idea Gamefreak's ever had (and one they haven't gotten right since this game).. I like how the game looks and I love the battle frontier, but the level curve is weird and the two regions concept is meh at best and just bad at worst.. Out of the 7titles in the main series that I've played, this is my favorite Pokemon game of all time! Pros: + - the music is wonderful - the game is super saturated and has good graphics when taking the publication date into account - there are lots of varied areas and cities to explore, and the majority of them have an interesting storytelling aspect to them too (in opposite to the recent games) - the minigames are AMAZING, easily the best multiplayer experience in any pokemon game, but also the best singleplayer minigames experience; with the Pokeathlon you have plenty of ways to spend time with pure entertainment, and there's also another small casino-type minigame that can be pretty addicting too and gives you the opportunity for great extra items etc! You also have your own little plant grower! just so amazing (and self sustaining hehe) If that wasnt enough you can also harvest fruits from special trees to get rare pokeballs craftet! to add to the not-necessary but added for the player fun, there are cute stickers you can collect for you pokemon to have a unique combat entrance! Just SO much effort in this game to give the players a fun experience that's seperate from the main story(*・∀・*)Ｖ. - your Pokemon walk openly behind you! easily one of the best and unique features in any Pokemon game. You can also interact with them and they will mostly react with different quirks which builds so much more of a connection!! sometimes, they will also give you little accessories, to dress them up in ANOTHER photo-minigame ✧✩ - The pokedex is great - you have a WHOLE new Map with a little story after defeating the Top4, so there are plenty of reasons to keep playing after the main goal!! - Cons - the required grinding is sometimes extremely bothersome and repetitive, although that used to be the standard with (pkm) games back then, and it's still favorable over the completely non-challenging combat in today's pokemon games. That's honestly the only con worth mentioning, in my opinion‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ ☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙. Meh. Overrated but that doesn't mean it was bad, just wasn't very good. Poor level curve is still present, dogsht story is still present, but the game does have incredible art and design, particularly Ecruteak City.. Absolutely incredible I'm only two and a half hours in, so technically I'm not even at the GREAT parts yet, but this is so so good and highly addicting. Kept wanting to play it during the day.. When I was younger I was patiently waiting for this release. I grew up playing generation 2 so this review is most certainly biased. Stands the test of time as an extremely well produced game with so much content and activities. I believe that this version is the definitive Pokemon game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. leaving this as a filler. if i want to one day, i'll give a full review through Pokemon Heartgold. tl;dr is that these are great games with tons of external content and amazing features, but are held back from the sheer lack of fixing done in Gen 2's flaws, which were the poor quality of Pokemon encounter tables and the poor level-scaling across the board. This, especially when stacked with Gen 4's slow engine, made playing these games rough all the way through sometimes, especially in the postgame. You can't really use these games if you want to aim competitively or battle off against your friends. They're even a pain for the battle frontier. However, if you're just in as a casual and don't care much about the quality of your Pokemon then you're pretty much set. Not the best Pokemon games but it's easy to see why they are favored by many. I just wish they made exploration more rewarding and teambuilding more feasible.. Arguably the best Pokémon game ever made. A must play to any fans of the series or genre.. 52/100 Pokémon Soulsilver recreates the world and experience of the original SIlver with a stunning amount of additions, modernizations and creative quirks that make this one of the best Pokémon games ever made. The original Silver was already packed with content thanks to the two regions and 16 gyms available, and the remake builds upon that even further incorporating the Crystal storylines, new areas, upgraded gyms with deeper level design, expanded story and Pokémon teammates following you on the field for immersion. So even though the core battle structure of Pokémon can be extremely repetitive and simplistic, this experience is nonetheless one of astounding content richness. Most notably, the new Pokéathlon facility hosts a rich selection of diversified action minigames, constituting a very fun breather from the usual gameplay. Lastly but not least, the Pokéwalker offers a revolutionary way to bring some of the game's experience into the player's real life routine, with a simple but extremely charming set of minigames and functionalities to make it work both on its own as a portable entertainment device and an immersive companion piece to the main game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Best Pokémon Game ever. Amazing Features and Tools were implemented in this Game. The Story was interesting and the entire Region was beautifully made. And the 2. Region was amazing too.. Best Pokemon game ever. The pokewalker made it feel more involved. Wish newer generations would have a external device to play with.. This is one of the greatest pokemon games ever made. It did just about everything a good remake should do. It kept everything great about the original, and added more good things. The game is full of content and has one of the best postgames in the series. It has a good pokemon selection, great soundtrack, challenging gyms, great locations, good graphics, one of the best rivals in the series, and cool legendaries. The only issues I have with the game, are the villain, and the NPC leveling curves. I found defeating Team Rocket in this game to be a bit lackluster and annoying at times (looking at you statue alarms), especially in comparison to other pokemon games like BW, Emerald, and Platinum. Also, after about the 3rd gym, you have the option to choose which order you can take on the 4th, 5th, and 6th gym leaders. I love that they give you more of an open choice here, but the leveling of the NPCs pokemon teams stay stagnant. Once you've received your 4th badge, the journey for your 5th/6th badges are a cakewalk because now you're overleveled. This mostly becomes fixed after that though, however another leveling issue occurs when you go to Kanto. One minute you're fighting a trainer with level 40-60 pokemon, then the next trainer on the same road will have a level 10 team. These became a slog to battle through. Overall, it was fantastic and is a must have for any pokemon game fan!. Easily the best Pokémon game ever made. I don’t think anything in the franchise will ever surpass this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pokemon Soulsilver is one of the best games one could buy for the DS. It features a huge amount of pokemon to catch, great challenges in the face of the Frontier Brains and the best rival of any pokemon game. The downside is that it lacks the better features of later generations like the Mega Evolution and it takes a huge amount of time to actually get a pokemon with perfect stats.. This is the only game I will give 10/10. In the DS era, Game Freak proved that they can do a lot more than they did in the GB era. In my opinion, remakes don't always quite live up to the original, but this game proved that it can be done. A beautiful pixel graphic that just looks a lot more alive than the 3D Pokemon offshoots, a beautiful soundtrack that goes straight to the heart and ear and not to forget the post game content in the Kanto region and the Gen 4 Pokemon that have been added. In my opinion it's the best Pokemon remake ever. If you are looking for an unforgettable Pokemon adventure, you will find it in this game. The greatest Pokemon game ever made, except for the fact that it took the all blue female lead option and replaced her with generic skin 130. So really the worst Pokemon game ever made.. It is fun to have the second generation Pokemon in a brand new console and advanced graphic performance.. Pokemon HeartGold & SoulSilver are the definitions of the perfect Pokemon game. Having a massive national dex, two regions to explore, fixes to physical/special attacks, new typings and a story you can’t get attached too. This was all followed up by the Generation 4’s mesmerising soundtrack which can be played in the 8-bit tone **** Colour. These games are truely masterpieces!. Pokemon SoulSilver is a remake of a classic 1999 Pokemon Silver and being released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS, it is a part of the fifth generation of the legendary Pokemon game franchise. Its twin version Pokemon HeartGold (remake of Pokemon Gold) was released at the same time in a classic Pokemon fashion. That is the thing about Pokemon games, they do not change. Each generation we get a bunch of new Pokemon, the towns have different names, but otherwise its the same. So every Pokemon game kind of feel like a remake. And still it somehow works very well. What can I say about the game? In terms of story, you know exactly what you are going to get, travel through Johto, collect badges, catch pokemon, beat the Champion, move to Kanto, repeat the process, bit of end game content, the end. Perfectly satisfactory. The graphics of these Gen IV / V Nintendo DS games are very likeable. Simple and yet very colorful and joyful plus you get the great atmospheric old school music. The one drawback with the Pokemon games that I often experienced was the low difficulty and the very easy way of making the game ridiculously easy by just training a single pokemon and overleveling everyone and everything else. But you can easily counter this yourself by going with full party. Also try changing the battle style option from shift to set and you might be surprised just by how much the difficulty will rise. Just for the record, I played on PC using the DeSmuMe emulator. Obviously no microtransactions or SJW politics are present in this game. Great remake sticking to the tried and true Pokemon ways. Final Verdict: 90%. The beautiful, fun, definitive experience of the back then definitive pokemon game. It is just a little slow in battle.. 90/100 The pinnacle of the Pokémon series. Don't need to say anything else.. to this day the best and most feature complete games in the entire franchise.. Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are objectively the best games in the series, and anyone who disagrees is wrong, plain and simple. People can nitpick these games and tear them apart over their few miniscule flaws, but at the end of the day, it's just that- nitpicking. The positives far outweigh the negatives here, from the gorgeous 2.5D graphics, to the sheer amount of content packed into the cartridges. There's no argument to be had. Everything that came before and after HeartGold and SoulSilver pales in comparison.. I'm a retrogamer (and an old person ) and i played this game for the first time in 2022 (Without trying the gb version back in the **** i don't feel nostalgia. It's a classic game, simple (it was created for young players) fun to play on Nds and Ndsi that has fun minigames that takes advantage of Ds stylus. Lots of contents, good strategy, tons of pokemon. It has a certain enphasis on other player interaction because exchanging pokemon with other players to complete pokedex and level up monsters is reccomended for speed up story progression (but it isn't mandatory) Multyplayer interactions in modern time is very limited and require some preparation for obvious reason (servers are down for example) . it isn't aged **** suffer of a certain amount of grinding, backtracking, long travel distances and time day event that slow overall progression (and enjoyment) of the **** is a bit repetitive. But considering it's age, is fun to try for ""historical"" purpose.. perfect game. easily one the best pokemon games of all time, and is definitely the best remake. they actually did more than the bare minimum, unlike some really bad gen 4 remakes that came out recently. Pure soul I love the pokewalker and love totodile. Bset pokemon game ever . 10/10. This is really one of the best Pokémon games I’ve ever played. Being a remake of one of my favorite generations during my favorite generation I would’ve liked it no matter what. It plays like silver perfected and in most things have stayed the same but they have added a lot of nice features. Some of my favorite new features include the safari zone which allows you to catch Pokémon from gens three and four. I also like how there is a lot more focus on the story content this is seen especially with the big change that you now have to catch the legendary Pokémon before the elite four and new team rocket admin’s. Pokémon using their gen four move sets really helps in improving move diversity especially with the more challenging trainers. The pokeathon that is added included some nice touch mini games. So overall I love this game for being at the original but better.. i like this game. it is fun. good post game. good main game. good starters. serviceable plot. all it needs to have; nothing more, nothing less. The perfect expression in not only Pokemon, but gaming as an entity. Takes the broad strokes the prior games laid down and sweeps them up, aware this will be the cresting for the franchise: my God is it beautiful. Grew up with this game, will continue growing with this game, and will never leave it behind. Has become as intrinsic to me as water: Soulsilver flows through me like an essence, lighting up my body with flowers and wishes.. 20/10. Best Pokemon games ever made hands down. Everything is simply perfect.. while i only just recently completed the johto side of the story it is amazing it has lots of charm i love pixelated graphics so i loved the graphics of this, johto feels complete and alive while i personally hate a lot of generation 2 pokemon i find that this game had made all the pokemon that much better in my opinion. i wouldn't recommend it for people who just started pokemon because its so expensive, the only one i could find was in a neighboring city and it cost over 80$, but if you are a fan of the series i would absolutely recommend this.. This and Heartgold are very hard to find nowadays, considering the high chances of getting scammed with counterfeit copies... anyways, this game is bonkers. It has contest for around 400+ gameplay hours, if not more, if you want to finish everything the game has to offer. Best NDS title i ever owned.. My first pokemon adventure. I feel very nostalgic about it. I'd like to replay it.. This and Spyro Reignited are examples of perfect remasters. And i mean, you can walk with your Pokemon. What more could you want.. Literally, the best game on the ds this game is better than the new super Mario bros ds I literally have 40 hours of gameplay so far and I still have a ton of the game left to explore the sound is pretty good also it's not the best but it's very nostalgic. I really don't recommend running this game on a computer as an emulator trust me it's a crappy feeling it feels way better to play it on a 3ds/2ds.. One of the best Pokemon games to date, plenty of content for a Pokemon game and its fun to play from start to finish.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bro this game is my childhood. Only fond memories remain and I have no complains.. Pokémon Sword and Shield has come and gone and, though not as cataclysmically bad as many were anticipating, the game left a lot to be desired. Moreover, it seems to have gotten people thinking about what makes a Pokémon game great, and what fundamentally works with the series. These ""findings"" seem to agree that Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are pretty much the platonic ideal of a Pokémon game. For one, they're built off of the backbone arguably the series's finest entry at the time, Pokémon Gold and Silver. They stuck to the respective games' various design layouts while also containing a few of the improvements and changes made in Pokémon Crystal, such as not having to chase Suicune around Johto. For another, it offers the most bang for your buck out of any of the games. Gold and Silver's postgame consisted of little more than stomping around a miniature Kanto like Godzilla. It was neat, but far from substantial. Not only has Kanto been beefed up HeartGold and SoulSilver, but the game has even added Pokémon Platinum's Battle Frontier for good measure, making for a beyond satisfactory reward for your hard efforts. But really, what make HeartGold and SoulSilver so beloved are the little things. The fact that you can unlock an item that restores the iconic Gold and Silver OST, the improvements made to the series as a result of the jump from Gen 2 to Gen 4 as well as improved movesets overall, the iconic legendary events, most of which you can still access thanks to a recently discovered loophole, the fact that so much time and effort went into adding content to the campaign without sacrificing even a drop of the original game's charm, there's just so much attention to detail that makes Pokémon what it is. But the biggest three factors that go into making this game so great are its most simple. First, Johto is the best region in the series, bar none. It's the most thoughtfully designed, comfy, homey, quirky, and memorable. Sure, a massive tower dedicated to Bellsprout, a rather forgettable Gen 1 Pokémon wouldn't have been first on most people's list of ideas for a Pokémon game, but it's the kind of strange inclusion that nobody knew they wanted, nobody expected, and yet so distinct and memorable that they kind of love it. As goes for places like the Slowpoke Well, the Lake of Rage, the Ruins of Alph, and Sinjoh Ruins. Next is the strange, beloved feature of having your Pokémon follow you. On paper, it makes very little difference, but being able to turn around and watch your Pokémon do something silly and adorable just puts such a big, stupid grin on my face every time. Moreover, it fits perfectly in line with the recurring theme of the game, that there's apparently just something special about Pokémon that elevate them from just pets or battle monsters, but apparently some kind of spiritual companion to humans. And lastly, there's the Pokéwalker. I feel sorry for anyone that didn't grow up with this peripheral. It was like Pokémon Go minus all the extra, pointless bullcrap. It was something you could take with you, this little token of your adventure that you can bring into the real world with you. It was cool almost beyond words, and it was a damn fine pedometer too. What's more, you could catch Pokémon not normally available until far later in the game, like Pikachu, Murkrow, etc.. Soul silver is a great game. The best game in Pokemon history. Not comparable to Sod Shield.. What a great game. A great remaster of pokemon silver, blistering with nostalgia.. The best drive down the memory lane with just the right amount of enhancement for a remake. its the definitive experience with Pokémon. The entire game has a gorgeous look and feeling attached to it. And its for sure the most competent and well made game of the series. Everything in this game screams love and effort, and if you read the interviews from the time, you will notice that this game indeed has a lot of this 2 defining things, that the series would lack so badly for the rest of the 2010´s. This game is huge, with 2 regions 16 gym battles, battle frontier, safari zone, and a lot to uncover if you have the Pokewalker accessory. HGSS its truly the right way to remake a game, with new content and the best of its predecessors. Its a must have for any JRPG maniac out there, and a must play for any Pokémon fan.. Besides the terrible level curve. It has the same bad distribution from the GS games and basically fixed nothing: every single problem is back, but with the ugly sprites from the dp games. The legendaries were shoving in at inconvenient places, ruining their original lore completely. It's also highly expensive, in part due an add on app thats underused and you won't need, so I only recomend this game if you are a collector that want them all. Otherwise, stick to gsc.. Pokémon Blue was the first ever video game I played. I was 6 at the time and from that moment on I kept playing all the Pokemon games in the main series and I can say Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver, are the best Pokemon games ever made. I feel the problem with the more recent Pokemon games is the amount of unnecessary legendary Pokemon thrown into the games but since Pokemon HGSS is a remake of Gold and Silver with the Pokemon from gen 3 and 4 also available, Game Freak managed to make every single legendary Pokemon count! Every legendary in the game has a purpose to the story! Speaking of story, the event Pokemon such as Celebi and Arceus act as sort of DLC, allowing the player the ability to access otherwise inaccessible places and events in the game! All this added to exploring 2 regions, collecting 16 badges and doing all sorts of daily and weekly events, Pokémon HGSS are, by far, the ultimate Pokemon experience!. Highly overrated. It's unfortunate to me to say it but it just doesn't stand the test of time: the charm, style, music and design of the original GSC games is completely absent, replaced by safe, boring music that's not even a fraction of how memorable the original was, generic sprites and an ugly overworld that doesnt make good use of what the ds could do. Worse: it has good aditions actually locked away through events that are now impossible to get, entire story bits no less that could have made the game better and more unique, not just event pokemon. The level scaling is also made worse than before despite the aditions its gen had. I recommend Crystal instead for the better Johto experience unless you really want the pokewalker app (nowadays hard to get) or want to transfer your cyndaquil to newer games.. I have a confession to make: I’ve never played the original pokemon gold, silver, or crystal versions. I know, its strange, especially considering I am a huge pokemon fan. But thankfully, the DS remakes, heartgold and soulsilver, are just as good, if not better than the originals. They are essentially just the original gold, silver and crystal but with the gen 3 and gen 4 pokemon added in during the post game, and given the same graphical style as my favorite pokemon game, pokemon platinum. As for everything else, well, its pokemon, and I’m sure you all know how pokemon works, so I don’t think I need to get into that. The only issues with I have with this game are merely nitpicks, such as HM’s like cut and whirlpool being required at many points. Overall, though, pokemon soulsilver gets a 9/10. It’s without a doubt one of the best game in the series and is also a fantastic game in its own right. If you have not played it yet, FIX THAT IMMEDIATELY!!!. I loved soulsilver version and felt that it was a well rounded game. I enjoyed the 3D aspect and felt like it was a good nod towards the original even though I haven't played the original. It was a great game.. Both HeartGold and SoulSilver are excellent remakes of two of the greatest GBC classics of old. But still aren't quite as glorious DS games as Black/White/Black 2/White 2 in my opinion, which isn't to say they're awful or anything.. This is the best Pokemon game ever made! This game brought Pokemon back up after its failure of the Sinnoh games. By far the longest game in the franchise and that's a good thing! They gave us great feature's like how Pokemon walk behind you and the Gameboy sounds item. With 2 regions, 16 gyms', 2 elite four and champion challenge's and old and new legendary Pokemon and normal Pokemon. Even after you beat this game you can complete the National dex and go to Mt. Silver to beat Red. The reason a battle with Red is fantastic is that its like battling your old self. The best game hands down on the Nintendo DS. Have fun and keep on training!. Pokemon SoulSilver is, in my opinion, the peak of Pokemon. All the games up to this point have lent their best features and attributes to this one. The game mechanics have been polished to perfection and the best storyline and world chosen. The original game was a marvel of its day, but early-2000s Gameboy Color games dated very quickly and lacked some of the features introduced in the subsequent two generations. This game delivers everything, a visual and gameplay treat for the ages. It is so easy to lose 100 hours+ in this game. My sole criticism is that the roster of Pokemon available in the game is a little small (even combined with HeartGold) and the player realistically needs access to Diamond and Pearl as well to get a 'universal' experience. After this Pokemon lost the plot but it saved the absolutely best for this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is simply excellent. This remake portrays the greatness of the original 2nd gen games for the gameboy colour. there are 2 regions to explore, Johto and Kanto, those are arguably the best pokemon regions, as they feature the best and coolest pokemon. This game never gets boring even after 50 hours, as there are tons of legendary pokemon to catch after you beat the game.. The best region/map of any Pokémon with the WORST selection of Pokémon. The way to really enjoy this game is to trade over a team of level 5 guys from the start. I always have to wait until I have 6 or 7 badges before I can catch anything actually worth training.. Graphics -10 Music - 8 Story - 8 Gameplay - 10 Content - 10 Personal Fun - 10 A Remake of the first video game i ever played. It was very well done.. Quality remaster of a classic game. The gold/silver games are some of the best in the entire series and remastered versions are always welcome. A must play game if you own a DS or 3DS.. Where do I start with this game... It's absolutely perfect. Easily the best game in the series, it offers everything that made the originals great but adds so much more. It easily has the best lower screen UI in any pokemon game and everything just fits so perfectly. There is a definite reason why I have over 1000 hours in one profile alone. Not only the best pokemon game I've ever played but also the best game I've ever played, full stop.. This game has the most content of any Pokemon game. This game is extremely fun, and is in my opinion the best Pokemon game ever created of all main series games. I have played all main series games.. Ill think no, i feel and it is the best game ever for DS. Typloshion and Lugia return assomly, if metascore its just a 87, ignore it because ive played it over 100h.. Im sorry that i cant give you an 11. this game is so damn good. relive my childhood, but enhanced in every aspect. so much hidden goodies. the item which you can switch the soundtracks to 8-bit is damn perfect. every else has said it. the best remake. thats how u do it ppl. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.","the core pokemon mechanics are okay but the level scaling is unacceptable . this game is very good, it is not my favorite but i like it . this is the best pokemon remake ."
724.Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance,"Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance is great and you should play it. The look of the game is great even though it is kinda bright to a fault being overly saturated. The game play is unique and I like that Juste is a more magic focused Belmont with the addition of spell books as this game's main gimmick. The combat feels super comfortable along with movement having my favorite dash in the Castlevania franchise. The story isn't praised enough good and simple, but I wouldn't say it is the best this Castlevania has to offer. The music is fun not having any tracks I found to be amazing, but it wasn't terrible either. The game's difficulty is my biggest grip being way too easy and you can buy potions for a low price and store up to 99 destroying any difficulty this already game had. The Castle layout can be kinda weird at times but exploring is super fun and I never got bored of exploration because of how fun it is to control Juste. The extra content is cool as well, boss rush was fun and the second playable character mode provides some actual challenge if you're still looking for more Harmony of Dissonance like I was. Information for the second playable character (contains slight spoilers.) After beating the main story with any ending, you just create a new save file type in the name MAXIM and you're good to go it'll auto start the game with you playing as Maxim. You can't use items, and you're restricted to one secondary weapon and can't change it with gear and anything else in the menu. To make up for its Maxim secondary is pretty cool being an attack he used in his books fight, he also is faster than Juste and has a triple jump, and a broken summersault ability.. Best example of the Metroid style games in the series, as far as 2d Castlevania it doesn't get better than this.. The game is good with some parts that you may need a guide for but it’s overall quite a fun time besides some glitches that may have occurred on my end. Graphically, for a GBA game, it's a mixed bag. The detailed character sprites and environments are solid, capturing the gothic atmosphere of Castlevania. But there's a catch – the graphics can be a bit muddy, and the character design, especially for the protagonist Juste Belmont, feels a tad uninspired. It's like a guitarist shredding a solo but forgetting to change up the rhythm. Gameplay: Gameplay-wise, it's classic Castlevania with a few twists. The whip action is tight, and the exploration is on point. The addition of the spell fusion system brings some variety, allowing players to mix and match magical powers. It's like adding a new instrument to the band – not groundbreaking, but a welcome addition. Soundtrack: Now, let's talk tunes. The music, composed by Soshiro Hokkai, is atmospheric and fitting for the Castlevania theme. However, it lacks the memorable punch of some of the series' standout tracks. It's like a B-side that complements the main album but doesn't steal the show. Story: And the narrative – well, it's Castlevania, part deux. Dracula is stirring up trouble, and Juste Belmont has to whip him back into submission. It's the classic vampire-slaying tale we've seen before. It's like a reliable encore, but you might wish for a bit more variation. The game's biggest criticism lies in its level design. While the exploration is solid, the castle layout can be confusing, like navigating through a complex musical composition without a clear melody. The lack of distinct landmarks may leave players feeling a bit disoriented. In conclusion, ""Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance"" is a decent addition to the series that captures the essence of Castlevania gameplay. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors, the solid mechanics and atmospheric elements make it worth a playthrough for fans. However, the lackluster graphics and somewhat forgettable soundtrack prevent it from reaching the upper echelons. The game is perfect but what it should have 2 different version limited run like the original castlevania and metroidvania like sotn ther should a have 3 a difference between vampire like tepes monster hunter like belmont and werewolf like cornell lycanthrope. An ok follow-up to Circle of the Moon, the game has its highs, lows and mixed opinions. I loved the brightened graphics which gives the game some much needed character, though I know they can be pretty divisive. Improved graphics seemed to come at the expense of the soundtrack, which can feel monotonous at times. The combat also felt improved and the bosses were the highlight of the game for me. The main problem is the backtracking. Save points and warp points are scarce so you'd better prepare to return to the same point to heal again... and again... and again. It's also too easy to get lost and not know how to proceed which I'm sure some will like, but I was not a fan. Overall a good game though, with some good pacing and nice sense of completion when you're finished, if not for its few glaring weaknesses.. Taking the template laid down by Circle Of The Moon, Harmony Of Dissonance improved every apsect - especially the graphics - and created the Castlevania we now know and love. Second only to the Metroid games in the genre on the Advance.. Soy yo o reutiliza muchísimos assets y diseños de escenarios de Symphony of the Night?. Harmony of dissonance is geat but maxime is dante alucard hellsing and bayonetta and juste is vergil Alexander Anderson and jeanne all the belmont should have been able to use holy magic light magic and water magic and the tepes demon magic dark magic and fire magic always put alucard as the main characters you can put the belmont as the main character but only in side stories maxime is somehow related to the tepes. This game ****! First of all the dungeon system is complicated. Ridiculous backtracking and boring tedious game. Is endlessly boring. You need a key to unlocked doors. Those keys are in unaccessible places. You need essential upgrade items placed in unaccesible places. To complicate more things, there are two castles and you can get stuck in any of them without a way out if you haven’t acquired an specific item. I just got fed up. I forced myself to finish it.. simply one of the best GBA games, good gameplay, good graphics for the gba, Great music, it's finally worth venturing into this huge castle!. For me this is a portable castlevania symphony of the night ,sadly it has some of the worst backtracking in metroidvania game I have seen but it's still enjoyable, it worth playing once. While I've yet to fully beat this game, I still love it to death. Yes, the game's sound isn't top notch, so what? It's still some solid tunes to jam to while kicking some ass! Graphics in HoD are really nice to look at, plus the locations are varied enough to spice up gameplay even more. The double castle system admittedly is a little... eh. But after a little bit of exploration, the castle opens up even more, and the system is no longer an issue. This game and SoTN are fun times, you too Aria of Sorrow!. Comparing to any other Castlevania game this one deserves 0/10 for sure. Painful graphics, painful music, painful combat, simply garbage!. Good game. It looks like SOTN. But not as good as SOTN of course. Graphics, music and gameplay are good. The variety of items is great. The way he uses abilities is fun. But the level design is bad. There's a lot of backtracking. Shortcuts are limited. And the game is so easy it could possibly be the easiest CV game. Bosses are very easy. It is impossible for you to die because it is a potion. Enemies are also very easy. I think it's a better game than Circle of the Moon. Its gameplay is faster and not as unnecessarily difficult as COTM.. This game is pretty good, it has nice graphics and smooth gameplay. Though the controls took a bit to get used to.. In a word, Harmony of Dissonance is mundane. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Just don't expect too much. Like Symphony of the Night, this sequel features a dual map system, albeit not as meaningful as the inverse map. You are essentially given more bosses to fight, most of which are not particularly difficult (especially if you abuse potions). Save points are infrequent, which means being forced to play safe so you don't waste time retracing steps. On the plus side, you are provided with a dash ability right from the beginning, which helps quicken the game and offers the player a powerful dodge mechanic. The game demands a ridiculous amount of backtracking without providing any indication as to where to go. The insane rarity of the merchant increases the game's overall difficulty, as the game is balanced around you buying potions to survive. The story is practically nonexistent as well, and there are practically no secret rooms to explore, which is disappointing. If you decide to play this game and get stuck, don't hesitate to spoil yourself with a map to get an idea of where to go next, as you will more than likely end up wasting hours revisiting the same areas. Overall, not a memorable experience. Go ahead and skip this game as you will not miss out on anything.. My rate for this game: 7.5 ............................................... Probably the most fun I've had in a 2D game since Castlevania SotN. This game is filled with content and awesome battles, and the skills you get throughout the game give you a ton of options. The castle is massive and has surprisingly good designs, something I don't see this game getting credit for as much as it should be. To put it bluntly, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. 10/10. Very unoriginal, easy and remarkably boring. The worst entry of the GBA era. Get Circle of the Moon and Aria of Sorrow instead, they are a lot better than this pile of junk.. Harmony of Dissonance is a good game, but compared to Aria of Sorrow it easily falls down in my opinion. The strongest points perhaps are the really atmospheric feel, a pretty good and intense story, and very easy control of the character. The game also introduces a system of collecting elemental spellbooks, which combined with the usual subweapons (cross, holy water, etc) give an entirely different special attack, depending on what book is equipped, giving a diverse gameplay. Similar system is later used in Castlevania: Lament of Innocence. Also the good ol' flexi-whip from Super Castlevania IV is back. You can hold the attack button and to move the whip in all the directions as opposed to only attacking forwards. The story as I mentioned is fantastic, one of the best in a Castlevania game, because it is mysterious and gets the player gripped. The atmospheric feel of the game certainly adds to that. Now where the game falls down. There are some minor issues, which can be annoying at times but aren't so bad. Those are the low difficulty, a strange glowing aura around the playable character, and also being forced to backtrack through entire stages at some points of the game. However what I disliked the most about Harmony of Dissonance was its soundtrack. Castlevania games usually have fantastic soundtracks, but I felt that this one was a real disappointment. I hardly heard any music in it, it was just a low quality noise, unfortunately. In my opinion slightly better than Circle of the Moon, but is nowhere near as good as Aria of Sorrow.","juste is a more magic focused Belmont with the addition of spell books as this game's main gimmick . the combat feels super comfortable along with movement having my favorite dash in the Castlevania franchise . the music is fun not having any tracks I found to be amazing, but it wasn't terrible either ."
725.Dragon Ball FighterZ,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Dragon Ball FTG **** only downside is that characters need to be unlocked by purchasing the DLC.. Here’s the translation into English:Too few characters, one of the few games where you can't use transformations, bad and boring story that I played through by simply pressing the X button on normal difficulty, barely any content, the worst menu where you have miniature characters and can't do anything in the small mini-world. Base Goku is only DLC, which is really embarrassing... The graphics are very good, combos are possible, which makes the game slightly more complex than other DB games. Finishers, etc., look good, and the details during attacks or character encounters are well done, but that's it.. Most overrated Dragonball game of all time. Lacks depth in the combat, awful single player mode. Lost interest in 3 months. This is one of the best competitive fighting games i have ever played. I really like how diversity this game is. Incredible 2D fighter! It gives guilty gear vibes if you are a fan of that. I love the game. This game has excelent gameplay and graphics but I could not finish the single player campaign because it's so boring. The AI is brain dead and the mode is repetitive at the point just smashing buttons and winning.. game is very fun on all platforms. dialogue interactions are back as well! artstyle is also pretty good!. Novel idea, probably more enjoyable to the competitively minded than it is to the casual player because there's not much in terms of game modes in this game to play with.. Amazing game not only is in a good anime game. It’s also a good dragon Ball game and lastly, it’s an incredible fighting game.. One of the best fighting games I've ever played. Every character is different and fun in their own way, and the game looks amazing. The cutscenes are also really good too. It has it's own story with three arcs and interesting plot points. It's a challenging game to learn but very fun to pull off combos and such. We need a sequel. Extremely accessible without a lack of depth or complexity. Countless hours playing against my friends in this, and a half decent tutorial too. Online with strangers can be rough, but that's nothing new for fighting games. Runs smoothly on every platform.. Dragon Ball FighterZ kinda just rocked E3 immensely, and honestly I don't think any other fighting game has done that since. Not only does the game look amazing, and but the fighting mechanics are actually pretty easy to understand and are fast enough to really feel like it's from the show. In terms of local multiplayer, the game is astoundingly great and something that has been able to keep hype throughout it's years with season passes and Sonic Fox. This is the fighter that killed Marvel, and we are all better for it.When it comes to single player content though, it certainly feels like it could have been less redundant and more flowing. The single player campaign starts off with the player becoming Goku (a trend that tends to happen in this game), and we start to navigate what exactly is going on, and how we can return everyone back to normal. The problem with this though is that the game decided to split this campaign into 3 different arcs that are not just different perspectives, but events too. Add this together with a lot of ""beat this many fighters to get to the next part"" being the big chunk of the game causes for a lot of fatigue. Thankfully though the best parts of single player content is scattered through out this, and that's the character interactions before battle. Characters that you wouldn't think of talking to each other having witty callbacks or a wink to past character interactions. Honestly FighterZ is an amazing homage to the Dragon Ball series and one that I wish was able to make it's campaign less filler.Online multiplayer is still a bit of a problem though, and with the overworld being fairly empty now that the casual audience has dropped is a bit sad to see so many empty lobbies. Hopefully this game can get rollback coding so it's online can revive, but it's just a pipe dream. At most, online is a passable experience, but with so many unlockables tie to it, you can't help, but feel a little sad you can't really apply it.Overall FighterZ is a better fighting game than most with amazing graphics, a good meta, and hype as heck battles. There is also a neat little mission mode and arcade mode too, but sadly single player content is just a bit lacking. Regardless people get fighters for multiplayer, and as such it's a good experience.. PVP is 10/10.. Its a great game with well thought out mechanics and it has a great artstyle.This game would be a 9/10 if it didnt have a terrible network system. My review is biased because i am a dragon ball fan. Nonetheless, what a treat this game is to dragon ball (and non-db) fans. The positives: With all three seasons of characters included, the character roster's number is great. They feel fairly similar an easy to switch between, but are not identical in gameplay - perfect. (if guilty gear has very idiosyncratic characters and bodukai tenkaichi 3 very similar, this game would have to be placed in between). It is fast-paced and damage is appropriate. The visuals, stages, character intros, finishing poses, dramatic endings, and special attacks are simply divine, sufficient, and faithful to the source material. The Negatives: Unfortunately the story is lazily done, unpleasant to experience, and forgettable/generic. Secondly, only videl has a costume, whats up with that? and there are too many gokus, why not make them costumes (keep their moves of course, i mean the menu would look cleaner and less confusing without all these gokus). i would have liked more costumes and colors hobnestly - on this topic, one minor complaint: picking a character color for online matches is not easy, because it is not shown to you in the menu... Finally, It is difficult to get zeni. the shop is a grind. Conclusion: Once you spend extra money on anime soundtracks and more characters. The game is an absolute joy. i keep telling myself its almost a miracle i have a game this fun and enjoyable and about one of my favourite series ever. Arcsystem works have delivered on the visual and combat aspects. The lobby is nice and so are the stages and bgm. The style of the cover artwork is beautiful, and i approve of that choice (Im looking at you, boring kakarot game cover art). The intro song could have been better but it is fine. The horrible story mode and the little personalisation available to players in game means that as a fighting game package, I must give this game 85/100.. The best fighting game I've ever played. It got five solid years out of me. The artist beautiful, The mechanics are sound, everything that they had wrong at the start has been corrected in my opinion, And now they just need to nerf Android 21 lab coat a little bit more.. The gameplay and graphics/art style by themselves would have made this game at least a 7/10. BUT because of the many many issues I have to give it a 1/10. Some of these issues include the servers constantly having problems and not being able to play with friends (it has a ""glitch"" where it locks you out of ring matches and arena matches the only ways to play with friends ONLINE) which for me is very important.. I’m a pretty big fan of Dragon Ball and traditional fighting games and when this game came out, I immediately fell in love with it. The game is very cinematic and the environment is very interactive. For example, if you do a giant attack on your enemy, it’ll send them flying into a nearby mountain. Another example is if there is one enemy left and you do an ultimate attack, it’ll either show a giant ki explosion or show a ki blast that can be seen from space. This game is also very colorful and it makes it look alive. FighterZ is so cinematic with their special attacks to the point where it looks like it’s own anime show. The story, in my opinion, is alright, it’s not the best but it’s not the worst, but if you’re a diehard fan of Dragon Ball, I think you’ll love the story. Overall, I give this game a 10/10 because it’s one of the only games where I can play for hours on end and not get bored of it at all.. I hate the DLCs man ........................................................ [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The characters are well reproduced and the techniques are flashy and cool. Lots of paid DLC and no The Android Creator. No story mode like in the manga.. Piece of **** People can buy characters that are stronger than base characters, keep you in chains you can't get out of, and it doesn't match you with anyone at your skill level. Unless you're playing for story mode, which is bland and cleche with a bunch of cringe diologue, stay away. The first game I wanted to PvP with and it's terrible for anyone who can't string chains that will empty a full life bar in just a few hits. At least Xenoverse had enemy reading and viable ways to counter your opponant if you read them correctly... you know... skill. This is just a spam buttons until you start a combo and then don't let them out. There's no ""mid combo"" break. If you're in a chain... you're in, you CANT get out until they're done or your life bar is gone, and with some of the animations, they take forever. So you're sitting there, watching your character get the snot beaten out of them and then they switch characters and do it again, and you just sit and watch because there is quite literally nothing you can do. Sure, if you can pull it off it's cool for you, but I don't like being a cheap little **** who relies on one button spamming to victory. I actually want to learn intricacies of the mechanics and rely on my skill... not my ability to hit a button over and over again.. This game is a literal perfect dragon ball fighting game that incorporates characters from Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, and Dragon Ball Super. The visuals are on par if not better than the actual show. The fighting revolves around extremely fast-paced combat with very long combos. Arcade style makes the game an absolute blast. My only complaint with the game is I wish there were more offline modes or things to do in the game.. This game is damn awesome. The best thing about this game is the fun gameplay. The controls are far better than DBZ: Kakarot, DB Xenoverse and even Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, COMBINED! The greatest fighting game of all time, absolutely no questions.. Fantastic animations, movesets, story. Only problem is not enough time went into the mechanics at launch or after all these years unlike previous titles. Why play a game just to juggle opponents in the air to death with no means of escape. Why play dragonball if you don't want to pair off a final flash with with a instant transmission kamehameha?. This game used to be great. It's not anymore. The lack of character colors that are for the seasonal colors is annoying. Some have them and some don't. It makes no sense. The lack of new stages and repetitive stages is stupid. The story mode is awful and to top it all off the characters are completely unbalanced and online is a joke. I used to love this game but just not anymore. Too many players choose the ""memorize 1 team that can do infinite corner spam and don't let the other player even get a chance"" tactic now. I miss when this game was well balanced and enjoyable. Too bad the devs don't care to balance the Fighterz properly. Update Honestly this game gets worse with every update. No balance at all.. Every year we wait for another Dragon Ball game. This time it's Dragon Ball Fighterz as in Fighters not Fighter Z. Let's cut to the chase. The game's got superb graphics. Arc System made the right choice when they went back to cell shaded animations instead of the disgusting manga style animation we had in Ultimate Tencrapchi and Raging Blast 2. The music is entertaining but not as good as it was in Budokai 3. The story is pretty drab. The Z fighters have lost all of their power and have to regain it by fighting clones of themselves. Android 16 is back and the new Android 21 joins the fray. While its nice to see the Z fighters back in action together, the story is rather dull. The voices are not synchronized with the animation of the characters mouths. This seems to be something they'll never get right in a Dragon Ball game. However, the story mode isn't the bread and butter here, it's multi-player. There's a multi-player lobby where you run around as a little Chibi character. This is kind of cheesy because the multi-player lobby in Xenoverse was a lot cooler. You got a full size character there. Anway, you can play matches 1v1, co-op, story mode, and various other modes. You earn Zeni to buy costumes for you Chibi character. Multi-player is disappointing. The controls are cumbersome. An inexperienced fighter needs to merely button mash to get the upper hand while you are still trying to pull off a proper combo. An experienced player who has mastered the controls will keep you locked in a corner. Being able to move and get out of the counter or block will spell your untimely demise. It was easy to break being locked in a combo in Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3, Raging Blast and Xenoverse. Dragon Ball Fighterz really punishes the player. Super moves and Ultimates aren't easy to pull off in the heat of combat either. In addition, characters lack good super moves. For example, Adult Gohan will only do his Super Kamehameha if you pick Gotenks as a member of your team. Otherwise he'll do a Family Kamehameha. Even worse, you can't power up through the levels of super saiyan. Nope, you go super saiyan at the start of the fight and will not transform back to base, go super saiyan 2, or super saiyan 3. The only time Goku goes super saiyan 3 is during his ultimate, and it's one of the weakest supers of the game at that. You can get the base forms of characters like Goku and Vegeta, but you have to buy them. Budokai 3 came with over 40 characters, included transformations and fusion with Potara earrings out of the box. What DIMPS or Arc System really needs to do is make an updated version of Budokai 3 minus the Dragon Rush mode and a revised capsule system. Kind of like the one used in Infinite World. However, game developers are more interested in making a quick buck off a new DBZ title with the same old story and just doing things a little bit different from the last DBZ game. I will continue to wait for a true follow up to the Budokai series but it may be a long wait if not never.. Literally The Best Dragon Ball Game Right Now The Graphics Is So Clean Gameplay Is Fantastic Online Is Cool You will face people play in different strategies it may be an advantage or a disadvantage the story is OK the tutoriels get annoying The more you get to play in story mode and some characters are superior to other which **** but you still can master a weak character and become a pro with it making it too powerful (like android 17 krillin...) i recommend buying the game and the dlcs when its on sale. The most accessible fighting game available to casuals out there. Very simple and easy to use controls, characters that are most popular and art that can only be described as godlike (until I met ggst that is) for a fighting game.. I have played the game to death, and I can't stop playing, but the story does keep away to greatness. It is boring after 2 hours and why is goku's hands so BIG. The voices are great, it looks really good, and the gameplay is amazing.. Previously, I only played Tekken games for the 2d fighting genre, after playing dragon ball fightterz I feel like I don't want to play Tekken anymore. So, we're back again. Arc Stupid doesn't know how to make a god damn video game. I could probably code a video game with my belly button plastered. The amount of **** supers and auto combos in dRaGoN bAlL FiGhTeRsZZZZ make me want to adopt several children and then drop kick each and every one of them while recreating the plot of Meet the Robinsons. If I have to deal with another **** Gogeta SS4 tracking super i swear on my friends lives that I will probably **** every person at Arc Stupid. I have had the dub taken from me multiple times due to stupid snap vanishes that, while im performing a sick nasty combo, they're able to just **** me. It's like, the **** Tell me how i'm able to shoot some damn death balls from my hands on someone who's blocking but they're still able to just dash out of it WHILE there are still blasts going at him. Everyone at this ****in brain dead potato of a studio has a boner for **** Super Baby 2. And while i'm on the topic, Who the **** named the other dude GOGETA SS4? IT'S SSJ YOU **** I've never seen this much **** from an anime ""fighter"". When I think about DB/Z/Super, I think of a childhood of fun but this ""dragonball"" game makes me want to die. You fall out of combos, your super dash ****s up and glitches you 70% of the time, my mom wants to leave my dad because of this game. And honestly me **** too. **** this god damn game. I will however give them my money when they release DECENT DLC and not Super **** 2. Thank you.. Great game but the problem is the damn controls confusing and crap seriously just add revamp controls just i can get rid of these annoying controls. there is an insane amount of bullcrap that makes this game not fun. it shares the same kind that most fighters have but somehow more annoying. online is not at all in any way friendly to new players and all i feel when i play this game is rage.. Not a bad game but also nothing great. Battles soon get repetitive but I pushed myself to beat this game. There are three main stories that last for about 12 hours. Don't forget to use three habilites in the main campaign because I found it out when I was at the end of the second story. The best of the main story is that it has many scenes and you get to see most of dragon ball characters just being themselves. If you want to beat the enemies easily just press the square button and the R2 when the enemy is far or defending. I don't think this game deserves more than an 8. PS: What's with the huge hands that all the characters have? Feels weird.. The best Dragon Ball game in a while, with great balance, beautiful animations, and of course all the best DB characters. The only bad thing I can say about the game is the fact there are too many characters hidden behind the paywall of DLCs. Gameplay: 10 Graphics: 10 Soundtrack: 9 Matchmaking: 8 Practice mode: 10 Campaign: 6 Other game modes: 7 Overall: 8.6. Till this day this is my favorite fighting game and I love that its an anime games because we don't get a lot of good ones nowadays or really ever , love the roster and the fast pace gameplay , online could be a little better but it doesn't ruin the game by any means , story **** but thats not really what I bought it for anyways. An amazing Game that does justice to dragon ball fans and the fight games club. Its a fast pace fighting games that allows you to choose a team of three to fight others. It has a variate of characters to choose from and the developers keep adding more more. The story is mediocre BUT in a fighting game the story is the least of your concern. Stunning animation that looks like it came out of the anime. There's so much into this game, from Easter eggs based on hero and map selection to classic Toriyama humor to everything.. It is playable for anyone who loves and doesn't love anime and is definitely a great game for anime lovers. This is a fighting game that fans of the original comic will love. However, solo play is very poor. Could it be that the story could only be done like this? I'm so sorry. The genre of fighting games also has poor accessibility. Nevertheless, perfect reproduction, great play.. Great fighting game, reminds me of Street Fighter in a way. All fighters seem very equal, so a Yamcha vs Buu fight could be interesting. If you’re like me though, fighting games like Street Fighter lose the excitement after about 3 hours of playing. But if you love those style of games, you’ll love this.. This is one of the most action pact fighting games that arc system works has ever worked on. I love the GG and BB series and as a fan DBFZ does not disappoint, with attention to detail to characters move-sets and call backs their is a true DBZ experience to be had. Dragon Ball Fighter Z is easily accessible to new players, with one button auto combos and a well put together tutorial and training area. Aside from the fighting DBFZ has a story mode one that could be beating within a few hours of one sitting, and the only other single player aspect of the game is the Arcade mode. DBFZ is an amazing fighting game we don't have many hardcore Dragon Ball fighting games and I'm very excited we're getting one from ARC SYS they did a great job and made a masterpiece ****. PROS: +Amazing Artwork +Fun Single Player Story +It's DBZ CONS: -Hercule is not in the game Verdict: 8/10 I eagerly await the reveal trailer for Hercule AKA Mr. Satan.. This game doesn't have a bad storyline the combat style fighting animations etc.. its perfect asf and mastering the combos and switching up to characters in online mode to finish combos for you is also pretty hard to master so yeah im not that good with words lmao so all i have to say that this game is excellent. I like this game she have good gameplay with hard combo for hardcore and good characters. Its the best dragon ball game i played but have a lot of dlc characters with abusive prices Sorry my bad english. DragonBall FighterZ simply put, perfects the 3D anime style that has been struggling to find its footing for so many years. It's stylish, it's fast, it's high octane, it stays loyal to the series it comes from, and above all, it has fun, exciting, fast paced, rewarding, addicting gameplay topped off with the best animation in a 2d fighter on the market right now.. Many people criticize the game for the few characters it brings even 3 years after it was released. I bought the Fighterz Edition for € 14.95 this week and I am overwhelmed by how many different moves each character has. The personality of each character in the anime / manga in the combat aspect is captured perfectly and the graphics are crazy. It's the best anime fighting game out there since the Budokai Tenkaichi saga (and one of my top 5 fighting games). I hope people reconsider their idea that it is a robbery, and even after 3 years they buy the game and enjoy it. as I do. I even bought Goku UI.. Just wasn’t for me. Other people clearly love it. I played several hours trying to learn to love it, but always felt like things were either too easy or way too hard. The controls are simple to understand, but I couldn’t master them and it wasn’t fun trying. The grind was unpleasant against beefed up cpus that do much more damage than you and combo lock you. But it’s probably pretty fun with other people (so long as they’re near your level. I hear the online matches are insanely difficult). It’s probably just me, but I was hoping for some customization of characters, like picking a load out if moves or whatever, or some kind of progression system. To be fair, there is a progression system in the story mode. But it’s bare bones and didn’t do it for me. Again, lots of people love this game so it’s doing something right. The matches are fast paced and have a good intense feeling. dbfz is a great fighting game set in the mythical Japanese series created by Akira Toriyama with a new story and with the return of many characters and that despite its beautiful animation that reminds a lot of the appearance of the series, there are certain important points in the ones that fail. The first failures of the game is the balancing of characters, many of the characters are balanced in absurd ways, however this is positive, since if not, we could never have an equally worthy combat between videl (a normal and ordinary Earth almost without powers) and beerus (the god of destruction of that universe) but hey, this is not as serious as the following things. One of them is its story mode, yes, I know that fighting games should not be so demanding with the story mode, but games like for example: mortal kombat 11 and tekken 7 at least deign to try to write a good story to give reasons to fight the characters, which dbfz does with great difficulty because the story seems to be written by a fan who wanted to satisfy his deepest desires. And the last and most important thing, the Achilles heel of the game, the DLC characters. Dlc characters are always welcome in fighting video games, however, this one in particular has a problem, if you buy them for pleasure or other reasons, go ahead no one prevents you, but if you want to get into the competitive game, you have it clear kid , the game has 19 dlc characters, of which the vast majority are used in the competitive and some of them are almost mandatory to learn how to handle them if you want to enter here, but nothing happens, it is possible to dedicate yourself to competitive without having to go through box, unless you want a beating. In summary, despite its inordinate amount of strange decisions, the game is quite fun and can be enjoyed casually, in addition to the ultimate edition that brings 9 dlc characters is discounted which should be taken advantage of.. Dragon Ball FighterZ had a lacklustre and disappointing story, thankfully the combat itself is very refined.. Fighting Games were made to be hard and not beginner friendly, but this is an EXCEPTION. Dragon Ball FighterZ is a fantastic fighting game with simplified controls made for beginners to ditch out combos, but of course fighting games weren't made to be easy. In combat you can use one team consisting of three characters with a pretty decent roster to choose from. Regarding about its art style it is FANTASTIC, even if you play the game on a toaster it will still look great. The story mode ain't half bad, the only problem i had was with the AI of story mode, they passively attack and are boring to play against, not to mention you need to clear all of them to make your team stronger. competitive wise it is ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTING GAMES IN YEARS. I am 500 Hours into the game and still not thinking of not playing it. BEST DRAGON BALL GAME IN YEARS. Bargain bin effort with just around 20 characters. All the extra ones cost a grand total of another €80, which is a scam. Budokai Tenkaichi 2 & 3 had over 100 hundred characters and were way bigger and detailed than this. The loading screens and pop-ups are ridiculous. Going to the lobby gets you more than 5 pops and take longer to dismiss than an actual match. Local battle rewards aren't transferred, so it's broken. The story is slow, short and has a time-filler system that lets you fight clones 95% of the time. There are Lootboxes that you can buy with in-game currency, but are also purchasable with real money if you don't want to grind. The lobby is the menu, and it's confusing. Fighting is fast, and the button combinations for moves are too complicated to be enjoyable. It takes time before you master them each time, and is therefore not easy to get into if you just want to have a match with a friend. Animations look good, but sadly are just as repetitive as the story mode. This is a €10 game that should include all the the characters. But it doesn't, so i can't recommend it. I give it a 5/10. It's underwhelming.. Played on PS4 Pro. Gameplay: GREAT Graphic: GREAT Story: GOOD Music/Sound : GREAT Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT. Very unique use of the beloved franchise in a real fighting game wish the company keep doing good with their tittles and add some of the test elements from this game to the next guilty gear. I usually don't play 2d fighters... but when I do.. it's FIGHTERZ.. Looks great and takes skill to master but still easy to pick up and play. A must have for any dragon ball fan. People with bad internet always seem to win as you have to play at there speed vs your nets speed. Not to mention the fps delay is insane. Another thing is reroll accounts that reroll to thrash a newer player. Terrible ass game.. I have enjoyed this game for two years and I just have to say that it is absolutely fun, it is one of my favorite fighting games, I love its mechanics. I daresay it's the best Dragon ball game ever made. I would have liked it to have a single player mode similar to other DB games, because the single player mode is too boring, but as a fighting game it is great.. Story 8/10 Gameplay 9/10 Graphics 9/10 This is an awesome fighting game, impressive graphics and easy to learn controls. I heard that the game company that made Narutimitstom4 made it. Maybe that's why I can guarantee action games. I feel like I made King of Fighters into a 3D game. It's the most dragon-ball-like feeling of all the Dragon-ball games! One thing I regret is that it would have been better if I had followed the story as it was in the original cartoon.. Pros: - Easy to learn fighting mechanics. - Looks beautiful Cons: - Never seen such LONG loading times in between matches...this was by far the worst fighting game in that aspect - A horrid and repetitive Story mode that makes you fight the same characters (clones) over and over again through many hours of pointless grind. - This game's currency aka Zen is even more **** just to get online avatars and colors at RANDOM. - The difficulty progression is all over the place, some fights are extremely easy only to get far more difficult on the next and vice versa. - Once again did I mentioned how bad the loading times are?.. This game is a masterpiece!! One of the best new fighting games in years, it looks awesome, and it shows the potential of 2D fighting games over the 3D ones... I really would love to see a Jump All Stars Fighhters like this.. I could put a huge list of great things about this game but I'm going to put it simple: I'm loving everything, every single thing about this game! Right when you get to see the graphics you get hooked, omg they are so astonishing. This db game has the best graphics ever. It beats all of all its successors even the db: kakarot game. The Fighting is so smoth and it feels great to play it. Specially no lag online. Definitely worth your time and money!. The game is really good the graphics and all that staff the only thing missing is that the story is terrible, I only played the story to unlock a character. Another thing is that the achievements especially the 530.000BP and 20.000.000 zeni are really hard.. I love this dbz fighertz game so much the gameplay is so fast and fluid. Would recommend it to any dbz fan.. Original story which is good for fans who enjoy fanfiction but the game itself is very repetitive, hardly any playable characters and as much as like 2d games of the past. I would like to see dbz games evolve. I´ve never been a fan of Fighting games, BUT THIS GAME IS SOMETHING ELSE. Probably one of the best, if not THE best, 2D fighting game of the decade, at least in the DBZ universe. It´s dynamic, fast paced, fun and challenging. The only downside is that most of the characters by now are paid, and in comparison to the full roster, the vanilla one feels kinda empty, but you can pick the remaining characters at steam sales for a very low price. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, BUY THIS GAME, YOU WON´T REGRET IT.. I don't have this game, but I already hate it. The reasons are: it has so much DLCs (Bandai is just thinking about making money) and this game's online trophies are just unbelievable and unfair. I wanted to buy this game but i changed my mind. after you get past the steep learning curve you truly do fall in love with the game, I constantly feel like I am getting better. you learn how to extend combos, you eventually discover high damage combos. If you are a fight","this is one of the best competitive fighting games i have ever played . it's a challenging game to learn but very fun to pull off combos and such . it's also a good dragon ball game and lastly, it's an incredible fighting game ."
726.The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,"The Legand of Zelda Links Awakening is my favorite Legand of Zelda game because it has great dungeons, great music, great graphics, better controls, and a story that is amazing, but I love the way you can make dungeons in the game and play them! It is a little disappointing that there's no multiplayer in the game, but the game is still great in many ways!!!. For me, this is the best top down zelda game there is, and now, this is the best remake of a zelda game there is. This game is beautiful, the gameplay has the classic metroidvania elements to it that make puzzles so satisfying, the story and characters are perfect and the music really elevate this game to the stratosphere. However, there are issues, in the switch this game runs kinda poorly, with some areas dropping a lot of frames making the exploration messy, and some dungeons have some puzzles that you absolutely have to search online.. It’s amazing to think that Link’s Awakening on the Nintendo Switch is a remake **** Boy game. At first, I thought they might have changed the gameplay, mechanics, or even added new content, but after seeing a side-by-side comparison with the original, I was stunned. It’s essentially the same game, from the bosses and abilities to the dungeon puzzles and music. The structure of the game is untouched, and it’s clear how much care went into keeping the spirit of the original **** most noticeable differences are in the presentation. The visuals now have this charming, toy-like aesthetic that feels fresh yet nostalgic. The music has been beautifully orchestrated, replacing the old 8-bit tunes while still retaining their magic. The camera is no longer fixed, except for a few dungeon segments where it’s locked in place for reasons I can’t quite figure out. These updates give the game a modern polish while staying true to its roots.What really surprised me was how much depth this game had as a Game Boy title. The story, the clever use of item abilities, and the dungeon puzzles are some of the most creative I’ve experienced. Some puzzles and even a few boss fights can be pretty confusing, especially with the cryptic hints from the owl statues. But when you finally figure out what those statues are telling you and solve a tricky puzzle on your own, the sense of accomplishment is **** first playthrough can be a mix of frustration and joy. You’ll likely get stuck at times, but the satisfaction of figuring things out makes it worth it. By the second or third playthrough, when you understand the game’s flow, it becomes even more enjoyable.. it' a really meddium game bc it's very slower and in the start u don't know what u have to do. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening has beautiful graphics and excellent gameplay. Additionally, the video game is enriched by an immersive environment, with great attention to detail. The character modeling, level mechanics, game physics, and artistic quality stand out at every moment throughout its story. Nintendo has created a masterpiece that everyone thoroughly enjoys. A fantastic game!. I didn't really got all in to this game, perhaps the only one in the Zelda series that didn't really fell to me. Cozy graphics but that's pretty much all.. It was a good, solid Zelda game; it wasn't very original or groundbreaking but was visually appealing and enjoyable to play.. Overrated piece of garbage,too boring i stopped after a few hours forcing myself,should have come with warning game only for kids,even for kids i swear the game is not fun,low standards switch fanboy im still trying to figure out whats on their mind. Link's awakening is such a perfect remake of the original Gameboy game. Such a worthy classic ! Highly recommend for any Zelda fans.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I loved the redesign in the form of toys, and the new content, but I felt that it is too easy in difficulty level and I feel that it could have, you know, something more for a remake. I give it a 7. Loved every second of it. All of the dungeons are ver clever and make you think the whole time. The art style and music are great too. The ending is touchy.. It's a good game, it's too short to fill the 60$ price, but it's a perfect game for those who doesn't want something that interfere on the lore. Nice story, with a cute ending. Combat is smooth and easy to learn. Being only able to hold 2 gadgets is a bit annoying as you have to switch all the time. Puzzles were good, although there was a few i couldnt figure out.. Good graphics but bad gameplay. Simple, short, and clunky. Not a fan of this one at all.. WONDERFUL :) We have the game with the best graphics of nintendo switch and it's beautiful. The dungeons are close to the perfection (exept 2 who are boring) The story is the most emotional i seen in a game. (I shed a tear) BUT, the best point of this game for me is ost which are under rated, they are memorables and are turned around to a melody To conclude, this game enter in my top5 games of my life. Have a nice day :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This Game Is Beautiful, So Cozy, So Comfortable To Play I hope Nothing Shocking Happens.... One of the best games I've ever played. The music the map the characters the boss fights the mystery's inside this island are all amazing. Thank you Nintendo for bringing us another masterpiece again.. This is a near-perfect remake of the original, the only issues I have with it are minor personal nitpicks related to sound design. Wether you're a fan of the original, or someone experiencing it for the first time, this is a phenomenal title.. Incredibly beautiful atmosphere. Awesome music. A perfect remake. Everyone should play this game. Personally, I beat the game 3 times in a row.. Very charming game. I leally liked the art direction. The dungeons feel good and are more challenging that what I anticipated. The problem with this game is that it gives you little direction of where to go to progress at the start of the game and what you need to do. At the start is very boring and leaves little to be desired, however, once you've figured it out and progressed, levelled Link up, it gets a lot better and turns into an enjoyable experience.. The remake is also pretty good but they changed some stuff and I kind of wish they didn't. The story is an 85% but overall 81-83%. Having played the Game Boy version from beginning to end more than once, I wasn't expecting to like the game as much as I did. The new visuals shine a new light into the world and story, indirectly giving more depth to the plot. Also, the sound and music are awesome, every single track well made. The game runs well too, maintaining 60fps during most of the game, but frequently dropping to 30fps for a few seconds as the game loads new assets. This new version also optimize the controls while being faithful to the original gameplay feel. And excelent way to experience a classic Zelda game on Switch.. The game is fun for a while but is difficult and is kind of boring. I don't recommend it.. An excellent remake with a unique graphics style that really makes the island of Koholint and the characters shine. The gameplay is fast,smooth and fun from start to finish. A great addition to the Switch library.. Great game, perfect sound, hard pazzle, gameplay is good, but game is hard. You need to follow the plot very closely to understand where to go.. There’s no denying Link’s Awakening is a very enjoyable adventure, however. It hits you right in the nostalgia spot if you’ve played before, and even if you haven’t it stands up well against more modern titles. After all, games are still continually being made in the vein of classic Zelda adventures. It’s just a shame it’s let down by such troublesome graphical and performance issues. With an optimisation patch and a price cut, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening would be a must-buy. Until then, it isn’t.. I enjoyed every part every dungeon and every boss. I love how this game is so simple yet contains different bosses with ascending difficulty, item to collect and a story to follow. Cute game, shame it has some frame drops in some areas, but really good game, wholeheartedly recommend it. A nice, short walk through bizarro Zelda land. It’s fun for what it is and well done for a Gameboy port but you can’t help but feel it’s simply a lesser, smaller, weirder, less evolved version of the masterful SNES game “A Link to the Past”. It makes you wish they ported LTTP instead. You can definitely tell it was a Gameboy game in every way. The camera tracks in Gameboy screen like blocks which really brings home the reality it was originally on Nintendo’s original handheld that didn’t age well like the NES or SNES. This can make the game feel claustrophobic and dated even after all the updates to the graphics. Even with the updates the graphics are still far from pretty. It’s also a strange entry in the series in terms of story and feels out of place within the overall Zelda-sphere. It along with “Link” were the two Zelda’s that have never really wowed me like the rest of the series. In terms of Zelda games on Switch, it ranks last behind better entries like the extremely underrated Skyword Sword update (which doesn’t get the credit it deserves) and video game GOAT convo games BOTW and TOTK. It’s worthwhile for those who have a hole in their Zelda completion list or are looking for something Nintendo to play after beating the best the Switch has to offer. It is significantly better than playing it on Gameboy.. Easily my favorite Zelda game. Absolutely necessary upgrade to the original - the visuals and soundtrack are unmatched. If you have ever enjoyed a top-down Zelda game, or have any interest in them, this is an absolute must-play. One of my favorite games on Switch.. I am a big fan of 2D Zelda games and this one is great. I love the music, the quirky characters, exploring the world, etc. While it is not my absolute favorite (e.g. the Oracle games or Minish Cap) but this but still a great experience. I hope that Nintendo will use the engine to remaster other old 2D Zelda games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 9.0/10 Not much needs to be said about Zelda: Link’s Awakening. It’s a traditional Zelda experience with a healthy dose of quirkiness and a charming art style. It has satisfying puzzles and progression. Exploration and curiosity is constantly rewarded. It’s also got beautiful, classic Zelda music and sounds. It was originally a Gameboy game but this kind of makes it even more impressive. They did a great job with this remake. It looks modern and has modern conveniences but feels and plays old school. Maybe the price point is about $10 too much. There are some minor technical/performance issues. Also working out what to do or where to go can at times lean towards being a little too obtuse, especially if you gave this to a younger gamer. But it is mostly just a great time. Zelda: Link’s Awakening is an easy recommendation. It is a must play for every Zelda fan and is a great entry point for newcomers. 9.0/10. An interesting puzzle. At first, the vignette was a little annoying, but then I got used to it. Some points are quite complex and not obvious hints.. Great game design. Hard to believe the game was originally made 30 years ago, but I wish this remade would give us some additional tips so we don't have to spend so much time backtracking.. The gameplay of this game is honestly SO much better than on Game Boy, the idea of going back and forth between items works so much better on Switch, but I wish they used more buttons than they actually do, ZR and R do the same thing as an example, but it's way better than the original. However, the animations weren't really updated as well as I would hope Link's turning, and some of the weapon animations make this feel more like a GBC game than a Switch game Color-wise though... this game is gorgeous everything pops and the 2 or 3 cutscenes in the game are AMAZING, I also appreciate that the frame rate is ""mostly"" stable which is good, and hearts/rupees come at a fair enough rate in the game, be prepared for the normal lawn mowing in Zelda games Finally, the puzzles are pretty good, but definitely feel outdated, some of these puzzles involve a lot of backtracking and a lot of sorta cryptic stuff, especially in levels 3 and 7, I like the camera angles, and some of the puzzles are super clever, but others annoy me tbh So yeah I think 8/10 is fair, the gameplay is good, the colors are great, and the puzzles feel like the early 90s again, I like the Remake it could've been better, but also could've been worse. A really good game, but incredibly cryptic when you want to advance through the story or beat bosses. Say at the beginning of the game, for example, where I spent over 2 hours trying to find out how to get rid of the raccoon in the forest, or the bosses, like f_c_de in the fa_e s_ri_e, master stalfos in cat__shes m_w (MINIBOSS), the armos knight in those ruins, etc. I love this game but at times it can be frustrating and a little difficult. I recommend you buy this game if you have a decent temper, if you do you have a huge and memorable adventure ahead of you. ALSO, SORRY FOR THE UNDERSCORES, I DONT WANT TO SPOIL ANY BOSSES OR DUNGEONS. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Wonky Game. Just start to get into the series of the legend of Zelda and I decide to continue this journey with Link's Awakening which is a port from GBA and to be honest I didn't enjoy my time with it. Well I can't expect much because it's just a remaster not a remake. The game is kind of good but many things that make this game feels off to me. Your adventure is all about exploring the dungeon at the core of it. Yes, you can explore koholint but you need the ability from the dungeon to be able freely moving around the world. The dungeon is not bad but the design is pretty unforgiving. Probably because I start it with hero mode right away, it feels so punishing. I always have to start at the entrance of the room and repeat every process that needed to take me back to the room where I died previously. The feeling of repetitiveness is building up right there. Another thing which is the biggest and the main reason for me not liking this game, there's a bad gene from Luigi Mansion 3 in this game, the game has pretty random enemy design. A lot of trial and error to know how to damage certain enemy which is not a fun time when you are in the dungeon. How do I know that I need to do charge attack on certain enemy? How do I know that I need to use magic powder to defeat that bouncing fire? Or bomb to defeat that fake kirby? The game doesn't tell you any of that and you need to figure it our by yourself. Last, for just a remaster, the performance of the game is disappointing. So many FPS drop here and there, especially in Mabe Village. Yes, the very first place that you explore, like what are you doing Nintendo? Well, if you enjoy the game then that's good for you but for 60$? This game at most only worth 40$ in my opinion. I even got the game second hand at around 30$ but I still feel it's not worth my money.. Nintendo seem to be unable to fix the slowdowns and for the price its a big joke to see stutter. i love the great graphics and the game play is fun but i really and then i mean really hate the dungeons.. A great remake of a tight, focused, and polished game. Weird and engaging story. Advancing and traversal are a little obtuse at times, but that's part of the charm. Respectful of those on a narrow time budget: I spent ~15 hours for the full story and sidequests.. Amazing adaptation of the strangest experiment that the og Gameboy saw. Graphics does improve the experience and the music is simply amazing.. This was a fun romp, but not one of the better 2D Zelda games (granted, that's a high bar to clear!) My few complaints are ultimately made up for by the wonderful-looking new graphics engine, and I'd love to play another 2D Zelda game like this in the future. The story, dialogue, and presentation are easily the most quirky and lighthearted of all Zelda games, and it's the sense of humor about it all that kept me playing. You'll laugh and cry, and have fun along the way. If I were judging this based on its charm alone, I'd be tempted to call it a must-play. The game is dragged down by performance issues (a few seconds of lower frame rate every time you change screens or exit the inventory, which is to say, constantly,) a rather forgettable soundtrack (mostly just renditions of the iconic Zelda theme,) an overall lack of difficulty, a whole lot of time spent backtracking, and some frustrating dungeon design in the later levels. Overall, I enjoyed my time with it, but would only recommend it on sale.. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX for Game Boy Color is one of my very favorite games, so I should have been much more excited when this HD remake was announced. Instead, my feelings were tempered by the ""plastic toy"" art direction. At any rate, I picked up and played this game on release day... and finished it in one session, of roughly ten hours. I have played the GBC version many times, so I had no difficulty finding my way through the remake. I like it, and it's very charming, but I can't see myself picking it up again. I guess I have just too much nostalgia for the simpler 8-bit graphics and music. Positives: - Extremely faithful to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color versions - Outstanding soundtrack - Wonderful story and memorable characters - Great sense of humor; never takes itself too seriously - Perfect Zelda game for introducing new players to the series Negatives: - The art style is not my cup of tea - Maybe *too* faithful to the originals; not much new content here - The newly-added ""dungeon maker"" is not very interesting - Not very challenging, especially for veteran Zelda fans Recommended for: - Legend of Zelda fans - Anyone interested in trying the Zelda series for the first time You might enjoy this if you also liked: - Any top-down 2D game in the Legend of Zelda series - Tunic - Crystalis. Quick review: ""Middle Ligue"" of Zelda series, but still high quality. 20 hours of fun and relax. Stupidest game i ever seen. there have puzzles for 5 years kid but they are long af and literally u can do 100% achivements in yakuza 3 while solving this stupid puzzles.. It could be a good gaming, but the last boss basically ruin the whole experience.. This is an amazing experience that makes you believe that you actually are in a dream like in the story thanks to the art style, the music, the enemies and the dungeons. I never played the original game in Game Boy, so it was great for Nintendo to remake it this way. One of the better remakes I have ever played personally. Maybe not worth of a 60$ tag due to how short the game is but overall the effort put into this almost makes it worth it. The visuals look excellent with this art style on the OLED. Bravo. For context, I have no nostalgia for the original game and outside of Breath of the Wild and A Link Between Worlds, this is the only other Zelda game I have played. This game is absolutely wonderful with loads of charm! It actually makes me want to play the original, even though I know that outside of graphics they are largely the same game. There are a few instances where it can seem a bit cryptic, but that's just the nature of these type of games which were developed before hand-holding became the norm, so I like the added challenge. The story is simple, but zany and thoughtful. I would give it a 10, except there are enough frame rate chugs in the over world to where it becomes a distraction.. a bit childish looking, but its hard as f*ck. I loved it. I need to write something. I played the original few years ago and I finded it pretty hard. And I´m a 80´gamer, so I im used to play hard games. This remake is much more enjoyable. I played very smoothly whit no dead ends so it went easy. I didnt had frame rate issues, and if they were I didnt notice them. In the first run I collected the 50 shells and 18 hearts. Im missing one item but I can tell where to find it. so to make a 100% play through is not impossible even whitout a guide. I really liked it. Its short, but fun and chill.. Coming from a major zelda fan this is definitely one of my favorite zelda games aswell as one of the most unique in my opinion. This switch port/remaster is miles ahead of the dx remake and original. The marshmallow graphics and vibrant colors are a spectacular addition to the original too.. It’s a beautiful game. But, it’s also very boring. You also often feel lost and confused in the game. I do not recommend this game.. Good gameplag, great visuals, the controls are very good, The story is packed, and it is an overall amazing adaption, my only problem is that it drags on at the beginning. -alden. Wow! I didn't think a Zelda game could surprise me with its story but Links Awakening does! Its story is charming, sad, mysterious, and has a fantastic ending. The gameplay is similar to most 2D Zeldas, and I'd argue it doesnt innovate nearly as much as most other 2D Zeldas. The map and level design are solid, although the puzzles dont seem to be quite as engaging as I'm used to from Zelda. As a remake, I really love the new graphics and fluidity, but I think they could have made more changes.. Amazing game! I did not play the original, so this was all new to me. All the puzzles were fun and the game play was great. Will be playing again.. A decent Zelda game. Beautiful graphics inspired by old era Zelda games but realised in a modern way. Very nice dungeons that become more challenging as you progress the story. Unfortunately, a lot of unnecessary backtracking and many moments where you have no clue of what to do next, and a world that feels unpolished and sometimes kind of generic.. Never played the original game on GameBoy. But this, remastered, game gave me and my 6yo daughter a feeling of adventure that we have had for a couple of weeks. The first what I was asked when we completed the game - are there more games like this. I wish Nintendo make more games like this.. Great game with fun puzzles. Some frustration along the way because a few times, I found it difficult to know how to procede. But a fun experience all in all.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Never played the originals but from what I’ve heard I don’t have to as this is a proper remake that respects the original games. Link’s awakening is everything you want and need in an handheld Zelda game. It’s a fun little game that might not reach the level as some of the great Zelda games, but it’s most definitely worth a play.. This game can't be fulfilled without YouTube walkthrough.I really can't understand all that good critics.Zelda marketing I guess.... A great example of how nostalgia makes things seem better than they work. And beautifully remake **** Zelda game that unfortunately hasn't aged all that well.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Zelda: Link’s Awakening from 1993 is one of my favorite games and this is a great remake. However, I cannot give it 10 because the Dungeon-Maker wasn’t especially great and I missed something new during the game.. i love everything on this game. its so good with a good content. i love it til the end. Beatiful game with great gameplay. Too bad it is one big maze with almost no directions where to go and what to do, but hey… it is how the games was done long time ago. Charming graphics and atmosphere. The gameplay itself is nothing too special but what it does do well is good.. Incredibly wonderful a perfect remake this zelda is very good with a somewhat sad ending. this game is so cute and loveable. i love every step that i made on this game. I really liked the style of the game and even find it better than Breath of the wild (sorry for everyone thinking different ;) ). This is a good game. It has the quality of any Zelda game: great story, cute graphics and amazing music, lots of great characters, big world and exploring. I gave this rating because of some aspects I experienced on my playthrough : -The game is unclear on how to kill some bosses . It’s Trial and error. -Some dungeons’ designs are very confusing (specially the last one). Hit invisible walls. -Some Puzzles are obtuse and confusing -Sometimes is very confusing what to do or where to go next. Even with the hints. -Control/button scheme is not the best. -Awkward controls, Jumping with Y and attacking with B button is not a standard scheme. You end up mixing actions. -Platforming is awkward, specially jumps. -Not a hint or tutorial on what to do with the hookshot or with the new abilities. Trial and error. -Lots of backtracking , sometimes tedious. -Jumps are clumsy at best. -Have a guide/walkthrough on hand: some of the puzzles and hidden areas (which are essential to continue) are very confusing and unclear. You can’t see some hidden cracked walls. -There is some Frame drops, nothing that will kill the game. No crashes at all . Quick restarts. Overall is a good game beside all of this. If you’re a Zelda fan it is a warrantied fun. But is not worth $50 definitely.. One of my favourite games in Switch. The remake is faithful to its Gameboy origin. I never thought a classic Zelda game can be so beautiful crafted. Map is small but solid, my only complaint is boss fights might be too easy once you study their move.. my favorite game of all time this game is the pinnacle of 2d zelda being a link to the past but better. it has easily the best artstyle of any zelda game, and if it weren't held back by the relatively weak switch, it would be one of the best looking games of all time. this game also features the best characters of all the zelda series, as well as a plethora of fun easter eggs, that aren't easter eggs because they are litterally just kirby trying to eat you, or goombas from mario. the only issue is that the dungeons can be cryptic, but this is an issue with a lot of zelda games. in short this is the way to get into zelda, with the best game in the series. Amazing game, artwork, puzzles, story combat. One of the best games I've played on switch.. This was a good game through and through. It felt like a faithful remake which took several creative liberties to improve upon the original. I would have given it an 8, but the claymation graphics really detracted from the experience for me. I know this is completely subjective, but the toy like aesthetic of the game made me feel more like I was playing with a figurine of link instead of as link. One of my favourite aspects of TLOZ games is how alive the worlds feel and how immersive the experience can be which I feel this game is sorely lacking. I know it was intentional, but the game felt a little too cookie cutter and bereft of ""personality"". Although I enjoyed the experience, in the end this game just feels like one of the most forgettable in the TLOZ series.. Awesome game overall. The original was one of my favorite 2d Zeldas. I didn't like the art style much and mostly the link sprite. I wish they could get back to toon link for the 2d Zeldas. Also there were some performance issues.. I don't understand what all the mostly very positive reviews are about. The game is nicely reworked and looks cute. However, the game mechanics are no longer up to date and somehow the game doesn't captivate me. The blur effect (blurring at the edges) is annoying most of the time, there is no option to turn this off. I also don't understand why many of the Switch's features aren't used. You can only place the additional items like bombs or grappling hooks on X and Y. Why aren't the shoulder buttons, which are double-used with protection and race, used for this? Likewise, the directional pad on the left remains completely unused. I found the graphics very cute, but got on my nerves somehow after an hour. I don't necessarily want to criticize that now, it's a matter of taste.. a perfectly servicable remake of an alright game. visually very pretty, gameplay identical than before, music great as always. It is an old-fashioned Zelda. It is an amazing game at the level of other Zelda games. But cannot give them 10 because it is still GameBoy Game on Switch for the price of big games on Switch. Without any addition. I still have GameBoy and Zelda: Awakening and it is better to play it there. From the story's plot, maybe it was hard to add something new. But I would welcome something more for the price of BOTW.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game maintains the original gameplay with new and spectacular graphics. It is a must buy for any Zelda fan.. A completely horrible chibi style and a design completely the same and anachronistic to the Game Boy game One of the laziest remakes in the entire market.. For a classic Zelda game, this is a must play. Growing up playing this style of Zelda you’ll have a great time. Although moments in this game arnt really thought out, it’s clearly just trying to extend play time by putting key story elements behind secret loading zones. But other than that, this game is a really fun Zelda game. And dam near perfect.. I made this account so I could review this game to say how frustrating I find this awful game. Huge fan of the Zelda series and Nintendo until now. It was painful. I’m not an amazing player, but my god, I’ve never died so much in a game, you get damage from everything, and starting from the start in a dungeon is not fun, doesn’t improve your skills and does not want you to keep playing. I’ve given up. I’ve completed breath of the wild, and will just go back to play that again instead of doing the same thing over and over again in this game. In addition, I don’t like the view over head, unfortunately, I found absolutely no joy in it.. It was an absolute pleasure to just inhabit this gorgeous world. There's so much variety throughout the map that most of the game didn't feel repetitive at all. Tons of clever puzzles and interesting enemies kept all of the dungeons very interesting. It was super satisfying to build up my arsenal as I progressed which gave me a tangible feeling of becoming stronger as the player. And WOW does every mechanic feel refined to a tee! Just a quick sword slash with B feels literally perfect to use on an enemy. The whole game just wraps up into a perfect little package of top-down Zelda perfection that I will play many more times in the years to come.. Easily one of the best switch games. Hands down the best graphics by *far*, the toy chibi styles works *so* *so* well here. The story is simple and not the kind that gets in your way yet it's *so* good and gets you the feels, the puzzles are fun as standard with 2D Zeldas and the characters are insanely cute. Music is good also .... A few bizarre design choices that can leave the player absolutely lost keep this from being a near-perfect 2D Zelda.. In 2021, i think this game only deserve 4/10. Just to be clear this is first time i play zelda link awakening, so no nostalgic here. Buying this game after BIG LOVE to zelda breath of the wild. 1. Frame rate dropping issue is annoying. 2. Very hard to complete without watching youtube walkthrough. (maybe just for me?) 3. If u play without walkthrough, u will waste a lot of time to find the correct npc/place so the story can continue (or is it just me again? For example the pushing cemetery tomb thing) 4. Too small a game for this price. ( 5-7 hours to complete) 5. Hard to resale (if comparing to Zelda BOTW, Mario series,Pokemon series) THis game does remind me of the old classic RPG game, 20-30 years ago when u willing to spend a tons of time to searching the correct way/npc/place to continue, but in 2021, not applicable for me anymore.. My Score: (9) - Great! -----------------------------------------------------------------","it's amazing to think that Link's Awakening on the Nintendo Switch is a remake **** Boy game . the visuals now have this charming, toy-like aesthetic that feels fresh yet nostalgic . the music has been beautifully orchestrated, replacing the old 8-bit tunes while still retaining their magic ."
728.Mini Motorways,"And you thought mini metro was hard? Hold its beer because Mini Motorways is here! Simple yet stunning graphics. Buttery smooth systems that look and feel so good you almost want to eat them for breakfast. What’s not to love about trying to connect a city together? You need to get from Point A to Point B but how are you going to do it? Well, that’s up to you! Again 10 dollars for a game you are going to get multiple days out of? What are you doing reading this review? Buy the damn game already!. A game built off the back of trash. The lessons learned from metro were put to use in the perfect iPhone time waster.. Mini Motorways is one of that kind of games you that you are going to spend lots of hours trying to solve different difficulties and also enjoying the music, sound and graphics. A very chill game in general. This game looks like a little stress reliever. After what seems like a little sequel of Mini Metro this isn't a bad game at all. Gameplay seems solid & relaxing as the game is actually like that in general and it's simple and easy to understand. New challenges & leaderboards can give in if you'd like to challenge yourself against other people as you can rise to the top & become the best ""road planner"" in the game.. Dinosaur Polo Club has taken the same tried and true formula that worked with Mini Metro and applied it to a game where you have to build road networks. Daily and weekly challenges, as well as scoreboards and achievements will keep you coming back for more but I'd argue that Mini Metro is probably the better game. Despite the graphics being a slight improvement in Mini Motorways, roundabouts and traffic lights seem ineffective meaning you're an almost helpless bystander to the traffic congestion.. Mini Motorways is a great game to either relax and play casual or to spend some time finding the perfect way to build the streets to brake your own record or the one of someone else.. It just doesn't make sense - if this came out after Mini Metro, why is it so much worse? Can a developer un-learn a lesson they taught themselves at an earlier date?. It's hard to fault Mini Motorways for being significantly less enjoyable than Mini Metro. But it's fair to fault it for not being enjoyable at all.. In its present state I cautiously recommend this game, just from how well Dinosaur Polo Club supported their last game with updates and new content. It lacks a lot of the content that its predecessor (Mini Metro) had. As of writing, Endless Mode is not a thing, the number of road types and upgrades you can build are limited, mod support is nonexistent and the game has some truly off-putting RNG.. If you liked Mini Metro, keep playing it. This new game from Dinosaur Polo Club truly ****.. Mini Motorways is a very casual game (and that's a good thing). There is no pressure (unless you are at 1200 trips and a goddamn white supermarket spawned in the middle of your blue houses), it is just a chill yet also strategic game. It is incredibly polished with no bugs (that I have found or noticed) and it nails its core concept and ideas. Definitely worth the 10 USD.. Mini Motorways is the new definition of a casual game. It was intended to be a kind of sequel to Mini Metro and it very much is. Unlike Mini Metro, I actually like this game, it’s the definition of a casual game. You have cars that need to get to places, and you build the roads; if they don’t reach their destination fast enough, game over. It’s that simple. This game too follows the principle of “easy to learn, hard to master” and that is totally the case. You start with 1 destination and 1 car to reach it and you’re gonna just chill and think to yourself: “It’s gonna be easy, bring it on!”, but like 10 minutes later when you have hundreds of fares complete already the cars start to add up and that’s where some strategy comes in. Diagonal roads are key to save road tiles, although they’re rarely an inconvenience. The only time I worried about running out of them was when I did color segregation runs to not have to deal with different colored cars intersecting each other’s ways to their destinations. Motorways are very satisfying to use and see get used as well. Roundabout’s are pretty difficult to utilize correctly; at least for me, some people swear by them. Bridges and tunnels are basically the same, the only difference is that tunnels are only available in some later levels. Traffic lights are a mixed bag for me. In one junction they work, in another, they don’t. The levels being named after well-known cities don’t do much for me. The only difference from one another is the river/mountain layout which are named after a river/mountain near that city. Any name could have been written there and nothing would’ve been changed. Once you’ve played all the levels, you’re done; not even the daily/weekly challenges have different map which is fine considering Mini Metro did the same thing but I’m still a bit disappointed by this. The maps however look amazing. Minimalism done right! This has been a more mini review, pun intended, than usual because there’s not much more to say than: Mini Motorways is a great game with few flaws, so it rightfully deserves a 9/10.","mini motorways is a great game to either relax and play casual or to spend some time finding the perfect way to build the streets . roundabouts and traffic lights seem ineffective meaning you're an almost helpless bystander to the traffic congestion . despite the graphics being a slight improvement in Mini Motorways, roundabouts and traffic lights seem ineffective ."
729.Batman: Arkham Knight,"Very good, better than its predecessor **** as usual, some challenges are quite tough.... Easily the best game in the series. The gameplay is refined. The city is bleeding with personality. The batmobile, while overused, didn't play bad at all. Even without the DLC, this is packed with enough.. Best Batman game ever all the time. All mission and side mission very enjoyable If you like Batman game you must play this game.Excelent game. very good.. First off, ""Arkham Knight"" looks phenomenal with its dark cinematic atmosphere. The gameplay also brilliantly expands upon the formula established in the previous titles. But the Batmobile ""tank"" missions are a disappointment. Still, the story is great and the presentation is cutting edge. While this trilogy capper may not be as great as ""Arkham City"", it's still a must play for Batman fans. Overall, I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. This gotta be the best game that i have ever played in my life. I literally could not wait to get home to play it everyday. Its crazy that it took me nearly 10 years to finally give it a go. I regret it lmao. Absolutely phenomenal. What an ending to an incredible series. Especially when you take the Knightfall Ending. I like this game but it's not as good as Asylum and City. The batmobile is used WAY too much and is actually more of a crutch the game falls on every two freaking seconds for no reason. I get you're fighting an army but still. The fighting was very fluid when it was occurring but I also found myself just getting overwhelmed constantly during big fights but that might be just me. The story was cool but not as good as Asylum and City. I liked it, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite Arkham game. But still, despite all the complaints, it was definitely a very good ""finale"" to the mainline arkham games.. Everything's great but maybe not bosses so much... -Great Gamplay -Great Story -Great Characters -Very good graphics -Weak bosses. Best ending to a game I ever seen. Combat iscool. Environment is probably my favorite of all time. Dark af and gritty . Too much stealth Batmobile and some of the controls but still it’s a work of art .. 9.4/10. The combat in this game is so smooth and polished. Single handedly beating up bad guys while incorporating all the different gadgets is so satisfying. The batmobile tank honestly doesn't feel like batman at all, but I still really enjoyed it.. This one is, imo, the best one of the series. you can really feel like you are batman. My second favourite of the Arkham series, the only minor gripe I have with this game is the batmobile and some of the boss fights. Batman: Arkham Knight, one of the best, if not the best, superhero game ever **** story of this game is extremely good, the gameplay is good, the story is good, EVERYTHING is good in this game, only Batman: Arkham City is better than this game. The only problem with Batman: Arkham Knight is that it has an ending. A rocksteady perfection, rating 10/10.. Amazing game, the graphics and story and gameplay are all amazing, looks like a 2024 game. One of the first big Ps4 games. Batman Arkham Knight is the last Game of the Arkham Trilogy and offers wonderful Gameplay and Graphics. Today Games are looking worse like Kill The Justice League. I hope Rocksteady will make Milestones like this again.. This game came out in 2015 , It’s 2024 and it looks like it came out yesterday ! I don’t know what these people are yapping about. This is the greatest superhero game ever made. The story is phenomenal. The gameplay is intense. The Batmobile I will admit is not as cool as they could’ve made it, but who cares we have the Batmobile! I love this game and it is one that I will never delete off of my hard drive.. Well Batman is my favourite superhero so I don’t know if I will be objective. The gameplay has great combat system but it becomes repetitive. I liked the story because it is a well known Batman story reimagined. Give it a try!. Could be 10 but it has riddler trophies I don’t recommend for those who think they’re a normal person. I really enjoyed this game. The action is great, story is also great and gameplay too. Surely in my top 10 list.. I find it sad how Rockstedy manage to mess this one up. to lazily bringing back Mark Hamil as Joker for the sake of having him around. to a story that makes no since. to a villain twist even worst then Arkham Origins Joker. and the overuse of the batmobile. such a dissapointed game that foreshadows Rockstedys downfall. It's just so good even in 2024 and after suicide squad just perfect (a bit much batmobile). One of the best super-hero vídeo game ever released, if not the best, together with Spider Man. Great game best in the series great combat and stealth paired with a captivating narrative but I couldn’t be bothered with riddler trophies and barnacle is overused. Had a blast playing this game, and the city was great! Only issue was the batcar levels, but some of the batcare levels were fun!. For me, Arkham Knight is by far the best Arkham game, the stunning graphics, the amazing story and the smooth combat make this game so good.. Close to perfection. Although the batmobile is a bit overused in tank mode. Different kinds of chases would have been far better. Oh and the real batcave is missing.... Every couple of years or so I go back and play this game again, and it feels like the game gets better every time. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm aware of the criticism about the batmobile, the boss fights, etc. but honestly, I have so much fun in this game and the good. Masterclass art direction and word building. The game still looks gorgeous and the combat/stealth are phenomenal. So I don't really care about the excessive batmobile use. This game deserves the praise!. The best batman game i have played very good story the map is big but the fighting is some times clunky. The game is good as graphics and the story. But I don’t know why I felt bored while playing it, knowing that the physics and combat were perfect.. The gameplay,the graphic,the story, all of them is fabulous this game is very a masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. With the release of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it is clear that Rocksteady gave all their budget, including money they didn't have for this game. For the first time, you get to prowl a fully realized Gotham City. The world is densely packed with secrets to uncover, riddler trophies to collect, and thugs to pummel. It's a city alive with danger and desperate hope, perfectly capturing the essence of Batman's world. Takedowns flow with balletic grace, predator sections offer strategic challenges, and the Batmobile adds a whole new layer of vehicular mayhem. You'll feel like the ultimate predator stalking your prey and fighting the iconic villains in you're way. For enthusiasts of Batman, action-adventure games, or those who appreciate outstanding interactive experiences, this game is a must-play.. A visually stunning open-world Batman experience that I didn't dedicate enough time to but recognized its quality.. It's an impressive game, Batman Arkham Knight, every movement is perfect! The graphics are beautiful, a lot of unexpected things happen in the gameplay and the story is sensational. One of the greatest Batman, Dc, Action,Adventure Games of all time and a 100 out of 10. I'm a really big fan of arkham games and this one is my favourite, this game really perfected the game play of arkham games and it was so fun to play, also the story was really great and a really good ending, but the best thing about this game for me is that this game really gives you the feel of being batman and the fact that batman was so badass in this game. The batmobile is fun but it is overused, the puzzles I don't mind but the tank battles become tedious, especially when it replaces a boss battle. The combat is peak Arkham and the graphics are amazing. The story does a great job of ending the Arkham series but the twist is predictable. The perfect end to an amazing trilogy , completely refined combat with a plethora of gadgets to choose from , amazing combat moves , stealth is the best it has been in the series. I loved the bat mobile stuff , i can understand if you didn't like but come on games now we did have the chance to drive the bat mobile sure it was tedious in some areas but OK The only reason that this not a 10 its some underwhelming quest endings .. This is a excellent Batman Game. Nothing tops this game the only complaints i have is the Riddler's Character Which is annoying as hell. One of the best experience and most loved games I ever played. Story is amazing. I think is the last game of that.series that worth.. I love this game but also have some problems but even with those problems I still love this game (being my second favourite in the series. The visuals are amazing, still competing with current games and the characters, details, combat, mechanics and so much more are near perfect. This game is incredible.. This is a masterpiece, real masterpiece… the perfect ending for the perfect trilogy. One of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. The only negative I have is the repetitive tank battles, however, this is something that I personally enjoy. The graphics are second to none. Even 10 years later, this game stands strong. Story, characters and gameplay are the best I've ever played. A great conclusion to the Arkham trilogy.. ı played this game with hating to use batmobile. Normally ı really like batmobile.This game just says use batmobile batmobile batmobile and they think they can use joker again but because of this game ı really dont like joker so combat good game design good but because of just batmobile and joker ı really dont like this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was the first game I ever preorder as a 13 year old. Safe to say it was an amazing choice. The true ending to Arkham Batman, not that suicide squad crap!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game from story to dialogues to characters , the gameplay are amazing it gives you a lot of choices you can use voice cloner or hacking while playing , one of the best games i've played.. The best Batman game there is. The Batmobile is awesome but sometimes missions with it can be pretty boring.. Nice game, story is good, good characters, some missions are too long but it’s the best batman game ever.. What an astonishing game, one of the best games I've ever played. This game it's almost 10 years old now and the graphics and gameplay are still as good as new. Incredible game.. This game is amazing. The original was groundbreaking but they excelled all expectation with this one. Open-world with a cool campaign, tons of side missions. A must-play game for all Batman fans!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Music is a world within itself With a language we all understand With an equal opportunity For all to sing, dance and clap their hands But just because a record has a groove Don't make it in the groove But you can tell right away at letter A When the people start to moveThey can feel it all over But they can feel it all over people They can feel it all over They can feel it all over people, no, yeah Music knows that it is and always will Be one of the things that life just won't quit But here are some of music's pioneers That time will not allow us to forget now For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo And the king of all, Sir Duke And with a voice like Ella's ringing out There's no way the band could lose You can feel it all over You can feel it all over people You can feel it all over You can feel it all over people You can feel it all over You can feel it all over people You can feel it all over You can feel it all over, yeah goYou can feel it all over You can feel it all over people You can feel it all over You can feel it all over people You can feel it all overYou can feel it all over people You can feel it all over I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over now people Can't you feel it all over? Come on, let's feel it all over people You can feel it all over Everybody all over people, go. Easy 10. I understand why people say it's the worst Arkham game, but I disagree, and I think it's the best. Best combat. Best stealth. Best traversal. Best story (haven't played Origins). I see why people don't like the batmobile, but I don't really mind those sections. Also the game has a bunch of free dlc, which is worth a try.. Batman Arkham Night has the best gameplay of the series, the formula has been refined to perfection. There are so many possibilities when in combat that you do truly feel like Batman. They also added the Batmobile though it felt a bit overused. There are far to many missions that involve the Batmobile but I'm still glad they added it. The graphics stand up to todays games really well, it all looks really good. The rain for example is looks amazing and the way the lights reflect of the wet pavement also looks amazing. The story is a bit predictable at moments, nonetheless I felt satisfied at the end. While perhaps not the best game in the series overall it still is spectacular and it will not disappoint.. It took me a whole playthrough to finally get the hang of the bat-mobile, and on reconsideration it's not so much bad as it is boring. 8.5/10. (which does round up). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best super - hero game of all time.. Best Batman Game ever, good Batmobile sequences, the game expand everything you ever seen in the Arkhan universe and makes it a lot better, the soundtrack, the graphics, the combat, everything in this game as the meme says: "" Makes you feel like Batman"", I loved every bit of this game.. Over then the over use of the Batmobile, this game is pure gold!! If your a fan of the Batman, then this game is 1,000% worth your time!. Absolutely masterpiece, i know people were mixed about the Batmobile but man besides that everything was phenomenal. Rocksteady did an amazing job with The Arkham Trilogy.. Without a doubt the best of the trilogy, this game is one of the best out there. It evolves everything from its predecessors and creates an extremely avant-garde formula that has set a standard. Gotham is displayed majestically and the technical sector is superb, except for the not very memorable soundtrack. The gameplay is extremely fluid and reactive, at the cost of a small visual sacrifice which leads some animations to be more rigid in order to overlap, but its strength is also the biggest in the game, the batmobile: one of the most fun movement systems ever, which in addition to offering an effective alternation with gliding, transforms into a war machine with the press of a button, as well as having a remarkable animation when recalled (initially it is difficult to handle, but you get used to it after about half an hour). The most astonishing feature, however, is the environmental destructibility: long story short, almost everything can be destroyed with your vehicle. Finally I would like to reward the variety present in the environmental puzzles and the ingenious ideas that the developers had to solve them. Must have. Even though i think Arkham City is better, Arkham Night is very close, this game even does some things better than City like, actors performaces, sidequests, better open world, better performace on the console. The batmobile sections are quite “different“, but it is not terrible like most people say. anyaway this game is great, and you should try if you havent yet, it is without a doubt, a top 5 best super heros games of all time.. Absolutely Loved it. Only flaw I can think of was too many Batmobile missions. The best and most complete Batman Arkham game of them all. The boss fights may be underwhelming, compared to City and Origins, but it compensates by far in every other aspect. Great visuals, story, a lot of content both in missions and challenges, and the Batmovile is fun to use, both in and outside of battle. You shouldn't listen to the negative ratings of handicapped kids who either can barely write and breath at the same time, or are too slow to learn the way the Batmovile is controlled.. Amazing in nearly every aspect. Just wish they did a bit better with Jason's story, and really wish they improved the boss fights. And while I'm not a hater of the Batmobile, it did get overused asf.. The best game for Batman in my opinion. second best superhero game behind ofc Arkham City. One of the best games ever! It has a great story, awesome gameplay, world and it's visually stunning to this day. The only cons this game has is the lack of proper boss fights and the tank fights.. WORST OF THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE! The Batmobile doe not reload fast, the driving is very complicate; the gas is the right trigger, but the brake is not the left trigger like any other driving game. This people decided to make the left trigger tank mode, and if you mistakenly press left1 the car will eject you. Not to mention that if you are trying to get away one little bump with something will turn the vehicle 180 degrees. The fact that Batman has to rely on the vehicle for like 80 percent of the tasks makes this game ****. On a good note, the storyline is actually good, really good!. Definitely recommend. While the story falters in certain areas and certain twists are pretty predictable, it is also still a classic Batman comic-book story with excellent combat, beautiful graphics, a large map to explore with plenty to do. Just wish they would have toned down the batmobile usage.. meh, pretty boring. First things first Rest forever in peace Kevin Conroy. His impact will never be forgotten. ***Spoilers*** If I could use a time machine to go back and show my past self any Batman game of my choosing to impress them, this would the one I'd choose. It is the definitive Batman gaming experience. From its gameplay, world design, characters, and story - everything about it surpasses its predecessors, even Arkham City, which is essentially just a fetch quest for a plastic bottle. Arkham Knight on the other hand delves deep into Bruce Wayne's crumbling psyche while also exploring and tackling his doubts and innermost demons that are personified through the various hallucinations of Joker that appear throughout Gotham. In addition this game also humanizes Batman the most, which is crucial for any good Batman story. Meanwhile Bruce in Arkham City, while literally dying, hardly shows any emotion throughout, not even the faintest discussion of his own mortality and fears of not being able to protect his loved ones with Alfred. The Arkham Knight's identity later being revealed to be the adopted son whom Bruce failed also adds extra emotional stakes to the conflict during 2nd and subsequent playthroughs. Rocksteady's misleading marketing in the lead-up the game's release does not hamper the Arkham Knight as a villain for me, nor should it for you. As for the abundance of Batmobile content, I'd rather have too much of it than too little. The Batmobile is an integral part of the Batman mythos. A game without it is sorely lacking in my opinion. The Batmobile also makes travelling across the map a breeze, which is a vast improvement from City's horseshoe shaped layout that existed solely to make the game feel bigger and waste your time. The game also cuts back heavily on the amount of Riddler trophies needed for completion, which is relieving. My one and only gripe with the game is its mishandling of Deathstroke, though him being one-tapped by Batman can be explained away in lore by Batman being at the absolute top of his game to the point that not even Deathstroke poses a physical threat to Batman anymore. All in all this is the best Batman game, but not everything is perfect. Hopefully SSKJL will be about as or just as good.. Fully Masterpiece, there is no one mistake, amazing gameplay, amazing story. Everything is done as perfection ️️. It continues the story of the previous part with a great improvement in the combat system with an excellent and very good story. You will face all of Batman's enemies. The frustrating thing in this part is the bad use of the car. At first you will see it as beautiful, but later it becomes boring and **** also the boss fights They were not at the desired level, but it is still one of the best games that they finished in a wonderful way. My Review of the game: Script: Good old Dc Script following the Asylum and City games, with a great plot twist. Gameplay: one of the best ones Dificultie: Bad choice, the hard mode isn't hard at all Its one of the bests Batman games, my chosen one still the Arkham City. You need to play this game, go forward.. It's the reason I bought the PS4 in the past, It's on a level similar to the movies.. A great game without a doubt. The fact that it's open world and yet the combat and investigation scenes are very good. Everything is very well done and a fantastic story with the involvement of the best Batman characters, ah and the involvement of the car which was very good.. this game is so so beautiful 69699696969669696969696969699699669696969996996. Solid fun batman game. If you love the character and the world hes in youll love this game.. This game is a good farewell to dark knight trilogy in videogame industry by our beloved rocksteady. It's now in year 2023 beautiful & gorgeous on my ps5. Gotham city is very alive and brilliant in this game. Gameplay is very good and has improvements Since batman arkham city. characters are very well-written & visual & effects are insane. level design is masterpiece for a superhero game. it has little problems like boss fights and some with story.. Good Game. Can give it a second try in future, I might like the gameplay and visuals. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Love this game, it has a lot of beautiful gameplay, just great graphics aged very well. Batman: Arkham Knight thrusts players into a chaotic and visually stunning Gotham City, depicting a metropolis on the brink of destruction. While the game polishes the mechanics of its predecessors to perfection, it falls short in providing significant innovation to the hand-to-hand combat, stealth, and boss fight elements that were already exceptional. The addition of the infamous Batmobile, while well-executed and a welcome inclusion, overshadows other crucial gameplay aspects, leading to repetitive and lackluster experiences. However, the story brilliantly delves into the culmination of Batman's journey, exploring his internal struggles through encounters with haunting figures from his past, including Scarecrow, the Arkham Knight, and even the enigmatic presence of the deceased Joker. It's a final dance with familiar allies and adversaries that delivers a fitting conclusion to the Dark Knight's saga.. The game has very good graphics and the gameplay is attractive and diverse. But sometimes, there is no guidance in the difficult stages and it takes a long time to solve the problem. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Before I review the game, let me tell you how silly a lot of you look right now. First off, you PC gamers are complaining about the PC version under the PS4 version. Maybe play it on PS4 and see how that turns out. Because one your problems are fixed, you're gonna love it, I bet you. Second, you guys who are saying this game **** for nonchalant reasons: have you actually played the game? Play through it before writing a review, please. And I mean all the way through the campaign. Third and final, a lot of people are complaining and whining about the Batmobile and the fact that this game out too early. I find this funny because these are the same people who whined and complained about the Batmobile not being in the other games and the fact that Arkham Knight was pushed back not once, not twice, but FOUR times. Rocksteady read has done everything they can to make this work and you guys just come here and complain about it? If I was Rocksteady, I would honestly just stop making games all together for you people. Now, this is a message to everyone. If you're thinking about not buying the game because of some lousy reviews, please get the game. Seriously, don't let someone else's opinion decide whether you are going to buy a game or not. If you WANT to play it, then get it! It doesn't matter what others are saying, because who cares! When it comes to gaming, the only thing that matters is YOUR opinion! Anywho, sorry for all the ranting, but people just need to be told. This game is great, it is everything I was hoping for in the Batman finale, and it has blown me away on every scale. I am terrible sorry for those who did not enjoy it, but maybe those are the same people who enjoy CoD. Who knows? But wow, Arkham Knight took my breath away. It is predictable, yes, but does that ruin the game!? Heck no! It actually helps if you try not to think about it. Just play the game and enjoy it! But yes, the gameplay is flawless, graphics are stunning, story is on point, and the sound is great. Even the characters are wonderful. Come on: it's the same batman game we've been with since Arkham Asylum. Only this time, it's a lot bigger than Asylum and a lot more addicting then City. This game is beyond amazing. It never disappoints me tbh. And to all the Batmobile haters: I love driving it around. I don't care if it's forced on me, I'm going to drive it for fun because it's just THAT cool. I love it. Maybe add the Batwing next? Overall, amazing game and I recommend this title to everyone. Character: 10/10 Story: 9.7/10 Graphics: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Appeal: 9.8/10 Original Score: 10/10 Average Score: 9.9/10. absolutley perfect not only for batman fans - great story with many surprises - amazing grafiks even years after - so many different ways to play the game and master the challenges - many things to do but not needes for the story - best story game ive played in my life. There's so much content in this game. With the cool fighting system, the nice characters and the fast paced action, it is the best Batman game ever. Overall rating: 8.9.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very good game , with a perfect ending , the only problem is the side missions , they are very repetitive. Its really a good game graphics amazing and i am love this game and i suggest you to play this game.. I love this game since was little kids see batman movie and excellent graphic and lot action and good day. i have loved batman since i was a child, this game is simply a masterpiece. if you like batman and his universe you will enjoy this game.. This was THE game that made me get a ps4 and oh boy I don't regret my decision. A great finish to a masterpiece of a trilogy (yes I don't rate Arkham Origins). If you have played the two previous games, you'll enjoy this one as well.. It's an incredible game, the best closing for this amazing saga, the story is absolutely magnificient, the gameplay is super fun and the combat is perfect like in every game of this franchise. Everything that has to do with gameplay is great, but the overused Batmobile and the absolutely atrocious pacing bring it down a bit. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. It was the first Arkham game I played, and definitely not a disappointment. Loved the art style and psychological themes!. the game starts off promising but goes down hill pretty fast by the near halfway point of the game i just was waiting for the game to finally end and now that the main story is over i can definitely say im never going back to this game as all the side content seems just as bad if not worse. Take the Riddler out, this is a 10/10 experience. You are the Batman and Gotham is alive.. Even though I started playing this game in 2021, which is 6 years after the game's debut, it has better experience than any newest game in this decade (graphic, story plot,... everything).. This is my favourite game in the Batman: Arkham series for its amazing combat that is the best in the series, the graphics, and the map. The story, while maybe not reaching the highest heights of Batman: Arkham City, still has very good moments, and I can honestly say that, while it got a bit annoying over time, I didn't completely hate the Batmobile - 9.5/10.. When it comes to Batman, I always try to be as fair as possible but it's not easy. I find him unique in his kind of him, mainly because he has nothing that makes him invulnerable to a bullet, punch or fall. He is human. Here lies the greatness of Batman: in his being superior to others he is still human. He has a willpower that has no equal, an incorruptible belief, a code to be respected that often leads him to the end of his strength. This game is the culmination of a journey that includes two previous chapters in which we see a Batman who remains increasingly marked by the events that see him involved, before the death of his mentor Ra's al Ghul and his lover Talia, to end with the death of his quintessential antagonist, the Joker. It may seem counterintuitive but Batman wouldn't be what he is without the Joker, he needs him, because he encompasses everything Batman is Batman for: order versus chaos, justice versus injustice. In Arkham Knight, Batman is no longer what he used to be: he is more evil, violent, cold and blinded. All these sensations can be perceived by the player through the controller and you realize the power that you have in your hands. In addition to this perdition, Batman has to deal with Scarecrow who wants to flood the city with fear but at the same time come to terms with his past. A painful past that he thought he had buried, a son believed to be lost forever. This will be the last major effort the Dark Knight will have to make to restore order to Gotham for the umpteenth time. Gotham can be explored far and wide, from the lowest slums to the main **** of the Wayne Tower, whizzing with the noisy and thundering Batmobile or gliding between one **** and another, constantly accompanied by a suffocating rain almost as if it symbolised all the lives that depend on Batman, hanging by a thread. I could stay here for hours and hours talking about this game but I would do nothing but ruin an experience that must be lived firsthand. Thanks to Rocksteady for making a dream come true that until now it was only possible to appreciate in comics. I think the best sentence that fully encompasses what Batman is the following: 'when that symbol appears in the sky, it is not only a signal but it is also a tool of fear, because I am vengeance, I am the night, I am Batman.'. It delivers an engaging story that, building on past plotlines, dives into the psyche of its main characters with compelling pathos. Combat, as usual, is enjoyably fluid but contentutistically shallow, and the game lacks Arkham City’s intriguing boss-fights to make up for it, but on the other hand stealth improved tremendously thanks to way more strategic options and diverse threats. Level design isn’t as tight and intriguing as Arkham City’s, but the Batmobile adds effective depth and variety to the experience.. i hate batmobile in my opinion you are a very silly concept hero and you drive a car I think it is a terrible idea and in this game there are so many batmobiles we see more batmobiles than batman the name of the game should have been batman arkham batmobile an idea I didn't like when it appeared so much in a game I hated the game old i used to love batman games but this didn't happen. A very good Batman game that maintains the quality standard set in Arkham City and adds a lot of fun new content including a Batmobile, more costumes, and vehicle skins. Solid gameplay with a few frustrating sections, but overall incredibly fun.. Batman: Arkham Knight is a fan dream come true. Beautiful graphics, marvelous sound, precise controls and an entertaining fighting s","""Arkham Knight"" looks phenomenal with its dark cinematic atmosphere . the batmobile ""tank"" missions are a disappointment . overall, i would rate this game with a 9.2 out of 10 ."
73.Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3,"Of all of the classic Mario platformers, Super Mario Bros. 3 aged incredibly, with its level layout reflecting the intentionality and design philosophy that Nintendo tries to put into all of its games nowadays.. I love Mario games it so mush funBeing the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24 years old. While it has not been made official, Daisy has been rumored to be Luigi's romantic interest. In Mario Kart Wii they are seen in statue dancing together. She was his caddy in NES Open Tournament Golf, as Peach was to Mario.. In my opinion Super Mario Bros. 3 is a really nice and classic Mario jump n` run. It`s a revolutionary game with very fun and engaging levels, an awesome first Worldmap and an unique charm. All worlds, except world 3 and 4 (these are pretty lame), are really nice to play and you should still play this game today (I played it for the first time in 2024). 8/10. I really like this game its Mario 3 on the go, but it's screen crunch is bad, but the e-reader levels definitely make up for it. This is why I think Super Mario Advance 4 Super Mario Bros. 3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the greatest platformers of all time. While this game is great, later on it does get quite difficult, you'll need some serious Mario skills to beat this one.. Fun fun fun and more fun!I like the older mario, can't wait for the revolution.. can't find anything wrong with this game. its Mario bros 3. not a perfect game but since is 9 or 10 it gets a 10. Like the other titles in the Super Mario Advance series, this game is a remake of a classic, in this case: Super Mario Bros 3 (it is the seccond remake of this game to be exact, if you count the All-Stars version). The original game is already perfect, being one of the best 2D platformers ever made. So, how does this version surpasses it? One of the things that makes this remake so great is that it does not suffer from the weak points that most of the advance mario games do, like the inferrior soudtrack and burst graphics. Furthermore, the main campain and level design are bassically the same from the original with a few quality of life improvements (like being able to save anywhere). The biggest highlight of this game however are the e-reader levels. These consist of over 38 new levels in a new campain (sort of). They are incredibly well designed and are very challanging, felling as a natural expansion of the main levels. However, the coolest thing about these levels is that they feature power ups, mechanics, and enemies from other mario games. In my opinion, this is the best 2D platformer ever made. Maybe is the best remake of all time as well!. This Game is incredible it is one of the greatest Mario games of all time. The gameplay is fun and responsive the levels are great and very fun to play good game over all. FINALLY! ive beeen waiting for this game for my entire life! and it just released! and its good too!. Such a bad Game!. Beated 100% on my GBA and l love the challenging of this game. I don’t like how modern Mario games just became a bit challenging when you try to collect star coins, and how easy they are to get 100 lives. Here life is the thing you have to collect, this game is a bit hard, but not impossible, It's nice to know that the difficulty is solely based on completing the level, and 100% isn't about collectibles, but about completing all the levels.. I definitely love Mario, and this is one of the best games in the franchise that will bring you fun, a little difficulty, and hours of entertainment if you really want to delve into everything in the game.. Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 successfully brings the timeless classic to the Game Boy Advance while preserving its charm and engaging gameplay. With its solid platforming mechanics, imaginative level design, and additional features, it offers a fantastic experience for both nostalgic fans and new players alike. If you're a fan of the Mario series or platforming games in general, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a must-play title on the Game Boy Advance.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Another fun platformer but it's more linear format and comparative lack of variety makes it feel like a step backward from the previous two instalments.. Super Mario Bros 3 is one of the most fun, addictive and greatest platform games ever made. I can't recommend this game enough.. One of the best Mario games ever, I think there is not much debate here. A pity that they do not maintain the level. I liked it back then I don't know about now I'm over these rubbish looking graphics from the 90s now we're in 2023 and I'm not so into these graphics much anymore but for that time I was a fan not so anymore. It does what it says on the tin - it's a faithful remake of the original Super Mario Bros. 3, and give it credit, it nails it. 90 expansive levels, unique world layouts that allows you to choose your own adventure, and loads and loads of secrets - if you have your GBA, grab this when you can, you won't regret it.. It was a great game and a good remake. I dreamed about the game before I got it like I used to not pay attention in class because of the game. It was worth the hype. I just wish that the e reader cards didn't cost money but I'm glad that it was included in the wii u version.. I'm a fan of the super mario bros 2D games,and this game is a BLAST!!! It is a large improvment over the original game,lost levels and super mario brothers 2! this game's introduced some of the most iconic Mario 2D mechanics. A must have on the GBA and an amazing game all round with mechanics, level styles, and moderate difficulty of the game itself. I enjoyed playing this game as a kid and enjoy it just as much being older now!. It's so fun and inventive. It's pretty much a classic now and I remember how creative this classic could get. So wildly good.. Fun game, Mario jump good. Honestly only reviewing as a personal 10/10 anchor for any other reviews I make. Mario do fun good jump yes, play game. The best Mario game of all time. A great remake and it works amazingly on the GBA specifically the SP. I would definitely recommend this game to a Mario fan. Even if you've already played it.. this is a all time classic but better with more power ups stages just the only problem is there is a slight screen crunch but play this one if you like plat formers. This game is... JUST WHAT I NEEDED! Jokes aside, this game is quite the joy to play. Super Mario Bros. 3 was a big hit, and this remake is a step further.. The second I got this game in christmas 2003, I loved it. The game is so perfect and is the best out of the four.. Excellent remake! The only downside is that they included the same Mario Bros. game as a bonus in each Super Mario Advance game.. Super Mario Bros 3 is simply one of the best 2D platformers of all time. Despite its age, the level design still is solid and there is quite a bit of creativity. The way Mario controls is amazing. He has great momentum and new power-ups like the tanooki leaf are super fun to use. The frog suit lets you swim underwater easily but makes your movement on land more clumsy. The tanooki leaf lets you fly above the level when you get enough momentum. The hammer suit lets you chuck hammers, which is pretty darn fun. I absolutely love this game's sprites and the art style is still charming to this day. It's amazing to play this game portably and I'd recommend this masterpiece to anybody. Have a great day/night, folks!. Having nostalgic memories doesn't mean this game is good. The controls are clunky, the bosses, besides Wendy, are boring and repetitive, there are some awful level designs, and some of the power ups are useless.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The original NES version was great, the All Stars version for the SNES was even better, and this version of Super Mario Bros 3 on the GBA just might be the definitive addition of this game (or possibly Wii, Wii U or 3DS virtual console depending on your tastes). The game introduces a ton of new enemies with a wide variety including Boomerang Bros, Fire Bros, Chain Chomps, Spikes, Rocky Wrenches, Buster Beetles, Microgoombas, Boos, Stretches, Baby Cheep, Blooper Nannys, Jelectro, Missle Bills, etc. The Bowser boss fight is MILES better than the original Mario Bros, and seeing him cause his own demise and plumet into the void is all to satisfying. The worlds are memerable and have some branching paths with challenges and rewards between them on the overworld. The music is fantastic, the level design is superb and the powerups would win any list that they're in. The game is easy to pick up and diffucult to master, and it even rewards you if you know what your doing with for example warp whistles that allow you to warp to worlds 5,6,7 and 8. Super Mario Bros 3 was the golden jem of the NES, and truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this, or super Mario world is the best 2D Mario game. this game also has the super Mario all stars updated graphics.. This is one of my most favorite mario games I'd ever played. It has all the elements **** classic mario game. The level design is awesome as always and it is hard enough to get you frustrated but not discouraged. I somehow keep going back to this great game. I'd give it a 10.0 overall.. This game may have been good when it came out, but it really isn't fun to play today. It's so simple and it's really outdated, playing this game almost feels like a chore.. Apart from nostalgia, can anyone give a good reason as to why this is a good game in 2017/2018? I didn't think so.. Best Nes Mario titile on the go with improved graphics, you just can't go wrong with this one. The difficulty level can't let me give it better score.. Amazing game that is ageless, still very playable to this day. This game set the standard for all future Mario releases. All gamers must play this classic.. This game is one of the best Mario games you can buy. The story is unique compared to other Mario games. The graphics are great, the music is very catchy with lots of instrument variety, and the level design the superb! Mario controls perfectly throughout the game, so you should NEVER die to unfair level design - all deaths are your own fault, NOT the fault of the game. The power-ups are all creative and varied, so the game never becomes stale. The bosses progressively get more challenging, and the final boss is one of the most unique of the entire series! After you beat the game, there is plenty of replay value. You can revisit all the worlds to beat any remaining stages (doing this will unlock, there is a updated Mario bros arcade game in which you can try and achieve a high score; and there are 38 additional e-reader levels and 3 mini games with those e-reader levels (these are only playable on the Wii U virtual console version though). Also it's possible to play the game with either Mario alone or play as Mario and Luigi (do note that Luigi controls differently to Mario). Finally, this game does have multiplayer! One player controls Mario and the other controls Luigi and you play through the game in a similar fashion to the Super Mario all-stars version of Mario 1. Overall this is a superb game which I highly recommend to Mario fan, fans of platforming games, or fans of multiplayer games.. Super Mario Bros. 3 Is one of those rare titles that was made by a spark of inspiration instead of a spark of violence. The game takes you to a variety of different worlds that each have its own charming scenery. The gameplay is magnificent. It isn't like Super Mario 2 where you throw vegetables at enemies, instead its like the original Mario where there are Goombas, Koopas, and Fire Flowers. The story isn't ""Save the princess"" anymore. Its now ""Save the 7 kings and the Princess"". Its a moderately hard game as well because of the floaty controls so you will have a challenge. There are also many secrets in this game that each allow for a new item to be unlocked. This game introduced my favorite Mario enemies, the Koopalings. Each Koopaling has a different, hard airship that is so fun to navigate. I recommend this game to anyone 10/10. I know most people say this is a more annoying remastered version of super mario bros 3 and their actually right.However the good thing about this game is that it hits you right in the childhood.Your memories of playing this game on your NES come back to you quickly.Overall this game still remains one of the best GBA games of today.. The Game is a must buy for anyone who has a gameboy advance. Amazing levels, fine story, superb gameplay, Tons of good power ups. It's a masterpiece. This was a huge step forward for the Mario series. So buy the game. Game: Super Mario Advance 4 Super Mario Bros. 3 Genre: Adventure/Platformer Developer: Nintendo System: GameBoy Advance (GBA) Total Score: 92/100 Value Score: 9.2/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 10/10 • Graphics: 10/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 10/10 • Length: 8/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Visual properties improved. +Voice overs have been added to characters +Few level design, music (remixed), and text improvements have been added Cons -Sound is weaker due to the GBA sound card. Well, this game could definitely use refining. It has issues with slippery controls (Am I the only one who feels like they're walking on ICE when playing this game?) Plus, what's so good about Super Mario Brothers 3 originally? The game-play was the same, and it was an obvious downgrade from Super Mario Brothers 2. Games like this shouldn't have any sort of ""universal acclaim"" the picky gamer would likely throw this in a dumpster if they see the bad quality of this game.. If you're looking for an awesome classic mario platformer for your GBA or even DS, this is it. Massive re playability, huge worlds and tons of unlockables and secrets.. Well, it's Mario 3 with slightly better graphics on the GBA, whats not to love? It doesn't have much new content, but it is still a great port. Recommended!. Greatest game available for the GBA so much fun must buy if you love Super Mário. Originally released in Europe on the Nintendo Entertainment System way back in 1991 this GameBoy remake serves as a reminder of why it is still heralded as the greatest platformer in video game history. Many have tried to imitate Mario Bros 3 but Nintendo's attention to gameplay and innovation in level design is yet to be matched. Following the template laid down in the original the game provides eight different worlds, each containing several levels, which provide a huge amount of challenge and entertainment. Every world introduced new ideas, enemies and power-ups ensuring the game never became repetitive or dull. Unlike many early 3d games the graphics also still stand up to today’s standards with some clever visual effects throughout. In conclusion Super Mario Bros 3 is still the pinnacle of 2d gaming and remains amongst the greatest games of all time.. If you liked the classic Mario platforming games and if you played the original, then theres no more words I can say to get you convinced.....unless you hate Mario , but thats very dumb idiotic ..

730.Dead or Alive 3,"DOA3 is amazing. I love this game It was my favorite fighting game for the Xbox Original. Fast paced, flashy, and kinetic, this 3d fighter is a constant thrill ride. Complex combos can be a pain but overall a solid set of gameplay options and a well balanced fighting system mean its always fun to be a flashy ninja or bruce lee. I believe for the time D.O.A 3 are the best I purchased xbox original at the time with this game for me are unbelievable. I love Dead or Alive 3, but there's one problem I have: there is no online mode. Fighting AI can get boring after a while so it would be nice to fight against actual players outside of local play.. DOA3 was so amazing. Wished I still owned it. It was my fav. fighting game for the Original Xbox.. This game is honestly still the very best dead or alive game even in 2022. I think the game does a perfect job from voice acting to the intense fast combat gameplay. Controls are super tight and well thought out. I disliked the mid kick forward counter mechanic that was introduced in dead or alive 4 and carried onto the new DOA games. The music, stages and characters are all superbly designed and added variety to the game. I think keeping all counters to the back and X buttons was good enough, no need to complicated the fighting mechanics of the game. I really hope we get a dead or alive 3 port to steam and current gen consoles. This game deserves to be played by more people. I think not enough people experienced the game to give it a fair rating. I think this game is a Must Play game and was way ahead of its time when it came out. PLEASE Remaster/remake DOA3! Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. My name is Flash and I'll see you guys on the next game review.. This game is pretty fun, if you have the first Xbox, This Fighting Game is great for your console, but if you want more costumes, you better play dead or alive ultimate.. An amazing game. Kasumi is pure gold. Hitomi could kick me in the face and I'd thank her.. Still looks and plays good so many years later! The best fighter of it's time bar none. The game play does ""easy to learn, tough to master"" perfectly. There are a bunch of characters, each with their own distinct style and abilities, such as characters that are great at evasion, or characters that want to rush you down and stay in your face. There are many modes, such as survival, tag team, story and the funnest of all, multiplayer with friends. The fighting itself looks and plays like a dream, especially for a game that is a few console generations removed now.. The last best Dead or Alive game in the series. The graphics looked amazing back in 2001 and still look good today. The music fits every character to perfection. I'd love to own the soundtrack. The sound remains unchanged from Dead Or Alive 2 but more refined. The gameplay had a massive overhaul in terms of juggling, combos and damage balancing. It was the first fighting game to have destructible and interactive environments on a sixth generation console. The wall bounce mechanic was awesome and the hold system was improved to be more simplistic over Dead Or Alive 2's hold mechanics. The gameplay was fun on every mode. Three new characters are added: Hitomi, Christie and Brad Wong. Hitomi is a clone of Ein but also a student practising karate, Christie is a badass assassin and Brad Wong is a drunken master. The main flaws with the game are that it's too short and its lack of good unlockable content apart from Ein from Dead Or Alive 2 and costumes for every character. It's a chore unlocking all the costumes. This is what brings the game down in my opinion. If the game was released on PS2 rather than on the Original Xbox which it originally was a launch title for and give it the ""Hardcore"" treatment from Dead Or Alive 2, it would be the perfect fighting game or they could just it give the treatment on the Xbox. I recommend you play it.. Good fighter but being on xbox only hurt it... No one likes the dpad on the xbox controller for fighting games. You might be able to find a decent controller for this game nowadays but at the time the d pad was too frustrating to use compared to DOA2HC's ps2 dpad. Fix that problem and this game would be a 9. You can get a device that lets you play on xbox with a ps2 controller which solves the problem entirely. Sadly it's 10 bucks.. Dead Or Alive 3 game released almost 15 years ago at the start of the first Xbox. This game is an excellent project, but only at the start. In fact, the game is rather boring and is passed pretty quickly for all the characters, just as Duke's controller is difficult to play and not convenient. The graphics in the game are pretty good, you can not argue with that.","DOA3 was my favorite fighting game for the original xbox . it's fast paced, flashy, and kinetic, this 3d fighter is a constant thrill ride . if you want more costumes, you better play dead or alive ultimate ."
731.Jak II,"A noticable transition from its more light-hearted predecessor. These changes come with complaints. The dark eco powers are near useless. Checkpoints are few & far between. The crimson guard are always on you. It's great but frustrating.. It doesn’t quite nail every aspect of it’s gameplay, but Jak II’s mix of shooting, combat and driving was fairly unique at the time and still remains pretty entertaining to this day.. I enjoy the base principle of 'Jak goes through and edgy phase' but the execution of it was just not good at all. Between the boring drab main open world withnothing to do in it, and the often overly difficult awful mission design and structure, this game just ends up being a hugely disappointing sequel to one of the best PS2 platforms out there. Don't get me wrong, Jak 2 is an overall good game, but the over-abundance of annoying and repetitive missions, pretty underwhelming gunplay, floaty driving, and strangely uneven difficulty curve, made it overall way worse than it could have been otherwise, I personally consider this game the weakest of the trilogy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Jak II"" is darker than its predecessor and was obviously inspired by ""Grand Theft Auto III"". It's a fun and sprawling open-world platformer with plenty of action and activities. This ""edgier"" sequel features wacky weapons right out of ""Ratchet and Clank"". It also has a ""rage"" mode that is similar to the Devil Trigger from ""Devil May Cry"". Unfortunately, it suffers from unbalanced difficulty. Some missions are a breeze, while others can be frustrating. Overall, I would rate it with an 8.3 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game honestly hasn't aged that well. From the open world mechanics, the driving between mission checkpoints, the repetitive mission structure and the police system it just feels far too similar to GTA. Unlike GTA however this game is far more linear. You can't really choose between as many missions, there's almost nothing to do besides the main missions and the map is much smaller. The driving mechanics are also super floaty and makes navigating the city more frustrating than fun. In terms of the story this game feels too disconnected from the previous installment. It barely feels like the same franchise at all. Jak & Daxter: The Precursors Legacy was colorful and filled with humor. Jak II is dark and edgy. The ""edgyness"" feels forced and borderline cringe at times. The whole dark dystopian dictator city theme is also incredibly played out at this point. The gameplay is also very disappointing. The platforming has been dumbed down significantly (the first game isn't even that hard platforming wise to begin with), the enemies are far too predictable and they rarely seem to mix enemy types which is like game design 101. The worst part about it coping GTA is that it also adopts GTAs biggest flaws. Like I said a little earlier the mission structure is super repetitive. You basically just go around and collect a number of things, destroy a number of things and sometimes you have to do so in x amount of time. Another thing they adopt from GTA is the repetitive driving between missions part. You basically drive for 3 minutes just to do a 5 minute mission which means 3/8 of your time is spent driving the same stretch of road over and over again. This feels almost manipulative, like they're trying to stretch the length of the game to make it seem bigger than it actually is. I've seen some people criticize the difficulty. Personally I didn't find it difficult at all. But I can see how it might seem difficult because of the lack of checkpoints. It's extremely annoying when you're close to the end of mission and you fall of a platform by accident and have to start the whole mission over. And it's not that hard to fall of platforms considering Jak's shadow isn't even directly under his feet (this is also game design 101). Jak and Daxter's open world was so unique and the collect-a-thon gameplay fitted the open world design perfectly. Why they abandoned this in the sequel and decided to chase trends that were already overplayed at the time is beyond me. I also think it was unfortunate how critics and the general audience didn't react to this at the time. Maybe if they did we could've gotten a proper sequel to Jak and Daxter before the series was abandoned.. It's certainly sad to know that there are people who haven't played it. Naughty Dog really knew what to do to elevate the saga to the next level.. Jak 2 is not just a game; it's a monumental masterpiece that redefines the very essence of gaming. With its impeccable blend of breathtaking visuals, captivating storytelling, and exhilarating gameplay, Jak 2 earns a solid 10 out of 10 without a shadow of a doubt.. It was fine, but i prefered the first one. I beat it tho. I liked the gameplay, but the world, the characters and the story were, imho, boring.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Naughty dog began it's journey to darker gritty games by taking a colourful platformer and saying 'nope.' Whilst the direction thr company has since taken with absolute masterpieces like the last of us and uncharted, quite why they decided to drastically change the genre of jak and daxter is beyond me. The grittier nature of the story is fine however everything that happened in the precursor legacy is irrelevant and almost completely discarded for a more mad max style adventure.. what a masterpiece i like the game new way of introducing guns which makes it different from the first one while most people think this game is hard and by extension means its bad i think its a great touch from naughty dog to make it more challenging (this couldnt be said to every mission though whoever made drill platform,strip mine eco,water slums seal peace deserves a special place in hell)i like the hoverboard and the story is decent overall highly recommended. Matthew Alexander ""Matt"" Sinegar [SIN-NA-GAR] (An EXTREMELY Mature & EXTREMELY Heterosexual (Straight) African-American/Black Man): Jak II (2003) Is LITERALLY Always One Of My All-Time Favorite PlayStation (PS) Games.. The greatest game ever made. Amazing core gameplay and insanely good variety of missions.. It has many flaws but for the time it was very good, Jak has a more Edgy character and it was not necessary. Good. Unique gameplay. Sometimes traveling from mission to mission through city gets tedious. Few missions could benefit from more checkpoints.. A masterpiece ****. A near perfect blend of story telling, open world exploration, and gameplay. Not only was this a great transition game, like a game for growing up, it also had an emotional element. Haven city had meaning. The progression in the game was palpable, the revelations in the story astounded and awed. One of the greatest games ever made.. Remember when Naughty Dog cared? Yeah me neither. Such an amazing experience replaying this. Why is it that Naughty Dog is so averse to making a fun game? Jak II has a decent story and the gameplay services the narrative. They don't have to be at odds. A great game uses the narrative to inform the gameplay and vice versa. ND clearly only cares about money (like all companies no **** but wow they treat this franchise like the redheaded stepchild. **** you Neil. Make another Jak game you ****. I love the tone and atmosphere of Jak II. It's a way better revenge story than TLOU 2. It's also a dark horse sequel that took risks and was polarizing. Only this game is actually based as **** and a trendsetter, lacking all pretention. Stop trting to chase oscar-bait praise. Make a fun game again. It won't kill you. Crank up the 2000s edge, bring back the artstyle and tone, write a good retrospective Jak 4 like Uncharted 4, I'm so tired of seeing Ratchet and Clank getting sequels. Sony I will give you money for Jak 4. You do realize that right? Same for you ND.. The game is good but at times it can really be frustrating. The lack of strafing in a game like this just made fighting enemies annoying at times cos you couldn't aim properly. Especially tougher targets. You would try to aim at them and constantly miss. Instead you just spam jump, spin shoot which wasted all your ammo but it's the only way to hit targets at times. Camera angles in this game were so crippling at times. At 1 point your trying to climb a wall of falling rocks and the camera just makes it impossible to see where they are coming from. Or another point when these metal heads are shooting lazers but the camera doesn't point at them till your up close so you have to memorize the beam times rather then see them. Was it seriously that hard just to zoom that part out and make the camera locked? Also the camera is inverted when zooming with no way to disable. It would have been nice to allow to have normal camera controls. You also better like racing with hardcore rubber banding and annoying mechanics because this game is packed of it. Your in a flying car but ramps stop you steering. You constantly get pushed into walls by the AI. Boosting is basically pointless since there is not straight areas to use them causing you to blow up and die. Then have to start over. You also get a race through the streets where boosts are on every corner throwing you into walls. These races were just the worst and made me contemplate just removing the game. No one likes racing in these games. Racing games are for racing. The difficulty in this game is a complete mess. You never know if a mission will make you loose your cool or be a cake walk. I don't mind a challenge but games should gradually get harder not a couple easy missions then a ridiculous hard one with checkpoints every 20 minutes. Repeating the same 15 minutes all the time just gets frustrating. I know the game is old but these things aren't that obscure even for its time. Other then these issues the game is good. You can get it on PS4/Ps5 aswell if you want to play with a new. But for some reason the PS2 emulator Sony made is a bit buggy and sound can be a biit weird at time. I really hope we get more Jak games in future but I really can't see it. Naughty dog are mainly focused on remastering the same game several times. As much as all the bad things mentioned above I really do love this game. It's 1 of my favourite PS2 exclusives. The story in this game is also my favourite out of the 3 Jak games.. Jak II is an open world platform third-person shooter action-adventure video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony.. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 8 Gameplay : 8 Graphics : 7 Fun Factor : 8 Environment interaction : 5 Sound effects : 8 Overall Immersion : 7. I wanted Jak and Daxter, I got a bad clone of GTA. Graphically the game has nothing in common with the first one in the series. The City is ugly, the color palette is pale. The shapes of the buildings are not aesthetically pleasing, everything in the city is put over one another as though at random. Too many objects, too many NPCs walking the streets, too much going on at one time, it's a cacophony of vehicles, guards, NPCs, and narrow streets. Outside of the city, which consists of small areas where the majority of the missions take place, the picture looks a bit better though not by much. Graphically it is the same as in the city, though not as cluttered. But there is no sigh of the beautiful scenery from the first game. Pale colors, ugly shapes, an excuse for a day-and-night cycle, in one word - disappointing. I am giving the game an 8 because of the amazingly good level design and gameplay. But story-wise and graphics plus UX/UI - a total mess. It's a shame given the fact that these things were perfect in the first game(for a third time).. Much better than first Jak, but much worse than R&C 2. Haven City is designed very good, there are day and night. But gameplay ****. Its mechanics are broken or even empty. You can't play it normally without strafe. Developers forgot about this little, but important element called checkpoints. I played it 4 times, and all 4 times I had fire in my ass.. This was the only Jak game I ever played. I remember it being terrific, yet flawed. It's an epic action-adventure that you can easily see was inspired by GTA III and ""Devil May Cry"". But while I was entertained throughout, I was also very frustrated during some missions. The game's difficulty is unbalanced as it can suddenly ramp up at any moment. Nevertheless, this sequel is a real accomplishment in game design. Action fans will probably find it to be enthralling. I would give it an 8.3 out of 10.. Jak II is a PlayStation 2 classic that holds up remarkably well but is likely balanced too difficult for modern audiences. Jak II is a rare sequel in how much it fully transforms the identity of its precursor while maintaining the core foundation that made the original work. Many of my gripes with the original still exist here but at-least the over-sexualized character designs are no longer literal children. Overall I highly recommend Jak II.. This has been one of my favorite games since I was 7 years old. The game gives you a pretty unique combination of platforming, third-person shooting, driving segments, and even some vehicular platforming (i.e. Titan Suit and JetBoard). The people saying this game is not a platformer, frankly, don't really know what they're saying. The game actually has a similar amount of platforming activity compared to the first game, yet since Jak II is a much bigger game, you have more exposure to the different elements mentioned above. It's sort of like they filled in the rest of the game with the new stuff. This is a very strong PS2 Action-Platformer; I would recommend to anyone who's interested in this genre. If you are into Collect-a-thon platformers, you're a bit out of luck here, but there is still some collecting to do in this game. I'd say, if you look at this as a significant change from the predecessor, it's better to focus on the similarities, rather than the differences. The game is not simply some GTA clone; it combines elements **** like GTA into an action-platforming experience. Most of the levels are set up like 3D platforming levels, and they are very large, detailed, and connected seamlessly, in the spirit of its predecessor. It truly breaks my heart to see how some people could not accept this game. When I played this game at age 7, it kicked my butt, but I didn't give up. I ended up beating it after a few months, because even then, I recognized that the game was worth completing.. When I revisited the game at 11, it was much easier, because I wasn't stressed about it anymore. I don't know why others couldn't do the same. All in all, the game is fun, massive, and not as soul-crushingly difficult as some people say. Just take it easy, don't get stressed, and most importantly, don't blame it on the game. Take the time to understand the different mechanics, and how they work together. Peace.. While it's a great game I consider this a huge step back from it's predecessor. Jak and dexter was a perfect game for collectathon platformer fan who bought a ps2 and the idea of levels connected with each other without loading screens was revolutionary at the time. Jak 2 party much changed everything from jak 1 the game structure has similarities with the gta series you drive around the city completing missions, most of the missions are varied and fun there's shotting and driving and hoverboarding and platforming, but my issue is the difficulty it can be very tough and kinda unfair especially in the last third of the game with no checkpoints and you can die very easily, so if you went through a long mission and died near the end you will restart the whole mission that can take you 15 minutes to beat, at least the nice new additions and some of the more enjoyable missions made me liked this game and jak still controls really well. And the story is good daxter was hilarious.. Seriously what is this pile of h o r s e ****? I don't like to give up on video games, but I knew from the very start that I'd dislike this game. For starters it has a piss annoying sidekick character that won't shut up, dreadful missions, mediocre level design, awful boss battles, the worst checkpointing I've ever seen in a game, hard to aim gun combat and frustrating controls (particularly on the flying car sections). Never will I play this again, perhaps the most unenjoyable gaming experience I've ever had.. Its funny when I Both Love and Hate this game at the same time you know. First I love the story of Jak 2 I like it how it improves over its predecessor, this open world is great and yet depressing at the same time, and I love how you can used guns and shoot enemies in this game. Now the Parts that I hate this game. This game is Super Hard that could lead to a lot of rage quits and the checkpoint system is completely broken in this game and I was so frustrated with. Overall though it's not a bad game, its a good game if you can get passed the broken checkpoint system and the super hard difficulty.. The plot was great and the open world design with GTA vibes introduced a sandbox element to the series. Exploring haven city and its outskirts was another layer of replayability added. The most notable thing about this game was its difficulty which made it even more fun. Gameplay mechanics were ahead at the time but does show its age, however this is mitigated with a bit of practice. In summary: this is the 3rd best Naughty Dog game (after TLOU1 and Uncharted 2) and the best J&D game. Note: this review is only applicable to the PS2 version and not the disappointing PS4 version.. Jak 2 is one of the badass open-world sequels I have ever played. The first game is all about love, but for the sequel is about revenge for those that harmed Jak after being captive in the futuristic Haven City. And it’s unbelievable that this sequel is more adult than what I expected and it’s awesome.. It will be my personal 10 and I don't know any other game I should give the same rating right now. I replayed it a dozen times at this point and I think it is the best Jak game we have right now. It has an interesting story, great characters and gameplay. It brings a unique world and dynamically changing music system. Havon city is a place I'd like to see in a possible sequel. Yeah, the game may be challenging sometimes but I don't think it is a bad thing. The Jak 3 game, for instance, have almost no challenge at all and is it a healthy thing? I dunno. If someone will ever make a new Jak and Daxter game - this is how it should be done. (English is not my native and it's my first review, so Ig that'll do for now.). You can safely say that this game maxed out ps2 horsepower with some incredible views and lots of details combined with an open world. Its kinda in this weird place between crash and last of us, so you get a little bit of everything, four guns, some punching action, platforming and racing, story, even skating... anyway, while very impressive, the game is pretty short and annoying at times, I really dig more what Insomniac did on the ps2 with Ratchet.. Jak II is a great evolution, because Jak and Daxter was only a platform, and was eazy to complete, but Jak II is a big step. In this new episode you can use weapons, you can drive Cars Around Haven City, wich is an unbelivable game map. And the story is simple but interesting. They are few things, but big things. In my opinion the best platformer / adventure game on the playstation 2. An open world created with a lot of imagination, great arsenal of weapons, charismatic characters with touches of humor, challenging and tremendously addictive with a lot of collectibles to get. Essential.. I played the hell out of the jak trilogy on ps2. This game has a few notorious difficulty spikes, but I was able to get through as a kid and had a lot of fun. memorable game. One of the best game ever for Play Station 2, too criticized for having changed the ""style"" of the story compared to the prequel (a good choice as my opinion). The game-play is fun and well structured, with elements of platform and action, all built around a cyberpunk atmosphere. A must-have for PS2 lovers.. Jak 1 was a successful, critically acclaimed platformer so what moved Naughty Dog to make radical revisions is a mystery. Indeed, when Jak 1 was almost a pure platformer, ‘action-adventure’ shuffling far behind, in Jak 2 roles are reversed. Yep, Jak 2 is a rightful action-adventure title and imagine this: it’s a GTA clone. Adventure begins with unlucky experiment that results in main heroes being **** into faulty machine and warped into Haven City, futurist habitat controlled by tyrant Baron Praxis and his Krimzon Guard. The group gets separated, Jak is captured and is experimented upon for 2 years, until being rescued by Daxter. The lasting torture is the source of three game aspects. First Jak is now capable of turning into dark eco version of himself, imbued with increased strength, defenses and scariness. Secondly, Jak has grown into serious tough guy now capable of speech. Thirdly, his motivation is revenge. As you can see Jak 2 goes for darker, more serious approach. Haven City mimics well dystopian works: police force patrolling the streets, brainwashing propaganda sounding in air, the rule of baron is absolute. Jak stays true to his unheroely goal throughout most of the story and to achieve it he is ready to deal even with criminals. Story itself is ten times more complex and sophisticated than “collect 75 cores” of predecessor, there would be twists, revelations, humor, tragedies. But cartoon design and bubbly past are inescapable, the story ever be limited by the fact that people in Jak are hyperbolic farce characters reeking of lightweight humor and design. Daxter in particularly is even more exasperating and superfluous than before. Jak 2 action-adventure is almost identical to GTA. Like GTA cities, Haven City is the hub filled with people, some walking, some flying in vehicles. Like in GTA, you’re free to roam, attack anyone, steal cars. Like in GTA, cops are ready to pursue you in case of infringement. Like in GTA story consist of mission, each triggered by going into certain place in the city, marked by icon on minimap. Like in GTA missions start with narrative cutscene, involving eccentric job-giver, followed by a task that can compromise almost any activity imaginable. The only ‘like in Jak’ element is that many missions takes places in certain non-city locations that involves classic platformer walkthrough. GTA-like gameplay structure requires a lot of variety in missions and, quantity wise, Naughty Dog managed quite well. The list of different tasks is long: platforming, fleeing from giant creatures, puzzles, NPCs escort, enemy eliminations, skateboarding, ambush escapes, lap races, sprint races, city races, shooting galleries, taxi, police shake-off, robot suite, intact deliveries, bosses, minigames. Jak now is supplied with a weapon, thanks to which game imitates a shooter (imitates because Jak 2 doesn’t feature regular aiming system). Activities list sound impressive right? Yes, indeed, I was charmed by the Jak 2 changes at first but illusion was quickly dispelled by two problems. First is simple and objective truth that, ironically, the only thing that Jak 2 does brilliantly is… platforming. Everything else (which is more than half of the game) falls under GTA category and is lackluster. The AI of denizens of Haven City consist literally of two actions: trite walking/driving and running from Jak. Cops system is so basic that it’s nothing but annoying. The Haven City itself is completely empty: no secrets, no interesting places, no motivation for exploration. And all these GTA-like missions about driving and shooting are mediocre because driving feels too arcade and not engaging and shooting, as was mentioned before, is an imitation. The second problem is idiotic, nerve-wrecking, unwarranted difficulty. Almost *all* mission in Jak 2 forgive no mistakes but at the same time many of them relies heavily on luck (!). For example, many mission involves hordes of shooting enemies all around Jak, you can kill them as fast as you can but you can’t prevent at least some of them from making few shots. And these shots… they may miss and they may not, you can’t control that, it’s random. So two absolutely identical player actions may lead (and often will) to different outcomes. Couple with the fact that platforming locations feature no checkpoints, prepare to spend hours on going through first mission stages only to practice the part where you fail. And this is idiocy: there are dozens of easily-implementable ways to makes game enjoyable and accessible to average player but no, no checkpoints, no health boxes, no mistakes, no selectable difficulty - only hardcore. And it’s just doesn’t worth it. Platforming is the only fun department of the game while everything else is a living hell. Yes, objectively speaking Jak 2 may deserve 6 or even 7, like original… but no 3/10.. I loved the setting of the firts game, in this one they completly changed it. They developed a GTA-like game with empty city and boring point-to-point driving in it. Also, graphic settings did not saving, checkpoint system is bad and some moments is not hard, they just annoying. Some missions are good and plot not so bad, but anyway, i'm dissapointed. A great sequel to one of my favorite games! I love how Jak II expands the world and gameplay of the first game, how the story every time goes deeper and deeper... It's one of the funniest games of the PS2. Although I love this game, I really have to complain about the difficulty... At times it's not just hard... IT'S UNFAIR! But thanks to the wonderful gameplay, the great characters and it's more ""adult"" story, I can enjoy this great game even though the difficulty it's just crazy for a game like this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. How can a game has decayed so much? The First Jak and Daxter is so good, has just some problems, but this second game, all game is the problem. This is another game completely diferrent, is like they creat a new game from the 0, and put the characters from the other game. The game is totally dark, like the creators went into depression and pull the game with them. The missions are boring and irritant(not difficult), the checkpoint is terrible, doesn't enjoy. I dont wanna play this never again. This game gave me crisis of nervousness. :(. In my opinion this game improved and expanded on the simplicity of the first game adding many more elements like weapons and open world.. Overall an all around-awesome game, it doesn't age well in my opinion in terms of controls. Other than that, it's worth your time.. I feel kinda bad for rating this game a 7 because I really want to give it an 8 or a 9, but I just can't.. I usually don't downgrade a game because of its difficulty, but seriously what is with the crushing difficulty? It's like Naughty Dog got mad because Jak and Dakster was stupidly easy, and jacked the difficulty of Jak 2 up out of spite. I like a good challenge, but this game crosses the line of ""fair challenge"" to ""complete bs"" too many times. If they just toned it down a bit then this game would be a near masterpiece, but as it stands it's so hard it makes you want to throw your controller at the tv and that's not fun.. This is in my opinion, the best installment of the Jak and Daxter series. This game was my childhood- it was one of the first games I ever truly fell in love with. The story and voice acting is fantastic, the gameplay is challenging and fun, the characters are unique, and I haven't run into any bugs yet. I cannot express my love for this outlandish, colorful game. Its open world aspect makes it loads of fun as well. With the remastered edition of all the Jak and Daxter games, for only around twenty bucks, there's no reason why shouldn't give this franchise a try. The new characteristics and changes from the first game, specifically towards Jak, are very evident. He's no longer happy go lucky, and he talks. His voice is rough and deep, and he's angry and looking for revenge; and let me tell you, I love it. The hover-cars and car jacking system is great, and can be loads of fun. People draw parallels from this game to GTA- but in reality, Jak is its own unique game. Please, give this amazing game a try! You will not be disappointed!. ****! I've played through this game way too many times. Everyone who doesn't know what it's about, the easiest way to explain it would be GTA in the future. And not some cheap GTA knockoff, but a fully fledged polished one that's honestly one of the most fun games ever. All the guns, the freaking hoverboard and even the dark powers. They simply don't make games like this anymore. The story is epic, and the game is actually quite hard. I however remember wasting more time with just messing around than doing the missions. There are small challenges everywhere, like getting some insane hoverboard trick combos while the police is flying around busting your ass. Or doing a race in a huge stadium, or shooting off alien creatures along with AI companions. There's just too many things to list, and these are just small side activies. I could probably talk about this game forever, but I'll just leave it at this. If you haven't played through the series, you're definitely missing out!. Jak 2 is a platform action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Fun + Variety Gameplay + Good Characters + Gun Gameplay + Jak Can Talk - Lack of Checkpoints - Frustrating Missions - Annoying Collectibles. This game is really well done. The smooth animations of Jak still amaze me. Very few games, even today, can rival this. The game features some really good characters. The story is nice, featuring 3 factions, so a little more complex than that of most games. Jak II is full of action and fun and smooth platfroming. And of course: No loading screens! The game loads areas as you are traveling towards them. A smart system which very few other gamedevelopers have realized.. just this game can be described with the word "" epic "" and I played many vezes that already and I lost count thank you very much naughty dog games like this defined previous generations. WHY DOES EVERYONE LIKE THIS GAME?! IT""S BY FAR ONE OF THE WORST GAMES I EVER The original Jak and Daxter was one of my favorite games of all time! And now they ruined it BY MAKING IT A **** GTA CLONE! Why?! Why did you do this, Naughty Dog? You had something great going on with the first game, and now, THIS?! This is just... UIBY FC,mjkhudtr7tu[gmhcgxkfyri75oe6r7py. Sorry, I got so pissed that I pressed all the buttons on my keyboard randomly. Anyways, it's not just the change in gameplay that annoys me, it's these **** missions! This game has a **** up check point system. Trust me, it's screwed up. If you die once, you have to go a huge chunk back in the level. Soundtrack wise, they didn't do anything to improve the already lacking soundtrack from the first game. And graphically-- IT ****!!! It's so dark and bland, I mean... what the hell happened? The first game had a lot of color, and now this? So in conclusion, if you're anything like me, don't buy this game or rent it. Hell, don't even watch anyone play it. I despise this game.. i found this game very kool, this game just turned out to the gta of platform, the levels and gameplay were kool, i liked riding the hoverboard, it gets difficult later on though. Yeah, this game is partially good, plenty of new enemies, better story and upgraded problems The main problem is on its GTA copy style, ruined with **** A.I. and some stupid logic (police catches you if","""Jak II"" is a fun and sprawling open-world platformer with plenty of action and activities . it suffers from unbalanced difficulty, with some missions a breeze, while others can be frustrating . overall, i would rate it with an 8.3 out of 10 ."
732.Mario Kart 8 DLC Pack 1,"This is not a racing game, it deserves to be not here like what the hell are people thinking like lmao. no way this was better than literally gt4, game deservs to be in a worse ranking than big rigs. as a DLC it is a waste of space on the top racing games list. get out and let the true legends like MW and GT be where they belong. This isn't a game therefore it shouldn't be here it's been taking up the spots for actually good game this will stop NOW!. Good dlc but that’s the problem, it’s a dlc not an actual game, it shouldn’t be here. This isn’t a game and shouldn’t be considered on the same playing field when listed among other racing games. Kind of silly.. No reason for a dlc to be ranked as a racing game, when it isn't. get out of top 100. Its only a dlc It dont deserve to be among full time racing games Get out of here. This doesn't belong in the ""racing game"" category, it's just a DLC ffs. This can't be better than a full game lol.. This is just a DLC for true Nintendo fans. Other than that, it's an expensive and pointless addition to MK8.. Link came into my house, broke all my pottery, **** my wife and then left. My life will never be the same, curse you nintendo!. This is a DLC and it should never be in the Top 10's AT ALL!! There are better deserving games that should be in the spotlight.. doesn't deserve to be above the actual game, the deluxe edition and in the top 4 spot. like every nintendo game: very nice, but terribly overpriced. really really sad.. I will not give any more money to nintendo, you can go to hell also why is this higher than NFS MW, GT4. DLC pack 1 is far superior to DLC pack 2, and that is all I have to say about it.. Overall great value for money, with mostly good tracks and vehicle customisation options. There's some non-Mario stuff included (such as Link, from The Legend of Zelda series, being playable) which I think is pretty cool. Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach are pretty 'meh' additions to the roster though (why not Bowser Jr. or Diddy Kong or something?).. I think 10/10 is an on-spot review for exactly what I would want in DLC. F-Zero and LoZ courses alone make the purchase worth it. Additionally, there are more characters and cars that creates a fun experience for all to enjoy.. Lazy cash in from last gen games. Completely mediocre and linear to the point of extreme boredom. A complete rip off of every B grade cart game ever made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really love the 1st DLC pack! I love all of the characters, vehicles and tracks! Sure Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach are unnecessary but seriously. I don't care about them. In fact, I don't care about the character roster in any game. I'm one of the very few to do so! But anyway, BUY THE DLC IF YOU CAN!!! (AND WANT!). Worth every cent. While the game already feels complete by the time you get 3 stars in every course in every category, the new courses are so much fun especially because you can play as LINK! So yeah, I'm very happy about this super affordable 16 new courses (including mirror modes), new cars, drivers, and cart customizing. Also when bought together with DLC Pack 2 you get a discount as well as bonus colored Yoshis and Shy Guys. Too cute!. You all should get this DLC. It shows that Nintendo is everything. They might do some horrible choices sometimes however they always seem to listen to the online community at times and show that they appreciate gamers. You can even get a small discount is you decide to get both packs at the same time. ""Groovy is still in!"" Brandonthegamer. This DLC pack is okay. The tracks were awesome. I especially loved Dragon Driftway. Also Wario's Gold Mine is awesome. The characters are what I hate about it. TWO THIRDS of them are CLONE CHARACTERS!!!!! The karts are good looking. I'd recommend this pack for the tracks. Not the characters.. This DLC is perfect. The characters were awesome, but the fact that they are clones, they could be costumes for that character instead (not Link, he is its own, not a clone) like in Smash Bros. The courses were awesome. Especially Hyrule Circuit,Excite Bike Arena,etc. The new customization for carts were awesome. I use the Blue Falcon ALL the time. Get this DLC now for only $11.99 or something both pack 1 and pack 2. If you don't like Mario Kart 8, you are silly as JB and a Non-Gamer.. A stunning HD game gets a ridiculously awesome DLC full of fun and value? So many other developers make weak DLC that was clearly held back for profits. Not Nintendo. They added **** more for just a few bucks. Wow.. Let's compare this DLC to the Call Of Duty: Ghost Devastation. Cod= 20 dollars, Mario Kart= 8 DOLLARS! Cod= 4 new maps, Mario Kart= 8 NEW COURSES! Cod= 1 WEAPON, Mario Kart= 4 KARTS AND EVEN 3 NEW CHARACTARS, INCLUDING LINK! This is how you make DLC, and i can't wait for the next pack.. THIS is how you do DLC right. You are getting 8 new tracks, 3 new characters & 4 new vehicles for 8 dollars. That is a lot of content for such a cheap price. All the new tracks a very well designed and really fun to race on (the Mute City track is one of the greatest tracks in all of Mario Kart history), playing as Link in Mario Kart is like living a dream and the vehicles are awesome to race with (Blue Falcon especially). Mario Kart 8 sets the standard as to what DLC can offer and HOW it should be done. If you have Mario Kart 8, download this pack, it's worth it.. No one would have guessed that Nintendo could do DLC best. This single Mario Kart 8 DLC pack proves that. The quality shown off here is fantastic. Every course is a blast to race on. There's not a single bad or dull one in the mix. Ice Ice Outpost might not be super great but its visuals help it stand out from the rest. It's nice to see SNES Rainbow Road make a comeback as well as Wario's Gold Mine, which is perhaps the most hectic course in Mario Kart Wii. Mute City, Excitebike Arena, and Hyrule Circuit prove to be the best of the bunch. The characters offered here are easily the worst part of the pack. Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach? Who the heck is making up these characters? Link from The Legend of Zelda appears as a playable character as well but I would have liked to see Bowser Jr. and Diddy Kong, since they were in Wii but didn't appear in Mario Kart 8 for some odd reason. There's also a few new karts added to the mix like the Blue Falcon from F-Zero and the Master Cycle which is based upon The Legend of Zelda. Both of these karts represent their series well. The Mercedes-Benz free DLC arrived near the release of this pack but all it includes are a few ""real life"" vehicles to race in. To be honest, they don't bother me at all. Overall, Mario Kart 8's first batch of DLC is a must-buy. I'd recommend getting the Pack 1 + 2 bundle. Pack 2 will be arriving in May 2015. Nintendo has definitely defined the term of ""getting more than you paid for."". Great DLC, especially for the price. The tracks are great! My only complaint is the characters; would have rather seen Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf as the three new characters rather than yet another version Mario and Peach. There are already too many versions of Mario and Peach in the game before this too! Why do we need silver and gold versions of these characters? Or baby versions? They should have done it like Yoshi/Shy Guy colors and just give the users options to select from when using Mario or Peach, rather than make all of these versions of them be separate characters. Disappointed with the lack of effort on the characters, especially on a Zelda-themed DLC when there are plenty of characters from the Zelda series to include instead (such as Zelda herself!). So -1 point for each of the bad characters that were included = 8 OVR.. Link can drive a car so yeah great this honestly won't matter to the public =I'm fat hated Purrrple( See what I did there heh heh?) Cat made by Sea=ga :D. I am a Nintendo Fan Boy - so it hurts me to say this - but these DLC tracks weren't properly tested before they uploaded them - I use tilt controls - and MUTE CITY and DRAGON DRIFTWAY has curves that are too sharp to take with the Wii Mote - I slide off the course every time - I've play Mario Kart with the Wii Mote Motion Controls since 2008 - and I've played Mario Kart more than any other game - I'm very disappointed.. Nintendo: Doing everthing so much better than Sony and Microsoft, especially DLC It bewilders me that the Wii U is so underselling... Link in Mario Kart? No I can fangasm all over the floor. That mute city remix is divine. If you have Mario Kart 8, BUY THIS DLC RIGHT NOW! It is the best DLC since Dual Destinies's Turnabout Reclaimed.. THIS! This is how you do DLC! Add optional things to the game which will expand the content! 3 characters8 stages for just a couple of dollars is a fantastic deal! Highly recommend! Overall if you own Mario Kart 8 and are looking to expand your game I recommend you pick this DLC up!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is how to DLC, nuff' said. You want more? Ok: The 8 new race tracks are unique and gorgeous, one of the tracks is broken, where you can constantly use shortcuts, which isn't very fun online. I only like the Link character in this DLC. The other's feel like ""Just another 2 clones"". The new cars, bike, wheels, and glider are cool. The fact that the brought back the MK Dasher from the DS version is just... :D. This DLC is just superb, it essentially adds another fourth of the game. For just eight dollars! Most of the new tracks are great, but the rainbow road making another return is a bit weird. The new karts are great, especially the returning B-Dasher and Blue falcon. Everything added from other franchises has received great attention to detail, The legend of Zelda and F-Zero tracks stand out as some of the better tracks but neither seem forced in just to grab fans attention. This is DLC i recommend every Mario Kart 8 owner buys. In an age where DLC can slowly strip away your money in exchange for measly content, its great to see Nintendo deliver with DLC of this quality.. Absolutely amazing DLC. This pack blows most other DLC completely out of the water. The characters are a welcome addition, though it would've been nice to see them bring back old favorites like Birdo or Diddy Kong before cloning Mario and Peach yet again. The vehicle selection gets a rather favorable expansion with the addition of the Blue Falcon and the Master Cycle, as well as the return of a fan favorite, the B-Dasher. However, the main draw is the tracks, and I'm going to have to talk about each one individually. Yoshi's Circuit - What a great way to start off the Yoshi Egg Cup? This is a favorite track off mine, partially due to the Yoshi theme, but also due to the twisting and turning this track has you do. You always feel like you're on your toes. Still bummed the secret tunnel isn't back. 9/10 Wario's Goldmine - Kicking off the Triforce Cup is a returning track from Mario Kart Wii. This one was one of my favorites. I blame Stockholm Syndrome as this one was a pain to get a good time on, but more importantly, I think they've fixed the one gripe I had with it, and that was how shard one of the mid-track turns always felt. Not sure I like them removing the mine carts as hazards, though. The shortcut now feels like it takes no real skill. 8/10 Rainbow Road (SNES) - Kill me now. I can already feel my ears and eyes bleeding. This is the fourth time this track has been featured in a Mario Kart game. We get it. You're proud of it and the nostalgia is brings, but can we just put it to rest for a few... decades? Please? Still a good rendition of the track. 4/10 Excitebike Arena - A great original track. This one adds in the interesting mechanic of randomizing every time you play it. Couldn't begin to explain why I like it so much, though. It's just straightaways with two turns each lap, yet I feel like something is always going on in this track. 8/10 Dragon Driftway - I actually really love this track. I might be a tad biased as drifting is one of my favorite techniques in Mario Kart, but I really do enjoy playing this track quite a bit. I can see how it could be considered boring, though. 8/10 Ice Ice Outpost - Aside from the derpy name, I think this is my favorite track in the whole pack. It may seem very simple and straight forward, but once you start looking for the quickest route, you'll likely find that this is actually a rather difficult course to get the most out of. The short cuts are hard enough to catch, but they're even harder to link together, and that's not counting all the track-switching you'll have to factor in. I also love the feel and the theme. 10/10 Hyrule Field - This is a bit of a let down, actually. The fan service is here in spades, but the track, itself, feels a bit dull. Maybe it's just me? This is easily one of my least favorite to race in this pack, but it's still great for all the TLC put into the details. 6/10 Mute City - Ending this on a high note. Mute City is fast, furious, dizzying, difficult, and overall very interesting. There's nothing about this track that isn't to love. They even lowered the gravity here to make the track feel more floaty and give you that F-Zero feel, as well as littering the track with boost panels to keep the speed going. Great fan service sprinkled here and there and attention to detail. Not my favorite, but it's always a joy to race on. 9/10 This is the way to do DLC. If Pack 2 is anything like Pack 1, I think we'll be seeing a trio of great review scores for this game, sitting pretty near the top of the Wii U games list.. I usually don't like and don't buy DLC, but when I saw the amount of content of this one I was sold out. And I'm happy to say that this pack worth each cents. If you like Mario Kart you should buy it, I think you already bought.. This is how you do DLC. 3 New characters, although 2 of them are pretty much already in the game, but the fact that LINK, from the Legend of Zelda Series is playable makes up for the two other shortcomings. There are 8 new tracks, being; Mario's GOld Mine: A fun retro stage, returning from Mario kart Wii. Yoshi Circuit: It's Yoshi. 10/10. Dragon Driftway: a course that has you race through a dragon. It IS cool, but it sounds cooler than it is. Ice Ice Outpost: Disappointment. I was so excited that there would be an ice stage, but its just a green and yellow road with some snow in the background. I love my snow stages, so I'm particularly picky on them. Mute City: Yes, you heard right. A fast paced stage based off F-Zero, and it's great! Exvcitebike: Very boring, but not repetitive, because its different every time! Rainbow Road: A 3rd Rainbow Road already made AND HYRULE. This DLC for Mario Kart 8 is the right road to do this type of content. Please learn Capcom, Play Link and the circuits like Temple of Hyrule or excite bike are awesome.. What to expect from a super-awaited DLC one of the best games of the year? Yes, if you thought of amazing you hit. Nintendo once again, as has been seen in New Super Luigi U, teaches how competitors launch a DLC with content and quality. There are 8 new tracks (almost half a Mario Kart), one more amazing than the other. The highlights are the fun Excitebike and obviously to the track based on The Legend of Zelda series. In addition to these wonders already mentioned, Nintendo still presents us with three new characters, which are: Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach and Link from Zelda franchise. Couple this to the new customization of models of cars and motorcycles, and you have one of the largest DLCs already launched in history, and a very affordable price of just $ 7. Certainly more a gift given by our beloved Nintendo.. While there is no denying the excellent value for money for the DLC packs here, it's interesting that the quality of the tracks almost match the rather 'cheap' price tag. The new characters and vehicles are great; no complaints here, but the tracks themselves are a different matter. Some tracks, lack a distinct feel to them, you feel like you are just driving down a colourful corridor rather than sliding your way across a vast racetrack full of jumps, twists and turns. I will divide the tracks into two categories, 'hit' and 'miss', then I will give a reason to why I think the track deserves the specified category and give an overall score on each particular track. Hit: Yoshi's Circuit (GCN) - Challenging but technically diverse track. 7/10. Mute City - Accurately depicts F-Zero universe minus the speed. 6/10 Mario's Gold Mine (Wii) - Another remade toughie, It's a MK classic. 8/10. Hyrule Circuit - Diverse track with many distinguishing features and great fan service. 9/10. Miss: Excitebite Arena - The track randomises each time you play it, you jump a lot, nothing much else. 3/10. Rainbow Road (SNES) - A little too much glare maybe? Also, deja vu, yet again? 5/10. Dragon Driftway - The scenery looks like it would be more interesting to drive around, too much twirling. 4/10. Ice Ice Outpost - Two paths, but they are always right next to each other, could have done much more here. 4/10. Overall, the first Mario Kart 8 DLC is a mixed bag, some tracks feel half-baked and vacuous, especially Ice Ice Outpost. Whereas Hyrule Circuit is a hit. They could have even done more here but as it is, it's the strongest new addition to the MK8 track family. I was personally disappointed by the first DLC pack, I only hope the second DLC pack has more TLC put into it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm not very happy that there is only ONE Zelda track. Why are they calling it the Triforce Cup and only having on be Zelda based? The tracks were good, but having only one Zelda track really bums me.. Mario Kart 8 is one of the reasons I dusted off my Wii U and DLC 1 makes it better. The DLC comes with four new courses and four old ones. It comes with three new characters (Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, and Link). The map are beautiful and well polished. The most stunning course is Hyrule Circuit based off the Legend of Zelda. Coins turn into emeralds. Some sound effects replace with Zelda ones, and an easter egg which I will let you to find out yourself. If you like Mario Kart 8 then this is well worth the Seven dollars and is keeping me excited for DLC 2 coming in May of 2015.. Every single other game publisher take note: this is how you do DLC. The amount of content for 8 dollars is staggering. This does not in any way feel like something that was simply ripped from the main game and sold separately. It's an addition to the main game you can buy if you enjoyed the base game itself. All of the added content has been created with the same polish and sheen you would expect in Mario Kart 8, and while not all of the added courses are absolute winners, I have to give a special shoutout to the F-Zero and Legend of Zelda Track, which showed much more respect to their source material than I expected them two. For 8 dollars, it is a steal.. The new tracks are absolutely fantastic, especially the F zero and Zelda tracks. They both have fantastic new twists on coin collection. Playing as Link is a dream come true, Tanooki Mario also has his charm and cat peach is one for the ladies. Brilliant DLC.. Best combination of Quality/Value, DLC in MK8 is a real +pay for +fun The best thing in this dlc is the new tracks like mute city, Hyrule track and the Dragon`s one (my favorite). Nintendo are the only ones who do DLC right, it is more like an old school expansion pack. They deliver quality above all others and do it at a great price.. Nices courses with nice graphics, nice gameplay and nice music... All nice! New characters are good additions too (8 of every 12 people choose one of them online) and new cars and pieces are good too. But the point to this DLC is the courses!! If you have the game you should buy it.. Great DLC, make DLC like this for smash and you will be the main for all gamers. Other companies should be more like Nintendo and add content that adds extra to a game rather than completing an incomplete game. (Sorry this review became a bit of a rant). DLC that gives you more that you pay for? Sign me up. Mute City in particular is one of the best stages in Mario Kart History and all the other tracks are fun too.. I don't have many reviews on this site and my only other game review is for Mario Kart 8, but that's just because I don't write reviews for forgettable games because I always forget to write those reviews, so it's only the extraordinary that gets me typing and it's so seldom that I see the extraordinary and recently it's only happened with Mario Kart 8 and this time with the DLC expansion that adds 7 great tracks to an already perfect game.. This piece of DLC is an excellent value that only helps enhance an already wonderful game. Other companies should take note and follow the example Nintendo has set for video game DLC. I am looking forward to the second set of DLC for Mario Kart 8, and I hope to see more in the future.. Great piece of DLC new characters are great, tracks are awesome and the cars are detailed and look great. Overall brilliant piece of DLC can't wait until next pack.. Nintendo's first few steps into the realm of DLC have been most definitely in the correct direction. Enhancing the game, rather than completing it, the Mario Kart DLC is putting the spark back into racing. The new courses feel great and fresh, with interesting mechanics from the alternate universes. The only reason this isn't a 10/10 is due to the characters. Tanooki mario is awesome, but he really is just...Mario. There are a lot more characters out there. No one asked for Cat Peach. No one.","this isn't a game therefore it shouldn't be here . it's a dlc not an actual game, it shouldn't be listed among other racing games . this is just a DLC for true nintendo fans . it's an expensive and pointless addition to MK8 ."
733.Final Fantasy Tactics Advance,"been confused on how to get cid and completing all of the sidequest, stuck on a loop though, oh and all i can say is chad marche. For me, the best of tactics, sweet and adult story, excellent gameplay and infinite possibilities! I wish for a remaster.... I wish I could go back in time and get the Judge and Rabbit guy on my team, I needed like 1 more quest for them which required a link to my friend, and I'll never get that chance now. Legendary game.. A very pretty turn-based strategy game set within the world of the early Final Fantasy series. Basically it's an RPG that concentrates on combat rather than storytelling and exploration which makes it a little lacking in depth, but it's a nicely chilled out bit of adventuring that's probably not for RPG purists.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this spin off game in the series.. Gosh. So much fun and so addictive. I still remember I could play it for hours and missed the time.. If you got this game expecting anything like the original Final Fantasy Tactics on PlayStation, you will probably be disappointed. This game plays more like tactics ogre than FFT. It is also a bit slow and the story is not as riveting. The gameplay is where it feels different though. I really hope they go back to FFT and not FFTadvance when making a future Tactics game. (Edit, in hindsight my review is probably not that great due to the fact that I was expecting something as good as the original Final Fantasy Tactics. This game might be good to you if you haven't had that one to compare it to, or for really small children that are new to this type of thing.) If you want a Final Fantasy Tactics experience and haven't played the original in a while, I would just recommend playing that one instead.. One of the best grid based tactics games of its' times. Now in days it is still good. Even though it plays slow and feels a little bit out dated. Controls are simple and you can take it anywhere with you, since it is mobile.. Ok. I see many people seem to like SE game just ... just ""Because""! This is one of the LAMEST game i've ever played, one of the biggest disappointment in the whole saga. The game is so very limited in so many ways beginning from characted cast, starring soul-less kids that enter a magic realm, very much similar to the clichè used in many book for kids, but far less complex. Seems like SE's fan once again, struggled hard to find any meaning into the story that to me, and i hope i'm not the only one, is just meaningless garbage with absolutely no drama, no intensity and no pathos. The battle system is a complete mess, with judge system being way more annoying than fun. The whole thing is packed and a complete downgrade if you want to compare to the previous game from this serie ( Final Fantasy Tactics for psx). My vote overall would be a 6-, voting ' because it's a real shame to see this game having an average score of 9.1.. fantastic game with some improvements over the PS version, you can only wish this amount of love was put into every portable game out there. Its not as amazing as the first FFT but its a must play, one of the best GBA games.. The job system and quest element made this one of the most addictive experience on the GBA.. The best game planning ever world and the story of beautiful characters breathtaking gameplay more like my constant, simple and wonderful tactic. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a super solid strategy game. The job system is by far the best and most interesting part.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of my favorite games, if not my favorite. The unique class and race system is creative and fun, allowing for exploration in terms of game play and strategies. The game is not extremely easy like its sequel Grimoire of the Rift. While I do enjoy newer games with updated graphics, there do not seem to be any or at least many that are as good as this one for nintendo systems. Especially in terms of board battle sizes. There are a lot of tactics games where the size of the board is minuscule. The larger board for each battle in FFTA is great, and is what allows for the ranges of some of the attacks and more interest in the game. More of an aside and an extra bonus, but this game also has the charm of adorable eared animals: Moogles, Vieras, Nu Mous, etc. as characters for your team. The art associated with the game is also beautiful as well.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is great and follows what we expect of a final fantasy tactics game with new game mechanics. If it was not for the dump end, i would give it a 10. Hope they port this one to PS3, VITA, PSP like the others.. Hands down my favorite game for the Game Boy Advance, and definitely in my top five in the Final Fantasy series. The game play is addictive, the job system makes you feel like you're actually getting some where with your characters, and the variety of races adds a nice spin to the game. I've lost track of the amount of times I've laid awake in bed, repeating ""just one more battle and then I'll sleep.. wait that was over too soon, just one more.."" Hours of great game play and a very, very large amount of replay value. I will cherish this game for years to come.. This game resides comfortably on my personal Top Ten list at number 3, and was formerly my favorite game of all time, needless to say, I have a near infinite amount of good things to say about the game. Longtime fans of the series (Final Fantasy Tactics.) see this game, and it's sequel as very unfortunate downhill turns the series made, while I can see where this comes from, because of the change in publisher/developer the game has changed its tone and even most of its gameplay dramatically. The story is not AS intensive as the first, I look more into it and see some heavily dramatic elements that deal the psyche of an abused school boy. The gameplay remains to be an extremely polished SRPG, with a completely customizable set of units. Being able to change everything about you're party lets you create your own style in battle, with each Job class being unique in your their own way, along with the fact that you can mix and match abilities from multiple jobs together to essentially make your own class makes character building extremely fun. The missions and narrative provide a heavy emphasis on character and story, but only when you want it, with the literal hundreds of side-quests and optional additional story missions, most of which can be replayed, offer a deep experience from a gameplay and even story point of view. The clan territory system and clan wars game mechanics ALWAYS give you something new to do. The only complaint I had with the game was the laws system, which provides one or two restrictions on any given battle which alternate every in-game day, instead of spicing up gameplay by having to accommodate these laws, it just remains tedious, BUT it is used as a plot device to show the amount of corruption and misplaced power in the government, so I think this mechanic is excusable because it literally makes YOU feel the frustration of the protagonist in the story. If you like RPG's, SRPG's, or played the previous title, I would HIGHLY recommend this game. It remains after ten years being one of my favorite games, and I hope that this review will encourage you to play it so it can become a favorite of yours as well. Get it on Amazon, or get the rom online, its worth a buy.. Finla Fantasy Tactics Advance is A stragety RPG with similarities to chess for the Nintendo Gameboy Advance portable gaming console. This game's prequel is Final Fantasy Tactics for PS1 and its sequel is Final Fantasy Tactics A2 for Nintendo DS. Due to this game being on a Nintendo console, the storyline isn't as mature as the PS1 game and isn't as unforgivably difficult but good writing still shines through on dramatic and though provoking psychology of a bullied school student hiding in his own fantasy world of his own creation and his friends fighting through it to get him to face his fears in reality. The gameplay consists of a chess board in which you move around units and attack with weapons, abilities, magic and special attacks. You gain exprience to level up and money to buy weapons and items through battles. There are multiple races and classes each with its own strengths, weaknesses, stat growths, abilities, weapons and attacks. Judges are introduced to give rules of the battle, if they are not followed, you lose bonus items at the end of battle, given a warning or even temporarily removed from the party and put in jail. Multiplayer consists of generic optional co-op missionsa re are not important to the game. There is exactly 300 number missions to play through with some being replayable and some are only avaliable after completing the main story and get the ending, random encounters with other armies and monsters, and special unnumbered missions after the main 300 are complete for an alternate ending. Fans of strategy games, RPGs or both should definitely check this game out, as for others, this game may or may not be your forte. Collapse. I loved the original on Playstation, and essentially, gameplay has not changed. I like that your party remains constant even through in-battle deaths, which is an improvement over the system in the original, which forced you to buy new troops. However, the laws system really got on my nerves. I like that it encourages you to diversify your characters, with the mastery of different jobs and the wealth of jobs available. The problem is that a) some of the laws are vague, even with the descriptions offered, and b) it's too easy to forget! I wish that the developers had just disabled the illegal moves instead of giving you the chance to break them yourself, which I often did inadvertently. The punishment for your infraction is not revealed until the end of the match, and then you can decide if it's worth it for your character's stats to decrease permanently as a result of your honest mistake. A serious gaping hole in the gaming experience.","a very pretty turn-based strategy game set within the world of the early Final Fantasy series . it's a nicely chilled out bit of adventuring that's probably not for RPG purists . if you got this game expecting anything like the original Final Fantasy Tactics, you will probably be disappointed ."
734.Immortality,"Maybe I would have felt this was a better game than Telling Lies if I would have managed to stay with it more than a couple of hours, but the detective work wasn't very rewarding to me. It was much more fun to try to find the right key words in the previous game than to find correct detalis to click on here. In this game I got stuck in the same loops and I didn't get enough progress to be intrigued by any of it. I didn't feel like I was in control of anything, it was too random what I stumbled upon.. A wierd and great experience. The acting is spot on, the movie production insightful and the game itself is far better than Telling Lies. But the way of discovering new pieces is mostly random and doesn't make much sense at first. Unfortunately none of the 3 movies interested me.. this is a very aesthetic, unexpected and exciting work, the gameplay of which simply has no analogues, and the plot can be compared with the very confident work of world art house specialists. An excellent game in a genre which struggles to produce excellent games. Great gameplay loop, great mystery, great reveals. Nothing to say other than cool idea done in a cool fashion. The main issue is that the genre it's in struggles to invest the player personally as it is much closer to a movie than to a videogame.. I really enjoyed ""Her Story"" and was expecting something as cool as that was. Unfortunately, this is an entirely uninteresting bore fest that does not work on any level. Watching long boring clip after clip out of context with hardly any interaction is just not engaging and poorly done. They do a bad job of explaining what to look out for and how to best use the mechanic. There was a way to do this game (aka Her Story), but this was not it.. Very shocking for the expressive power led by the characters and director.... Great and unique experience with Immortality. One needs to be patient to understand who is immortal.. Very unusual FMV based game searching for clues in video clips to figure out what happened. I was a bit lost on exactly how to progress things until I figured something out, but ya it takes some creepy twists to the end. If you can be patient with it to figure it out I’d recommend. Only about 6 hrs to finish. Warning though lots of nudity, lol.. One of the best games in storytelling. By using Layered narrative ، sam barlow created a masterpiece in fmv games. Immortality is almost a good game. Immortality focuses on 3 movies that were made but never released all starring Marissa Marcel. Immortality is an interactive movie game from the developer of Her Story and Telling Lies. Immortality fits right in with both of those games, where the main ""gameplay"" comes from watching videos that are often times jumbled up and out of order and the player has to figure our the story for themselves. The game is like a puzzle game, but instead of the game making a ""dadadada"" noise when you complete a puzzle it is more of an ""aha"" moment for the player. The ""aha"" moments are the basis for why these games are so intriguing; however, Immortality is different from the other two games. The gameplay in Her Story and Telling Lies consists of searching for videos by typing in a keyword that exists in the dialogue in the scene. This make it so when you hear a name of someone or a place or an event you can search that word to see what other videos might unveil more information. In Immortality you get new videos by pausing the clip and clicking on whatever object or person that is in the frame and it will take you to a new video with the same object. Say if someone is holding a candle in one scene it might and it gets clicked on it may take you to a scene with a fire or a lighter. Seems like an interesting concept, except it doesn't create any good gameplay. The problem is it will take you to another scene with said object or person at random. So you just keep on clicking flames again until you think you see every scene. Or you just keep clicking on Marissa's face or the clapperboard over and over until you unlock everything. This is really the biggest issue towards the end of the game when you have no idea how to get to the remaining scenes because there really isn't an easy way to know what to click to get you something in the scene you are missing. While I liked the stories of the movies themselves and the overarching story, it just falls flat on a gameplay level. The interactivity with the secret scenes are good but that is about all the positives I have for the gameplay.. Impressive story, the actress manon gage has several scenes in different characters and in a way the game is suspenseful, where you think what can happen next, but it has one of the worst gameplays of all games, basically the only thing you do in the whole game is to point the eye to scenes and reveal other scenes, nothing more than that, a great lost potential.. Hmmm, I found the acting to be very mediocre. The lead actress particularly didn't hold my attention in the slightest. I felt not a single emotion during the whole thing. It's 3 terrible films cut up into pieces. The production values have been praised, and perhaps they are high for this type of game, but I haven't seen such bad wigs before even on the cheapest soap opera. It felt like a series of very amateurish school play extracts acted inexplicably by adults. This is a massive case of Emperor's New Clothes I'm afraid. Got to the end 4 hours in, with no real sense of achievement or clear understanding of the plot. And you know what? I couldn't care less! The characters are faintly odious but not in any way believable. A clumsy attempt perhaps to comment on objectification of women, by doing more of that. Really really poor.. Unique experience and a very clever idea. The random number generator should have been tweaked though at the end of the game, as it gets tedious to try to unlock few last scenes. Almost GOTY 2022 if it weren't for Pentiment.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's well filmed with a lot of attention to detail and decent commitment from the actors (mostly, there are times when 'scenes' cut and it feels like the acting continues). The technical skill isn't matched by the storytelling however which feels very gimmicky once the curtains are pulled back. The deconstructed narrative and repetitive gameplay mechanics involved in piecing it together is pretty frustrating. It's an interesting experiment for sure. I'm glad there are people trying to push the medium. However to me it feels both too amateur for cinephiles and too cinematic for gamers.. Immortality is a love letter to film and art nerds, with more than enough quality acting and story content to engage just about anyone. If you love a good mystery, have an interest in film or art, or are simply looking for a good way to waste a few days, this is the game for you. This is really one of the most unique and ambitious games I've ever played. The acting is top notch, the story is engrossing, and the gameplay is unique. There's a truly impressive amount of content to be discovered. It's a riveting experience unlike almost any other game. Finding a new clip is extremely satisfying and unraveling the mystery will throw you through so many different emotions. This game definitely isn't for the prude or faint of heart, but if you're willing, this is absolutely worth a playthrough. The non-linear storytelling works very well with the mystery format. It truly does feel like you're unwinding a lost piece of history. One of my favorite elements (although admittedly a minor thing and not something that everyone would appreciate) is the use of different cameras and editing techniques within each of the Marissa's films. It really gives each of the movies a unique feel and does a good job of grounding them in the time period in which they were supposedly produced. Overall, I can see why some people might not appreciate this game (specifically if you're prudish/uncomfortable with nudity --although this is DEFINITELY NOT pornography, like some other reviews have suggested). Whether or not you appreciate this game will probably come down to the individual, although I have a feeling that this will be a cult classic for many, many years. This is an incredible experience for film, art, and mystery enthusiasts.. A unique and well-crafted experience that will provide a memorable thrill. The theme is a gradual revelation of the inner life of the cutest girl you never knew. Manon Gage gives a riveting performance as the mysterious Marissa Marcel; her wonderfully expressive face drew me in and charmed me at first. I won't talk about the rest for fear of spoiling your fun. Gameplay (best with X-Box controller) involves sorting through numerous film clips to develop Marissa's story and then a deeper dive into forces that drive her behavior in mysterious directions. It can be completed in ten hours or so if you know a few tricks: (1) read the intro and take notes; (2) rewind every clip before watching; (3) when the controller vibrates, be ready to fiddle with the left stick to access hidden content which is in every clip; (4) pay a lot of attention to hairstyles; (5) in each clip, select Marissa's face to open the next; (6) you know you're done when a certain somebody's face fills the whole screen. You can't sit back and enjoy the ride, but you won't soon forget this trip!. FMV games are a controversial lot due to their nature - is it a movie or a game? Immortality presents an interesting project with quite a large scope: you will experience, through rehearsals, behind the scenes snippets and actual recordings, three movies starring Marissa Marcel, an actress whose films never released. Although it takes some time to get going, you'll quickly get into rhythm as you search additional clips and piece together the secrets behind Ambrosio, Minsky and Two of Everything, three unique films with shocking and mysterious happenings.. I hated this game. I’m giving it 3 for presentation and a creative concept. It is not fun to play. It does not provide enough progression to keep you hooked. The gameplay loop is too random and repetitive. Not interactive enough. Also the scrub controls did not work well on a laptop touchpad.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I’m so shocked by This game, and I think I can’t find any astonishing experience like this from any other game. I will give it 10/10, a deserved masterpiece which recommended to art and movie lovers.. Awful, and to call this a 'game' is stretching the truth. And to call this a 'game' is stretching the truth, it's an interactive movie (and not a very good one). Avoid.. I love this game. The mistery, the movies, the characters, everything absorbed me and obsessed me. Recording 3 full movies, extremely well-acted and with a great plot, just as the backdrop of a bigger mistery is mindblowing.. The whole thing is disgusting. An incredibly primitive community is presented on the screen. Actors? Maybe from porn movies. The product looks like a primitive, mediocre ""movies"" for fans of trivial Netflix series and other cesspools. Awful.. I have one big problem with this game. It lacks meaningful interactivity. I was able to see credits roll in under 2 hours by just clicking on random things and scrubbing through videos without paying attention to anything. This game does not have enough skill checks to make you think your way through the game and solve it. You can literally ""beat"" the game without understanding anything. It just fell flat for me.. Really good story and gets really creepy around halfway into the game, not a lot of gameplay so if u come in looking for a lot of gameplay then it's not for you. WARNING: THIS IS NOT A VIDEOGAME NOR A INTERACTIVE COMMERCIAL MOVIE. Can't even say if this is a movie. Well maybe technically? I don't know. Once defined this , I could say if you expect something related to obamaflix blackhomo crap streaming something its not the case either. This is more a concept ,artcinema, performance, theater, related. Is like a bunch of very short films just related to the main actress somehow that varies from boring to odd to eerie ,with a lot of symbolism. The interaction with this short firms is quite odd too and lead to anothers and cannot be accessed in a main menu or something. But this is a part of the whole experience. This is not for everybody besides art lovers , actor and director students and related. I cannot rate this production as Im not an expert in the area so I just throw a 7 just giving the benefit of their work.. The acting done by the cast is top notch and really sells the experience, but the gameplay mechanics itself hinders it from truly shining. You'd be hard pressed unraveling the full mystery without resorting to clicking on random faces and objects just to progress. It's a shame how finicky the system for searching for new clips can be, because there really is something good here.. a masterpiece **** from the legendary FMV games studio. I still remember all of their games and I will remember this game forever the mystery is just incredible and unexpected. Took awhile to get into but this game is amazing. Really enjoying it as a good chill game.","""her story"" is an excellent game in a genre which struggles to produce excellent games . the genre it's in struggles to invest the player personally as it's much closer to a movie than to a videogame . if you can be patient with it to figure it out I’d recommend it ."
736.Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Pack,"I have hard time understanding why does this even exist. Seriously what the hell is this?. A very fun DLC to Red Dead Redemption the zombie killing is incredibly fun as well as liberating towns from the undead it's incredibly easy to aim on console with a controller as well which just adds a nice bit to it especially since I don't consistently use controllers that often this game is very fun and I like it a lot! The only thing I don't like about this is the bugs there's a few game breaking bugs and some non game breaking bugs the only non game breaking ones I've found is just the horse not really following your movement correctly and if there's a lot of fire around your game WILL lag pretty heavily. The game breaking bugs though are GAME BREAKING like you can't even finish some missions like for example if you destroy the coffins at a graveyard too fast the game will infinitely spawn zombies with no head or arms and you can't liberate the graveyard.. This dlc contains everything that was good about rdr 1, however the dlc was full of bugs that made it very discouraging to continue playing. due to so many problems the game should be free to install and not be sold as a game, that's why rating 7. A really good DLC, but critical bugs that block progress ruin all the joy and experience. Unfortunately, I can only give it a 2.. Great.. Best western zombies game ever ! (Better than the 2nd RDR). Undead Nightmare masterfully combines horror and Halloween aesthetics to create a thrilling and memorable gaming experience. It's a must-play for those seeking a unique and spooky take on an already outstanding game, making it a perfect Halloween gaming adventure.. it was very dumb idea to turn RDR to a horror game , I didn't like it , it was a boring game. Virtually unplayable. I can't even get halfway through the game without it locking up because of too many zombies being spawned. Can't get anything done with this game anymore. Gave up on it like 4 hours into it. Shame because I was loving it up until that point. Play the base game, avoid this dlc like the plague.. Cowboys versus zombies in this stand alone expansion pack for the six gun version of Grand Theft Auto. Even more limited in scope and repetitive than the original Red Dead Redemption, but it is quite good fun for a while...until you realise that it's exactly the same all the way through. The Game Of The Year version of Red Dead Redemption features this game in its entirety so it's difficult to recommend buying it in its own right.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. I’m so happy to see him again, but I didn’t think in that way. The zombie horse is amazing.. The expansion is not as long as the one in gta iv, but it is worth it. It is one of the best video game expansions It is raw, sad and funny at the same time. Several characters return and new ones as good as these. New music, new horses, zombie animals, new online modes, new clothes, new events, trophies or achievements are added, and you must save the towns, if they attack them and you don't go, you lose them forever.. Everything about this game is great, except for the game-breaking glitches.. This Dlc Is Amazing , A New Story And Very Good For A Dlc,Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare Is One Of The Best Dlc I Have Played. Just finished Red Dead Redemption and absolutely loved it. Then I started the Undead Nightmare DLC. This is amazing. a totally new story, same characters, alternate reality from the original story. make sure you 've played the main campaign first, as Undead Nightmare will give you some spoilers for the main game.. How the hell can they leave this completely unplayable? The DLC is completely riddled with gamebreaking bugs. The DLC doesn't even look like it would have been any good without the bugs. This has got to be the most disappointed I have ever been with a game after how great the core game was.. Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Pack is as phenomenal as its base game. The story, characters, and gameplay are all top-notch. There are, however, way too many bugs.. Very fun, but not as good as the original PROS -Great graphics -good story - fun combat CONS -None .. Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare DLC Done Right, but gameplay done wrong. Undead Nightmare has John Marston setting out to stop a zombie apocalypse, The setup is great, zombies are attack your home, you run out into town to see it’s been over run, you’re given a torch and told to go cleanse a graveyard, its feels epic and like your are in for an insane zombie slaying adventure. That’s not what you get though. My favorite part of undead nightmare is its mythical creatures, there are Sasquatch that roam the forest and apocalyptic horses you can break and take for your own all with their own special perks. War for example can catch enemies on fire with contact. This however is really the only good the DLC has to offer. The thing Undead Nightmare does right is that it does feel like its own game, it isn’t just add on, it’s something new and can stand on its own. This isn’t cover based shooting like in red dead redemption though, this is survival based shooting. But Undead Nightmare does an absolutely horrible job with game progression and level design. Undead nightmare is massively repetitive. When you get to a town you have to rid it of all zombies so you can sleep there and restock ammo, at first this is fun slaying a hoard of zombies to reclaim a town, but after about the 3rd town it’s no longer fun and becomes grindy. Zombies take forever to kill no matter what weapon outside of the blunderbuss you use excluding head shots, making gameplay unsatisfying. And you do a lot of zombie cleanup both in towns and in cemeteries. The story has you cleaning cemetery after cemetery, town after town, it gets boring fast. The game also does a horrible job with story progression. I’m not sure if main missions are bugged out or not, but unlike in Red Dead Redemption, some story missions won’t unlock until you’ve done a certain side mission which quite frankly makes no sense… Why not just make every mission a main mission if you’re going to force me to play them anyway. There are so many side missions I didn’t care about doing such as getting a zombie for a movie, but if I wanted to continue the story I had to, and having to do side missions isn’t really the part that bugs me, the part that bugs me is that you aren’t told to do them.. Which gives you a panicked feeling of maybe the game is broken because it doesn’t feel like you’d need to do a meaningless mission to continue. The concept of undead nightmare is great, and the first couple hours are mesmerizing, but the weapons aren’t over powering enough to make this survival style of gameplay satisfying and by hour 2 of 6, if not earlier, you’re just ready for this undead nightmare to be over. For What it is Action Adventure Survival Horror Game 7.5/10 Overall 7.5/10. Let's start whit the singleplayer it **** everything **** about it the AI the story the side-missions,the random encouters,the gameplay and the most of all the ****'s all just some **** excuse for more DLC could they not have planned it out better?And the challenges just piss you of it's only worth buying it if you want all the multiplayer DLC and a new zombies mode that is only fun until level 10 when all the zombies have 100000 health **** world in the singleplayer is just boring and dark nothing is fun everybody is just moaning,screaming and crying while you kill everyone it's just killing or getting something to someone.John bring me that you just would like to cut their heads **** the multiplayer is another thing it's much more fun to with all the new maps,guns,gang hidouts,charactres,missions **** you want this dlc it's only worth buying for the multiplayer and if you want a good game buy red dead redemption instead.. I love this pack, it is probably the best zombie ""game"" I have played, hell I play this more than the main game haha. This pack is defiantly worth buying, even if you don't like the whole zombie apocalypse stories.. Undead Nightmare is western zombie bloodbath, but is it a fun add-on for the awesome Red Dead Redemption? Its a great dlc for zombie lovers and for RDR lovers! The whole story is about 5-6 hours long witch is great for 800 microsoft points. The story is alright, but its not the point of the game. Music and gameplay are fantastic. What I love most about it is the things you can do witch you can't do in RDR, like hunting for bigfoots, clearing towns and gravyards of the undead. One real big problem is the new fustrating glitches. One when I was ready to watch a cut scene and all I see is a black screen with people talking, very annoying. Now multiplayer wise, we got this survival mod witch you must survive eaves and waves of undead hordes of zombies, sometimes even tense cand great game mode. Overall great dlc with aglitches stoping it from being amazing. Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare 8.7/10. BEST DLC besides Walking Dead, and it is only 800 MSP. This is just perfect... the perfect DLC for the perfect game! I had really a ot fun with it, singleplayer or multiplayer does not matter - it is just so good and you will be addicted hours to it. ROCKSTAR ROCKS!. Red dead redemption is an awesome game, but this undead nightmare is just a pack of expansion that should be able to download for free and not to resell as another game, the game is good but is the same places, same people, same game, just with a few new toys, missions and enemies that just get boring after a few hours, so I feel I paid twice for one game.. This game is insanely fun, and the best DLC I've ever bought in my entire life. You spend a lot of time running around saving towns and doing various missions. Each mission is super fun and always makes the story advance. Saving towns maybe can get a little repetitive, but every now and then you'll hit a pretty hard town that will have you on the edge of your seat and having a lot of fun. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the voice acting and mouth syncing is superb, although some of the sound effects could use some work. My last complaint is the ending seemed a little flat and the last level was extremely easy. There are a lot of hilarious side quests too, that in my opinion are a lot more fun than the side quests in the original game. The flaws of this game are too few and far between to do a lot to hinder this game, it was a fantastic play and I enjoyed it a lot.. Undead Nightmare changes what you come to expect from DLC. In changing the entire game world, UN creates a fully-fledged alternate story that makes great use of existing characters by seeing what effect this strange situation would have on their lives. New side missions are also added along with new multiplayer modes. The value on offer here is incredible and well worth it.. This add on content is excellent, especially for the low price. A brand new campaign, and new multiplayer modes and characters. With this content, expect the same map, but with zombies. There is also a 4 player co-op, where you fight endless waves of zombies. Although the zombie combat can get a bit repetitive, there is much to do that will satisfy your needs for fun. I recommend this pack to anyone who loves Red Dead Redemption.. This is a DLC? Are you sure? Am I sure? Because I don't remember a DLC this awesome. I still can't believe it's only Â£6.50 on Xbox Live. When I was playing this, I thought it was a full game. This is pretty much the best DLC to be ever released yet. It's so lengthy and so packed with hours and hours of fun that it is completely unbelievable that this amazing game is a DLC. The story, from what I've played was as good and compelling as the original and even though I am not keen on zombie games, I'd never had so much fun shooting zombies. Again, best DLC ever made.. It was fine but a bit too expensive if you ask me. Boring and repetitive mission objectives and its over rather quickly as well. If you really love RDR then you will enjoy it but other then that, I would pass on it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. R* is the DLC king of games. Every dlc has as much effort and focus put into it as the retail game. This is no exception. The game looks gorgeous, and who doesnt like killing zombies?. This is one of the best zombie games i've ever played. 800 Microsoft points get's you a lot with this pack. Plus everytime you get out of a saved city, the landscape becomes dreary, nightmare-ish, and dark. Landscape=AWESOME Gameplay= Spot on! Atmosphere= GREAT! Rockstar made this also seem like a very cheesy horror movie.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Born/created in a time when Zombies were taking over the gaming community, I found Undead Nightmare to be the cream of the crop. I really enjoyed this but the only reason why I found this only semi appealing is because nearly 1/4th of the way through the actual story, I found a way to 'cheat' my way through the game. Despite that, 'cheat' I realized the game does have some great length of difficulty especially on hard.. I can barely believe that this is just DLC. Undead Nightmare is hilarious, fun and proof that the addition of zombies can make almost anything better.. Even though the game is very dark and creepy, it is still pretty awesome. I personally like zombie movies and games, but this is different. It is John Marston fighting zombies, which takes some time to get used to if you've played the first game. But if you like creepy and dark video games and like Read Dead Redemption, this is the game for you.. 10/10 This is what DLC should be! No one does it better then Rockstar and hey.....zombies! Who can argue with Red Dead with zombies??? No one I tell you!. Zombies have invaded many titles over the years, and now they've invaded the world of Red Dead Redemption, just like Borderlands The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, this is a downloadable add-on, and offers a lot of bang for your buck pricing at $10 or 800 Microsoft points depending on your system of choice, it's a lot of fun, and offers a lot of play time, and some cool multiplayer modes, my only complaints are that the story behind it all is incredibly lame, and it gets really repetitive with all your quests being just fetch quests or clearing out graveyards, so even though it's got it's flaws the charm of Red Dead Redemption and Zombies ultimately make this a great DLC, the only reason I can find not to buy this is if you just don't like Red Dead Redemption or Zombies, a great DLC.. Rockstar's DLC for one of 2010's top games is one of the best DLC I have ever played on any system. For the $10 I spent on this DLC, I got 12 hours of single player fun and additional multiplayer fun if you choose to go online. The story is cheesy, but in a good way, Rockstar had fun with this title as it manages to include zombies, unicorns, and pokes twisted fun at possible reasons for this zombie apocalypse. The missions are fun and there are plenty of challenges and side quests to keep you entertained. The graphics are just as Red Dead Redemption, just with new enemies, creatures, and the towns are usually in flames now. The music and voice acting are top notch in the DLC, and I only experienced one minor glitch, but it didn't hinder my experience in the slightest. If you so choose, Rockstar has also included a new mode for online that pits you and your friends against oncoming horde waves of zombies, with the difficulty increasing as you go. The multiplayer is just as fun as the campaign, which if you don't do the sidequest or challenges will last probably around 6-7 hours. If you are expecting a serious game about John Marston, you will be disappointed. But if enjoy the cheesiness Rockstar throws at you and can sit back and laugh at the twisted dialogue, then there should be no reason to pass up on this great deal.. This is the best dlc I ever purchased. For $10 I have an unlimited time cutting down zombies. Who doesn't enjoy that? It's like a whole new game. The change in the artwork atmosphere and music was spot on to give it that horror feel. Limited ammo while your keeping back the undead really makes it an intensive game experience. I've been burned on dlc before, but this one is definitly worth it and more.. This expansion pack is like getting a whole new game. It's completely seperate from the main game. There is also the addition of new weapons, and zombies lot's of zombies. Awesome!!. This is a great add-on to a spectacular game that introduces some fun Halloween, zombie-themed humor. It's an interesting twist to the story and it's pretty enjoyable both in the single and multiplayer fronts, though I found the single player to be a touch repetitive. That said, it's an excellent way to spend a few hours. And it's zombies, who can hate on zombies?. The Undead Package add another side to the whole Red Dead Redemption theme. The Story alone for Undead is brilliant despite being a bit intense at times. It gives you another chance to play with one of my favourite game characters, John Marston. The Story is around 6 hours long roughly around the same as the main Campaign in Black Ops. So for an Add on it really give you some more time on this great game. The online in my opinon is better than the classic one. Its brilliant fun to take on a horde of zombies with your mates. A definet must have for any kind or Red Dead fan. And at only 800 microsoft points which is about Â£8 so a fantastic bargin for the Best Add on of the year so far.. This is one of the best Zombie DLC packs ever made, this is the only DLC pack rockstar have released and they did extremely well for a first time. The DLC pack Undead Nightmare has the sandbox layout like the orgininal, They made the atmosphere perfect along with Wondering zombies and Special infected, undead animals such as bears, cougers, birds, and horses etc, Throughout the game you also have dead towns, burning buildings and people screaming for your help while you pass and splatter the zombies brains all over the muddy ground. The story begins at your home in the Northern part, your wife and son get bitten by a zombie. you tie your family to the bed and set off the see if you can find a cure to this plague. you head straight to blackwater and start to burn coffins to cleanse the earth, after hearing Hennigans Stead is under attack by the undead, after finishing business there, you head to Armadillo and fix things there, and head to Mexico etc. Rockstar have also given people a secret suprise as in The Four Horses Of The Apocalyse. I can conclude that this DLC pack is well worth the money, it is a little buggy though, but either system will fix this in time.. One of the best single player DLC's I've ever played. For 800 MS points (a measly $10), you get a brand new adventure complete with story missions, stranger missions, weapons, challenges, outfits, mounts, multiplayer characters and 2 new online modes (Undead Overrun and Land Grab). The story missions won't take you very long to finish, but gaining 100% completion will take well over 11 hours. The single player adventure makes many witty references to the main game and throws in some truly humorous cut scenes. Undead Overrun is probably the most addicting multiplayer mode in the game and it can become insanely difficult in the later waves. The bang for your buck factor is astronomical. This DLC contains more content than most $60 games do today. Download ****!! WARNING: I highly recommend finishing the main game before even starting Undead Nightmare..many important plot points are used in the DLC and you WILL be spoiled if you decide to play the add-on first.. You can't go wrong when you place the entertaining undead into the stunning Red Dead Redemption scenery! Can you? Combining a great and beautiful free roam experience with the horror genre has resulted in something very fine indeed! Plenty of action for both single player and on-line means you are getting your money's worth as this is without question one of, if not the most, the best value DLC expansions this year! With glory though comes some negative points, you can expect some repetitive tasks and a lot of running around slaving for people - Fine, if you are into that sort of thing. However, this is overlooked by the fact that the further the ""story"" uncovers, less and less makes sense...Perhaps I was expecting too much realism from a game with mythical creatures! In conclusion, Although it doesn't make the best sense at time, its still a great fun and a bargain at that. Definitely a must for the red dead fan-base!!!. Undead Nightmare picks up where Red Dead Redemption ended (sans the last few missions obviously). Awesome story, music and theme. Even though it can be cheesy and insane at times, this is how DLC should be made, 800 MS points for a full-length, action-packed gaming experience.. This expansion came at the best possible time. It adds so much to the game for such a minimal price, standing as the antithesis to Fallout: New Vegas. Where New Vegas charges $60 for a game that is almost identical to Fallout 3 (except with glitches), Rockstar is charging $10 for a new, separate campaign filled with new enemy types, music, atmospheric effects, weapons, modes and more. I know it's kind of crappy to knock one game in favor of another, but Rockstar clearly respects gamers in a way that most others do not: financially.. This is one of the best DLC ever ! It has everything; from a story mode wide and long; to an addictive multiplayer mode so far so good, Rockstar Games really know what they want their fans.. Multiplayer Review - So far so good. If you like tearing zombies down with your friends and waves with increasing difficulty, you should get his DLC, im just talking about the multiplayer part since I have not played the single player campaing. I bought this game 3 weeks ago and this DLC came in the nick of time. Didn't hesitate to get the undead pack wich includes all the dlc. I got to wave 26 with 3 other online players, the dificulty till wave 15 was ok, after that I could sense how hard it was to kill even the normal zombies (there are 4 types of zombies) at wave 26 I found myselft throwing dinamite like crazy to get them off me and running and yelling at my room like a 13 year old little girl (which I'm not lol). I am only reviewing the multiplayer and will surely update this review when I play the single player experience. its fun to free roam as a zombie grunting at people...",the zombie killing is a very fun DLC to red dead redemption the zombie killing . it's incredibly easy to aim on console with a controller as well which just adds a nice bit to it . the game breaking bugs are GAME BREAKING like you can't even finish some missions .
737.Marvel's Spider-Man,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game. Story was well written with good pacing and the main story lines never really got boring. Side missions became repetitive along with many of the animations, such as car stops. But overall, very good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best narrative driven games I have played. This was a revelation for the playstation and the gameplay is light and fun with awsome boss fights. cool game as for me. Simple plot but its also ok. Cool gameplay and open world. 2 part is better than first but its good also. I think it only have one bad thing it's the story it's very easy to expect the actions and what will happ. One of the first few games I got with my PS4 and one I certainly enjoyed as it has a thrilling and engaging gameplay making it more enjoyable to explore and play.. A game that made me love Spider-Man even more, this game entertained me and entertained me for hours, the city is beautiful, the story is very good and it's incredible to walk around the city as Spider-Man.. As i write this review i want to make it perfectly clear i have a lot of bias toward this game. read the rest for my very biased review. This game was my first game i ever got on PlayStation 4 as i could image a lot of others who's first console was a PlayStation. You boot on the console you put your Marvel Spider-Man disk you load in and now your in NYC. Graphics gorgeous. Controls perfect. literally peak gaming.. Loved the game from beginning to end. The swinging the soundtrack the story everything. The true spider man game in a decade.. 9.4/10. From web slinging around the city, to acrobatically punching, kicking, and webbing up thugs, this game is fantastic and makes you feel so much like spiderman. The stealth levels where you aren't Spider-Man are horrendously boring, but man the rest of the game is amazing.. this game is very special for a lot of people, including me. in my view, this game adapts the super-hero from marvel comics like never before, with great message, great boss fights, and a masterpieces were made on the storytelling.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the best Spider-Man game, and with amazing villains, near perfect gamplay, an amazing story, check this out on pc, ps4 and ps5. A fun Spider-Man game that does the character and universe justice. It is hands down, one of the best superhero video games made.. Love this game and is honestly a great Spider-Man story. I think the writers fully understand the character and don’t disrespect him or any other character in the game. Love the gameplay and doesn’t feel as repetitive as Spider-Man 2. I think the music and traversal along with it is great and super fun to just epically go around New York.. An amazing power fantasy game. The controls are tight, the gameplay is fun and challenging, but not really difficult. The story is a good remake of the Spider-verse. The only issue that I had with the game was the handful of stealth missions, but even those were pretty short and well spaced.. Best Spider-Man's game. Everytime dynamic never boring and really dramatic.. I am a big fun of Spidey and the game is just amazing. Bringing a lot of villians in just one game was great. A brand new great story. Graphics are amazing and New York is full of things to do. Perfect, worth it. A marvelous game! The perfect balance between addictively fun gameplay and a story full of trills and chills, twists and turns that make you care about the man behind the mask. Peter Parker thanks to the combined efforts of Yuri Lowenthal (Voice actor) and John Bubniak (Facial Capture) achieve a protagonist that overflows with charisma and personality. The best adaptation of New York City put into a video game, 45 FREE SUITS! Addictive photo mode, Annoying MJ missions. Oh god, the soundtrack by John Paesano makes you feel like a larger than life hero. This title is definitely one of the three best superheroes of all time.. The story and Arkham like combat system stand the test of time. Yuri Lowenthal trumps other voice actors who took on the role and balances the Peter Park and Spider-Man aspects of the character. The game allows you to approach missions in both stealth or direct fashions with gadgets that allow diversity in combat scenarios. The number one thing this game needed to get right was the web slinging and they nailed it. The open world is filled with tons to do and you'll never fast travel while doing it. This game host many iconic Spider-Man villains and my only critique is I with that each villains had there own boss fight instead of it being grouped in teams of 2 but that won't take you out of the experience.. Sometimes gameplay mechanics when you web cross the city and trying to web in to wall it just anoying because camera targeting is slow moving hard to target anything you want. Maybe it is skill bussines. But for me I cant do anything to better at it. A very good adaptation of the story of Peter Parker. The gameplay is somewhat boring but the story is very faithful to the nature of Peter’s life, which is tragic and heroic but somehow relatable.. gameThis is very I advise everyoneI play it while she isIt's worth its price.. Best game of the trilogy. Amazing story with a great ending. Only bad thing is that the world feels so empty after the main story. Highly recommended. Incredible game! (Masterpiece) | Marvel's Spider-Man | 100 Points (5 Stars) | Story 10P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 10P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. While not one of the greatest games in terms of gameplay,this game really made me appreciate playing as Spider-Man!. This game rips. Fluid and fun web-swinging, intuitive and exciting combat, great performances, neat original story, so many websuits to collect. Stealth sequences are unnecessary.. Spider-Man in an open-world game set in Manhattan is a fantastic experience. The story is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the cutting-edge graphics are simply stunning. It was a great experience to platinum the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I like this game a lot better than most spiderman game but spiderman 2 is better by a lot. The best Spider-Man game of all time! Best storytelling, good chemistry between the characters, and perfect immersion into the skin of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man!. This game was my favourite game oat until the sequel came out it has a an amazing story full of emotions highs and thrilling scenes the combat is amazing and very fun a must play game. easily would give this game a 10/10 but it lacked a bit in terms of keeping me hooked in the open world while trying to platinum i, it felt tedious asf to platinum but it was a great experience. great graphics, accurate story about PETER PARKER, nice gameplay but it gets boring after some time of playing, open world really tedious in some cases but still love the game. i highly reccomend playing loved every second of the story. Bland, boring and too many boring moments to want to even warrant finishing it. SUPER DISSAPOINTED. This game has handled the story that needs to be given very well, just like in the comics.. I bought this game because I really like Spider Man, and while I'm not a die-hard fan, I have my share of Amazing Spider-Man comics on my shelves. This insomniac's game gives me mixed feelings: On one hand, I like the gameplay and mechanics, it reminds me of a mix of Batman Arkham and Infamous. The webbing is incredible, the gadgets are fun to use, and the combat is very satisfying. New York is full of repetitive mission icons that I really enjoyed completing while wearing the different spider suits. On the other hand, I didn't like the insomniac-verse characters at all, an example was Mary Jane. Instead of a beautiful, charismatic red-haired tigress, she's just an unbearable, uglyfied (look at the beautiful motion capture actress) Mary Sue who imitates Lois Lane's lifestyle and treats Peter like trash, basically like any other woman. in this game, except good old aunt May. I also found the Miles/Mary Jane ""stealth"" missions horrible which ended in slow paced trial and error sections that I just wanted to finish as soon as possible. The story was pretty bland except for the last fight, which was epic and emotional. At least The 3 DLCs are good, they portray a slightly healthier relationship between Peter and MJ and were fun to play, although I think Sable's character was a total waste and the black cat costume shows how terrible and self-censored Western developers currently are. In short, a good and fun game with terrible characters.. this is by far one of the best superhero games i have ever played the story and villains are amazing the web shooting is stellar and the combat is great, aside from the MJ mission its a pretty perfect game. Everything good mid ass combat just spam square and triangle all the time will recommend for spider fans tho. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best superhero games ever made. Better than arkham? I don't know, you can decide that. Still an incredible game nonetheless? YES ABSOLUTELY YES! Please play this game as soon as you can. It's always fun to play and even with it's issues it's still one of the best games ever.. Graphics 9.9/10 - RT reflections and frame generation make this one of the best looking games I've ever played, just wish there was RT shadows as well. Gameplay 9/10 - Really fun combat but having to do specific side quests to level up your gear ****. Story 7/10 - The stuff with Dr Oc and Mr Negative is good but when the game forces you to play as Miles or MJ or do those dumb hacking games that's usually where I'd turn the game off. Overall 8/10 very fun combat, looks amazing with some annoying levels sprinkled in.. Amazing game, I only disliked the way of the cutscenes, could have been smoother.. An incredible game, but I think there could have been more stunt options during the web swing, which was already fixed in the second game, but I couldn't leave that out.. an incredible game in every aspect you can think of (story, voice acting, graphics, optimization, physics, etc.), I could only say that I felt that the combat was a little rough in some cases, just a little, which later was fixed in subsequent installments, that's why I give it a 9/10. The first one was better. This could have been a solid game if not for the rushed writing. There is also alot of woke propaganda shoved into the game. This was an amazing looking game where it was a joy to swing around and traverse through the city, but after a while the city grew dull and outside of the main story and a few side missions, many of the activities were boring and were extremely tedious. Good: The graphics and the city were absolutely stunning, with scores of cool outfits, a large array signature attacks and a solid main story. Bad: As nice as the city looks, it started to feel lifeless as most of the buildings are inaccessible and many of the streets and citizens walking around look and feel unvaried. There is also nothing spectacular about the combat, and my biggest criticism was that the side challenges were mostly boring and extremely repetitive: from chasing pigeons, to rounding up robbers on the streets to taking down enemy bases that mostly looked the same. The worst part was that things like the location of backpacks or discovering landmarks were shown on the map, which made discovering them unsatisfying and took some of the fun of exploring the city. All said, this game wasn't that bad but not great either. I would still recommend it to people who love Marvel and superhero's but I personally thought it was no more than mediocre.. Did not expect this to be as amazingly executed as it was, great story, world, objectives, moments, character and amazing gameplay that really feels like a translation of the character and is endlessly fun to swing around. Combat is satifying and varied, and story is superb, they pulled of sinsiter 6 so easily? its great to just jump in and go. a cool intro to miles and such a well executed vision. i would say open world still becomes a bit check list issues but its too fun to explore for that to be a huge issue. Awesome.. An exceptional foundation. Had some of the best traversal in any game for its time. Combat was top notch. Story was amazing.. An amazing game that captures the essence of Spider-Man. Despite some repetitiveness, it's incredibly enjoyable.. Good game with a decent story and average combat, mediocre open world. But the travelsal is good. I have finished nearly for 60% of the game and dont finish it Its not bad - cool graphics and universe bit its ordinary and boring I think its a bit overrtaed. Good game: very good story (better than a lot of movies) and the best control system.. Amazing Combat and traversal. Lots of fun for long time Spider-Man fans. Story takes a bit too long to wrap up but is well written.. Gameplay is the king here. It is just so damn fun to traverse through the city. I have never used the fast travel feature. Story is pretty good. Would be nice to have more boss fights.. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 9 Total: 8.50. I'm tired of repeating the same thing. Sony makes mediocre games in the open world. The fullness of the world is worse than in GTA 3. The city is absolutely dead.. This game changed what open world transportation's standards are for me this game's movement is incredible it had me playing for hours even after beating the game its amazing the writing is immaculate as well I cried when aunt may died and the city hall bombing is legitimately the greatest mission ever. In short if you have not played this game DO SO. This is how you make a game based on the most Iconic Marvel hero of all time. If you ever wanted to know what it's like being spider-man, this is your game.. Out all the greatest spider-man comics they could've pick to adapt they chose comics by dan slott. The guy that 100% backed the decision of spider-man selling his marriage to the devil. Insomniac doesn't deserve to have the rights to spider-man ip.. I love this game so much and I played it 1000 times to replay the storymode because it's so fun.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. This game is the best spider-man game from the combat to the story to the side content and it's a top tier Peter Parker story and the antagonist was almost perfect definetly worth it if you have a playstation or a pc and if you're a spider-man fan. this game is a pile of crap. Insomniac are a bunchof useless stupid morons. The gameplay is really bad, the camera is awfull... nothing works. Don not buy this turd. Honestly the majority of the time I don't think Spider Man media will be that good due the constant retelling of how he got his powers, but I think Insomniac really nailed the proper narrative for Spider-Man, especially as a game. Being caught in the middle of Spider-man's run with enemies, while at the same time introducing a new threat, left enough room to world build around spider man that you get an overall view of what this spiderman's universe is like. With plenty of context clues on what happens in universe along with a refreshing take on some older characters, like Miles and MJ's role, it makes for an interesting experience compared to other Spider Man media out there. Wrap it together with a decent combat system, and great mobility mechanic, Spider Man PS4 is kinda the best property Spider Man has been in till Spiderverse came around.. I love this game so much makes you feel like Spider-Man way better than Spider-Man imo the story is great.. This game has the feeling of two people, Sony's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man, which I usually know, and I really liked the feeling of being a completely third Spider-Man.While playing this game, I felt like I was Spider-Man, not Spider-Man in the movie. It was very good in this part, but I think the story was **** boss's impact wasn't that highI think the big problem was that it didn't support very high **** play time is short, but the appearance changes, and the story is about meeting the same enemiesI think the player will be bored because I forced to increase the play time.Also, there is almost no AI in the city, and the SNS function is just for physiognomyEven if I raised it, it would have been fun to make **** people who like Spider-Man and want to be a hero and spend money three timesIt would be nice to play.. Swinging feels good, missions are good, recommend it if you like spider-man movies or games.. Not only is it the greatest super hero game of all time, but it revolutionized the-best superhero of them all and. Unfortunately, the wrong people always take on the spider... There were good jokes, interesting ideas, but a bad, boring plot, poor technical implementation. Now the technical implementation is good, the gameplay is convenient, but the graphics are cartoonish for children, the whole approach is childish, even immoral and stupid. Spider, especially with Watanabe in the DLC, is just incredibly childish, terrible, shame. Octopus does not looks like Octopus. There is a lot of stupidity and monotony in the game - for skills you have to do a lot of same quests, the approach is very stupid and childish, boring. Spider is very slow, weak, even for an ordinary person. These people don’t even understand what they are doing, it’s terrible. Always same story. We've seen this Octavius 100 times already, obvious plot. This is a parody of a spider, like the movie Scary Movie, banter. Also, I'm surprised by directors today who also repeat the stupidity of comics books. After all, the spider has super strength, reaction and speed. Octavius doesn't, one hit and he's dead. And this stupidity is repeated endlessly. Scoundrels who need to be executed are released. Wrong approach, many mistakes. Even photorealistic graphics of The Last of Us won't save the game, because the plot good but the approach and direction and some moments are very bad. First of all, it's not just a graphic filter that could have been added in the settings, it's also the proportions of the environment and the game mechanics. Slow doesn't mean realistic. And because in addition to the graphics, the appearance of the characters doesn't match the original and doesn't fit at all, the characters are childish, especially Peter himself. And, in general, the direction, atmosphere, script. Well, I've already talked about the gameplay. I play such games on easy difficulty (Spider, GoW, shooters), and beat bosses with super power on maximum, so that it is plausible, spider will knock out ordinary people with one finger, perception explodes when he in such games with super strength like Hulk, like Superman should beat an ordinary person (Octopus is ordinary by the way) so many times that nothing would be left of these enemies. In cutscenes he can not allegedly dodge Miles's blow, can not save a person in the main story and in DLC with no reason, it's exactly like the joke with Fisk in the beginning when Spidey says ""do you know that I see you?!"" =)) (only one joke which is funny), behaves with Watanabe in DLC like a blockhead. The attitude towards very bad guys is as if they stole gum, they should be executed. In the second part they show how they are released and given a second chance, I am shocked, this is no longer just a childish approach, this is prohibited. ETC... I liked Spider-Man the Movie 2002 game. There are all the gameplay problems and the gameplay with graphics are outdated, but the cutscenes, the approach, walkthrough, missions are amazing. Turn on the intro cutscene, you will immediately feel a huge difference. And the gameplay, the city, the atmosphere, the feeling are impressive. The flight on the web is outdated, but impressive, you just need to combine it with convenience, make a speed button, etc. to do everything correctly. The color of the textures, the sun, plot and behavior of the characters, despite the outdated graphics, feels as it should. Web of Shadows, look how they showed the beginning and Cat-woman, the cutscenes and direction, hit, realistic swing and speed. Very interesting and mysterious opponents. Listen to the jokes in these games and in **** Dimension. The cartoon 1994, it can be done just as cool, realistic graphics don't contradict. Is a genius character and story and i have never, as far as i remember, said such words in reviews. But unfortunately Marvel is for kids. Spider-Man: Friends or Foes with console graphics. And the developers who don't make NG+ and give skills late are also mentally ****. Optimization is good, and i didn't find that DLSS spoils the quality of graphics in this game. Which is not surprising, because it is simple and cartoonish anyway... )In particular, it is unlikely that this rental game, you will launch it a second time, after finishing, if you finish it at **** PC everything is 4K 60fps, old games too. Constantly discounts, all games, including ""exclusives"". And on consoles 90%+ of games are in 30 fps with terrible graphics. On PC all remote solutions and huge screens. Yes, there is a big difference in the price, but consoles are changed every few years, in addition to other disadvantages. Plus, comparison is pointless, because you can compare something possible with something possible, but playing with such terrible graphics and in 30 fps is impossible, no matter how much the PC costs, console is not an option. And i repeat, if you are smart, you will not spend money on games on pc, because of constant discounts and without buying accounts don't (continuation on Gamespot, 5000 limit... First played this game at 11 now at 13 I have the platinum the ending is so heartbreaking definitely a driven story I'm such a huge spiderman fan and I loved this 10/10. loved the game i just keep wanting to play it great story one of the best games i ever played this is better than gta 1-5 i love the game. Great story, loved the ending it felt so real and meaningful, great story telling.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a really good game. I want to start out with the positives of this game. The games web slinging and parkour felt great it was nice and fluid and made traversal seem seamless. The combat felt great there were a variety of different things you could do to take down enemies throwing objects, shooting webs at their faces, slinging a web towards them to get closer to knock them out etc. The animations were also great. Now some of the negatives. The story I think the story could have been a bit more well put together I felt like there were some segments that could have been put off and some that should have been completely removed. There were also too many elements from the Batman Arkham series that made it lose some of its creativity. On top of this some of the Arkham elements were not as well implemented as Arkham had done them. The pacing towards the end of the game was not as well put together as I would have liked it to be. Overall, though this is a solid game and if you liked the Batman Arkham series, I am sure you will really like this game.. Oh my god,this game was absolutely amzing ! and it's my favourite spiderman and superhero game insonnia, thank you andim sorry that you lost the goty but really graphics are amzing , the combat is good , not only that even 3 dlcs with their own missions and the super fluid swinging and for how much nyc is detailed and alive may be the best 2018 videogame of all time what an incredibile game not only that but the thing that makes this soooo goooood is that you cab free roam and swing around the beatiful nyc city and the bossess are amzing not only that they are even detailed my favorite boss is hammerhead and from the 3 dlcs turf wars was my favourite.. Marvel Spider-Man is an amazing game from Insomniac Games they really nailed the character. (This is supposed to be my review since 2020). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After 100% completing this game, I can safely say it is a masterpiece of excellent gameplay, great story and fantastic graphics. The combat, web swinging, gadgets and sense of progression is expertly crafted and means you can’t help but always want to come back for more. The only criticism I have is that it can be very repetitive at times but there's enough variety to limit this somewhat. Overall an absolutely fantastic game.. ""Spider-Man"" for the PS4, developed by Insomniac Games, was truly amazing! There were just so many things I loved about it, from the storyline to the smooth gameplay to the traversal ooooh just so good. There were so many aspects that made this game the way it is today. 1. Engaging Storytelling: It featured a compelling and well-written storyline, capturing the essence of the Spider-Man character.2. Open-World New York City: The open-world New York City setting was incredibly detailed, providing an immersive environment to explore.3. Fluid Web-Swinging Mechanics: The game's web-swinging mechanics were praised for their realism and fluidity, making traversal through the city a joy.4. Combat System: The combat system was dynamic and satisfying, allowing players to seamlessly switch between attacks, gadgets, and acrobatics. 5. Attention to Detail: The game was filled with Easter eggs, references, and collectibles that paid homage to Spider-Man's extensive comic book history.6. Character Development: The game delved into the personal life of Peter Parker, adding depth to the character and his relationships.7. High-Quality Graphics: It showcased impressive visuals and graphics, especially on the PS4 Pro, which enhanced the overall experience.8. Variety of Activities: The game offered a wide range of activities and side missions, ensuring that players always had something to do.9. Emotional Impact: The game managed to evoke emotional responses from players, particularly in its narrative and character development. These elements combined to create a game that was not only fun to play but also stayed true to the essence of the Spider-Man character, making it a standout title on the PS4. Playing through this game over and over again made me feel like Spiderman, It really made me feel like a hero like a better man. My love for games was forever changed the day I purchased this game. In conclusion, I want to show my gratitude to the creators of Spiderman, and to the people who healed the world by giving them a 10/10. Spiderman will forever be my favorite game of all time.. Great game. Combat is the best since the Arkham trilogy, and rivals those games as the best superhero game ever. Story and graphics are both amazing. If you somehow haven't played this, get it NOW!. Spectacular gameplay and history with amazing graphics and a beautiful music! I beat this game four times, two of them at 100% and I definitely get the platinum trophy!. Its a very good game **** has great combat,a good story and amazing grapichs. The best thing about this game is the traversal(swinging),in other games you want to fast travel as much as possible,but in this game is diffrent you wanna do the opposite.I also like collecting backpacks,although its not the most exiting thing to do its still fun to see what collectibles you **** only reason Im giving this game a 8 is bc of the mj missions and the first few hours of the game were kinda boring,aside the intro,that was fun.. Finally finished for the 10th time this game. Had to play it again, because of the special trophy for NG+ and the Ultimate difficulty. This will always be a 10/10. Hope they don't f,ck the 2nd game. PS: They did. This will be forever the best Spider-Man game. Especially because the PS5 version they changed his face.... Nice and relaxing game but also soo overrated and overhyped 8.1⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣/10. Good game. Good story. Fun combat. Bad stealth missions. Good open world. Lots to do even after you beat the game. A solid open world game that makes you feel like a spider-man. Nothing innovative in the genre itself, just a great implementation of a Spiderman game. Good enough to be spiderman :D. It's not innovative, gameplay or story-wise... If you've played Treyarch's Spider-Man games, you might start comparing both eras... Audiovisually speaking, it's a spectacle.... Epic game, Insomniac really went all in for this hero, and they created a master-piece. Everything on this game is on point. Fully recommended. Spiderman 2018 Remastered offered thrilling combat akin to the Arkham series, and it remained enjoyable for about 30 hours. However, it became somewhat repetitive, with a shift towards achieving upgrades and achievements. The main storyline was fantastic, but the DLCs didn't quite match it. Visually stunning with great music, the standout feature was swinging through the city. Despite minor drawbacks like repetitive side missions, it was an overall great experience.. Joya de Playstation y imsomniac games…. Until the sequels, this was the best spider man game out there. Swinging feeld very smooth, Combat flows well, the story is good, and it's an overall job well done by Insomniac.. One of the greatest games that I've ever played. The open world is beautiful. Flying on the web through the city brings a feeling of satisfaction. The story is better than latest movies about Spider-Man. But the game has also a boring parts, such as a gameplay for Marry Jane or Miles. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. much harder work insomiac put in compared to the latest game. Absolutely phenomenal game. Bit late to the party but completely blown away by how fun and what a treat this game was to play. A game that came out more than 5 years ago is more graphically impressive, fluid and engaging than anything I've played in recent memory. I've no nostalgia for Spider-Man games, and anyone that I did manage to play (bar the PS1 game) I often found combat and web navigation awkward, clunky and unresponsive. But Insomniac hit the ball out of the park with this effort. Beautiful stuff.. One of the best games about Spider-Man, with bad secondary missions, but with a really good main story. Best game that ever been made great story great gameplay. One of the best games about Spider-Man, which I completed 3 times. Flying on the web, battles, additional tasks are all at a high level.. Since the original PlayStation 4 release, this video game has seen a remaster and an upgrade for the PlayStation 5. It has also received a set of downloadable content named The City That Never Sleeps, a spin-off named Spider-Man: Miles Morales and a sequel named Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man fans will have no difficulty when it comes to finding a great video game to play. All of the choices are good ones, but picking up the PlayStation 5 versions are the best looking.. This is the best Spider Man game I've ever played at the time, great story, great soundtrack, villains and Suits.. i am a such a big fan of spider-man, probably spiderman fans might love this game because this game has very good story and good combat style and using webs is very enjoyable. A very wonderful game, but it suffers from the problem of boring repetition in foreign missions. The reason i bought a PS4. The game is very good, I can often go there just to relax. A short but intense plot, despite the fact that the plot can be completed in 8 hours, it can be felt in 15 hours. Cons - grind to get platinum. Pros - music, gameplay, characters, graphics. The traversal is a poor rip-off from the Spiderman 2 movie game,but it lacks the wide range of **** stealth was copied from the Arkham games, but it's clunky as hell. There are only a few types of side quests, ",great game. Story was well written with good pacing and the main story lines never really got boring . gameplay is light and fun with awsome boss fights . game adapts the super-hero from marvel comics like never before .
738.Pokemon Moon,"Not crazy. That's what came to mind once I'd beaten the League for the first time. The game is cool but it's night and day with Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire being very good. The game is slow, the cinematics are horrible, Tili I hate you with your lame robotic facial expressions, the teacher makes us feel like he wants to have sex with our mother. An average game that, unlike its predecessors, isn't a must-have for the 3DS.. Good story for gamefreaks standard. Many cool pokemon designs. Z-power was a bit boring. Kahunas and trials were a cool twist from the old gyms. Many new aspects of this pokemon game changed what was nice in previous generations and made it SLIGHTLY worse, removing gyms for instance. Generally it was just average game. Nothing exciting.. + Actual Character Development+ Best Pokemon Story to date+ Lillie+ Aesthetics / mechanics of the pokemon battle menus and scenes have improved+ Trial system makes each island challenge new and exciting+ Team Skull~ Z moves are unneeded, yet balanced~ Alola Formes make certain pokemon relevant again~ Gen 1 bias~ Rotom talks a lot- Too much handholding from several different ways- Pokemon Picture system is bare minimum- Beginning of the game is a horrible turn off- SOS system makes catching / random battles more than a chore.- Game seems to lag with more pokemon animated on older 3DS. Why is this game so bad? Like, XY wasn't great, but THIS? Why is this so terrible? I'm honestly shocked. It's slow, boring, filled to the brim with boring-ass dialogue that makes up like 30% of the game, the most boring Pokemon fights ever and a mostly forgettable soundtrack (although a few songs are good). Not a half bad Pokemon lineup, a few good songs, and the concept of the Ultra Beasts is cool. Those were all the positives. 3/10, if you want to replay all the Pokemon games, skip this one.. What fun this game is able to tease out of its innovations to the pokemon formula is stifled by lack of difficulty and extensive tutorials. Ultimately for all of its changes, it feels a bit like the game is jumping the shark. An ultimately forgettable pokemon experience.. This game was the first to introduce big ass variants of pokemon, and I respect that.. only ever finished 2 games ever skylanders swap force and pokemon moon. one of the best pokemon and overall games I have played in a looong time. Lusamine is such a pretty and beautiful lady, I wish Hawaiian people were real.. This is my least favourite Pokémon game. The amount of times you are forced to stop and talk to some NPC I dont care about is ridiculous.. SuMo is one of my favorite Pokemon games of all time. After 20 years Pokemon finally changed their formula. There are many quality of life improvements, as well as bigger changes such as the replacement of gyms for the island challenge. More importantly than that, though, is the massive narrative shift from previous Pokemon games. The plot really takes center stage in SuMo (and later USUM), rather than it being just another factor on our journey to championship as it has been in most previous Pokemon games. The plot is interesting, the *characters* are interesting. It's no longer a story of you and your lackeys who sometimes hassle you for Pokemon battles at random points in the game - it's now a story of you and your friends. Your companions and rivals are crucial to the story - they're characters with motivations and backstories and personalities and development the likes of which have never been done in a Pokemon game before or after. You can sympathize with almost every character. The game takes a much darker tonal shift in comparison to previous games. There's themes of abuse and manipulation, mind control and possession, there are scenes that I found genuinely disturbing at 17 years old.. 42/100 Pokémon Moon will take its player to the flourishing Alola region, where upbeat, exotic tunes beautifully clash with more boisterous, violent electronic pieces, just as the game's tropical, traditional tribal setting clashes with the futuristic, sci-fi elements of its plot. Speaking of narrative, unlike XY, Pokémon Moon actually offers one of the best storylines in the series, more intimate than usual as it focuses on the struggles of a troubled family and the more marginalized members of society, with simple but endearing, well crafted character development. Sadly, this focus on the story frequently comes at the expense of exploration, halted and steered by narrative developments annoyingly often. Generally speaking exploration is one of the game's worst aspects, because as much as the locations are gorgeous and full of charm, the Level Design is for the most part dull and linear with laughably easy puzzles. In gameplay, Pokémon Moon introduces a new battle gimmick, Z Moves. These are mechanically way more significant than Megavolutions as they aren't exclusive of only some creatures, but they're just as frivolous and inconsequential since they provide very little change to the fun but extremely repetitive core battle gameplay. Fortunately, even if the challenge is generally tame, it can be surprisingly demanding with certain bosses, requiring great flexibility and strategy. On top of this, the Pokémon petting and customization features from XY make a return, greatly enhancing immersion.. Many people complain about how pokemon games just re-use the same formula and this one does change it somewhat but personally I didn't like the lack of gyms.. very underappreciated entry, pushing more into jrpg territory with proper story and characters was a good direction for the franchise.. One of the best generations by far, it has a spectacular story and an excellent competitive scene.. Underrated Pokemon game, it's one of the first fully 3D traditional Pokemon games and it was done on the Nintendo 3Ds. Granted the first 3D traditional pokemon game was X and Y but that was done with chibi models, while Sun and Moon did full sized models and worlds. While too easy for a lot of us, it introduced a lot of brand new stuff to the franchise with a fresh new story with interesting characters and villians (Which ultra later got rid of cause lmao). I think people were giving this more hate than it should've gotten, yes it did got rid of a lot of legacy content but it justified it with the quality and new additions. Not perfect but a Pokemon game with good additions. started playing pokemon back in gen 2. The fact that a level 10 pokemon with 5 health can't be caught because it continuously summons other pokemon is a game-breaking mechanic. This has happened not once but five times in a single play-through. if your core mechanics don't work everything else literal doesn't matter.. I thought it was pretty good for the most part. The pokemon games have definitely gotten too caught up in a formula, though, and it wasn't particularly original. It's main attempt at originality was the Z-moves, which just seem lazily done, and unlike mega-evolution, don't add much to the story. The post game of completing the rest of my Alola pokedex was definitely fun, though. I wish the story was more interesting too. Nonetheless, it was still pretty fun. I liked the new characters for the most part.. The best Pokémon game in the franchise for now. Story is good (the best one for now, with even some little interesting plot twists for the first time), difficulty and level curve is great (and even kinda hard in some parts!), characters are charismatic and less flat than previous generations, music is outstanding (as always), Pokémon designs are great, there are kind of boss battles, real side-quest, is a bit innovative for the first time in forever... This has to be the best Pokémon game to date. It was definitely the step in the right direction, but then they came with Sword and Shield.... While the game does have a very annoying slow start and the story is kind of unsatisfying, this game definitely sticks out in the Pokemon series for being easily the most unique, and it payed off.. I like confidence and changes, but in this case it did not pay off. Way to much dialogue and the trials just fell boring. The worst title in the series so far.. At the time of release it was the worst iteration of Pokémon to date and it killed by interest in the series. The world design is poor with no sense of exploration, each route is a windy corridor. The puzzles/challenges in the trials are never actual puzzles. The towns are so bare of features that there isn't a reason to return to any of them. The music is irritating. The NPC control where you can go so heavily that it doesn't feel like an adventure, but a tightly controlled tour. The difficulty comes from the enemy Pokémon being damage sponges or from wild Pokémon endlessly summoning each other.. It's a different pokemon format that goes away from the traditional way. Also, the game feels short for a Pokemon game, add to it the difficulty is lacking. In the end, for new owners this is a solid P.game for previous players its an easy game.. Let's remember and compare Sun and Moon to SWSH. Because Sun and Moon is far less hand holdy than Sword and Shield, because the story is the best Pokémon has made so far, because this game allowed you to turn off the exp share and enjoy a good difficulty, because this game had much more postgame... Well... Sun and Moon are one of the best game of this franchise, let's not forget that. This game is underrated just because is not old enough yet.. Pokémon Moon is the step in the right direction we needed after the painfully mediocre X and Y The story is actually engaging, there may be too many cutscenes for some but I for one loved the more story focused experience of Moon. Z moves are not as good as Mega Evolutions but they are alright. The island challenge was a good change of pace from the gym system (even though I love the gym system) The game wasn’t a total cakewalk, obviously not super difficult because it’s Pokémon but it’s definitely not X and Y easy Hau and Lillie make for friendly rivals that actually work (unlike the horrible rivals in X and Y) My main man Grimsley shows up at one point (my favourite Elite Four member of all time) For my rating system a 7 is pretty great but not quite amazing, and that’s what this game is. Gen 7 was probably the best entry in the mainline series. It is the one pokemon game that actually had a well written story(although it can be a bit handholdy around the start), it breaks the usual gameplay mold with the island trials, the characters are mostly fun and interesting, and the introduction of regional pokemon variants is genious. And if that is not enough, the game has one of the best post-games, with stuff like the return of Blue and Red, the hunt for the ultrabeasts and the introduction of bottlecas that finally give you a way around IV breeding(would still prefer for them to get rid of IVs entirely, but at this point, I take what I can get).. a great pokemon game with a great story, and not a single pokemon had to be cut.. This game has good points, but also lot of downsides for me. The good points were the removal of the Hidden Machines and the change of the Gym badges concept, but the bad points were the frame rate and performance issues, plus the innovation was not that great in this game. Not a disappointment, but a step down compared to previous Pokemon games.. Incredible. This is an absolutely amazing pokemon game with a great storyline and a fantastic new gen of pokemon which in my opinion gen 7 is one of the best in the series with great pokemon and charactars. I would give it 10/10 if it was more open to explore and there wasnt someone talking to you every 5 minutes in the game and there are a lot of unecessary loading screens like opening a gate. But otherwise this is a great game. 9/10. Simply put, Sun and Moon are best Pokémon games that Game Freak has ever produced. Poké Pelago, the side quests, the absolutely stunning nature of the presentation, it's all a sheer joy from start to finish. Game Freak hasn't missed a beat and has managed to carefully balance the inclusion of new mechanics without totally ruining things for the most hardcore fans. It's got content coming out of its ears, a much more interesting story, and rewards exploration in a way no other title in the series has. Whether you're a Pokémon fan new or old, this is an absolutely essential purchase.. Best Pokémon game so far, this is for me the best entry Game Freak has made for the franchise in 20 years. It's amazing to see how FINALLY they innovated a bit and tried to change the formula, I know it doesn't change a lot, but change the necessary and it feels so fresh. Hope Sword and Shield do something similar and tries new things too. Pokémon Sun and Moon also has the BEST STORY in a Pokémon game ever. Black and White had good ideas, sometimes poorly executed, but Sun and Moon worked so well, developed the characters and even made some plot twists. The relationship between characters, background stories and family bonds is the best we saw in a Pokémon game so far, the mixing of every single topic the franchise has touched was excellent! And we can't forget about the difficulty, USUM made it harder, but Sun & Moon has some challenges with Totem Pokémon and a great Pokémon League, and well, we have even the Battle Tree, as the biggest postgame challenge we had since Emerald. Pokémon designs were excellent in this generation too! As I said, this is for me the best Pokémon game to date!. An entertaining and refreshing bet for the main series. Despite not having a very interesting story, the characters are interesting. The progress in the game is fun and leaves you wanting to continue exploring.. I really appreciate all the new changes that Gamefreak has made to the series, but this game was so easy that I had a hard time having any fun.. The battles can really be **** sometimes with the rng but it's a fun game overall and I recommend it to someone who has never played a pokemon game in their entire life.. Let's get the positives out of the way, as I honestly have little I liked about the 7th generation. New Alolan forms are cute, bring something interesting to the table, and expand on a pre-existing concept of regional variants. The music is lively and fits the island vibe. I enjoyed the changes to the battle UI, and hope they keep the type effectiveness notes moving forward. Largely, for me, this generation was 2 steps forward, and 3 gigantic leaps backward. I have played every Pokemon game since Red and Blue. The departure from concepts that built the core of Pokemon games since the beginning, namely gyms, will have longtime fans wondering why GameFreak thought the Orange Island story arc in the anime deserved to be featured front and center. The region layout is lackluster and convoluted all at once. The ending drags on and on, and having no love for the characters established, I just wanted to scream after 20+ minutes of dialogue I didn't care about in the slightest. I had to force myself to even get through the main game. It simply was not fun or enjoyable for me. I have never been so disappointed in a Pokemon game. I thought Black and White was pretty weak, but this is a new low. Let's hope Game Freak learns from their mistakes and returns to form with Sword and Shield.. A solid and fun game, beautifully designed and has a lot of great new stuff. For example: no longer stupidly annoying VM's! Anyway Alolan-forms are totally unnecessary and the most of them look ugly in my opinion. I would prefer more new Pokemon like Salazzle or Golisopod. They also removed my personal highlights in Pokemon-games: The gym's, which is really sad! Also that many cut-scenes especially in the beginning of the game were kinda annoying. It sounds very negative but it is a really lovely game which is absolutely worth buying it.. Pokemon Sun and Moon is like The original Black and White for me it is very ambitious for what it's tryin to achieve and for the most part it excels on what it tries to do , but it still feel rough around the edges, and some things could be better here and there and mostly minor things, it still have room for improvement (like bw2) and still have more it can add, but on its own, it is a solid game, and a definite improvement over it predecessor, and this game IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT AND INITIALLY EXPECTED OUT OF XY, Has a solid story, characters, Satisfying Single player experience(for me at least) ,Great online , and couple more suprise here and there that makes me wants to catch em all, its only bogged down by its **** online implementation which trying to capture the magic of Join Avenue from BW2 only failing to understand of what makes the original so appealing and loved by everyone. it should've stayed with the XY online implementation rather than experimenting something new at it and fails miserably.. This is probably the most creative of all the mainline Pokémon games. There are no gyms, and there's actually a story this time around! Some small game mechanics also help spice things up, one example of this being the chain battles. All the Pokémon designs are pretty memorable, especially the Tapu.. The new features are just boring, looks weird, and didn't hit me. Too many dialogues, and they are mushy and sugary to the point it can make you sick.. The most ambitious pokemon game ever made: every risk they could take with the formula was taken yet: 1- almost all worked and paid off and 2- still feels like playing a pokemon game from start to finish. You have the best story with amazing themes (like the context of tradition and progress) a region that feels like a real world country with background that makes sense, characters with layers from both good and bad side, a new system instead of just more gyms just for the sake of it, a heartwarming conclusion, and smart ideas that honestly should be implemented 20 years ago.. A vibrant region, customization of your character, cool new Pokemon added and a near perfect game, apart from some minor issues with frame rates.. - best story in the series - z-moves were a good idea - Alola has many interesting quests and the trials were way more interesting than gyms, specially the idea of a totem boss with buffs and aides. Such a good story and so many new things added, it felt like a long time coming for this adorable game, specially loved the whole idea of ultra beasts. One of the best pokemon games, maybe even THE best one I played yet. Also a good starting point to join the series: The region is beautiful and has tons of interesting places to explore, you can feel like you're venturing into a eden-like paradise as you unlock more and more areas across all the islands. The trials give extra importance to some of those areas and totems are a great way to have boss fights and are actually challenging for real. Other pros include the Pokepelago system, the story that is the best in the series, the practical way in which you can manage your party and box pokemon now, the music, the ultra-beasts as a whole, the extended postgame, the z-moves that are a fun shake-up/addition to the formula and much, much more.. Pokémon Moon is great as most Pokémon core games. It makes great changes to the formula such as Poke Ride replacing the annoying HMs and has great graphics. For newcomers is great that there are fewer new Pokémon added, since having to learn 150 new Pokémon can make you feel lost. However, the pros end there. For being an RPG Pokémon Moon feel VERY linear. The tutorial feels like it will never end and there is little incentive to stop and roam around the place. The storyline is way more interesting than older entries in the series but the abundance of cut-scenes make it feel slow at times. The difficulty is non-existent until the last hours of the main content. The EXP SHARE makes leveling up your Pokémon a breeze and turning it off makes the game way more challenging. For a Pokémon game it's fine, the post-game content is extensive and interesting.. Incredible, good story, the kind I expected from other jrpgs but for pokemon was a first as previous games never got there. Gameplay dynamic and full of places to discover, quests to figure out and pokemon to find, anything that other pokemon games did, was done again as well or better here. Fully recomend playing it to the very end, it has some unforgettable bits. Really simple. The dialogue is boring, way too many cutscenes. The prologue is incredibly long for what it is. Ended up giving up playing it as I found it way too tedious. Felt like it was made for a young child and yet I can't imagine them enjoying the slow cutscenes interesting either. Couldn't play through it and so I can't give it a good rating.. Best games + best story + best characters. Masterpiece Id say and I don't say it to any game, specially not any pokemon.. The 3DS brought many great gems to the pokemon series so when I say Pokemon Moon, alongside the Sun version are the second best game pair in this whole game series, only second to it's bettered Ultra versions, its with heavy-hitter competition. I'm a fan since Pokemon Red and Blue came out in the U.S. in the late 90s but even after so long and having played all games I keep the assertion above: I was shocked with how much of a breath of fresh air this pair brought to the franchise. From replacing the gyms with a new boss system to new concepts like the rides, playing them feels like a mix of discovering so much new mixed with the prime pokemon trainer experience, not only many changes happened: They WORKED and they MATTERED which is something rare to say for games that change so much on old formulas. The side content is some of the best the series ever had, the hunt for Zygarde cells, Pokepelago, Refresh, etc, you feel like the pokemon is your pal instead of just a sprite in the team screen It has the best characters and best and most interesting story in the series, I'm yet to find a single pokemon fan who haven't gushed about how interesting and engaging the plot surrounding your journey was this time. Also decent pacing throughout your journey as to let you explore each section as the trials come by. The story actually managing to pull iconic and emotional moments like I've never seen in the series. And don't let the bright tropical looks and colorful people full of personality trick you: the story can get dark at points, with uncharted themes to pokemon The designs of new pokemon were ALL unique. You can feel a higher focus in creativity in each new pokemon, with ideas that feel iconic yet unexpected, including the regional forms, which bring new life to old pokemon like Raichu by putting them into new concepts based on how they'd adapt into a tropical setting. Team Skull is the best ""evil team"" pokemon has had and will be remembered fondly 20 years from now as one of the highest points in the series (but I can say that about a lot of things Alola region brought us) Z-Crystals are a neat way to make a weaker mon stay relevant, while working to all pokemon and having special effects if you combine it with effect/status moves. Speaking of the Meta, it's really well balanced in recent years, making going online a joy. All accounted, don't let online trolls who diss nintendo games everywhere convince you otherwise: It is a Must to play this game or the Ultras if you enjoy pokemon, as any longtime fan ( of which many I have befriended by playing it with) will most certainly tell you, this pair and its follow up are love letters to any pokemon fan, from the pleasure that it is to make runs in it, to how easy it is to breed, trains and battle online, to the beautiful and interesting places to explore, to even multiple references and old characters from every gen coming back.. Replayed and finished S/M a couple times and it keeps feeling great every time, even after this long. As a long-time pokemon fan who played all games, this is one of the best ones in the franchise, no contest. Great region, story, and trials were way better than gyms in every way. If this is the way the series goes foward, we're in for a golden age of pokemon.. Good looking 3d and is what many would argue the best pokemon game in the franchise by far. Looking back no wonder me and all my friend would get so hooked up playing with each other compared to other multiplayer games, as it's filled with qualities.. The most captivating games I've ever played. After finishing Sun I then played Moon for a nuzlocke run and it was worthy.. It's been enough time for the reviews to this game to be fair and balanced and as such I gotta say: this is the best generation in the series and would be the games if not for its enhanced versions existing. Alolan Forms, the massive revolution that is was finally replacing gyms and hms... not to mention z-moves, both fun to look at while also balanced and helpful to the metagame in a way you'd never expect such additions to be. I truly loved those games as a pokemon fan and a player.. gen 7 was the best gen (BY FAR even). Obsolete mechanics like Hms and gyms that dragged down the series were finally replaced by new ideas, many aspects of the series were revolutionized while still keeping the heart of the series and everything that makes pokemon what it is.. Pokemon and characters full of personality, in fact the characters are all very memmorable this time, they also all play roles in the story instead of staying there like gym leaders used to, this gen was amazing.. Story - Very Good Online - All right Music - The best in pokemon Region - Fun Z-Moves - Fun To me it deserves a 10. Pretty fun game. It was however a little short and felt like it did not have that much to do after i finished the story. It felt so much lacking compared to other Pokemon games. i also felt there were too few new Pokemon. Lots of fun ideas and futures, but not enough content for me.. With Pokémon Sun. BEST POKÉMON GAMES. Story is just the best with BW, it gets harder, great designs, characters, graphics, beautiful region, great additions, decent post game... I've been playing since Blue and Red and whoaa! this is just THE BEST. I have loved it, it has the best of every Pokémon game. I wish the new Nintendo Switch game to follow SM's way because its amazing, best way they can follow.. Best pokemon in years: -an immersive story full of twists like I never expected from pokemon, -the new pokemon are mostly creative and cool, specially the ultra beasts, a new kind of pokemon that are unique and just straight up awesome in how they add up to the pokemon world -The trials, that replaced the gyms, are both harder, more unique and way more refined as challenges. -zmoves really helped me make good use of weaker pokemon I avoided using in past games I wasn't playing pokemon games ever since black 2 came out, so when a group of friends kept recommending this to me I went with high expectations but and I was still blown away by it.. This games show that Alola has a strong sense of personality that makes you invested, even by just looking at npcs, places and routes you can feel it. Also the best story in a pokemon game.. Can't find anything I dislike even after replaying it AND playing the Ultra one and Z-Moves are great contributions to how battles play. After my disappointment with previous pokemon games for years, Moon to me resurrected it with greatness and Top RPG quality.. The best writing the franchise has ever had + the best characters + best music tracks + the best evil team in Team Skull, which is better than all other teams together + overall really good batch of newer pokemon I give it a 10/10 and recommend it as a longtime fan of the series. Not only the pokemon game with the greatest story, but also the best for pro-players, as the training, capture and SPECIALLY breeding of pokemon is easier than ever. It's also the most revolutionary generation that changed the most of the pokemon patterns and formulas instead of just reusing previous concepts, the hm system for example being replaced by something much better, just like gyms are replaced by a refresher in its kind of boss. Moon is a breath of fresh air in a franchise getting close to tedious repetition and shows that Nintendo, even with its most beloved franchise isn't afraid to take a few risks; even small ones. Compared to other Pokemon games nothing comes close to how well developed and enjoyable the characters are and the battles are made so much smother with various ease of life additions. Fantastic music adds the final cherry on top to be a great step forward after the disastrous x/y games. One of the best things relating to pokemon to ever be published Period. It did away with obsolete parts while adding more, moving forward instead of more of the same. The story is on pair with great franchises known for their great stories, trials, kahunas, totems and captains are all interesting concepts that bring more and better to the table. Evil teams were the best we ever had. Z-moves complemented the main battle system well and naturally, without overwhelming it but adding a new layer stil. Catching, breeding and training pokemon is easier and more practical while still compelling to do, even going as far as giving a way to interact with the boxed pokemon in island where they can hang out, explore and even train. And the best of all: HMs are finally gone and replaced with something better, and all that is just what I can remember from the top of my head.. Had great times with all the new pokemon. I also liked alola, it almost felt like visiting a real alternative world to ours, there's a lot of focus given to characters, even npcs and how they live. And I also loved how new and unique it was despite still having the basic pokemon traits I knew and loved. When I think in this game, I'll think in bringing in the new and interesting, in the pokemon devs not fearing taking risks and embracing the new.. The game offered me one of the best rpg experiences I had overall (and was my favorite pokemon until the Ultra version came along), and that's after playing dozens of games of the genre over the years. The world is fun and engaging and feels exotic. Anyone who actually played this game is bound to enjoy it, I can recommend it from veterans to newcomers and children alike. Best story of all pokemon games (+) Pokepelago, now my boxed mons won't just be forgotten (+) Unexpected quest system instead of gyms, bound with nature and the pokemon themselves (+) z-moves are a good spice to the battles, as I can give use to my weaker mons now (+) Overall Sun and Moon were both amongst the best games that came out in 2016. Unabashedly different from the other mainstream Pokemon games, Pokemon Sun and Moon refine the 3d mechanics of X and Y, and adds a great story that is sorely lacking in other Pokemon games. Same I said for Sun, except in Moon you also get the twist of the changed time of the day: it's inverted, so if you like playing at night but enjoy seing the game in its day or vice-versa, pick Moon instead of Sun. Other than it, greatness everywhere. Great new pokemon each with their own lore, top-notch story etc. This game surpass ALL of your expectations and goes beyond and Team Skull is THE best team in the entire series, even through if you play it, you'll know the true villains are elsewhere.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Alola is really fresh and innovative compare to the beginning of previous generations, this is the game where they FINALLY, after so long, started to push the envelope and find ways to innovate and change old formulas while still keeping the core of the series true to itself. Like the Totems replacing the old gym leader system.. Oh man, how do I hate this game? My first pokemon game was Diamond, and honestly, that was the only one I have truly enjoyed. I'm not saying that ""the new games **** because they are new,"" but I'm ","an average game that, unlike its predecessors, isn't a must-have for the 3DS . it's slow, boring, filled to the brim with boring-ass dialogue that makes up like 30% of the game . it's also filled to the brim with boring-ass fights and a mostly forgettable soundtrack ."
739.New Super Mario Bros. Wii,"It's definitely a fine platformer and a good game to play with friends or family. It's not a breakthrough but at the time it was a great comeback for 2D Mario on home consoles. 100%-ing this one is not fun though.. I love Nintendo games, especially Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda, my favorites are Mario Kart, Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild. I also enjoy playing Horizon, Crystal Fruits Deluxe, Fire'n Diamonds, and Midas Dynasty by Tom Horn, which I play mainly because I follow DiceGirl Egle expert slot streamer. Anyway, while I save up to buy Super Mario Party Jamboree, I'll be playing Pokémon Go. ;). Controversial opinion I despise this game it's genuinely so infuriating when I'm trying to play and get spammed by fireballs or spike balls and it's even more infuriating especially since it's supposed to be an easy kids game I hate the entire Mario bros lineup and I wish it didn't exist. Mario Galaxy, Odyssey, and 3D Land are so much better the only remaining feature with this bad game is the fact that it's only mildly fun. It also doesn't help that I spent $35 on this 15 year old game should've been like $15. New Super Mario Bros. Wii isn`t a bad videogame, but a bad Mario game for shure. I wouldn`t say that this is the best ""New Super Mario Bros."" game, I would even say it's the worst, but I can't remember the game 100%, so I can't say for sure (All I know is that this game would be on a very similar ranking then the others, except New Super Mario Bros. which is the only really good one out of the 5). But yeah at the end we got a pretty good 2D Mario game... 6,3/10. It's a solid 2D Mario game, and fun both single-player and co-op. While it's much better than old-school Mario games in its creativity, it still gets a little stale by end-game. There isn't as much variety as with the newer 3D Mario games on Mario Odyssey and Mario Galaxy.. This game is perfect to play with friends. Playing by yourself ends up being kind of boring, but the memories you will make from playing with friends is unforgivable.. It's fine. If you play this as a multiplayer experience you'll love it. The game and replayability is great, and the side missions and additions are a nice touch. It adds enough new to the series that it's fresh, but it doesn't hold up great after U,2, and Wonder came out. Additionally this game does less as a homw console experience than the handheld counterpart.. Overall Opinion: perfectly designed, but lacking in creativity. Outshined by Dkcr. So much nostalgia for this game and it’s aged well, just uninventive but never boring. It uses the same themes, the same gimmicks (There’s like 5 levels I can name with completely new gimmicks and I have every single level of this game in my head) 4 player is obviously fun and chaotic, and there’s not much to say. Fellow Wii classic Donkey Kong Country Returns is better in pretty much every way, from visuals, to difficulty, to level gimmicks to controls. (If you hate motion controls, you can still admit the physics are good) The great: Multiplayer Series best power ups (propeller and penguin suit) No levels are too offensive. 6-5 Excluded. The Bad: Lack of creativity Outshined by dkcr Too similar to its ds predecessor. Bro this game is a really good game .The excitement of dying in the parkour, the detail and beauty of the parkour maps. It draws you into the game. I enjoyed it abnormally for a platform game. It is one of my favourite games.. Great game! If someone wants to try any wii games this should be on the list.Very colorful and inspired levels that match with music that matches the theme of the **** a simple yet interesting platformer with new controls and mechanics as well as new **** bosses are simple but cool and you're motivated to continue playing.. Hella mid, this game feels empty and soulless. Far weaker than its prequel.. Some of the level design is questionable. A memorable game at least, but not too good of a sequel to the original New Super Mario Bros. The Wii was not made with 2d platformers in mind.. as many game reviewers say this game is brutally hard, it is not for those who struggle at games truly wise words. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very solid Mario Bros game, I had a lot of fun just picking my friends up and throwing them down into pitholes and stuff.. The first ever mario game I played, fun for everyoneabsolute perfection and no flaws WHATSOEVER. This was a nostalgic trip formeI played this game for hours and it was a game what I can play every time. Loved this game as a child and continue to come back to the game, best in the New Super Mario Bros series. Fun, 2-4 multiplayer co-op, etc. That makes New Super Mario Bros. Wii fun and full of action, Shooting Ice Balls, Motion controlls, flying with the helicopter suit, etc? I know we have Super Mario Bros. Wonder today, but both games are cool!. I loved new super mario bros Wii with new features 3d game for the time. This is one of the only games i have played in my childhood. I remember always sitting on the couch and repeating the game over and over from the first world, and sometimes playing it with my sister. What good times.. The DS one has 10 times better level design. The star coins are usually either in a random wall or require an item that you don't have on the checkpoint after dying in the level.. got a lot of great memories with this one. playing with my siblings was a ton of fun. one could make the argument that new super mario bros U is the better game. . . but pretty much everything it did, new super mario bros wii did first.. Mario Bros Wii delivers a classic Mario platforming experience with updated visuals and engaging multiplayer options, but its reliance on Wii motion controls may deter players who prefer traditional button inputs. The game maintains the beloved charm of the series with creative level designs and familiar characters, offering a nostalgic journey for fans. However, the motion controls can feel imprecise during intense gameplay moments, potentially leading to frustration due to unintended actions or missed opportunities. Despite this, the cooperative multiplayer mode shines, allowing up to four players to join in simultaneously, enhancing the social aspect and replayability of the game. Visually appealing with its vibrant art style, ""Mario Bros Wii"" remains a fun and lively adventure, yet its Wii controls may pose a challenge for those seeking a more conventional gaming experience.. This is really the start of Mario being less and less inspired in each mainline 2D game. I think the reason Nintendo hasn't released a brand new traditional 2D Mario since 2013 is because they are out of ideas. Mario Maker eliminates that problem because the player is now the game designer and not Nintendo. But with that in mind, NSMB Wii is least interesting in the series. NSMB brought Mario back to 2d in some exciting ways, NSMB2 had a unique theme even if it was a bit superfluous, and NSMB U and Luigi were just better designed and had better controls. Because NSMB Wii was designed four 4 players, the levels are empty if you play single-player. At the end of the day, this is not a terrible game by any means, you can still have some good fun with friends while playing it. It gets around a 5-6 for lack of creativity. I hope whenever Nintendo decides to make a traditional 2d Mario again that they don't just reuse assets from the NSMB games and aren't afraid to get a little weird and wacky with their art style, themes, level designs, and music.. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a copycat of Super Mario Bros. 3, and while that isn’t exactly a bad thing, the fact that it doesn’t provide a lot of new and interesting things to deal with or play with is. Never the less the nostalgia I felt playing this game was a treat, but not enough for me to like this game more than its predecessor(s).. Hard, but fun. Super Mario returns to its roots with a retro-inspired reboot of its 2D origins. Nice use of the Wii controls add a slightly different dimension but it inevitably feels like a step backward from the Sunshine and Galaxy games.. This Game Is Very Fun Mario's Physics Feel Great There Is 9 Worlds To Fully Explore And With 3 New Power-Ups My Personally Favorite's are The Propeller Suit And The Penguin Suit. The Levels Are Fun And Action Pack With 3 Star Coins Each Level, The Levels Are Evan More Fun With The Power-Ups And With Multiplayer You Can Play With Friends with So Much Chaos. The Only Thing I Don't Like Are The Cannons Because With The Cannons I Feel You Skip Way Too Much Game Like W1 To W5 Than To W8 Just Does Not Feel Right. So While The Games Isn't Perfect I Still Give It A 9/10.. This is one of the best New Super Mario Beros games of the whole series. Its especially fun with friends even with your brother. Messing around in this game with your brother throwing shells at eachother is so fun.. this game is just aright, i'm bias tho because i dont like 2d platformers or even platformers in general. New Super Mario Bros Wii, the lukewarm cocoa of Mario games. I'll admit I have a soft spot for this game, since it was one of the first games I had ever owned, but calling this game one of the greatest platformers on the system is a bit of a stretch. To a console that is home to Super Mario Galaxy, Wario Land Shake It, Raving Rabbids Go Home, and Donkey Kong Country Returns...this game is certainly, the least interesting of the bunch. The story, Peach is kidnapped on her birthday. Go save her. This game may have stellar controls, colorful graphics, and decent level variety. But ambition? Not a trace. Once you've seen one New Super Mario Bros game, you've essentially seen the rest. Because most of the level themes and enemies are practically identical compared to the previous entries, it's hard to find a reason to replay this one unless you have family multiplayer nostalgia like me. This game may be responsible for introducing me to the Super Mario franchise, but without any thematically impressive cutscenes like in those other platformers I mentioned, its hard to get a feel for what this series is all about besides good level design. I want something to think about during the journey. Bowser's new secret weapon, hints about returning bosses, some new villains...a title like New Super Mario Bros feels very deciding when barely anything about the game feels new. I will say the most stand out features about this game include the chase with Giant Bowser, the King Bills that appear in the final stage in World Nine, and the boss fights. But other than that, it's more a Mario game to just play to win. The only reward for one hundred percent completion is endless item mini games, it's a bit lame. Unless you have some friends to join you for the ride, you're better off just sticking with New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe. Its all you need.. This game is way more enjoyable than new super mario bros ds. The levels aren't crammed as **** and they feel actually fun to play. I wish the world themes were a little more creative tho.... Gameplay is unfair. Sometime you have to make leap of faith. Sometime you can't tell if it's a wall you can bounce to or It's in background. Physics are counterintuitive（Worse than NES mario）... AVGN level of bad. Marios return to the home console was great but it feels too much like NSMB. Controls are whatever but a real multiplayer exists now. As the first video game I ever played, Mario served as my gateway into all other Nintendo titles and gaming as a whole. I will always be thankful and nostalgic towards this game as a result. From a critical standpoint, this game does hold up very well with a great art style, fun new power-ups, and some appreciated love for the older titles in how bosses are handled and general level structure. While the general feel of each character isn't as snappy and smooth as you might want, an increased layer of difficulty with later levels and engaging multiplayer cements this game as a modern classic that many gamers look fondly back on such as myself.. I truly believe that this is the pinnacle of 2d Mario. I may have bias because this was my first video game, but it’s by far the most difficult 2d Mario, excluding the lost levels. The multiplayer also allows for a lot of backstabbing and rage which is a blessing and a curse. I’ve never seen anyone else say this, but this game is amazing. Also Iggy in his chain chomp form both gave me a heart attack when playing it and kept me stuck on that level for weeks.. This game is just groundbreaking. Back in 2009 if you asked me which I was more excited for, New Super Mario Bros. for Wii or the second coming of Christ I would tell you nsmbwii this is the golden standard of all video games. It's the best video game to compare other games to while reviewing them. That's why I think about how much better or worse every game is than this to see how good every game is. The game does EVERYTHING right and NOTHING wrong. It is the best game EVER MADE!. pure gold fun game, u fill u are like in a country in the sky playing this chit its super magic travel in diferent planets for kill kupalings. tesla version the best one‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎. It's classic mario jump and run, with lots of cool items, some challenging levels and just fun gameplay. This is the game that got me into gaming. Just got 100% at the end of the summer, and I can say it is amazing.. after doing the 100% of the game (and some extra things) i can say that this game is a amazing game, i recommend it. (8.5/10) - The multiplayer made this so fun to play. When I tried to go back to this game I realized that the controls were really difficult, so I don't know how I got so far when I was a kid. Never beat it though :l. Platformers have been my go-to type of video games ever since I got into the hobby and I have this game to thank for it. New Super Mario Bros. Wii may not be the best platformer out there, but it's still very much a fun one. In this game we take control of Mario and friends to save Princess Peach.....plot summary over. (it's a Mario game what'd you expect) Presentation wise the game is pretty good though that's about it. In fact the lack of originality is this game's biggest issue. The world themes are the same as NSMB for the DS and if you know that game, you'll know that they're pretty generic. Not to mention the graphics while pleasant, aren't anything special and the innovation is non-existent. The music also isn't one of Mario's strongest, though there are still some bops in here. My favorites include the athletic theme, map overworld themes, final boss, and end credits music. If you're looking for a platformer that breaks the mold, you won't find it here. That said, this game makes up for it with its controls and level design. Mario and friends control really well and in a platformer that's especially important to me.. There's plenty of moves you can perform as this game incorporates moves from 3D Mario games. it may seem like a lot but it won't take long to get used to it. It's fluid, varied, and satisfying. To make things even better we have the power ups. All of them are winners. The classics are as fun as ever and the new ones are great additions. The Propeller Mushroom can be very handy to gain heights and it comes with a nifty drill move to rain death from above. The Penguin Suit has a really fun slide ability and is able to freeze enemies (which makes the Ice Flower obsolete, oops). Overall the controls are very satisfactory and the power ups are fun. The levels themselves are also very good. There isn't anything that special about them but they're at least mostly consistent in quality. Some worlds are more fun than others (World 5 and 8 are my favorites while 2 and 6 are my least favorites) but there is none I dislike and their gimmicks do enough to set them apart. The best way to play these levels is to speedrun them. It's really satisfying though not all levels are designed for this playstyle and I did lose most of my lives due to recklessness. Though to be honest, unless you're extremely impatient, you won't lose many lives. This game's difficulty curve is mostly balanced. There's a small difficult spike here and there but it basically starts off easy and by the end it's mostly standard. This also applies to the boss fights which aren't all that great. Each world has two fights with a Koopaling. The first fight all play mostly the same. Really easy to dodge attacks and three hits before death. The second battles are more interesting and a few can get rather tense but they're nothing that special still. The exceptions are the Bowser Jr. battles. These are still not that hard but they're all satisfying. (Especially the second one) Also the final boss is sick, If a little easy. So if you're looking for a challenge, then you'll only find it near the end of the game. Though if cooperation is your only weakness, then don't play this with three other players. Multiplayer is a great addition to this game. I played this with one other person and it was fun. (Especially the sabotage) Plus the mechanic that allows you to go into a bubble at any time to save you from harm or a bottomless pit is rather useful to help younger players to get into Mario...(or cheat). So definitely consider this for some good multiplayer fun. Fair warning though: More than 2 players will more than likely lead to chaos. The last thing I wanna talk about is the completion process. The only thing you need to do is find all of the secret exits, collect all the star coins, and AVOID THE SUPER GUIDE AT ALL COST!!!. (Trust me) I think this is definitely worth it as it forces you to go off the beaten path at times and come on, who doesn't love collecting shiny things? The reward for 100% all may not be very special but this is a case of the journey being the real reward. (But the star coins do unlock some other things that are really cool) Overall, I'd still say this game holds up. There isn't anything amazing or original about it and it's on the easy side but even ignoring my nostalgia it's still a consistently enjoyable game. The controls are satisfactory, the power-ups are mostly strong, the levels are generally well-crafted, the presentation is still good, and the multiplayer is fun. It's not the best 2D adventure the king of platformers has to offer, but it's still a fun one and a great intro to the genre. Score: 8/10 (probably a high 7 at best but I have nostalgia for this one. It's the first game I ever beat. Cut me some slack. :D). This is really the start of Mario being less and less inspired in each mainline 2D game. I think the reason Nintendo hasn't released a brand new traditional 2D Mario since 2013 is because they are out of ideas. Mario Maker eliminates that problem because the player is now the game designer and not Nintendo. But with that in mind, NSMB Wii is least interesting in the series. NSMB brought Mario back to 2d in some exciting ways, NSMB2 had a unique theme even if it was a bit superfluous, and NSMB U and Luigi were just better designed and had better controls. Because NSMB Wii was designed four 4 players, the levels are empty if you play single-player. At the end of the day, this is not a terrible game by any means, you can still have some good fun with friends while playing it. It gets around a 5-6 for lack of creativity. I hope whenever Nintendo decides to make a traditional 2d Mario again that they don't just reuse assets from the NSMB games and aren't afraid to get a little weird and wacky with their art style, themes, level designs, and music.. It's a decent 2D Mario platformer. A lot of chaotic fun with a group of friends.. goated game, i have beaten it so many times. controls are great, level design is fun and interesting, and the gameplay (ESPECIALLY COOP) is fun as **** and playing this game with 4 people… some of the most fun you’ll ever have. its pretty good they added multiplayer which is huge but otherwise its just another 2d Mario its a great game don't get me wrong but could be more it looks really nice the sound track is eh powerups are nice and levels are pretty well designed but many aspects feel outdated but still a fun game to play. 7/10 (great). I love this game so much. I remember playing this game with my friend, good times.. This Wii Game has some good aspects, but all in all the game is very easy and i like difficult games.. Perhaps my favorite 2D Super Mario game, I've played this game for so many hours with my siblings. The level design awesome, and the gameplay mechanics are very enjoyable. Many power-ups to choose from, and all of them serve their purpose very well. There's a big variety of levels and minigames. The different worlds have their own gimmicks and unique levels, making the game feel fresh every time. The underwater levels are quite annoying though because water restricts your movement and slows down the pace by a lot. The soundtrack is very iconic and exciting to listen to, it has its own personality in a cute way. Lastly, multiplayer works very well, and it's the best way to play the game. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10. Good - interesting use of motion controls for platforms. Trying to move left and right while tilting the wiimote to move the platform is challenging. - new power ups. Bringing Yoshi back is cool, adds diversity to the gameplay - the numbered platforms where you had to kill enemies to keep the platform afloat was neat. - the spin koopa cart boss fight was kinda fun - the wiimote controls feel great. The dpad and buttons are perfect for platforming. - underwater level with luminescence jelly fish was creative. Bad - not being to save after each level was annoying. Replaying levels that I’ve already beaten just to return to the level that I lost is repetitive and not fun.. Very, very, very good Mario game. Some of the best soundtracks in Mario games and an awesome levels design.. So-so, graphics are OK, but the gameplay is not so enjoyable as it could be, in my opinion. Kirby Epic Yarn, Donkey Kong Country Returns and Super Mario Galaxy (1 + 2) are really great with their gameplay and mechanics. If forget about the aforementioned games it is a good game, but in comparison with them, it is not so great and enjoyable. Still is just matter of taste, as I said, I better play Kirby Epic Yarn, Donkey Kong Country Returns and Super Mario Galaxy (1 + 2) one more time than this game.. This game is great. I love the multiplayer, the level design, the music, and the new game mechanics. You can spin jump again, have Yoshi, and fight Bowsers kids all which have unique fights. Lastly they brought back the mini games from Super Mario bros 3. My only problems with it is that the graphics are the same as new super Mario bros ds, the physics are floaty, it's too easy to get 1 ups, and you can't take Yoshi with you after beating the level but other then that it's a great grand game.. Awesome game with so many functions, and the King Koomba in THIS make actually scared me!. This is still a decent time, but it's lost its luster due to the sheer amount of New Super Mario Bros games we got afterwards.. This is just your average platformer, nothing special. If you like Mario, or 2D platformers in general, it's pretty good. I have a lot of nostalgia for this one. This is the 2D Mario game I grew up with. Pretty fun time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. When the only negative reviews are saying ""It's too **** know it's really really good Mario. This is the best 2D platformer. Not a fan of the New series but this one is the best cuz it actually has memeroable music i think i would reccomend it to anybody. To say this **** is to say you hate gaming, this is the 3rd best 2d (2.5d, whatever it's still in the 2D realm) mario game i've played. Next to SMB3 and SMB1. The story is the same, the gameplay is awesome, as typical mario games are. The graphics are suited for 2.. This game has nothing wrong with it, it does everything it needs to perfectly, Although the plot is very banal, the game itself is fantastic, you will play the role of the most loved plumber of all time in search of your beloved princess and in the journey you will face many fun levels and even more if played in company, certainly the childhood of many people, and certainly one of the most loved games of all time, and even after 40 years it is very fun, perhaps it is one of those immortal games, which have made and will always do the best side of video games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Right amount of difficulty, well projected Multiplayer department with the bubble system, Yoshi, the introduction of the true Ice Flower (Galaxy doesn't count), the Propeller mushroom (one of my favourite powerups in the series), the OST... this game has everything! A must-have for every Wii owner :). Great gameplay and its even better to play with friends. Classic Mario game.. The game is very well made and is very fun with friends but playing it alone is not as good and the first 4 world are pretty ok but the last 4 are really good.. Very good game, a bit too similar to the DS Version. Multiplayer is great fun!. It is a really fun game to play with your friends, also it was the first super mario bros game that let four players play at the same time.. Great Super Mario game, the music is nice, the level design is good and the gameplay mechanics are very enjoyable.. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is just a fun and simple experience. It's enjoyable to almost every casual gamer and it's certainly a great game. The game introduces all kinds of new gimmicks. It brought Yoshi and the Koopalings back. The new propeller suit and the penguin suit and both amazing. The propeller suit will give you an upwards boost when used. The penguin suit will let you slide on your belly and will stop you from slipping on ice. It also lets you shoot ice balls. There's a new co-op mode which'll let you place with up to 4 players. It can be great fun but it can also be pretty messy. Yoshi plays just like he did in Super Mario World. He extends his disturbingly long tongue and devours any poor creatures that gets into his path. This game's level design is simple and can offer some great experiences. In conclusion, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a real fun game that Mario fans can enjoy. Have a great day/night, folks!. El clásico. An essential for the Wii. Nothing more to say. He is an old school super mario.. The best Mario I play, I made an speedrun at this game and it's so Good, Not is so easy tô be boring, but isn't is so hard to be angrier, I love this game, thanks for read my opinion. (Sorry the bad English I am Brazilian). Good Wii game, but after playing bros U it’s not flashing. The game makes fun, it was the first time with the cooperlings, so that is not a point which is bad. The final boss is awesome and the 100% realistic. It’s a good not so long game. The price worth. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a fun game. While its level design is not good, its ideas are safe, and the save system is flawed, the game mechanics are well done, it has good power-ups, a Super Mario Bros. 3 inspired map system, fun bosses, and great multiplayer. Just don't buy this game over 30$. 3/4. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. People hate on this game so much for being similar to the DS entry into the series, but I personally think that this game is one of my favorite Mario 2D platformers of all time. This game took my family 6 years to beat, and it was all worth it. The 4 player co-op can be a little hectic in normal play, but if you do two-player, or do the special modes, this game can bring so much fun.. I like this game a lot. It's a great title. I think the drawbacks come with the overpowered skips though. You shouldn't be able to skip to world 5 from the first level. I guess that makes it fun to watch speedruns of this game but it doesn't really have much other purpose. I love the multiplayer mode, but i just don't really come back to it as often as i should. It's very challenging but it's a really good feeling when you've completed it all. If you're gonna play this, play this with people. It's sooo much fun just throwing your friends off a ledge. [OBJECTIVE QUALITY REVIEW] There wasn't much that was interesting about the levels - they were pretty generic even for what at least seemed like a nice old-school diversion from the traditional 2d Mario formula - it turned out to be their excuse to do 2d Mario without actually innovating much as we've seen in the distant future. However it was also good that the Koopalings had returned to the Mario formula - a smart move by Nintendo for a series where all characters should at least have a substantial part in it. But there is very little replay value, and some sections of the game were really just punishing, as opposed to difficult - there's actually a difference here. Also, some of the levels are a pain to make it through, and even more so when dying on the tail end of one with no check-points. In fact, my first playthrough of this game involved getting to both World 5 and World 8 Warp Cannons just to get to World 8, get past the rather painful final boss, and complete the game, just to get it done. The controls are also pretty shoddy on this one as well. We've already had difficulty multi-stomping enemies and doing Bulldozer Attacks for a long time due to collision issues, but the shoddy controls on this title make it even more painful to do so, if not impossible. Also, overall, the game is just pretty boring in general even for New Super Mario Bros. early on, though that's not to say that it DOESN'T have meritable fun value for what it is.. This is a repeat of the standard Mario formula. But I feel it nails it. Its the standard Mario game but perfected. The repetitiveness is the only reason I subtracted the one point.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is pretty fun, however the Wii U and DS version are superior to this one. So I'm rating this a 10 out of 10. Sue me. Nonetheless, this is my absolute favorite Mario game and my overall most favorite Mario game of all time. Sure, the story is tired and used up, but the gameplay and the graphics definitely make up for it.. Great Game In General This Is A Very Fun Game With Many New Obstacles And THE KOOPALINGS ARE FINALLY BACK!. It is Bowser and here it comes: Bwa, mwa, mu ha ha ha ha, Marioooooooo! Player: pleaaseeeee not agaiiiin! 4 out of 10, the eternal short story reuse is getting annoying. What is the point of having the same story? Just call it a platform game. Ok, I see maybe it looks more complete even with this reuse and justifies the higher price. Ok it is Nintendo.. This is the best Mario game. Everything has been thought through and there are tonnes of fun things that can be done with the Wii controller.. While I thoroughly enjoyed NSMBW, I felt as though it doesn't translate as well in the modern day. For the most part, this game felt uninspired as it tends to take away from older games in the 2-D Mario franchise. this game is very easy until the last few worlds, and it doesn't get very difficult as far as I played. I don't think it's a good Mario Title to introduce someone to the series, except maybe for the multiplayer aspect. witch, for the most part, is this games only different quality compared to a game like the classic Super Mario games. While those are classics, this felt more like a desperate attempt to make. A pretty bad game. Nintendo can dish out wonderful games, but this isn't one of them. The story is terrible. Peach gets a big cake for her birthday (who's going to eat it all?) and the obvious happens: the Koopalings jump out and kidnap her for the millionth time. The levels are pretty boring, the story is terrible, and the end is even worse. You fight a normal bowser battle. Then you get to do a side-scrollin","i despise this game it's so infuriating when trying to play and get spammed by fireballs or spike balls . while it's much better than old-school Mario games in its creativity, it still gets a little stale by end-game . it's a solid 2D Mario game, and fun both single-player and co-op ."
74.Metaphor: ReFantazio,"Threading a line between fiction and reality, Metaphor: ReFantazio wants to discuss politics and create the future of JRPGs. Somehow, it manages to do both masterfully.. It really does have an exceptional narrative that builds on everything that these developers have learned from their time on Persona, with enough depth of theme that the game should encourage people to analyse it for years to come. You might need a big chunk of time to actually play it, but it is worth it.. After nearly 100 hours, I've finally completed Metaphor Re:Fantazio, this game is, without a doubt, the best game Altus has produced, not even just the best game, the best story as wellI completed everything there is to do in it, all the quests, all the followers, everything, only things left were stuff like 'listen to Gallica 100 times' or 'Cook every dish', nothing that important. Anyway, lets get on with the review. Story 10/10: I see absolutely no flaws with the story, it explores its themes masterfully, the characters are done beautifully, hell even the voice acting was phenomenal. Gameplay 10/10: They mastered the job system and the press turn system completely in this, there is literally nothing I would change in it. Visuals 9/10: the UI is visually stunning and the areas are beautifully crafted, the art style is so unique. My only problem with it is that some less important areas, like camps, are flat expanses that are jarring. Music 9/10: The addition of the 'Monk rap' in the OST elevates every single part of this soundtrack and truly makes something unique, it really sells the 'fantasy' the game is trying to accomplish. Gripes: Some late game bosses, like the last boss, can be trivialised with a certain late game character and class, using only Wanton Smash to deal over 4000 damage with proper buffing and debuffing. It's a 20mp skill (this character had over 390mp by the end) that deals extreme damage (AKA the strongest type) and makes the enemy weak to strike skills, allowing more set up. Early game MP is hard to manage as some low tier skills require 8-10mp to be used, making Mage massacring required to do earlier dungeons in one day. Grinding is piss easy late game, allowing me to sit in a corner near a monster spawner, equip Mage and spam the X button while watching Youtube, it's especially annoying since bosses levels lie to you so you don't truly know where you're supposed to be.Overall 10/10:Such a beautiful game, I think it's the first Atlus game with such a large cast of characters to not make a few of them insufferable to read.. This game is unic and so different, it offers you 100+ hours of playing. Fights are really cool. Game of the year for me.. Metaphor: ReFantazio is Atlus’s crowning achievement—a culmination of the best elements from their past titles and across the RPG genre. The Press Turn system, combined with the genius of the Archetype and synthesis facets of battle, creates a thrilling, strategic, and well-balanced battle system as you face off against one incredible boss after another. The impressive moments never stop, never cease, and the utterly magnificent plot is paced perfectly, with no dull moments. A cast of wonderfully written characters carries us through a magical, cohesive, and alluring fantasy world lifted to dizzying heights by a bombastic score and stunning visual design. Atlus has shown that fantasy is not dead.. Metaphor: Refantazio is the latest addition from the stable of Atlus, the developer that previously brought us award-winning series such as Shin megami tensei and Persona. Atlus is pretty much considered the hallmark for Japanese RPGs and delivers perhaps its best work with this one. Japanese RPGs like this are not for everyone, but fans have a masterpiece with Metaphor: Refantazio.. An excellent Japanese role-player that is at least the equal to Persona, with an engagingly thoughtful story and enjoyably fast-paced combat.. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of the most memorable RPGs we've played in years. In pursuing a new property, complete with a fantasy setting, Atlus has allowed its creativity to blossom, resulting in a brilliantly rich experience — both in terms of narrative and audiovisual design. While Metaphor takes obvious gameplay and structural cues from the developer's previous projects, it combines and refines those elements to make an epic, kingdom-hopping adventure that feels unique and deeply fulfilling.. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a very good RPG with great gameplay and a superbly constructed world. But it's important to remember that it's a fairy tale - then the convention adopted won't be so glaring. Maybe I myself subconsciously fell into the trap of constantly referring to Persona? Because of this, it's a little difficult for me to talk about a groundbreaking work of art, but only about a truly unconventional game. Check it out for yourself.. While the game in general has a good story, it lacks in some departments. The pacing of the story is not good, the dungeon to story ratio is a bit off, the dungeon part being too lengthy. Compared to e.g. the very good Persona 5, the characters were mostly a bit blant and the most interesting characters did not join the group. Social Link stories were also not to Persona standards and often more about some random NPCs than about the characters themselves. Main Dungeons could have used „road blocks“ where you‘d have to do something to progress to make it less grindy and for a better story pacing. Not a bad game but definately does not live up to the hype.. The game is very nice, beautiful, good combat system. The graphics are ok. would be a 9 if wasn’t the calendar system. You need to complete the game in 6 months game time. All main quests are time limited, so you cannot grind or farm so as you want. Also is not possible to go back to dungeons to grind or complete all side quests. This is very frustrating.. (NOTE: First of all, I didn't finish the game. So my experience only contains the first 4 hours of the game. And I am also a very big fan of Persona 5 and 3. I have experienced and very much loved the concepts of the game, because of the correlation of things and how the mechanics and story molded into each other, offering something that is extraordinary and deserves all the applause. Which in this game, I didn't feel anything that would be genre defining like Persona that would be remembered for years.)I would like to point out three things, first of all. These things I will point out, are the things that clearly state and prove why this game wasn't the Game Of The Year.First thing. The game itself is, characters. The characters were so good, I felt gay when I was doing straight things. Let alone the goals of the characters, there is nothing that creates the feeling of wonder or adventure or something that makes you want to seek more of what they are providing.Secondly. Even though the presentation of Atlus is splendid and many technical features of the game very well done, the game doesn't put any effort into originality or concepts that would provide the basis for Atlus to create something much better than Persona series and create something that would surpass it. This story, is the exact copy of kingdom stories that you see on the anime industry every single year. It is not that the story itself is awfully done, but the care put in to create something different that wasn't done before is lacking. Mediocrity is accepted as a ""truly perfect experience"", when we don't realize that the smooth curves of a picture don't make it a perfect thing because it was done carefully. Something can be done over and over, and all of them can be done correctly. That doesn't mean that it's perfect when it repeats **** third and the last thing is, the fighting system in the game and the balance between fighting stronger opponents and weaker opponents and the time they take is great. It is very neatly done. However, the power balance between characters and how that works into the story with the mechanics is not well done. You can not pinpoint out exactly which character is strong, for the story to have an reliable and believable ground to work things. Because if you can not shape characters into a mold, where you very clearly understand who is weak and then develop that into story elements, the story falls flat with ""plot armor"" and characters being ""overpowered"" and story elements changing because people ""felt like it"".I think it is immature to approach story with emotional sensitivity, rather than logical approach of how we feel what we feel and why we feel.. No idea why people are praising this game. This story is not bad. Actually it is good. But this is the only bright part in this game. The graphics are from 2010. It's not just old and outdated, it has a bad direction. Looking at this game makes me feel depressed. The idea to make costumes of 60s-70s is great, but implemented poorly. I just don't like the way this game looks. Music is ok. Nothing more, nothing less. The Gameplay is what I don't get. It is 95% a copy of other SMT and Persona games. To play the same game for decades is just frustrating. Basically you play the same game over and over with just a different story. There is nothing new. I played almost all Personas and SMT games. They were great for their time, but doing the same thing over and over again is a stagnation. Didn't enjoy the game at all.","Metaphor: ReFantazio is the best game Altus has produced . it explores its themes masterfully, the characters are done beautifully, and the voice acting was phenomenal . visuals are visually stunning and the art style is so unique ."
740.Elite Beat Agents,"It's impressive how this game looks like it came at the end of the DS' lifespan, while instead it dates all back to 2006! This piece of art is just unprecedented: the song covers are all decent, the storytelling is spot on, and the pace of the game is perfect for both casual playing and hardcore gamers who want to perfection every piece if every difficulty. Absolutely worth playing, full marks!. One of my personal favorites, I believe everyone who is passionate about music should give it a try. Its simple approach on both gameplay and campaign is also what makes it shine so much, giving importance to each and every mini-story within the songs which are all endearing and funny.. Very unique music game with great pinch of humor and bunch of memorable moments. I didn't expect such emotional Rollercoaster from this game. Great game but unfortunately little bit to short.. Quite a good rhythm game where each level is a paradise for my ears. The stylus control is nice, but it lacks my native language, Russian. It's a rhythm game and all it's strong and weak parts come from there. So not my cup of tea in general. Pros: * Super funny comics before each level! * Commander Kahn screaming ""Agents are Go!"" * Songs are great * This game utilizes stylus in the best way possible. Cons: * It's a muscle memory game. So it's repetitive by design. Not my cup of tea. But I see how it can be addictive.. Erm, kind of ironic as top-rated games to check as you the top-rated system as finest of more tip of the end of the game like so many other at one, keeping it on flank. Creationism is where this the game feats matter at most, mash-up contain spoiler of beginning of game. Dance moves should just more advanced/adDANCED like how most **** should live, making ordinary gameplay maggot-inducing, but not in the good ways, or both. Whack that feature in to the out park, they nailed the dance feature in tin you like show mother like japaneses rip-off of Elite Beat Agnets. Cleansed my soul, that's a promise.!. One of the best DS games, and one of the best musical games on the ds ever. Despite it has a very easy start, the game has so much replayability and so many songs to choose that you'll either try for a perfect (all 300s), or just play out for listening to your favourite songs! And on top of that, it has an unique feeling and it's damn bizarre considering it's dancing agents ""dancing"" their solution out. Not only it's fun to play, but it's also hilariously to watch, but what really took me off was that some songs aren't made very well in this game because most of the songs are covers and some are remade for the game (like ""You're the inspiration ""I was born to love you"" and jumpin' jack flash were slightly changed to be more upbeat) and while most are actually very good (sometimes even better?) than the original, few just don't feel as good. Also, no hidden mode from Ouendan, which is a HUGE lack because not only it was insanely hard but it was also very challenging. But not huge flaws however and still you get a very very good music game that will take you days to complete: infact at higher difficulties it's very hard at first try, but much more fun to play (easy difficulty is a mere long practice mode). If you love music game (and loved Ouendan), you should check this game out: it's cheaper right now and you get a very good music game for your ds.. This was a very fun and quirky game, but unfortunately it was sometimes a bit finnicky with the controls, which made it very hard at some points for a rhythm game that requires precision. Some of the songs were sub-par compared to the others, and a few would be rather dated now. I would still recommend picking up this game if you hadn't, as it's now easily found for just a couple bucks. Art: 8 Music: 8 Story: 7 Gameplay: 7. Horrible cheesy remake of the brilliant Ouendan, dumbed down for western audiences. Crap music, no character, no humour. Just get the original.. Pretty fun game. kept me going for hours!. Jammin' on the ds with this game is quite fun. Too bad i feel embarrassed playing a ds nowadays. Cutscenes and gameplay are fun and top notch. Must own for DS. Elite Beat Agents is not your typical rhythm game. It gives you humor, good music, and great gameplay. I love how the game starts off easy then ramps up to ""oh my god! one more time and I can beat it"" People have criticized it for being short and having only ""ten"" songs. Fact: It's not short, there are three difficulty modes that only add to the fun. There are also unlockable songs (which the people below me I guess didn't play long enough to find out.) Best of all are the cutscenes which really play the wacky situations greatly. They are comic book esque and you'll laugh every time you see them. There are also a couple of tearjerkers. The last level had me ramped up and I was tap and dragging my heart out. This game has been out for a long time so the price is cheap. Get it while you can. You will not be disapointed. I promise. Nine outta Ten!. The frantic gameplay, comic-book-esque ""cutscenes"", zany humor, and wide selection of songs easily make this the most funny (and challenging) rythm game on DS. If you don't own this, you need to call for HEEEAAALLLPPPP!!!. I'd like to point out some things that people don't seem to be understanding. First, about the track list. The songs in the game aren't tailor-made to your preference. Everybody's taste in music is different. If you don't like songs like Sk8ter Boi, that's fine, but that song isn't meant for you. It's meant for people who do in fact like those songs, because beleive it or not, they do exist. Imagine if the game only had songs that YOU like. If that was the case, only people who have similar taste in music as you would buy it, and everyone else would be left out. Think of it like this. Guitar Hero is all about Rock songs, so people who don't like rock songs would obviously not buy it, because it's not meant for them. There's a wide variety of music in the game so that a wide variety of people will find it appealing. Now about the dificulty. This is mostly for Jagur, who doesn't seem to understand what the level of difficulties are meant for. In most games, difficulty settings are meant to make the game easier, or harder depending on your skill level. The same is true for EBA. However, in other games, after you complete the game on one difficulty, that's usually about it, unless you feel compelled to try the game on a higher difficulty. In EBA, the higher difficulties are REQUIRED. Once you finish one difficulty, you are SUPPOSSED to go to the next one up. That's why the hardest song on one difficulty is about the same level of challenge as the easier songs on the next higher difficulty. The higher difficulties are part of the entire game, not an option. That's why the really high difficulties need to be unlocked first. Anyway, I don;t remember when I bought this game, but it was at least a year ago, and I only finished the Hardest difficulty yesterday. That's how long it's suppossed to last. The is easily my favorite rhythm game of all time and a contender for my favorite game EVER, and I play a lot of games. The level about the girl at christmas nearly brought me to tears, and if it doesn't at least make you a little sad, then I don't know what's wrong with you. That's about all I have to say. Hope I helped.. Fast difficult game and extremely enjoyable. This won't fail to put a smile on your face. you will get frustrated for sure. but still its one of the best DS games out there. For how cheap it is now, EBA is possibly worth getting, but it's extremely short with just over 10 songs. Having said that, it's a funny little game with a pretty good song choice, and will whittle away a few minutes, but is too limited for long sessions. While unique and features short amounts of fun, it would be much better with twice as many songs.","this game looks like it came at the end of the DS' lifespan, while instead it dates all back to 2006 . the story is spot on, and the pace of the game is perfect for both casual playing and hardcore gamers . it's a rhythm game where each level is a paradise for my ears ."
741.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2004),"The dialogue was really funny and a good read to know more about the lore and characters in the Super Mario universe.. such a great game man probably one of the best rpgs i have ever played i just love this game so much. Even if it was trying to be be kooky/fun and not that serious or **** just did not land well, for me at least, and made the whole game then feel bare and lackluster. Sorry to the developer, but that's how bad that ending was for me.. I don't know what it is about mario turn based rpg games being so fun, but this is it. Extremely funny and charming game. A must play game for sure. I love the style of the game and creativity put into it. A near perfect game.. Yeah ....Its alright.I do believe this to be the best in the **** plot is honestly really underrated , but certain things such as the battle system are so overrated. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awsome game all thr magic of Nintendo. Fun combat, great dialouge, likeable characters.. cab someoen tell me.ehow to talk o the goofball Edit: pls I relly neead help. Bro I just really wanna sexually harass goombella. Like I know she a goomba and all, but sometimes I just wonder if it’s tight, yknow. She could literally get some, same for Vivian. Idgaf if she trans, you can’t play a game without a joystick. ‍♂️. Amazing game.Even though the story isn't as interesting as Super's, it's still a very good story for a paper mario **** gameplay is awesome and the music is pretty memorable.Although this game has a lot of backtracking it never really bothered mr. Very poor level design with difficulty no where to be found, with enough backtracking to bore someone to exhaustion But badges are good as always and like 4 areas are designed well. Story and erveyrthing is fine. I like the game. I wish every paper mario could be playable with this features!. One of the standouts in the Gamecube’s library and one of Nintendo’s best RPGs. The story surprisingly has substance for a Mario title and is complimented with a charming script. The game isn't too challenging but it will throw some curveballs at you especially the final boss. Those hungry for a challenge can opt to try the pit of 100 trials which adds a test of endurance and a difficult boss as the end of the trial. The Battle system in this game is certainly a cut above other entries in the series and is more refined than its prior entry Paper Mario 64. Like it’s predecessor, the battle system in TTYD is given more depth through equip-able badges and can add more layers of strategy and variety to the gameplay. Truly one of the Gamecube’s crown jewels and an experience I can’t wait to revisit in the remake.. this game is all around amazing. the battle system, the characters, the story, the badge system. the only reason it isn't a 10 is because there isn't more things to do, and chapter 6 is pretty forgettable.. Somehow even more fantastic than the original paper mario and a 3 of the first 3 paper mario games are all equally fantastic!. Favorite game of all time!. The best game in the series, by far. While the game does have a bit of backtracking, it's still a fun game. The gameworld is somewhat less immersive than the first game but it more than makes up for it with the cool abilities you unlock to traverse. The battle system is the best it's ever been, like partners have their own HP now! The story is really good, though since it's a sequel you should probably play the first game first.. The absolute pinnacle of the Paper Mario series. The Thousand Year Door is a masterpiece of an RPG.. Two things come to mind. 1.) This is definitely the best Mario RPG of all time. No contest. This is an objective upgrade to the original game’s formula in every way. And the story is extremely entertaining. 2.)I completely understand why Miyamoto hates it and kinda agree with his restrictions on Intelligence Systems now. His characters are violated a lot on this game and if they were my characters I would be pissed too… still entertaining as ****. This game is an all-time classic that does a perfect job of combining the strategic nature and storytelling potential of the RPG genre with the signature charm and accessibility of the Mario brand. It’s got incredible characters that have surprisingly emotional stories that don’t clash with the overall goofy tone, a beautiful artstyle that manages to make the graphics still not look dated 20 years later, an excellent combat system that expanded on the previous entry, and an unforgettable world that feels like a new adventure with each area. There’s a few nitpicks such as how annoying the trouble system was and how little impact each character had outside of their respective chapter, but nothing that really ruins an overall amazing experience.. This game is an adventure and every moment is memorable. The music, scenery, art, and story is what sold me.. Hardcore RPG who expected an experience like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger might not enjoy this game all that much, but overall it's an outstanding game and is personally my favorite Mario game ever. Not only does it have a surprisingly good story for a Mario game, but also has a combat system that flows extremely well. The system of leveling up is a little simple, but it works well, and the badge system adds a nice touch. The only real issue is that it's a bit too similar to the first Paper Mario game, but it still is different enough that it feels like a unique and fantastic experience.. the game is amazing all the attacks give you a god complex when you hit them just right amazing game absolutely perfect. A game that is absolutely loaded with charm. My #1 game on my Gamecube growing up. I couldn't WAIT to get home and load this game up. The art, the characters, the places you explore to. I think about this game often. This Paper Mario and the N64 are my absolute favorite entries. Something about them truly captivates me! I think its the story and the buddies you meet along the way, not to mention its super fun to play!! There's so much to do and see. 10/10, make Paper Mario games like this again PLEASE. :). EXTREMELY funny, lovable design, interesting combat. It would be rated higher but the game is mind numbingly easy to the point where I could basically get through it by button mashing rather than interacting with the pretty good combat design.. This is the ultimate encapsulation of what turn based gameplay can be. There is no part of this game that doesn't feel perfect. The charm and cohesion that this game exudes is stunning and will be remembered as such.. The most boundary pushing Mario game to date. Give it a shot, the simple Mario franchise name as a whole might already put some people off. Fret not though, there's a noose in the starting towns square. This game isn't afraid to change pace from Mario's usual roots.. Im in english class learning about how to use RACES paragraph method but this game is pretty good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Still considered one of my favorite paper Mario’s games ever, barely surpassing the original. I remember fist playing the game and couldn’t find that contact lense. Years later didn’t know you had to talk to the shop. So I was a dumb kid, but once I passed it, I fell back in love with the game. I hope future paper Mario games go back to the RPG roots. I could only dream.. Played it recently. Feels like a ds game that only uses 1 screen and has lazy writing. Massively overrated. Colour splash is better than this game.. I can't believe it's possible that such a pile of garbage even exists. this game has nothing special and is always the same way too bad crap. i hate it so much i would like to report the developers. the only positive point is the music. this game makes a nintendo fan like me way too sad. i feel all the negative emotions just by mentioning it.. Big, Funny, Deep, Original, Awesome Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door is a fabulous game... just play it! You won't regret it!. A great game with fun characters, a fun story, AMAZING gameplay and big areas to explore.. A great sequel to the original N64 title, which has higher highs but lower lows. The visuals are certainly a step up, and hold up very well. The music is another strong point, with plenty of memorable tracks featured. The writing, story, and characters are somewhat more elaborate this time, which is great to see, and makes it stand out in the series. I did have issues with the pacing and flow of the game, as there is an excessive amount of padding at times. The other elements of the gameplay carry over much of what made the first Paper Mario shine, while adding further complexity. This works well generally, but there are a few gameplay decisions which I didn't appreciate. Overall it's a great time, but I did end up preferring the original title as the flaws dragged down my experience a bit too often.. Probably my 5th favorite game. This is really the height of turn-based RPGs for me. From its quirky world, to its memorable characters, to its near-perfected combat, to its surprisingly strong story beats, this game truly has it all. There is just so much this game does right! I love the customizability of the badge system and the customizability in choosing what you level up. I love the wacky bosses and somewhat disturbing events that make up this game's quest. The running gags are all very entertaining, like how all of the evil spirits curse Mario with something that is super helpful, or how all the women in Mario's party need to kiss him at some point for no reason, or how Luigi's partners all despise and want to murder him. There is so much clever dialogue in this game, so many wild ideas expressed, and yet it all still feels like a true Mario game at the end of the day. The only issue I find with the game is the unnecessary amount of backtracking. It's tolerable in parts, but there are sections of this game that I dread whenever I come back to it for another playthrough. Overall though, I would highly recommend it and I really hope it gets remastered on the switch someday. As an added note I hope that a remastered version has an option for a more direct translation of the Japanese edition as the story about Vivian being trans is censored in the American version and that's really too bad. The game is about 30 hours.. Game is slightly confusing at times but that's my only downside really. The characters are fun, the battle style is a good combination of timing based skill, and turn based strategy. And the game is wonderful for memes. More: ****/watch?v=9cJAi1yud6s. The perfect paper mario. I will never forget this game, this is a classic that I wish I could get on a switch.. Play color splash or origami king instead of this garbage. Like seriously don't play this.. This is one of the most memorable games I have ever played. I loved all the unique characters and settings. The music was fantastic and memorable. The gameplay is the only turn based combat I have found fun. I love this game however there are a few flaws. I personally could not beat the final boss of this game with over 2 hours of attempts.. A great Game which surpasses his predecessor in all disciplines. Better graphics, better gameplay, better battlesystem, better characters and a better story. Then the Bowser and Peach parts which brings variety and a new funny perspective. For me, the lenght of both of the parts between the main plot ist perfect. Not to short, so you can enjoy it, but also not to long that you not get bored. The chapters itsself are all very unique and fun to play them, when I have finished a chapter my anticipation for the next one was high. The bosses represents this game perfect. All of the fights are unique, interesting and challenging. The only little flaw is, that the game teases you in an unnecessary way. The search for general white, is an example of that. However in total this flaw doesn't harm the all in all great positive Aspects the game offers you. The 10 out of 10 is fully deserved.. My favorite videogame. I have replayed it countless times! -Interesting characters -Strategical battle system -Intruiging story This game has it all!. This is my probably my favorite game ever. As someone who was never into turn-based RPGs, the ""action command"" battle system is very engaging The only drawback for me is some required backtracking. would love to see a true sequel someday.. This game has an amazing combat system and an amazing story I don’t want to say too much because the game need not be spoiled, but this is the best game I’ve ever played.. Well... fascinating... I very much think this will be remembered for a long time.. A legendary Paper Mario and RPG. You can play it today and it will make fun. The best Paper Mario and one of the best RPGs.. What an adventure! Good - stylish points add extra challenge to the inputs. Super guard is a great addition, it rewards godlike timing. - the chapters felt extremely diverse. The missions in each one and the story, the dialogue, the scenario was very very well crafted. It kept me intrigued. Like in Glitzville, I really wanted to know who was behind all the missing fighters. - the chapter with the train was an interesting change of flow. Being on a train was cool, and taking the gameplay into the station was nice surprise too. - The partner powers and mario powers in the overworld were very cool. Good use of the moves to solve puzzles. Although some were too ambiguous - The story behind the partners were interesting. They did make me care about them. - The dialogue is of course superb. Incredibly charming, and funny. - I liked how they tied in Bowser despite him not being the main antagonist. - The TEC side story with Peach was also very sweet. A little sad, but it was a welcome change from the main story. Bad - the game won't let me turn around hammer quickly. Which makes it hard to counter attack with hammer if the enemy is approaching me from behind. - some puzzles are really stupid, like what the heck is a water hole, how am I supposed to know I can blow these boxes because their paper in the storage room in glitzville - it's stupid how items and coins after a battle can drop into the water. There was a fire enemy that it was fighting very close to the water and after I beat him, all the goodies dropped straight into the water after. - the depth perception in some parts of the game looks really off, making me fall into a water or off a cliff by accident because it was hard to gauge Mario's distance. - some of the story progression events are really ambiguous to figure out period because sometimes you need to talk to an NPC with a certain partner with you, which isn't always obvious. - tracking general white to literally every single world just to talk to an NPC then moving on to the next world was pointless, mundane and not fun. - I don't understand why there are so many sprites in the game, when you max out your partner upgrades super early in the game. - I found much of the offensive and debuff items pretty useless because I could dispatch pretty much all the enemies with regular FP attacks. - there are too many sections of the game where Mario just walks around looking for something or looking for someone. Like in chapter 6 in the train. I'm just constantly running back and forth between passengers. And chapter 7 in the moon fortress. And here I'm just taking elevators and just walking from room to room.. A natural evolution of the first game. Simplistic but brilliant, with very humourous moments.. This Game is an absolute must played for everyone. No more words needed. Highlight of the Paper Mario Games.. Honestly the best Mario RPG of all time! Nothing has topped it! What a fantastic game!. Perfected the original Paper Mario formula and took it one step ahead. The turn based combat, special attacks, the badge system, the unique allies (each with its own story behind) and the marvelous music and world building make this game one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Definitely recommend you play it, specially if you only played the last entries in the series.. This Game Is absolutely fantastic, one of my all time favorites, Great story-line, Characters, game play and overall a Fun and engaging experience Really wish Nintendo would Make this game more accessible due to copies of this game becoming more rare and expensive, If you have the chance to find this game at a decent price I highly recommend getting it. Ps #RemasterThousandYearDoor. This game is so overrated and it’s not even funny, I went in with high expectations but man was I disappointed. My big problem with this game has to be levels(the main gameplay) they are just soooo boring, repetitive, and backtracking filled like I can’t even put to words the amount of backtracking this game has it’s actually insane. The combat is pretty fine but in terms of RPGs it can feel a bit bland and repetitive but it’s definitely better then going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth like almost the entire game is. The overarching story albeit more complex and unique then most Mario games it ends up feeling more boring then bowser kidnapping peach because of the danm writting it’s just so pointless and has wayyy too much fluff. The music is alright and that’s about all I can say is good about this game. I didn’t even feel motivated to beat this but unfortunately I did.. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is everything a faithful sequel should be, taking the concept of the original and expanding on it in a new way that feels both fresh and familiar. The battle system from before has been near-perfected in this entry, alongside a truly unique and memorable world, tied together by the best hub world the Mario series has ever seen. The soundtrack expands on this ""fresh and familiar"" style by forming a very distinct style for the Mario series that still takes from many of the defining aspects of its home series. This game deserves every bit of respect it gets, and should serve as the gold standard for what a turn-based Mario RPG should be.. There is a reason as to why many people consider to be one of the best, if not the best, GameCube game. The gameplay carries over from the original Paper Mario (N64), but now partners have their own HP. FP, BP and SP all return, but this time the “Special” moves are focused around the main artifact for this entry: The Crystal Stars. The partner system makes a return and is improved on - rather than tools with some dialog, the partners in this game feel more fleshed out as characters. In terms of story, there is a presence of much darker themes and the story overall is more complex, and is very different to the traditional “Bowser kidnaps Peach”. The characters are generally well written and the humour lands in just the right way. However, there are some issues with the game - there is a **lot** of backtracking as a result of “hallway” level design occasionally combined with required fetch quests. Unlike later entries, exploration isn’t as rewarding, but is still worth it. Where this game truly shines is the combat and the storytelling. The art style is overall very charming, and develops on the “pop-up book” style of the first game with “paper” style abilities which can be essential to puzzle solving. Whilst this game, like any other, has its flaws, it makes for an excellent beginner’s RPG that doesn’t alienate RPG veterans, and is filled with memorable moments and characters. Like many others, I believe that this game, along with the original and SPM for the Wii, deserve to be remade for the Switch.. Perfect! And forever a master piece. With amazing characters, fun gameplay, and very creative ideas. Truly a cult classic.. best rpg on the gamecube. best game on the gamecube. modern paper Mario ****.. This game is kind of overrated. But, that doesn't mean it's bad. The battle system is a bit complicated, albeit fun. So what is my problem? The issues are that this game is difficult when it doesn't need to be, it can be really tedious to have to constantly backtrack, the music is just ok, the level design isn't the best, and I think you get the point now. Behind all these flaws is a good game, just not a game as good as it's often made out to be.. This game is one of the best gams that i ever played. I can only say play that game the music the story... are perfect. Loved playing this game. Everything about it was just fun. It had good puzzles and gameplay, the story was neat. Personally I thought it was even more fun than the first paper Mario.. To this day, this game is still an all-time classic with memorable story, captivating characters and fun gameplay. The best Mario RPG hands down. One of the best games (if not THE best) from my childhood and from any games I have played. The only flaw to this game is the backtracking in most levels, which can reach tedious levels later on. The combat is fun, and just simple enough to not be overwhelming, while still offering a fair challenge. The characters are great and memorable; the levels are interesting and fun; the story is a fresh take on the usual Mario plot line; and the music is fantastic. A must play game.. One of the best RPG games ever made....................................... ................................... I LOVE THIS GAME! Not only is it the best RPG I've ever played. Not only is it the best Mario game I've ever played. But it is the best video game I have EVER played. Sheer perfection and the game the series needs to be remastered on switch. Paper Mario: TTYD is one of the most beloved and influential RPGS of all time. If you ask any Paper Mario fan what their favorite Paper Mario is, they'll almost always choose this game. I hold this game dear to my heart since my Grandpa has a Gamecube and I played the heckin' shoelace out of it. The gameplay is amazing. The battle system has more depth because of the addition of the audience and new stylish commands. I absolutely love this game's art style. Everything looks very cartoony and completely nails the paper aesthetic. The soundtrack in this game is amazing,but the classic has some better music in my opinion. In conclusion, this is an amazing and very polished RPG that I think everybody should try at least once. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. As soon as you hear Rogueport's theme, you'll fall irreversibly in love with this game for the rest of your life. It's just THAT memorable. And the game is just THAT good. A 10. In every possible way.. This is the first '10' I have ever given to a game. EVER. If you have read any of my reviews, I am a heavy, heavy critic. But this seems to be perfect! NO CONS! A marvelous story with a spectacular soundtrack, as well as a outstanding battle system, and characters and bosses filled to the brim with personality and charm, as well as great graphics for the time this was made. EVERYTHING you would ever dream of in a Paper Mario game is all combined into this, one game. Even the little pros feel so good. Overall, a masterpiece and the best Mario RPG ever. NO bias.. Hands down one of the best rpgs ever made, and the best mario rpg to date. Charm oozes from every pore of this game.. Let all the other reviews here do the talking. Paper Mario TTYD is simply that good.. Honestly, this may seem over the top, but this is my favorite video game of all time. EVER. It has an emotional ending that almost made me cry (like, LITERALLY), the most likeable characters I've seen in a game, extremely catchy soundtrack, and the greatest story i've ever seen in a video game. I know this review seems too positive and too over the top, but that's just what I think of this game.. I had heard about this game for a long time, many say it's the best Mario RPG, and definitely the best Paper Mario. I finally played it through and have conflicted thoughts. At its best, this is prime Nintendo at its most magical and charming, the battle system is fantastic, the game is funny and the first few chapters are just a joy to play through. Unfortunately the game starts getting long in the tooth, and any backtracking, or platforming/skill section highlights that the gameplay really only shines during battles. Having to revisit or return to a location in this game feels like a punishment, so hunting for hidden items, is never as fun as it is in say a Metroidvania, or a Zelda game, because Mario is slow and fast traveling is far from optimal in this game. The battle system is great, continuing the interactive turn based combat that was started in Super Mario RPG. I always loved the skill based turn base RPG that allows you to do more damage, or decrease damage depending on your skill and timing, and Paper Mario has tons of way to reward that. I think if this game was remade and a few quality of life changes were made, for instance making Mario a little speedier and his jump a little more Mario-like, it would really be an absolute classic. As it is, it's a great game, but a few elements make it far more frustrating than it should be. 8.5/10. An Absolute Masterpiece The Thousand Year Door not only improves over it’s terrific predecessor, It OUTDOES IT in almost every way.. This game is silly in a way that is super fun. The combat is simplistic but somehow remains fun throughout the whole game. The art style is both pretty and pretty unique.. This was a sequel that surpassed it's predecessor in nearly every possible way. Better party member with even more depth to their characters, a much more compelling story, an improved combat system and overall just a much better game, which is really saying something since the original was so good! If I have one complaint it's that the stage gimmicks were very annoying and often angering (randomly getting poisoned, people throwing things at you, the stage breaking, FOG!). But even with that one mechanic, so many things were improved it was instantly forgiven.. A great game with unique locations and characters. Instead of the stock mario environments, we get fun chapters that each hold interesting ideas (With the exception of chapter 2, which has Pikmin like followers that are frustrating to command) the best chapter hands down is the Glitz Pit, a replayable area where you are a Wrestler. Another great chapter is one where Mario's body is stolen, a chapter taking place on a moving train with a kind of murder mystery going on, a chapter where you are captain of a ship crashed on an island, etc. Almost all of the chapters have their own unique idea to them. The companions, particularly the Baby Yoshi and Vivian are interesting characters. Recurring villain Lord Crump is a fun incompetent joke character. Some parts of the story veer into more serious stuff like a character having a deceased wife, a character's missing brother, etc.. Not the best RPG of all time, but probably the best one on the GameCube and defiantly the best Mario RPG. Great battle system, compelling story, and interesting dialogue make this a ""must have"" for GameCube owners.. Why does this exist? Its just TloZ : OoT 2: Electric boogaloo but its mario. EVERY single trope is used here, the difficultly is unfair at times regardless of what level you are at unless your overleveled. doesn't matter anyway becuase you can spam power bounces over and over on nonspiked enimes and spam hammers onspiked enimies and use your partners as meat shields and use thier purposes once or twise. thank GOD we got sticker star and color splash to make up for this overrated ****. This game is genuinely a 10 and I will explain why. If you go in without playing any other Paper Mario, you will give it a 10 no questions asked. If you have already played Paper Mario 1 (which I recommend you do) you might be inclined to think it's less than perfect because it reminds of Paper Mario 1. HOWEVER, that is not true at all if you keep playing. Within 3 or 4 Chapters, the game easily proves that is not just at least as good as the first, but remarkably better. So if the first gets a 10 especially for its originality this also gets a 10 since the innovation it brings is impeccable and enormous. Everything is great from gameplay to visuals to story, and don't do the mistake to rush it.. This game has everything I've ever wanted, and Nintendo nailed all of it. It has beautifully designed worlds, tons of new unique characters, a fun and exciting (and hilarious) story and tons of collectables and upgrades throughout. Honestly every part of this game is just a joy to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing mix of rpg and adventure game. Great characters, funny plot and diffrent ideas for action. Best Mario RPG ever created, way better than this Mario and Luigi games and Paper Marios that we are getting these days.. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door improves on it's already phenomenal predecessor in nearly every way. The creative new hub world called Rogueport is brimming with original characters and funny dialogue. The story in this game is more intriguing than in the original, and there are many twists and turns throughout the 30-hour adventure. Mario has a variety of different companions throughout the quest, and each bring their own unique skill and personality. The improved battle mechanics including Partner HP and the Audience applause meter are very welcome and are fun additions to an already excellent turn based battle system. There are also a handful of excellent side-quests in this game, some even on par with those of the Legend of Zelda. The rewards for completing these side adventures can range from a simple thank you to adding a new companion to your party. The graphics from this game hold up very well thirteen years later because of it's simple, paper-y style. Despite not being the main antagonist this time around, Bowser is back with a vengence for Mario, and it's amusing to constantly see him one step behind Mario and Co. The different locations you visit on your adventure are all very entertaining and different from one another, which is refreshing to see in a Mario game. Overall, this is a must-have for a Gamecube owner and I hope that it is available on Virtual Console for the switch when it launches because I would love to take this baby on the go.. I almost never give perfect scores, but this game is one of the single greatest video games ever made. It's accessible, creative, unique, and confident in itself. The gameplay is creative, easy to figure out, but far from too easy. The dialogue is the best part, but the story is nuanced for a Mario game and completely unique to itself. This game truly is amazing. I'd say it's for everyone, but I also recognize that not everyone will be able to get something out of this game in the same way I did especially after reading a review like this. However, I recommend it to anyone and everyone of all ages. 10/10 Perfect score -JR. This game is everything the amazing first game did- but better. The characters, story, music, and gameplay are all fantastic. What a great game! Easily one of Nintendo's best.. Perhaps my favourite game of all time, and the one I have beaten more times. I mean, there is nothing I dislike about this game! Maybe it is a bit easy, but it is so fun... and funny as well! Characters, especially Mario's partners are astonishing, and the variety of places you get to explore is also very good. You go from a castle with a giant dragon, to a dojo coliseum, then to dark place where people become pigs... so there is no way this gets repetitive, you always have fun. I don't know, not much more to add, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, it is a real shame that new Paper Mario games are so far from this gem.. Toilet Paper Mario: Color Trash's smart older and Far superior older cousin. Paper Mario TTYD is my faovrite game of all timeand nintendo has slowly been killing the franchise ever since. #screwyounint","the story isn't as interesting as Super's, but it's still a very good story for a paper mario **** . gameplay is awesome and the music is pretty memorable ."
742.Mario Kart: Double Dash!!,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. MKDD might hold nostalgic value for some, but for anyone who values fair gameplay and polished mechanics, this game is a colossal disppointement. First, the graphics. For a system as powerful as the gamecube, MKDD looks shockingly mediocre. Flat textures, low polygon characters with some good environments to save the situation. Now, onto gameplay where the real issues lie. The singleplayer mode is an exercise in frustration. The infamous ""rubber banding"" AI goes beyond being challenging. It feels like outright cheating. No matter how well you play, the game seems determined to ensure that AI opponent will swoop in and steal your victory at the last moment. Wether its red or blue shells coming out of nowhere or an AI racer magically speeding past you with no logical explanation, you re constantly reminded that your skill doesnt matter. Even worse, the game seems arbitrarily decide which AI pair will dominatethe races. Instead of fair competition you re battling against a preordained victor, which makes the outcome feel completely out of your control. And lets not forget the random, chaotic elements suddenly appearing on the track, throwing off your entire strategy, or items hitting you just before the finish line, gifting the AI an undeserved win. Only the multiplayer mode offers some relief, as playing with friends can be genuinely fun. If you re considering revisiting this title for the nostalgia, do yourself a favour and leave it in the past. MKDD is proof that even Nintendo can miss the mark - and miss it badly.. Played this a lot as a kid I love the drifting mechanics in this game and some tracks are very fun but with only 16 tracks and some of them being lackluster it can make the game less fun than it should be that being said i had a lot of fun still and think the game holds up well. This is a game I grew up with and even 100%'d it as a kid. However, the nostalgia goggles can't save this game from being one of the most awkward Mario Kart games to play. The main problem this game has is its physics. It always feels like I'm driving in a kart that seems like it's being held together by duct tape and a dream and could seemingly fall apart any second. Unlike the tight controls of Mario Kart Wii, this game's controls just feel super clunky. If it wasn't for all the smaller aspects of this game being quite good, this ranking would be a lot lower. On the inverse, if this game's physics were more like MKW's, this could be a contender for the best Mario Kart. It has great classic tracks like DK Mountain, Baby Park (this game having the best rendition of it by far), Yoshi's Island, and Waluigi Stadium. The game's notable gimmick of having two drivers is an interesting one I thought was done well enough. The main thing the characters you select affect (aside from the size of car you can use) is your special item you can get. Each set of two characters has a special item exclusive to them (except for the final unlockable pair which can use any of them). This ranges from DK and Diddy getting overly large banana peels to Yoshi and Birdo getting essentially a red shell that drops items upon hitting its mark to the baby characters getting a Chain Chomp, which is basically a prototype of the Bullet Bill in later games. Also this game definitely has the best battle mode of any Mario Kart game, being the Bob-omb Blast (honestly Bob-omb Blast might even be the best part of the game), a fun game mode where you get to collect bob ombs and throw em at each other to win. But instead of just having a health bar, it's an interesting point system where you get a star for each hit, but you lose a star (if you have one) and the opponent gets one if they hit you, so it's a constant back and forth. You can even do a co-op racing mode where one person drives while the other person is responsible for items (and you can swap mid race if need be). Overall, a lot well thought out ideas put into a game with a horrible physics engine make the game even out to just being okay.. Since I have no nostalgia for this game I can be blunt, this game isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. The main issue with this game is the lack of content, and while the visuals are nice, and the game is fun, it just does not make up for the game only having 16 tracks.. Another great addition to the best karting franchise by a country mile, the character swapping premise adds the ability to carry two power-ups at once which is hardly an **** innovation, but the added speed, funky graphics and hectic combat make for one of the very best instalments in the series.. Fun to play and then some with a unique play mode..................................... 10/10 Best MarioKart unless you dare play in single player if you do play in singleplayer: may god rest your soul. Best game ever from mario kart and is my main favorite! I love it a lot even is too fun the 2 players for novice gamers to play on a single kart!. DAISY STOP. The games cool too. Probably a little tricky to control your kart with friends, but still, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! really brings out the joy that any other Mario Kart game had. A bit hectic, but still fun! All the new tracks seem to be pretty good, and the new characters too! Love the item work put into this game. Does the job pretty well, and a good choice for a first GameCube game.. Perhaps the black sheep of Mario Kart instalments on Nintendo’s home consoles, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is a well polished GameCube masterpiece. As the player, you pick two characters to control your kart and you’re encouraged to get creative with special item combinations exclusive to each character that you pick. Perhaps Mario and Bowser could team up for a race or two with fireballs running across the track with big Bowser shells to follow, or perhaps Paratroopa and Waluigi could go for a spin dropping Bob-ombs and red shells all over the place? It leaves for a lot of fun and countless hours of lots of replay-ability. Once you get past the slightly touchy front wheel drive controls and sometimes floaty mechanics you have a very good and (sadly) very overlooked Mario Kart game. With new characters, the introduction to Bob-omb Blast and Shine Runners in Battle mode and the simply addictive gameplay, it’s easy to see why this game is loved by anyone who’s ever owned it. The only thing stopping this from getting a higher score for me is the fact that there’s only four cups, which you could argue the N64 version only four cups too, and that would be a valid point. But I always felt like something was missing once I got to the credit sequence each time I would go and replay the game. Team up with friends or play it solo, if you love Mario Kart you cannot go wrong with this one. 9/10.. one of the best great items, characters, and karts I really like how theres 2 people on a kart This was my first Mario kart and Will always be one of the best. if you hate this game because of the handling, you are bad. i picked this up after not playing mario kart for at least 3 years, and within less than a week i've already unlocked mirror mode.. Absolutely timeless, a banger of a racing game that is fantastic solo but especially with friends. The tracks feel amazing, power ups arewell balanced, and different racer classes hadmeaningful differences in handling. An all-time-great party game. There are only a few reasons why this game does not get a straight 10 rating. The first reason is the lack of being able to jump. The second reason is the difficulty of one player mode in 100cc, it is hard to drive and attack at the same time. Finally it is very difficult to find five GameCubes and 20 people willing to all play. If one gets lucky enough to gather the needed GameCubes, it will cost a pretty penny to equip everyone with food and drink to stick around and play a while. Then one would have to pay for any missing games, modems and LAN cables. If you are more into just you and your family enjoying the game, then this is perhaps the best game you can get in the racing genre.. Rather unique Mario Kart game, lets you play as two characters at once and use their skills jointly! If you have two favorite characters in Mario Kart this is the game for you!. An amazing Mario Kart game for the time, still one of the GOATs nowadays. Fantastic racing game.. This game is absolutely great fun. The problem is you’ll end up completing it in a day, so is it really worth the time or money. I would say no. Now, it would be worth getting if you intend to play it as a party/multiplayer game. But then why not just buy one of the newer Mario Kart games!. Having two characters in one kart was the one of the best ideas they ever had for the series, its a shame it hasn't returned in any other game so far. The only things holding this game back are the outdated controls and insane amount of items on the tracks.. Yes, MK Double Dash is my favorite MK game for 2 reasons: first the music is the best I've seen in an MK game and the second is the gameplay, some people think the game is too hard but I think it's just difficult to be playable by anyone correctly even if it sometimes requires a bit of practice to understand how the different mechanics work.. This is one of the most memorable, unique and fun Mario Kart games in the series. You can choose from a wide cast of recognizable characters and can customize to your heart's content, which is one of the reasons what makes this game so awesome! The ability to have two characters in one kart adds some spice, flavour and excitement which is exactly what makes this game so special. Although it is fun to play alone, this game really shines when played with 2 or more people. My only complaints about this game are its lack of course selections (as it only has four cups instead of eight) and while the courses are amazing, it can get a little repetitive at times. And also the inability to play battle mode with only one player. Other than that, this game is fantastic and is a must play if you own a Wii or a Gamecube!. THE best Mario Kart game to hit the shelves. Fantastic items, and plenty of amazing courses, it's all here, in the most unique Mario Kart title! An interesting new gimmick that is done perfectly, Double Dash allows you to mix and match 2 characters from a great cast, and race as both of them in a single kart. With weight classes and character specific special items, as well as several different karts, there's more than enough different combinations for you to make.. Mario Kart Double Dash plays like a failed experiment. It is the only Mario Kart game that has special items dedicated to certain characters, two characters for one kart, and cannot jump your kart in. The soundtrack is exceptionally grating for a Mario Kart game apart from a handful of tracks. Overall, this is easily the worst Mario Kart game of the series.. Two is better and Mario Kart Double Dash proves it with a lot more mayhem and good original tracks.. Mario Kart Double Dash was really refreshing. Just the idea that you drive with 2 characters was insane nice.. This game is the most unique of the whole franchise, and there's lot of things I would like to talk about. First, there's tons of new characters, like Diddy, Birdo, Waluigi, King boo. Second, the special items are fun to use, heart is really a clever idea, Bowser Shells are crazy in tracks like Baby Park, and who can forget the Mega Banana. There's great tracks in this game, like Mushroom highway, Baby Park, Dk Mountain, and Yoshi Circuit. Also, the battle modes are easy to have fun with, especially the shine thief. The only thing that is bad is the online mode. The GameCube had lots of problems dealing with the Internet, and I mostly played solo on this game.. The driving is nowhere near as tight as its predecessor Mario Kart 64. The graphics look terrific however the rack designs are annoying and less memorable than other instalments. On the mechanics, doing mini turbos is clumsy and the button layout on GameCube is less than seamless when trying to switch characters, fire off weapons and brake. You have to slide your thumb whilst still holding down A for accelerate. Not great. A good game, but overrated, in my opinion.. The best kart game in the ps2/gc era, good graphics and gameplay, every track is good, really fun. This game has lots of pros. The double characters thing and special items will always make it known as the different Mario Kart. There are some problem, though. Firstly, the AI. CPU doesn't play for the victory, they just want to ruin your day. You're third? The second racer will throw a red shell behind, just to hit you. They won't try to hit the first one. Another problem is that some tracks are not well designed for the particular drift system of this game (Wario Stadium, Dino Park). The roster is great, the characters are well matched together. The game is not very longible, but I think it's okay for the year it was released. Good game.. I played this for hours at my cousin's house growing up. This thing is great!. i would give this a 93% This Mario kart game is so good it had great graphic, i love the idea of having 2 people control a kart and if you don't want 2 people controlling a kart you can change that, it is just a great game in total. Great maps and charter designs as well.. Ahh yes, the ultimate kart racer. Look, this is my favorite racing game of all time, mainly because of it's charm, uniqueness and accessibility. Let's just get this out of the way: this is a game nearly anybody can pick up and play. It's hard to master, but easy to understand. You pick two characters, pick a kart, and start driving. And the game is just, fun! The powerups carry that Mario charm, the maps are incredible, and the idea of having multiple characters at once and transitioning between them adds for some wonderful strategy. This game has a very high rating and it deserves it, as this is an incredible game.. The most technical Mario Kart. Good - the two racers and two item swapping adds a lot of mechanical skill and reflex test to the gameplay. Makes it more exciting and deeper. - hitting wall doesn't eliminate all your momentum - stages are well designed. Bad - too much dodging required. - hard to dodge things because when you turn your cart tends to go straight still - sometimes your Kart get hits backwards even though the opponent rammed you from the back - there needs to be a restart option for GP. - weird how special cup isn't unlocked from beating star cup 150cc, only 100cc - there are so many items to the point where luck plays a huge factor in winning. This holds back the deep gameplay mechanics the double riders and drifting. They're tied to each other, making it a catch 22.. Double Dash is an amazing Mario Kart game, and certainly one of the most interesting titles too. The 2-character mechanic works well, and the tracks are all creative and intriguing. The controls take a bit to get used to, after playing Mario Kart DS for a long time.. bloody good fun, especially the multiplayer here. races can get absolutely manic.. This is a good game! It might even be a great game! This is a good cart racer!. To me a very mediocore title. The graphics look stunning and the Charm is undeniable, but the lack of an incentive to come back to this game despite all the positive reviews, just make put it in the middle of the spectrum for me. Pros: 1. Good Graphics despite the Gamecubes Hardware. 2. Fun Multiplayer mode 3. Tracks are fun especially Baby Park, a giant oval with 7 whole laps Negatives: 1. Little replay value 2. Reuse of SFX in certain places 3. Not enough tracks 4. Certainly better games out there Would i recommend it? No, but that doesnt mean its bad at all, just not my favourite and you can disagree with me, but if so then make your own review.. Probably the best Mario Kart game to date. Graphics that stood the test of time, and with double the characters comes double the items, which make for a hectic race. The items don't come across as unfair, as the blue shell balance is pretty good. The only thing holding it back from a 9 or 10 is either more tracks, or a story mode would've made this game the perfect cart racer in my eyes.. Two characters in one kart, the characters, the stages, the battle mode, the multiplayer. Need I say more?. Single mode amazing. Multiplayer mode, amazing. Races, amazing. Characters, amazing. Although not my favourite game in the series, it is a really good game!. The fourth instalment in the Mario Kart series, Double Dash sticks to the tried and tested formula as players use a selection of Mushroom Kingdom characters to race against each other on Mario-themed tracks. Arguably more so than any other entry in the franchise races in Double Dash can be decided based on how lucky you are with the special items you pick up. As a result is not the best entry in the franchise, but with a good selection of tracks and the ability to switch between two characters with different special moves on the fly, it is still an enjoyable multiplayer experience.. This title is perfect in so many different ways. The roster is wide and very sensible, the vehicles are all awesome, the courses are incredibly memorable, the battle is beyond perfect, I can’t say that there’s really much wrong with this game. It’s chaotic, sure, but that just enhances how fun this title is to play. 8.5/10 for this one, and that’s the highest score I’ve given a Mario Kart.. By far my favorite instalment of the Mario Kart franchise. I am very surprised that more Mario Karts haven't enabled the player to play with two characters on the same vehicle more. This game was revolutionary in the Mario Kart franchise and has some of the most iconic tracks. The Gamecube was the first video game console I ever received and Mario Kart: Double Dash was the first game I received. My sisters and I had so much fun playing this game and this game will always remain special to me.. This is my favorite Mario Kart. It's unique in many ways. The 2 in 1 character gimmick, the special items, and it's one of the most hectic games in the series. Most Mario Kart games tend to be brushed aside once the newest one comes out, but I don't feel that's the case with Double Dash. It could do with a bit more content, though.. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is the most ambitious Mario Kart game ever made, and for that reason, is the best in the series. The character swapping mechanic makes the races more strategic, allowing for numerous combinations. Outside of that, the game looks amazing, runs at 60fps, and has best track designs of any kart racing game out there. An absolute must for GameCube owners.. I really don't like the fact that a 7 is considered a mixed score. I think this game is good. I like it. I think it's enjoyable, but it has some downsides. I think the controls are kind of iffy and that might just be me, but turning is very difficult. I might give this game another shot seeing how high the user score is. Overall, it's a good game, and it's almost an 8.. My personal rating for ""Mario Kart: Double Dash"" (GC): 8/10 - Great Gameplay: 8,5 Video: 7 Audio: 7,5 Scope: 8 Balance: 7 Story: -. This is the only other full 10/10 Mario cart game. The ability to switch up who is in your double dash vehicles and the items you get from it keep the game fun and fresh as compared to the other games in the series where the cart and single character is the only major difference.. One Of The Most Creative Double Dash!! is extremely enjoyable even 16 years later.. Booting up Mario Kart: Double Dash!! today, I'm immediately struck by how good it still looks, especially in progressive scan mode via component cables on an HDTV. Everything is clear and colorful, and the action is fast and frantic. It feels a lot like an arcade game -- and this is by design. MKDD is best enjoyed as an arcade-inspired spin-off to the Mario Kart series; it is fast, frantic, and fun for multi-player, but it is not really a traditional Mario Kart game. My low score is related to my preferred way to play -- solo / campaign -- which is far too random and out-of-control for my liking. The fact I needed to consult the instruction manual when playing for the first time -- after a quarter-century of enjoying other Mario Kart games -- points to a needlessly complicated system and a frustrating amount of content locked behind a ""play-wall"".. A good and solid racing game, but there is nothing really to stand out. The mechanics are solid but sometimes they feel a bit cheap, and the way to unlock other race laps is really annoying. But overall, a good game that could be a 7/10 in the future for me.. a fantastic game in the series, I really loved it. it is really cool that each character has their own special item, and combining two different characters can make for some strategic fun. this is my personal 2nd favorite of the MarioKart's after Kart8. really great fun, and highly recommended.. With great controls, insane music, nice tracks and wacky visuals, this game is easily the best Mario Kart ever made, and for GameCube, that says a lot.. I absolutely love everything about this game. Nothing else to say but, I will mention that this game is usually the game that is always in my GameCube.. Mario Kart Double Dash reinvents the wheel with two people in one kart. This means that Mario Kart becomes more strategic, because you can switch between items if you get an item box for each character. And that's not all. Each duo has a unique special item. These range from fireballs, to big bananas, and huge Bowser shells. And the tracks are some of the best in the series. DK Mountain, Wario Colosseum, and Daisy Cruiser are examples. My only gripe is the controls, but you'll get used to them eventually. The battle mode is also amazing to play with friends. Whether you're playing Shine Thief in Pipe Plaza, Balloon Battle in Luigi's Mansion, or Bob-omb Blast on a freaking Nintendo GameCube, Battle Mode is always frantic and fun. Mario Kart Double Dash is fun for everyone. Definitely the best multiplayer game for the GameCube (NOTE: I haven't played Super Smash Bros. Melee yet).. This game is definitely one that I would recommend, especially if you have family or friends to play with you. This is the only title in the mario kart series to ever have two players on the same kart and while it isn't always the best way to use multiplayer, it definitely added some fun twists. It's hard to replace those feelings you get when you and a friend are neck and neck with another 2 friends on a kart and the person on the back is throwing items while the guy driving tries to get close so that the person on the back can hit the other driver to knock them back. Obviously multiplayer was tried in other ways in the future, but I think it would be cool to bring this back just as a fun mode.. I remember playing this with my cousins and boy did it feel like the Max Mad of Nintendo. It's a never-stop fun game to play with friends and helping each other to win. I highly recommend this to play.. The game is really exhilarating. The amount of fun in the game is outstanding. I would recommend the game to anyone who has a gamecube! The amount of characters is really high, and all the characters are very unique. Good job nintendo! #ChaseMccain4life. Probably my second favorite mario kart game. Loved the tracks, and the 2 player mechanics.. Not much to say, it's a very good game like every Mario Kart. I like this game especially because of the addition of multiple character in one kart and the great courses this game has.. This is one of the best Gamecube games made, I remember playing this and loved it. It's still held up do this day. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes the Gamecube or Mario Kart. The most infuriating Mario Kart I've ever played. The bots are set out to personally screw you over, I have every race a bot throw a god damn red shell backwards when there are numerous bots ahead of them, but they have to throw it back to me. The hit box on bananas and shells are ridiculous too, you can clearly see you're not touching the shell/banana but you still get hit, the bots either easily dodge a shell or banana, or they just drive straight into them. Also having to drift just to take a corner without braking so much is stupid.. I remember many, many years ago playing the co-op with my buddy. I remember that moment where we were in the city level, and just as he honked (he was Baby Mario, I was Todette), a Bob-omb car blew up some AI racer. It was funny because when you honk, your character does a little animation, and Baby Mario's is a handwave, so when he honked in front of the opponents, it was like he was waving them goodbye. Pretty funny. Anyway, this Mario Kart kicks ass. If they remaster it, I'll be sure to be up in there as soon as possible. Excellent racer, but there's not much to do for the solo player.. 9.6 - Awesome concept and classic Mario kart. Also has probably the best character list in a Mario kart game, and has very iconic and memorable tracks and power-ups.. This game is just plain horrible. Not only do you have to choose two racers for one kart, you also have terrible drifting, terrible characters like Petey Piranha and Diddy Kong (thank God they never came back) the flying Blue Shell, and worst of all: terrible tracks. I give this game a 1 out of 10 because of all this bullcrap.. Mario Kart doubles up with Double Dash. An awesome game that is a must buy if you own a Gamecube. With that aside it's pretty much business as usual, endless hours of fun await, especially if your playing with friends.. This is my favorite racer of all time and for good reasons. The graphics look smooth. The courses are always fun to play on. Amazing multiplayer. YOU RIDE WITH 2 CHARACTERS! New karts! Most addicting mario kart game. Just 100% FUN! Controls are great. SO MUCH FUN!. Two-character karts with a whole load of fun. Who couldn't ask for any more? With ""Mario Kart: Double Dash!!"", no one will be asking for less fun... they'll be asking for MORE FUN!!!. Mario Kart: Double Dash IMO is the second best MK Game up-to-date! The graphics are great and a little beyond standards for the Nintendo GameCube. The Character Selection is good except I like Mario Kart Wii's a bit better. The 2 character-in-1 Kart is awesome. The kart design is great especially the Yoshi one. The tracks are what I love the most about the game. The music/soundtrack is amazing. Mario Kart Double Dash is one of the games I got back to recently and you should DEFINITELY pick it up if you find one for a great deal. And if you hate MKDD, you're BEYOND silly as JB..

I love this mario kart, it has a unique mechanic on making strategy with 2 racers per kart, also the specials and the courses make this an amazing game, the 16 courses cup is epic, also battle mode is great, i consider this one of the hardest mario karts!! I don't know why is so hated. This is the worst game I've ever raced. After analyzing this game with a team of Nascar racers, we've all come to the unanimous conclusion that this game is painfully unrealistic and dangerous to the young and stupid minds of our children. Allow me to elaborate. This game teaches our children that driving recklessly and drive-by shooting is okay. It also teaches them that spending time with a kidnapping turtle on steroids and a barrel-throwing monkey is the right thing to do. Contrary to what you might believe, it is physically impossible to drive a car on a rainbow. Maybe if the creators had actually done their homework, they could have avoided such gross mistakes in the capabilities of refracted light. I don't approve of this game having unlockable characters and maps. It's clear that they should have had all content available for purchase. Cause if there is one thing I love, it's buying a game and then forking over even more money to the developers so that my character can wear a blue cowboy hat instead **** one. I only had to spend 14 bucks on this game! What a ripoff! I should have had to give over at least 30 more. I also hate that this game involves teamwork by allowing two people to drive/operate the same kart! I hate teamwork, I hate all my friends, and I don't need to be reminded how frustratingly lonely I am! Get your head in the game Nintendo. No one will ever buy any of your games unless you start making good content. I don't even know what a Nintendo is! So what we have hear is just some game no one has ever played or heard of. And it will do nothing but crash and burn.. Mario Kart Double Dash did nothing but improve upon its predecessors. Better graphics, more characters, multiple different karts, more items, new LAN mode, etc. The controls feel a bit jerky at first, but once you get used to them you'll find that this is one of the better games the Mario Kart series has to offer.. By far the best mario kart game (yes i played them all). Mario kart double dash it without a doubt the most unique mario kart. Each character has there own specials! This game also has great maps and catchy music. Also weapons are more random, meaning a person in first can still get a good item. Also when you make mistakes they are more consenquential. This is the best mario kart to date.. This game is awesome. The 2nd best Mario Kart game to date. The graphics were amazing at the time. The track selection is great. The character selection is awesome. The controls are good. Mario Kart Double Dash is a great Mario Kart game and it's definitely worth getting!. Fine, Petey, you can steer if you REALLY want to... Mario Kart: Double Dash! is the best game in the Mario Kart franchise. It has decent graphics and a wide character selection. The best part is riding together on one kart. My friend was a horrible Mario Kart driver, but he could always be in the back shooting power-ups. The battle modes were really fun, too, especially the Bob-omb one. Hop on the back of my kart, we got some shells to shoot.. I was very exciting when I wanted to get this game. And it did not disappoint. I expected it to be my favorite in the Mario Kart series…and it almost was. The control takes some time to get used to, that's the only reason I didn't give it a ten. Once you're used to the control however, it's incredibly comfortable and well done. Some tracks are very fun, sporting huge jumps, exhilarating views, sharp turns very fun to drift on and very unique parts. The music is pretty upbeat in most stages and it fits the stages very well. Especially stages like Mushroom Bridge and Daisy Cruiser. The graphics don't look too amazing nowadays, but I'm pretty happy with how it looks. It's got nice shading in the right stages and it sports some good colors. The gameplay is definitely the best out of any Mario Kart game, including two players in one kart adds to your strategy because each character gets their own unique item and you can switch drivers to keep an item in stock. It is possible to shoot straight from last to first, with both assistance from the Chain Chomp and using items which make you work to use them well, but end up being rewarding in the end. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the Battle Mode. You have your standard Balloon Battle, but you also have Shine Thief which is an excellent four player game and Bob-Omb Blast where the only item is Bo","for a system as powerful as the gamecube, MKDD looks shockingly mediocre . the singleplayer mode is an exercise in frustration . the game seems arbitrarily decide which AI pair will dominate the races ."
743.Bangai-O,"Bangai-O is a certainly a strange game for a few reasons, and I’m not sure if all of the reasons are intentional on the developers behalf or not. Because for how high the quality value of this game is, the translation was clearly not a priority during development. Almost every character interaction is nonsensical, and it doesn’t help that the game has a kind of whacky comedy feel going for it as is. Now obviously this translation is bad, but it doesn’t hinder your enjoyment of the game, if anything it improves it. Because Bangai-O is a game of extremes, and these insane character interactions only get funnier the longer you play the game. But the gameplay itself is also so over the top and absurd, it feels like the translation and writing might have actually been an intentional match. Bangai-O is a 2D, multidirectional-shooter puzzle game, yes I said puzzle game. You must traverse 44 levels throughout the game, flying in the Bangai-O mech and destroying thousands of enemies in the process. Bangai-O’s mechanics are simple at first glance, but the game actually requires a great deal of skill to beat. You’re able to fly the mech freely around the open-ended levels, you can aim in eight different directions by either using the analogue stick or by pushing a direction on the d-pad without shooting, the d-pad is also used for movement. Now for those who haven’t seen a Dreamcast controller, you might not realize that it would be impossible to use the d-pad and the analogue stick at the same time due to the layout of the controller. So immediately you must adjust to a very specific type of movement, in which you must move in eight directions with the d-pad but also get used to stopping and starting to fire your weapon so you can adjust your characters aim – because while shooting you are locked into the direction you begun shooting in until you stop firing. You have only two weapons throughout the game, by swapping between Riki and Mami as pilot you will also swap firing types. Riki has a homing missile attack which is useful for enemies who move a lot and for general crowd control due to the explosions they cause. Mami has a thin laser attack which bounces off walls and penetrates enemies, this is good for when more accurately placed shots are required and is extremely useful in smaller levels due to the damage you can stack by having these lasers bounce in and out of enemies multiple times. You can swap between these two firing types very quickly with ease. But I wouldn’t recommend this game so highly if you just shot at enemies with two different attacks for the entire game. Because Bangai-O’s best mechanic is also its simplest. By causing explosions and defeating enemies you will recharge a special attack meter, you can fill this meter five times at once, and each special attack drains one bar. These attacks can also recharge the meter as well. These special attacks depending on your weapon at the time will shoot at a barrage of projectiles in all directions surrounding your character, but the closer you are to enemy fire, and the more enemy fire there is around you at the time the more projectiles you’ll fire. This could have so easily been a cheap mechanic, imagine, you just take a bit of damage then while in your I-frames you would just surround yourself with as much enemy fire as possible and annihilate everything. So the developers took the best and arguably the most extreme path and simply, removed your I-frames. Yes, you heard me right – no I-frames. Got a few projectiles coming your way which you don’t avoid? Every single one will hit you, and you will probably die within the blink of an eye. I can’t emphasize enough how important this decision was to making the game as fun as it is, it creates such an incredibly fun and tense dynamic between your character and the enemies. Because you are fighting literally hundreds of enemies per level, and at any point you could die within seconds, but if you play well you’re also able to completely screen-wipe enemies with ease. Again, this is a game of extremes. But at this point it probably just sounds like an insane shooter game, well you’d be right. But Bangai-O takes its design a step further just to make sure it really sets itself apart from other games. Throughout Bangai-O levels are filled with obstacles, little grid based walls and structures which behave differently to one another. There are so many different mechanics throughout the game which are mixed around for creative combinations, genuinely changing the way the level plays out. The game also loves using these mechanics in again, extreme ways. There are entire levels which just revolve around one simple little mechanic, but are utilized so well that it actually works, and are such a blast to play through. This is why it's considered a puzzle game, because amidst the destruction and chaos you’re also required to constantly figure out solutions for tricky situations.. Extremely over rated game IMO. Any time the action actually gets exciting, the fps slowdown ruins it. The rest of the levels are really frustrating platforming and out of place puzzling. Maybe my expectations are too high based to the fanboy gushing that this game receives, but honestly it's just a mediocre game. Oh and the art style is awful with their gigantic pointy noses. Like who thought that looked good?","the game is a 2D, multidirectional-shooter puzzle game . you must traverse 44 levels throughout the game, flying in the Bangai-O mech and destroying thousands of enemies in the process . the translation is bad, but it doesn’t hinder your enjoyment of the game, if anything it improves it ."
744.RalliSport Challenge,"There's a story for this. In 2001, there was a 4-year-old boy who played Rallisport Challenge on the original XBox with his father. They had a ton of fun playing it together. Unfortunately, after some time, the boy's father passed away. Years later, the same child, who is now a teenager, took his XBox out of storage to play and relive some childhood memories. He put in Rallisport Challenge and found an old save file.

746.Battlefield 3: Armored Kill,"The last Playable and decent Battlefield game of the series. Everything afterwards is a dumpster Fire!. Disclaimer: Due to the behavior of premier servers, buying BF3 DLCs individually doesn't allow you to play on them even if you own the DLC of the map that is currently in rotation. In other words, none of the DLCs are worth buying over premium. If you want a specific DLC, get premium or don't bother getting it at all. Excellent DLC that provided big maps with plenty of vehicles which were more common on BF1942 and BF2 maps. It doesn't feature any new weapons but does come with two new vehicle classes (Mobile artillery and Tank destroyers) and their own unlocks. New vehicles: tank destroyers and mobile artillery are found exclusively on the Armored Kill maps. TDs resemble IFVs but have the firepower of a tank while mobile artillery are unique and don't really have a counterpart in previous BF games, only a similar role to the artillery of the BF2 commander. Maps: Four excellent maps provide all out vehicle warfare but still with good dedicated infantry locations to fight in. Armored Shield, Bandar Desert, and Death Valley are some of the best maps in the entire franchise. They're very balanced, provide diverse playstyles, and are all vehicle oriented. Due to the dedicated infantry locations, TDM plays very well on them despite not being specifically designed for them. Pitfalls: The AC-130 is a marketing gimmick that doesn't have a place in the game. It's either underwhelming when played on Conquest or ridiculously overpowered when played on Rush. The rush game mode is singlehandedly ruined by the AC-130 making this the a worse DLC for consoles. The new game mode Tank Superiority is not very well thought of and quite unfun.. The maps in this expansion pack are the perfect example of how some Battlefield maps should be. Enormous with a lot of vehicles. If you want a true Battlefield experience you should try it.. In Battlefield I love using tanks on maps such as Caspain Border, I expected this to be fun as such and it just wasn't. What a complete let down and waste of money, the maps are absolutely terrible. If you love Battlefield tanking I would avoid the expansion and instead play normal maps with tanks on, because it's a lot more fun than what this expansion offers.. This DLC is what Battlefield 3 should be from the VERY FIRST DAY, new maps are simply BEAUTIFUL on a strong PC. This is the most beautiful multiplayer i have EVER played. Also gameplay is amazing on a new maps. I must admit that new vehicles type dosen't bring much new into the game, but that's it, all the rest is Amazing and i think you should go out and buy it NOW.. So far this is my favorite expension pack for BF3. The new vehicles are a great addition and provide some added variety to the roster. The maps are obviously huge and on the hole are generally well designed and provide a step forward for the BF3 game. My only gripe is that because the maps are so big if there are a lack of vehicels about (which does sometimes happen) there is a long walk ahead of you to the next checkpoint or to pick up a ride. This asside i have and will spend many more hours on this expension pack. As this was the only DLC I was waiting for, there was great disappointment. With it's COD styled DLC approach. you get 4 generic maps and little more. The new vehicles don't bring much, except for the mobile artillery. As for the maps, only 1 has an actual good design and that is Alborz Mountains. It brings some refreshing play with it's vertical approach. the other 3 maps brings nothing new and doesn't bring much fun with it. The anticipated ""biggest map in BF history"" is horrible with 3 capture points next to each other where all the action is and the others are just 1000 meters away over some desert. This DLC confirms how EA destroyed DICE entirely. And I think back how great their DLC was in the past with BF2 and BC2. It's such a shame it has turned to this. I really like this expansion over B2K and CQ. I bought Battlefield for the epic battles with tanks, jets, choppers, and the like. BFBC2 ruined some of the fun I had going with each expansion in the series, and 2142 is no different. BF3 brings it all back, although, if anything the maps still feel too small. How about a jet only map similar to Coral Sea and really expand the fighting area. I love the fact that uncap areas are off limits. My only gripe is that the AA/Tunguska is no where to be found in most games. It spawns, but it's either the favorite target of everyone or I just cannot ever find except when I'm in a jet of course. I'll admit, my skill in this game is terrible. And yet, one game I'll be in the top 3, the next dead last. Balancing the game is more important in this DLC with teams. It really is evidenced when you are at a flag in one tank and the rest of your team is AFK, charging off alone in random jeeps, or waiting for the helicopter/jet. Meanwhile, I'm a sitting duck for the coordinated tank army fast approaching. And the AC-130, I love it. I hate it when I get shot capping a flag, but it adds an element that is super fresh and fun. I find myself only joining servers with this DLC or have this DLC in constant rotation. I have no major complaints. If anything it is still too small. This is coming from someone who plays flight simulators (ironic that I would play arcade); if anything I would like to see double or triple the size. Have us in what they call a furball with guns blazing, missles flying, and even have crazy stuff like battleships with AA, emulate real Tunguskas, and dare I say terrifying things like S300s. Bring in things like flying under the radar, loft bombing, and other cool things. Keep it arcade, but add in more elements and bigger areas so I do not feel like my role is to do 8G turns the whole time.. Huge, beautiful and very well designed maps. New and interesting vehicles like the tank destroyer or the AC-130. The best DLC for Battlefield 3 so far in my opinion.. Fantastic Expansion for Battlefield 3. Brings in some massive maps with exciting vehicle warfare. Each map has a unique look and feel and bring a new level of combat to the game. They are beautifully designed and fit in perfectly with the maps already included in the game. Tank superiority is a bit disappointing as it can be fairly boring but every other game mode is exciting and a lot of fun to play on these maps. This expansion is well worth purchasing on its own or with the Premium package.",the last Playable and decent Battlefield game of the series. everything afterwards is a dumpster fire!. the maps in this expansion pack are the perfect example of how some Battlefield maps should be.
747.Forza Motorsport 6,"They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. If enjoy GT7/Forza in general/simcade racers go for it. If enjoy linear career modes/less car detail event entry racing games enjoy. Wasn't fan of some ideas/directions. Singleplayer only review, no expansions/multiplayer. Bought FM6 to complete the series (only FM1 to go) & see what changed from 5-7 as never owned 6&7 prior. 6 the last Xbox One to get. For singleplayer offerings you have the career, showcases & arcade. Intro videos play per tour volume/narration overview for each car class with nice personality of narrators. Same FM5 & May/Hammond. Can choose between any of 6 car classes per tour (swap whenever it lets you for a tour, 3 tours per volume and 5 volumes. Car class swapping is optional to repeat each tour with another class. 17% appears after the first tour run. Repeating while optional I think is weak to offer content. FM5 may look like it had less (even if sometimes 100 events) but it sprinkled signature, high/low PI score, auto cross & more in-between, these events have been moved to showcase. So it's only racing & only 'same order of tracks' so if get bored/struggle to progress on tracks this is why, do the showcases whenever feel like it/when they unlock. Some unlock from other showcases but most do the career mode. If preferred giving up on a car class like FM5 well can't really. You can I think change the car class but you aren't changing the track in FM6, in FM5 you could pick any car class championship whenever you wanted, come back & your fine. When you finished the major events you had optional race ones & can redo them but they were all flexible afterwards, FM6 is not flexible & tells the player what to do. Showcase doesn't tell the player what to do just set the scene (history, endurance, cone events, etc.) to have fun. Or FM7 whatever race/special events and car needed. FM6 is very restrictive. If want a straightforward/hand holding career by all means. Compare to PGR2, track/event variety even if car class limited. no PI/PP. I think a bit more flexible in track selection not only car selection/car class focus. It is very much focused on car classes. If you don't want menu jumping that's fair. If you don't want car details of this HP, K cars, tyres, country only, etc. Then you'll enjoy it. If you want to enjoy events with those requirements like GT games or FM1-4 to go about events & strategy limits or the FM3&4 calendar 3 choices/all events list yeah you don't get that here so you might not enjoy this game. Night events are hit & miss. Cool idea to return. The cosmetic option makes the lights break so good luck driving. :) Just word of warning. Track selection is good. Personality is there.. Some old tracks don't return, but some new, some returning. Many layouts. Many real circuits, some good city tracks. No touge/hillclimbs events/locations but many modern racing games don't offer them (some do drift still) as I assume open world ones fill in that gap instead? No idea. PI score like usual. Like gear score if familiar with shooters/RPGs. I look at the car stats not these ranks. Tuning helps but I just went high stat stock cars. Cost vs tuning parts to fit rank ceilings for events wasn't worth it against opponents (that & Forza auto-tuning exists still I think with roulette cars, not dealership). Roulette is new with 1 of 2 level up systems. Still manufacturer discounts for cars level up, roulette for player level. Varies from credits, cars & mod packs. Progression can be broken. If want a fast car well, use it in multiplayer/arcade as class isn't likely open in career tour/volume yet (I think) (PGR2 had quote of fast cars not accessible from start, so 3 fixed that with open approach) as far as it seems. To me this is odd. **** got the right cars 'in order' in FM1-4, FM6 1hr into game a supercar roulette can't use? 2.GT7 has a similar roulette & invites to cars/car parts. Gladly FM6 has none of that. Mods are tweaks. More weight for credit payouts, more grip/more grip on a track, that kind of thing (are other types just picking a handful). There are Green, Blue & Purple. Blue & Purple are more involved positive but a negative catch. Can only use 1 of each not 2 green/blue/purple. Other than weight during a Raptor showcase event I didn't notice any different. I could not beat the event with the mod installed, when removed had no issues. Grip may be there but didn't notice. Use mods if wish, can go without them. Driving model/physics/graphics/damage model are fine no complaints there. It's similar to FM5. FM6 to me is FM5 remixed/few new features. Damage model, auto brake, sim/arcade driving feel & other settings still here & offer xp/credit differences to be easy/hard. AI/drivatar difficulty was ok. Almost struggled with bit above average (in the intro), kept it at normal level/sometimes lower to see how it varied throughout rest of game.. Slightly better than FM5, but still very bad for me, we need a Forza Motorsport 4 again. Played this game a few years back and recently again and decided to make this review. It definitely feels like a step up from 5 in every aspect would not say it’s the best in the franchise as I’ve only played 5 6 and 7 but definitely highly up there. If you enjoy racing games and own a Xbox one you can easily pick it up very cheaply and have a blast.. Forza Motorsport 6 is the best Forza to date. Rewarding and fun gameplay and solid career mode.. Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.. Incredible from every perspective. Not only is it an incredible simulation, but a great game. Progression feels faster, there's more things to do, and the game doesn't take itself too seriously. I only play single-player, because the multiplayer is very laggy and glitchy.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 7 Story: 5 Total: 7.83. Did not enjoy this game at all. Controls were unresponsive and all over the place I’ve never used so many flashbacks in my life and didn’t enjoy the career mode set up.. Graphics 7/10 Playability 8/10 Entertainment 7/10 Overall 7/10 Quite good racing game.. This has to be one of the most addicting games I've ever played, the graphics are amazing and the realisticness is on point , its definitely worth getting the game.. Good points: - Easy to play with a controller, no need for an expensive wheel (as opposed to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars) Bad points: - IA is terrible - Rewind option is too arcade, but because of IA destroying my race I have to keep it - Always start in the middle of the grid - Most races just last more or less 3 laps - Most cars come in expensive DLCs. Forza 6 is a solid racer that will entertain for hours. I would like to see hostable public lobbies as an option, to boot out ""crash racers"" that can make online racing frustrating. The auto match making system works well though. I might pick complaints as time goes on, but one can with everything critically and to be realistic, at the price it is now it's a bargain.. Yes! this is a step to the right direction, this a real Forza game, fun to play, nice nice. Best racing game on xbox one and pc, amazing turn 10, this is a masterpiece. The best racing simulation game of the generation, amazing job turn 10, graphics 10, gameplay 10. It is another Forza game. That's not a bad thing at all. It's a pretty good thing in fact.. [ ] Perfect [x] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. Forza Motorsport 6 is the first auto simulator I 've passed completely (I mean the original 15 seasons and DLC Porsche). Graphics for 1080p is not bad, slow machines are excellent. Here, Forza looks an order of magnitude better than Gran Turismo. But the physics of the machines is surprisingly disappointing, in Forza you can play as an arcade race, but not as a simulator. Separately I want to allocate DLC Porsche, for fans of this car manufacturer it is a tuning gift.. The good: Drivatar 2.0 allows improvements in training and performance of Drivatar. The rain arrives and with it the “dynamic” puddles in 3D. The night also arrives and with it the problems for less experienced players who in the first braking will lose their lights and will not have another one to restart the **** Mod system totally changes the events of the game. The system of qualifying leagues arrives. We see the campaign volumes as divisions and events of the previous Forzas. We see the Motorsport Stories system in which we are asked to choose a scare to compete against others by repeating iconic battles of motoring (very similar to FM3 and FM4 events). There are also exhibits such as Bowlling Car, chase, passing tests, resistance. The game has two expansions that add more hours of play, first the Porsche stories and then NASCAR that add more cars, rivalries, leagues, tunnels and events. New tracks such as Rio de Janeiro, Homestead, Monza. The Mods system that changes the events, challenges, aids and dynamics of the game. It includes the prize roulette inherited ""from its Horizon flavor"", where after leveling up you enter a random roulette of prizes such as cars, credits or mods. It is the game that has made the most changes to the franchise. The bad: The tracks of Japan are missed, which in this game did not return either. The weather is preset. Not all tracks have a stage at night. Lo Meh !: FM6 came out in the times of worst popularity of Xbox One which led to staining this game, many overlooked the quality of the game, which the press did not get tired of grinding sticks with their notes just ""because there was no Great Tourism"". Also at the end of its useful life Microsoft launched a beta-Free to play version called Forza Motorsport: APEX for PC, which only had a hundred cars and a few tracks and many haters swelled to ensure that they could play Forza on their PC ( a very cropped version). Absolute rage inducing game. Needlessly difficult. I can’t win on any difficulty except NEW and often fail then too. It’s not fun repeatedly losing and playing on novice difficulty. I despise this game now. This game is complete garbage. I have gold edition although it doesn't have useful DLCs but it's the best racing game ever released till 2015.. A good driving video game, precious graphics and very well implented controls.. Forza 6 is the best racing game that I have ever played. The moment the rain drops hit my windshield and some debris stuck to my windshield I was hooked. Shortly after I went into a turn and the the ass end of my car Camaro swung out like a boat turning on the water as the wheels began to screech before slingshotting forward. That's the same maneuver that cost me a rear end when I owned an LS1. It was perfect and they had captured it. This game has the best handling and attention to detail that I've ever witnessed. There is always room for improvement and if you are looking for the latest and greatest graphics and multiplayer then you might choose 7. However, if you want the best single player racing experience this is it. The backgrounds are not the best and the crowds are cheap, but the cars and the handling are perfect. If it's not broke don't fix it. I'd say buy this if you don't have an Xbox one X, but if you do then go with 7. This game purrs like a kitten at 60 fps on the one S.. This game what can i **** just plain amazing in every way. it has beautiful cars.graphics,AI(Drivitars),and most importantly is the tracks. the tracks are very realistic. the night racing is fun, but after reading some reviews on other site i agree it would have been more fun if a rainy night race was in the game. the rainy racing is fun it is VERY realistic with the way the car hydro planes and the way the water just roles down the windshield. The car customization screen is also a plus to the game. and all the cars help with the whole affect of the game. its so good it feels like real life. for a guy that's been playing racing game his whole life i personally love this game more than most of the racing game out there(except for NFS underground and underground 2). for any racing gamer's out there this is a must have game for you and your friends.. Forza 6, another great racing game from Turn 10. As someone who never played the less than stellar Forza 5, I never had a bad experience from Forza games. I came from playing Forza 4 on the 360 for countless hours and getting every DLC pack they released for it. Now, since I came from that game, there are many differences between the two that shouldn't surprise. The graphics are much improved from game to game, although I have to say that some of interior dials have numbers that are quite hard to read, but that's nothing kill the score for. What I am killing the score for is the lack of variety of races in career mode. Coming from Forza 4 means that you come from having a large list of different races to do that would probably take you until the end of time to complete. While I wasn't necessarily looking for that, I did expect more than I got. The showcase events are fun, especially the endurance ones, but I still wish there were more of them, since the standard story mode is very repetitive and boring quite frankly. It also seems like there are less normal production cars like there were in 4 and more race cars, which isn't a bad thing, but it was nice to create crazy fast cars out of your normal daily driver type cars. One of the bigger positives is the addition of new tracks such as COTA and VIR, and new versions of the existing tracks from the prior games. All in all, I still find much joy playing this game for hours on end and can't wait for Forza 7 towards the end of this year. Hopefully since that game is going to have around 700 cars to start, it will have more car variety.. This game has fantastic game mechanics, but terrible game play. Say goodbye to Career mode. The Career mode is what made the Forza series so much fun - buying a crappy car, upgrading it to be more competitive in other classes, and racing it over and over. None of that exists in Forza 6. In the new Career mode, there are little races which require you to buy and drive a different car for every race. They even auto-upgrade your car to be competitive, a nice way of dumbing it down. All the little things in Forza 6 they changed, just ruined it compared to Forza 4 (the last Forza game I really enjoyed). The list of terrible changes is long: - The menu system ****. Buttons do different actions at different menus and it will forever confuse you. - Test drives start right away. Say goodbye to drag racing. - Test drives don't show your ghost. Say goodbye to learning the track or racing yourself. - Test drives don't save your laptimes. Say goodbye to recording hot laps. - You can only bring certain cars to certain race events. Say goodbye to driving a muscle car in aJapanese import race. - Career mode ****, which I already explained above. - Rewards are completely random, it's literally a slot machine system, you get credits by getting lucky, not by driving better. I'm a single-player kind of guy when it comes to racing sims. What I love to do is buy all the cars and thoroughly test them. Put them through the quarter mile, half mile, full mile, record the times. Drive them over and over at my favorite tracks racing my previous ghost and see how the upgrades affect performance. Taking a dinky Trueno and upgrading it to become a beast in Career mode and racing it against other cars. All of those things, I can no longer do in Forza 6. They improved the game mechanics but ripped out the game play in the process.. An awesome entry on the series, making proud all the XBO users with the most realistic racing game until gran turismo sport hopefully, great soundtrack, the tracks are well designed, the car variety is decent and the feel of driving is just there, I'm not too convinced on the car sounds but its ok.. Best Forza Game I've Played. In fact this is the best racing game I've ever played even though I couldn't run low settings 60FPS.. The mission things you can do are great, I played them over and over again that's how fun they are!. The best racer on any platform period! The graphics are beautiful in smooth 60fps. Only complaints are lack of system link and triplescreen setup. With that it would have been a solid 10!. Been playing Forza since the 1st title and I am a huge forza fan.. well used to be, before I bought fifth installment and this game. I have always played with a pad without any assists. I'm constantly in top 1% in lap times on global scale. Driving is more realistic than ever. That I'm afraid is the only good thing. AI is so bad and blind to player actions that I stopped playing after 30 to 35 hours. This isn't a racing sim, it's destruction derby simulator. AI is constantly crashing into something. When AI ruins your game on the last lap of endurance race by deciding to brake in the middle of a straight without any reason so you crash into them.. Let's just say that I would rather cut my face off and wear it as a hat, than play this garbage anymore. Porsche DLC is an instant -5 from me. Porsche should already be in the game. AAA titles are worse and worse every year. I have had much more fun playing indie games lately. And more often I find myself picking up an older generation controller instead of ps4 or xbox one. Even nes and snes. My score of 3 comes purely from physics and graphics which are both great. But the fact is, that isn't enough for a good racing game.. This game is the worst Forza of all time. Man where do we **** what about this stupid narrator that you cant turn off and you have to endure that for the first 20hrs in a way that will have to lower the volume. Then lets get to the worst part of the game; AI combined with the worst physics of all time!! OH MY GOD!! They go faster when you are close behind. They will hit you like its a demolition derby. So much for simulation gaming LOLL Then when you barely touch them, they brake and brake until you almost get to zero! What a joke!!? where is the clown who made that possible!! Your car will get stuck under his car and you cannot get out of there unless you decelerate to almost 1/3 of the speed you can go. The physic is so unrealistic that if you ever drove a fast car or played any good game, youll see that the car behave like nothing you could expect. Money is useless in the game. ''Mods''(special card that gives you penalty for extra credit that you will never need) are useless. And the night **** this is a joke!! 1million car and they light up like a 5k beater hahahah poor game it is!! Any racing in rain is boring as hell; rain effect is a big joke too LOL The DLC is a freaking theft system!! I mean you cant play the GT350, Camaro 16', all the porsche unless buying the pack and many more. What a deception. Menus are a big POS, plain and simple. This is the worst racing game I've played, EVER! All that for 69$ Graphs are good/great. Thats the best part.. This review is only for the offline mode in the game. I have, however, downloaded all the small car packs and the Porsche and Nascar Expansions, which give an overall better feel for the game. Like most people I rate Forza 4 as the highlight in the series but was keen to see what direction the Forza team have taken the game after the aborted attempt they gave us in Forza 5. Pros- Insane number and variety of cars Fun door-to-door racing Endurance is back! Free Play is 50 laps offline Smooth menu navigation Windscreen rain and dirt effects Engine bays on many cars Cons- Career is a long, boring and pointless grind No qualifying or race weekend Simple physics, track and tire temperature Average track feedback Lack of dynamic weather Baked lighting on tracks Free play does not have enough options to tailor a race Audio still not up to Forza 4 heights Little innovation in the series since Forza 3 It is a shame that the game has so many many things against it as I really do enjoy it, but there is no point juggling a few good balls when you leave the rest lying on the floor. Come on Turn 10- I know you are better! Game Rating- 7 out of 10 Fun Factor- 8 out of 10 Overall Rating- 7.5 out of 10. The ""10"" reviewers are ignorant arcade players. Period. Where did all the tech go? Customizing cars is what Forza excelled at. Now there's no wrenching involved. You can upgrade various parts to ""Street"" or ""Race"", and it doesn't even tell you what the stock parts are. Is that a 5.0, 4.6, 1.8TT? No idea! Because it doesn't tell you. Just a generic speed rating. I got fed up and quit playing for a long while. Then I gave Forza 6 another try, and found a drivatar setting that turns off aggressiveness. I run it at above avg or one step higher and usually get into 1st place within the first lap, so that's a good sign. But, any AI level higher fakes the cars rather than increasing actual driving skill which ruins the experience. The AI cars still crash stupidly around every corner. Such terrible AI. But at least they don't actively go after you with that setting turned off. They still accelerate without regard for the car's actual capabilities. Fake challenge. Drivatar AI is so stupid it's almost unplayable solo in career mode. Out of 23 cars, the bottom 12 will just try to ram you off the track while the top 12 will speed up or slow down %-wise regardless of the cars' capabilities (such as top speed, which is ignored). This is supposed to be semi-pro/pro racing, and half the cars ram right into the player!? And Turn 10 thought that was a good idea? AS if that's how pro racing works? What is this, Daytona USA, circa 1995? At higher difficulty setting, the top 2 cars will accelerate like Star Wars pod racers regardless of the car, and then if you manage to pass them, they suddenly seem to have engine trouble because they fall WAY behind quickly. Another thing that irritates me is you get a ton of money and free cars and really don't even have to work for them. I get that Turn 10 wants players to experience a lot of cars but there used to be a challenge to it. I also miss seeing ACTUAL component names and performance data. Now it's dumbed down to the point it's not fun at all for a gearhead. Since when did Ford make a 5.7L V8? Or a V12? That ruins the fun for me further beyond the driving problems. Previous Forza games used actual hardware from real companies for upgrades, like Roush and Saleen equipment to upgrade Mustangs, and real Ford engines for engine swaps. Instead, it looks like every category has the same generic 5.7L engine upgrade: Ford, Chevy, and Dodge. Unless I missed something. That ****. For the Fords, you should see the 5.0L (GT/Boss 302), the 5.2L GT350, the 5.8L GT500, etc engines. Such a shame. So much potential. And where is the Boss 302 Laguna Seca? Where are the REAL cars? After the 12th Lambo I have lose interest in supercars and want a real-world driving experience pitting real American cars against other real American cars--or maybe an exotic from time to time. No luck, the cars are too limited. Forza 4 was far superior to this game in the most important aspects that matter to a racing fan. From the car upgrades to the car SELECTION to the AI, this is a downgrade. Besides larger scale tracks with dust and night and rain, the graphics aren't far enough beyond 4 to accept the dumbing-down of the game to this low level.. No proper controller settings makes it a chore to play, all cars feel like they under steer way to much, only way to counter this is have all the assists on so no credits. Will be trading it in and stick to project cars.. I was a little late purchasing Forza 6, though I love the series I just never got around to buying the sixth installment till recently. This game is gorgeous, and lots of fun with over 400 cars, tons of tracks and almost everything is adjustable/customizable. The game itself is not perfect as there seems to be unbalanced difficulty with some drivatars, and when racing in the rain the puddles cause massive sliding and temporary loss of control. One big gripe that I have is the mandatory tutorials and the videos (which are well done) but unskippable. Microtransactions return here just like in Forza 5. Overall this is the definitive racer on Xbox One currently (far surpassing Project cars) and if you don't mind shelling out an extra $20 bucks the Nascar add-on is fantastic.. This is a goob game , but the online mode is a chaos and I cannot play good like I want and the career mode I completed the career mode in 7 hours , is ridicolus. An amazing racing game on PC. This game series should have released on PC since Forza Horizon 2. How wonderful it will be that you play it in 4K, 60fps!! I can't wait for Forza Horizon 3!!. I bought this game upon it's release because I wanted a racing game for my Xbox One and I had purchased Forza Motorsport 1 and 2 for the Xbox 360 and enjoyed it alot. This is a racing game at it's peak. I love it! The handling is something to get used to for the newb in the series but it's so realistic and once you get it down, awesome! I recently have picked it up and been playing alot, online it is competition. I EVEN GOT MY DAD PLAYING IT AND HE DOESN'T EVEN GAME! He loves it and wants to buy a steering wheel to play. Honestly for all of the detail and effort the developers put into this game, I can't nitpick any flaw from it and give it a rating under 10 because this game is all about the cars and racing, and so much more! Ha you could even use it as an engine simulator!. After all the updates and having purchased VIP, Porsche and NASCAR dlc content, this feels like a 9, so much great content, good online, excellent grapics in my opinion because the 60fps helps with this. 60fps really adds something to the gameplay as well as graphics, this is a superb highly technical simulation racer, that will appeal to track racing fans, though not so much with casual racing fans that prefer open world racing, if your a track racing fan and want a great simulation challenge, you will likely really enjoy this.. The most annoying problem of this game are small fonts. It's terrible. I have never seen so small fonts in any game before. Many people asked to increase it (on official game developer's forum ****), but still nothing. I have a good sight, but tired to strain my eyes with that small tiny fonts. Another problem of Forza Motorsport 6 that there are no volume adjustments at all. I want to make music louder, but I can't do that. I want to make engine sounds louder and make quieter sound effects, but I can't. I have a Forza Horizon 2 with all the DLC from this game, and it's amazing. It has good readable fonts and volume adjustments. I love this game. Just one simple question: why Turn10 guys can't do that simple things with Motorsport 6? I regret, that I have bought this game and I will not buy anything from Turn10 in future, and I will not recommend this game to no one, cause Turn10 (game developer) don't care about users.. the best racing game I've seen in my life, is splendid graphically and has a very good playability, the scoring system is neither just nor nor unfair is well programmed, not be nor as saying the emotion I had when playing this game,, but cars , it has bery good cars!. GOOD: Excellent graphics and car details, 60 fps, nice additions (like mods), new weathers are excellent additions, very good controls. BAD: Race structures not too good, feel like too few tracks, controls sometimes feel a little unrealistic.. I really liked this game. I had a damn good time. i always plays this game when i only got 1 hour of gameplay, the time really flew by when i played it. I give it an 8 because i'm not a big fan of racing games. Buy it if you want something casual and to kill time.. This game isn't perfect, but it's close. There are so many game types beyond the standard career that you could play it for 6 months and not finish them all. Between the Leagues, the Showcases, and online racing, it offers lots of extra content above and beyond your standard linear racer, and you can step out of the career mode and do them at any time. The graphics are standard Forze, which is to say fantastic. They finally got Porsches in there so you no longer have to buy the RUF and pretend you're driving a 911 Carrera. If you're a Forza or racing game fan, don't worry about buying this title. Turn 10 just continues to improve its product, and not just with slicker graphics or more cars, but by expanding your gameplay types, as well.. This game is very overrated, obv not a 0 but sure as hell nothing higher than an 8, i gave it a 0 mainly as a response to all the unnecessary 10's, I bet most of the people who gave it that haven't even played it, stupid fanboys. Excellent Game - Ugly Microtransactions The game itself is absolutely great for every car enthusiast. 450 cars, a wide range of race tracks, rain and night races, visual and performance tuning of every car, ForzaVista mode for showcasing cars, etc... However, the game contains ugly and unnnecessary microtransactions that can't be turned off. When I buy a game for the full price, I want to have a full game and not developers wanting to urge me to invest the same amount of money again. Every time I want to purchase a car with the game currency, I have to see 20 or more cars tagged as ""DLC"". These cars can neither be driven in any way nor purchased with game currency. Players are supposed to buy very expensive expansion packs. The game's microtransaction system is worse than in any free-to-play game, and the developer makes a truly greedy impression. I would give the game 10/10 if I could disable DLC cars and not show them, because the game itself is brilliant, but the microtransactions really annoy and ****.. Although Forza Motorsport 6 is the best Forza game had in the franchise (in my opinion), I think it still is a somewhat bland and boring racing game compared to the best. I enjoy the game, but it certainly doesn't bring all the hype everyone (including me) was giving it. It is fun, but not as enjoyable as other racing simulator games. And one of the problems is the drivitars are either left in dust by your car or a million miles in front. The game does have MANY more tracks and cars then Forza 5. But it definitly needs room for improvement. If you do get a racing steering wheel however, it is a more engaging experience by a lot. But still, racing simulators should be WAY more advanced it's 2016! But it is a fun game, even though I occasionally start falling asleep driving.. Forza 6 is a beautiful racing simulator that values the art and science of racing as well as the drama and theatrics that often make racing games so appealing. All in all, Forza 6 is lacking in very few areas, and the overall racing experience is one of complete enjoyment.. Forza Motorsport 6 may be the perfect racing game. It does everthing 2013's Forza 5 does and more. There are more tracks, cars, and modes in Forza 6. Also, the core driving experience, technical achievement, and level of accessibility in Turn 10's new racing sim are superb. Forza 6 may be the best racing game ever made.. I can simply say that this game is revolutionary in racing game history. With hundreds of fantastic cars all in stunning detail (and with eargasmic sounds) to choose from and tons of tracks (I could not count how many) each with their own style of driving required, this game is blow-the-roof brilliant. Everything done wrong in Forza 5 is checked, fixed, and polished with piles of extra content put on top like the",i was his biggest fan and now i hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything . if enjoy linear career modes/less car detail event entry racing games enjoy.
748.Donkey Kong Country Returns,"The best 2D game of all time. One of the best soundtracks in video games, partly inherited from the first title in the series and remastered to perfection. Exquisite level design that presents a great challenge with its high difficulty (and even more so if you're brave enough to complete it 200%, as I did). In my case, it was the first game in the series I played. I was very young and couldn't get past the infamous World 4 Cave. Many years later, I returned (after finishing Tropical Freeze) and ended up completing everything the game had to offer. This then encouraged me to play the original SNES trilogy, which is a gem and ultimately became my favorite video game series.. What a game. This was the only game I got my nihilistic little brother to play with me. AndI actually got to see him smile, too.. One of my favorite games on Wii, I had a ton of hours enjoying the diversity of this game as a kid, musics and general atmosphere are great.. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a challenging 2D platformer by Retro Studios. Unlike their Metroid Prime series this DKC title doesn't go in a completely different direction. The gameplay is very truthful to the original with some minor tweaks and the overall design also feels very similar. My biggest complaint with this game is that the music team didn't take any risks. What's so great about the original Rare games is that each game had a completely original soundtrack. Retro went the easy route and almost all the music is recycled. The music is great but only because it was already great fifteen years ago. I wish they could have hired David Wise again to compose an original soundtrack that would surprise us just like DKC2 did. I have other minor complaints, like how the game has less content than the other games. The secret world is not that special, there are fewer Kongs and animal buddies. Still, the platforming is some of the best you'll find on Wii and the game is challenging, but not brutal. This is not the best game in the Donkey Kong Country series but it is a great addition to the series.. Donkey Kong Country Returns feels slow at first, but as you clean up mistakes and learn more difficult timings, you start to glide through the levels.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game built my childhood. So diverse, so hard, so fresh. A must have for every 3ds owner.. Along with Galaxy 2, this is the perfect example of what a sequel/remake should look like. It completely reinvents the original Country trilogy, but still maintains some elements, like Rambi. New villains are a good alternative to K. Rool, and the game offers quite a challenge, while still being accessible to casual players as well. Ost is amazing as well, definitely worth trying at least once!. It’s a great 2D platformer. The levels are unique. It’s a must buy for the Wii.. For my part, judging this game with subjectivity is a rather difficult task, given that it is the first game on the large list of games bought in garage sales and it is a game to which I have devoted a lot of Time. The game is a 2D platform game, in which you can influence the elements of the foreground and background. The game offers a wide range of movement, which goes from simple jumps to long rolls on the ground, a lot of movement uses the motion gaming brought by the wiimote. The work on the artistic direction of Retrostudio is remarkable, the game is part of the most beautiful product on the patetic technical architecture of the wii for the time. The levels are all different from each other, so early we are in a jungle and we are at the beach, in a factory or caves. Levels are packed full of collectibles to collect for bonus images or game information. That's why this game made my top 10 best game in the world.. Best platformer game I've ever played. The gameplay mechanics are very enjoyable and the level design is incredible, some levels are just jaw-dropping and they have their own unique art-style. The music is fantastic and really fits with the game. There are also some ""music levels"" that are solely focused on the music which are very unique and cool. As for content, there's a decent amount of it, making the game very replayable if you want a challenge. And lastly, the boss fights are interesting and pretty decent, some of them are simple enough but they look great, and some others are quite tough. Overall, this game contains everything a platformer needs, a must-play if you are a fan of this genre. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. The game that brought it back to its amazing routes, tons of fun challenges in each level, a must play for the Wii. Let’s hope for a switch port!. Really solid platformer - it's crazy how good nintendo is at making great platformers. Just like many of their other games, the level design is exceptional and innovative, and controlling the characters feels awesome and super natural. Overall, I just don't have many negative things to say about this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Simply one of the best games ive played. Incredibly detailed, exciting level design and awesome soundtrack, a game made with love. The story starts off with a group of masked villains stealing all the bananas in the island and brain washing all the animals other than the Kongs into doing whatever they ask. The quest is to defeat each of these masked villains and restore things they way they were on the island. You get to play as Donkey Kong in one player mode with Diddy Kong as an assist if you crack open the DK barrel. Diddy acts as an assist by using his jet packs to help Donkey Kong hover for a couple more seconds from a jump. This can be useful if you make a timing mistake on your jump. The game can be completed without the aid of Diddy but that would be really hard. The most important aspect all of you gamers are wondering is probably whether or not this version does the classic versions of Donkey Kong justice. Although it is not identical, I can assure you that the art style and new play styles are refreshing and fun. You can expect there to be great classic platforming. Blasting from barrel to barrel is in it. Something chasing after you to force you to go faster is in. Rambi is in. Mine carts is in. Now, there are a handful of new aspects also. I'll try to name them all. At first glance the graphics are improved obviously. I think it did a great job on that. The enemies are very different. They range from squids and crabs to robots and drums. Personally, I wish that they included some of the old baddies from the original. That would give the game much more nostalgia. I guess they wanted to give things a new look. There are sequences in the game where you ride a rocket barrel either upwards or side ways. The screen keeps going right or up and the game keeps throwing obstacles at you. This was done very well actually. It is one of the most challenging parts of the game. They replaced jumping from rope to rope to jumping from chains to chains. It's different, but not better in my opinion. Bosses in this version are a lot harder and innovative. It was a lot of fun. Retro also did not include any of the animals except Rambi, which kinda ****, but the gameplay is still amazing. It would just just been interesting if they added more animals. Other than going back to collect everything, there isn't too much replay value to this. There is no way to compare time trials or anything unfortunately. Something is unlocked at the end of the game, which I don't want to spoil. You must collect all the orbs in the island to be able to enter into this ""something"". I really hope they will make a sequel, with more classic aspects. Overall this is still an amazing game. Retro did a really great job bringing Donkey Kong back old school style!. Great platformer with beautiful graphics, interesting control and amazing soundtrack!. Donkey Kong Country Returns is an amazing return to the series. Donkey Kong Country's 2D platforming is leagues ahead of any other 2D platforming. Even the original is better then almost every platformer ever. In fact the original is my favorite platformer ever, and my third favorite game ever. So does DKCR live up to the original? YES!! This game is an amazing platformer. Every level is perfectly designed. There isn't a level that I felt was unoriginal or boring they were all incredible. There are four types of levels. You have your standard platforming levels, which all have a certain and original gimmick which make them awesome and memorable. You have your minecart levels which are always fun, and tense fast pace levels where you have to think fast. Then you have your rocket levels which have you continuously press A, or 2 to keep your rocket from falling or hitting rubble. Last you have your boss levels. The bosses are some of the best in the series. DKC isn't known for it's bosses, but this game has some good ones. Overall this game is just a blast from beginning to end. I give DKCR a 9/10 and an A+.. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a great-looking Wii game and it is so much fun to play. Starring Donkey & Diddy, you'll be traversing through a variety of exotic levels, while using several known ""Kong"" moves and attacks, as well as some new ones. The soundtrack is packed with classic tunes and brand new ones that evoke a tropical feel so beautifully. So if you have a Wii and/or a Wii U and you love platformers, then you'll love this game.. Best platformer game I've ever played, the music is awesome, the gameplay mechanics are very enjoyable and the level design is incredible.. Donkey Kong: Country Returns is easily one of my favorite video games of all time and means a lot to me personally. I absolutely love the level design. All the levels are very creative and fit the jungle-esque vibes of Donkey Kong Island. I absolutely adore the bosses. They're all very interesting and fun to fight. They bring a good challenge and are certainly one of the best parts of the game. Another thing I love is the music. The remakes are very solid and I listen to them regularly. The atmosphere of this game slaps me in the knee. Everything feels fitting, even the factory world. Every level tells a story. One level, you're being tossed around a factory with robotic chickens in it. Another level, you're running away a horde of spiders that will gnaw on your monkey butt. I absolutely love how DK controls in this game. He has amazing momentum and it's really easy to pull off actions. His jump has perfect weight and his speed is just right. In conclusion, this is an incredibly solid platformer, and is certainly worth your time. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. Game has frustrating controls, even with emulator. Hitboxes are off, you need to move to roll, mid air control is not good. The game is not fun to play. No underwater levels, few animals (I think only the Rhino is there). Game looks pretty good though. I've played the original 3 DCC games previously.. Just gonna say that I played this game when it came out and it was pretty fun, replayed it recently and its even better now. This is one of the best wii games alongside Mario Kart Wii, 007, Wii Sports, Super Smash Bros. Brawl. and Zelda: Twilight Princess. The controls of this game are so smooth and responsive and playing the story mode is so fun. Even though some stages are really hard but I like a challenge so it's not a problem.. A great 2D platformer and one of the best-looking games on the Wii. The gameplay is great; however, you might need some time to get used to the motion controls.. a truly fantastic 2d-platformer with brutally challenging, old-school difficulty. some people may be a little bit put off by it's difficulty, and I must admit I was a bit myself in the early stages, but that eventually wore off, and I welcomed it more and more. the feeling of satisfaction after beating it's toughest levels was very addicting, and just made me want to play more until I finally beat it. the bosses are also quite tough, but the strategy for beating them are really fun. RetroStudios has proven again and again that they're masters of game-creativity, and this game is no exception. If you love platformers, and welcome a real challenge - get this game!. Easily the worst game I played. The game is controller breaking difficult that it isn’t fun, motion controls, and nothing happens. The game goes at a snails pace, that makes the game take forever. I only just recently finished this trash bin, and I regret every second. If you’re looking for a good Wii game, just buy shovelware. People say they all ****, but at least it’s a better time.. The Wii version was a blast, but the Nintendo 3DS version, I went bananas for this version & this was the greatest remake game off all time!. Donkey Kong Country Returns is the best platformer on the wii. I recently bought the game at gamestop for my dustfilled wii and soon realized what I missed out of as a kid. I hear some saying its really hard and even frustrating, but thats because theyre getting frustrated at the game for dying when they shouldnt be, because all the deaths are the player's fault. The enemies arent OP, the controls arent unresponsive(and quite good for the wiimote), and the levels designs arent unfair. - That said, the game is hard. ys thts it -The gameplay is smooth and refreshing from other wii titles, and very satisfying. By that I mean it feels GOOD to footstool the enemy, it amazing to see that stupid bird fly towards the screen when you roll into it. I find that almost every level(espcially in the beach world) im sitting in my basement going like ""NOTHING CAN TOP THIS"" when the next level just goes ahead and blows the last out of the water -The art style is Very Donkey Kong(no complaints) The music is fricking amazing, even the soverworld music when you travel between levels I could jam out to for hours. In conclusion, buy this game and Im sorry this is my first metcritic review.. DKCR is a really good platformer with a decent challenge, that they had to ruin with **** motion controls. I'm sorry, but how does **** my wiimote make me feel like donkey kong is slamming the ground? Thank god for the 3DS version. The game also lacks soul though, it has that generic unity game feel to it. And the pig is annoying as hell. DK makes a triumphant return. He now moves with momentum suited to someone his size, which was lacking in the original. This allows controlling DK to feel a lot more enjoyable, and the overall platforming to feel more fluid. The rolling also assists in creating this sense of fluidity, and also allows many levels to be tried to sped through, requiring more skill and precision than otherwise. Soundtrack is still great, the overall visual design is great and Diddy's hover adds a new way to tackle many levels. The only problem is that the boss battles are pretty dull in comparison. Some of them are creative in using your surroundings, such as the Forest boss, but others are weak, in particular, the final boss battle left a lot to be desired. Still, a great game, that improves in all the right areas, while still maintaining the incredible sense of creativity and enjoyment of it's predecessors.. First of all great music even if it is greatly a remake of the stellar Rareware music. Great game overall with some criticism. Too difficult, clumsy usage of the Wii controls. After so much hype for the motion controls by Nintendo you would expect the signature games of the console to make good use of it, but no, the response is slow and bad.. ""Donkey Kong Country Returns"" feels like a mix between the classic DKC games with a boatload of fresh new ideas. This game is perfect for beginners and experts! The Kongs' Banana Hoard has been stolen once again, but for a very different reason this time. That is where Donkey Kong and his pal Diddy Kong set out to find out just what that reason is! The game is a 2D platformer, like your typical Mario, but each and every level is filled with secrets and collectibles that will have keep coming back for more! Some levels involve the mine cart rides, which are a blast with remixed music! There are also Rocket-Barrel levels, which test your quick reflexes. Even if you finish the game, you still have a lot to complete! Puzzle pieces, Kong letters and more! Go bananas for this game, 'cause it's worth it!. I've just finished this game on Wii U after a 2-year hiatus. First of all, Wii U ****. It's the worst designed console I ever owned. And this negative context of using it detracts from the game. I think, I'd like it more if I've played it on Wii. It's a fun game at its core. With strong mechanics and reasonable curve of introducing new concepts. However, I didn't like it that much in the end. Pros: +Catchy tunes +Skill-oriented gameplay +Stylish b&w levels +Fun to play with a friend Cons: -Wii U **** -The game is too difficult and annoying. Especially, the last world & all flying sections. -Nunchuck as a controller ****. I've never got used to it. -The art style is too childish in many places.. Really solid platformer - it's crazy how good nintendo is at making great platformers. Just like many of their other games, the level design is exceptional and innovative, and controlling the characters feels awesome and super natural. Overall, I just don't have many negative things to say about this game.. Fantastic. That's all I have to say about this game if I'm limited to one word. If you have a Wii or a 3DS and feel bored of the 2D Mario games, then, just give DK a chance! This game has great level design, a very memorable soundtrack, interesting mechanics, and a VERY high difficulty for a 2010 Nintendo game. The bosses are simple, but really satisfying to hit them in the face 20 times to finish them off. However, the soundtrack does not have that much variety, the multiplayer could have been better, getting coins sometimes feels pointless when you have a lot of them, and the bonus world only has ONE level in the Wii version, but I prefer ONE hard level instead of just bland rehashes of previous areas like in the 3DS version, with 9 levels. But overall, this game is just outstanding. If I had to pick a version, I'd stick with the Wii one. But if you can get it for 3DS, you will still have a masterpiece ****. (PS: DKC Returns should be ""DKC 4"" so people don't think it's a remake).. Finally this game come back, the history its good, but the soundtrack takes you to the Snes DK, I really think this game is funny and also hard to play, so that make you think, it's not only for children, Fantastic Design of levels. This game is super fun and a great welcoming back to the game series we MUST love. If anyone hates this game you probably don't know what a great game is.. This game builds up a solid gameplay with solid graphics, bringing back the old days with a solid experience. Donkey Kong Country Returns is worth a play and another one at it.. This game is not best on the Wii . This game some better than New Super Mario Bros Wii . This game has got a nostalgia . In this game should not be awesome graphics and amazing gameplay . This is nostalgic game as New Super Mario Bros Wii . Normal game .. Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of those classic 2D platformer so dear to Nintendo with an emblematic character of the brand, then of course you'll expect a very good platformer, now lets talk about why the game isn't a disappointment at all. First technically the game looks good for the Wii, it's not gorgeous but will definitely not hurt your eyes. Solid framerate and 0 bug during all the playthrough, precise hit-box for all the characters, responsive controls, etc. The game is perfect on this ground. Now about the gameplay it's basically genuine for the 2D platformer genre, with very few new ideas, but the formula didn't need to change so I'll not consider this as a con for the game, there is a good curve of difficulty in the game between the super easy first world to the hardcore last world where the game is almost a Die & Retry, specially the levels on rails or rocket. Concerning the wiimote controls there is a slight problem here, all the skills are based on the same movement and a particular tilt of the joystick in the nunchuck and therefore many times I died rolling over a platform when I only wanted to breeze the flower at the edge, this could have been change during testing. But globally the game is very fun with some challenge that will frustrate you just enough to give you a good feeling of accomplishment. Like all good platformers the game is full of collectible and bonus stages and if you look for everything the game should last about 20 hours, which is very good, unfortunately I will have the same criticism that I have for almost all Nintendo games, where is the story ? The little there is could have been written by a 6 year old, in my opinion they should really change that and give more importance to the characters and purpose, even more when the universe of the game is very rich like in Donkey Kong. All in all Donkey Kong Country Returns is a great 2D platformer with a handful of content, challenging levels, good bosses, fun gameplay (with one minor default on the mapping of the controls) that I'll definitively advice to old-school players looking for a retro platformer, but not to story oriented players.. I played Tropical Freeze before Returns, but I found that Returns is just a charming and innovative. The level design is fantastic and the environments are just as lively as they are in the sequel. Retro really did a great job breathing new life into this franchise. Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the Wii's best games and I definitely recommend it for both casual and veteran platformer fans.. This is truly an amazing and at times for challenging 2D platform and if you have a Wii or plan on getting one, this is a game you need to own. It's a lot of fun and definitely worth playing, every island is more beautiful than the last and defeating the final boss feels great, also when you beat the game there's more challenges to do afterwards which can be frustrating but you feel like you accomplished something when you beat them.. When it comes to the difficulty of the top platformers for the Wii, I'd say Epic Yarn is the easiest, Mario is medium, and this is the hardest. It's a fun game with lots of fresh gimmicks and variety, and the story cutscenes are cute. DK at his best.. This is a great game! The DK country series is back! The graphics are great for Wii. The controls are good. The level designs are awesome. This game also has a Mario Kart track based on it called DK Jungle. DKC Returns is a great game and you should definitely buy it.. e game's story focuses on a group of evil creatures called Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe that arrive on Donkey Kong Island,[7] and hypnotize the island's animals to steal Donkey Kong's bananas. This forces him to retrieve the hoard with the help of his friend Diddy Kong.[8] Donkey Kong Country Returns is the series' first traditional home console installment since Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (2005), and also the first Donkey Kong Country entry not to involve British video game developer Rare during its development.. I felt the difficulty was a bit much with it getting genuinely frustrating at times and all the jigsaw collecting felt a little like a chore but other than that this is a great game that every Wii owner ought to have tried. Great visuals, gameplay very true to the originals and plenty of content as well as a cool soundtrack and co-op mode make it highly recommended.. I remember the day this game was first announced, a little before around that time I was just already getting into the Donkey Kong Country series and around that time of hearing all about when Rare left Nintendo back in 2002, it made me really sad because It made me think that there almost was no hope for the return of Donkey Kong, especially after also hearing how disappointed fans were when they played Jungle Beat on the GameCube and how much that game didn't give tribute to DKC; so I lost hope, I thought to myself ""Man, they will never make a new game following the old Donkey Kong Country formula again."" So when I saw Nintendo post the first trailer for Donkey Kong Country Returns, I freaked out! I got so excited, and when I got it I definitely enjoyed it. Pros: -Excellent gameplay and controls! -Wonderful atmospheres. -Nostalgic Music at it's finest. -Rambi is a fun to play. -Cool bosses. -Fun secrets to discover. -Cranky's shop is cool with neat items and Cranky being ""cranky"" as usual. -Nice long adventure that never feels boring after a while. Cons: -Can get very difficult after a while to where a lot of deaths would occur. -No underwater levels. -I would've liked to have seen more Animal Buddies and Kong members. -The Rocket Barrel levels had some frustrating controls. -The Tiki enemies felt very lacking in characteristics. So I do think that DKCR is a great game, but nothing that I am super enthusiastic about. When I get myself a Wii U, I really hope to get myself Tropical Freeze soon after.. Introduction Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Wii was a Donkey Kong Country reboot developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo in 2010. The Tiki Tak Tribe have hypnotised animals into stealing bananas which Donkey and Diddy Kong must retrieve. Donkey Kong Country Returns has kept the old features of Donkey Kong Country and added more. Overview The game offers 1- and 2- player modes. Player 1 controls Donkey Kong and 2-player mode sees player 2 take control of Diddy Kong. There are 8 worlds in the game comprised of a number of stages, each world with a different theme. By the end of world 2, the game becomes challenging and each world ends with a hard boss battle. Gameplay The game can be controlled with the nunchuck attachment, or classic-style by turning the Wiimote sideways. Donkey and Diddy pound the ground, roll and blow air by the player shaking the controller. Shaking the controller can be awkward, though. Collecting Diddy Kong in 1-player mode offers Donkey a jetpack to temporarily hover, which serves to make life easier. Unlike in the original Donkey Kong Country, in this game Donkey and Diddy start with two hearts, one of which is lost when injured. Losing all lives only means the player loses any checkpoint reached, so there may as well not be a life counter. Banana coins can be used at Cranky Kong’s Shop to unlock more stages or to buy items. Extra lives, Squawks who can help you find puzzle pieces, an extra heart or banana juice to make you temporarily invincible can all be purchased from Cranky’s Shop. There are more than enough banana coins in the game. Like Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong Country Returns includes minecart and barrel shooting stages. In addition to these are new rocket barrel stages. The player presses a button to elevate the rocket barrel as it passes through the stage Helicopter Game style. The game also includes animals from Donkey Kong Country like the rhino. Aesthetics Donkey Kong Country Returns doesn’t push the graphical capabilities of its system like Donkey Kong Country did for the Super Nintendo. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a 2.5D game, rendering 3D sprites in a 2D platformer. Some of the music in the game is a familiar throwback to Donkey Kong Country. Replayability Finding all of the KONG letters and puzzle pieces gives the game replayability. Doing so unlocks extras in the image, music and diorama galleries. The puzzle pieces are hard to find. Conclusion Fans of platformers must play. 9/10. This is easily on of the best games i have played in a long time. Fantastic level design, great graphics, smooth gameplay and remarkable soundtracks. Every level feels diffrent from the last, and theres so many hidden areas to explore, not to mention the great amount of collectibles. The boss fights are really great aswell. Highly recommend this game.. I find it stupid for someone to give this game a negative score just because it's hard, that's what makes a game fun. It's been so long since a Donkey Kong Country game came out and boy did they do a good job the only thing i'm wondering is where are the kremlins.. To be honest, I thought that Nintendo just forgot about the Donkey Kong Country series, but when Donkey Kong Country Returns came out this is the first DK Country game not to be made with Rare but with Retro Studios. I wish Rare would come back to Nintendo to make good games again like they did before. Score: 4/5.. I don't think Donkey Kong Country Returns is that good **** for many reasons being the controls, the cheap deaths, the over use of motion controls, and many other reasons. But it isn't that bad the game can control well sometimes and the art style is really good I just hope Retro Studios does better on the next game.. The donkey kong series has been revived in the best possible way. The latest installment borrows ideas from other 2D platformers, but makes them all its own through unique twists and punishing difficulty. It's pure platforming bliss, and will especially impress hardcore gamers. The wii's motion sensing is put to subtle use- mainly for hammering the ground, one of Donkey Kong's many actions. There are eight worlds to explore, each with their own nine or so levels. There's a jungle world, a cave, and more. These may not seem original, but the many original mechanics, objects and bossses you come across certainly are. The settings are brought to life by lush graphics full-of-life scenery, charming music and great sound effects. Enemies are creatively designed and levels are expertly crafted. The difficulty is especially high, and will even challenge hardcore players. Seriously, Country Returns has a brutal difficulty level that will delight fans of the series. Many a time I got a game over, but it's never unfair- every time you die, it's due to your own mistakes rather than dodgy level design. One of my favourite elements of Country Returns is the barrel blasting. This mehanic has you time your exit out of a barrel/cannon thing. It propels you quite some distance. It's all about the timing to blast out of the cannons and land safely in the next one. This idea is used a lot in Country Returns. The bosses are excellent too, and they take many hits to kill. The bosses are all very challenging, even the very first one, because the more you hit them, the harder they get. Of course, this isn't a new concept to videogames. But Country Returns uses it a huge amount in boss battles, which makes them very hard and satisfying. Hidden in each level are various collectibles- four KONG letters and seven to nine puzzle pieces are to be found in each level. They are so difficult to get, even the best of the best will be challenged by these. Often these collectibkes introduce an element of puzzle into the platforming. There's also a addition called Rambi- a bit like Yoshi, except he's a rhinoceros. It's fun using him, but he only actually appears in three or four levels, which is slightly strange. Other than that, Country Returns is perfect in every way.. This game is gorgeous, by Wii standards among the best-looking on the platform. The soundtrack is magnificent. The level design is tremendous. The variety is outstanding. The game is enormous fun. So Why won't I give it a 10? The difficulty. The absurdly punishing difficulty. This game is very, very HARD. You will die over and over again. Only determined players will finish the entire game, and completionists will also be sadomasochists as this game will KILL YOU. Yes, the Super Guide is present to help get you through extremely tough levels, but where's the fun in that?. fantastic levels intresting gameplay, nice soundtrack... very hard and also have a co op opition it is a must buy and it is much better than new super mario bros wii. retro studios is the best. The best come back of the monkeys for Wii. Long adve",donkey Kong country returns is a challenging 2D platformer by Retro Studios . the music is great but only because it was already great fifteen years ago . the platforming is some of the best you'll find on Wii and the game is challenging .
749.Bully,"To this day I still play this game and watched all of the play throughes out there. I actually cannot give this game justice and I still couldn't find other game similar to it. I feel like it is a full package game where you can do anything and everything and this aged pretty well!. Best game everIt is one of the most beautiful games I have ever tried in my life. Rockstar's version of GTA in a school setting. Surprisingly, it's T-rated. The game is an open-world adventure game. It's also a crude comedy. It wonderfully captures the feel of school semesters as the seasons change. While ""Bully"" isn't very challenging and lacks the freedom of GTA, it's a lot of fun and is quite funny. Anyone that has been a student will enjoy this trip back to high school. I would rate it with an 8.7 out of 10.. This game is Fantastic!!! I disgust all the people who gave him 7s and 0s. It's not fair that such a beautiful game has such a low rating.. This game is special for me....................................i am a fan of this game. It's simply the **** PS2.......................... It's the best game ever......................................................... Bully is a great Rockstar game, if not one of the greatest. It has amazing comedy, catchy tunes, an easy and approachable combat system with an impressive amount of depth to it. Bully easily has some of the best characters to ever be made in Rockstar history. All of the characters in Bully are their own person whether it be student or not, with their own funny, witty dialogue to differentiate them from other students or townsmen. Bully's main antagonist is funny yet menacing at the same time, especially when considering his age. Bully's only fault is the length of the game, coming in at around 15-20 hours for a non 100% completion, a 100% completion would come in at around maybe 25-30 hours as most of the things needed for 100% completion are random collectibles. Bully is a great game for all ages which I recommend to all.. The game is still as good as I remember it being, albeit a little repetitive. Only a handful of the missions are actually difficult, and the pacing seems to go from normal to breakneck speed once you hit the Jock chapter, leaving you with a pretty rushed and lame conclusion involving Gary, who barely shows up during the story for the most part. Despite the issues with the story, it still is a unique game with its own crude charm behind it, and very much fits that ""Rockstar style"" that their games had in the 2000s.. Bully is an amazing action game with just a very good story and combat mechanics i can replay it anytime and it will never get boring for me its just such a great game.. One of the best games ever with unique gameplay elements and a great story. It really needs a sequel.. one of the best games i played its very very very nice and fun hame i love his story and jimmy hopkins. My favorite Rockstar game is between this and RDR. Pretty cheesy story wise, but it just adds to the game more than it takes away.. Good game for always<3. GTA but in school, Genius. One of the most unique game ever made with some of the best NPC interaction such great game.. Probably this is the game I've completed the most times in my life. The school theme with the groups of nerds, athletes has a really cool vibe. The gameplay is a lot of fun, the combat is great, and using the slingshot, skateboard, and bombs is the best part of the game. The soundtrack is sensational!. In my opinion, this game gives you a great and memorable experience, personally my favorite Rockstar game, it has moments where it doesn't make sense, and still, you enjoy it, I recommend it in all aspects. The game of my teenhood. I always thought this was so much better than GTA (it was more lighthearted - as crazy as it is to say Bully is lighthearted) and Jimmy Hopkins kinda helped me to stand my foot against schools bullies from there on. Great freaking game!. Awful graphics, awful character, WORST FIGHTING SYSTEM EVER, and WORST community. Thais **** is th WORST game EVER made in the entre universe. F*ck you rockstar than develop This piece of garbage.. AKA Canis Canem Edit, the Rockstar formula goes to school in this hybrid of Grange Hill and Grand Theft Auto. As playable as the other GTA games on the console, but the one single environment obviously has a lot less scope and variety.. this game is my 2nd fav video game ever made fun gameplay and story rockstar did a great job with bully i just really love it. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. Another timeless game and one of the best of its generation, this game is on par with Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves and Devil May Cry 3. Everything about it is awesome, fresh, and revolutionary, with no discernible flaws. It's a true masterpiece that sets a new standard for gaming. It would be great to see Rockstar create something new and fresh like Bully and continue pushing the boundaries of creativity and storytelling.. This game never fails to amuse me, BULLY was for all the kids who could not convince their parents to buy them GTA - 9/10. It's more than a GTA with bikes (although in some sense it's an autoparody of those games). Has it's own soul, with a likeable kid who is angry with the world (and doesn't know why) and thinks he's the smartest guy in school (and he's not). I love it. Even with it's flaws (a weak plot, for example), at the end of the day it's a funny multi-layered experience with lots of things to do and collect.. The Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption formula is applied seamlessly to academia.. Also known as „Canis Canem Edit“ which is Latin for dog eat dog. It is an open world action adventure some called “Grand Theft School” but it has no crime or overburdened violence and it is not about bulling. Actually the main character puts the bullies into their place. The story is about the 15 year James Hopkins nicknamed Jimmy who is sent to the infamous boarding school Bullworth Academy. As new kid he has a bad standing and the school is not for the weak. He will however not stay at the bottom. I stop here to avoid spoilers. The story is excellent and relatable. Jimmy is an unpolished diamond and has a lot of character growth. All characters are fitting and genuine. You can relate to the story and characters. Gameplay wise it is an open world game but not all parts are open to you at the beginning. You have the school life, quests, minigames and mission. As you progress through the story you unlock more stuff. There is a lot to collect, buy and do. Think a bit like the Grand Theft Auto games but in school minus the crimes, violence and other things too overburdened for the setting. For example your weapons are stink bombs, fire crackers and itching powder. I like the gameplay as much as the story. You have always stuff to do, explore, collect or fight your way to the top. The presentation is nice but I think aged a bit. Lets say it was good for its time. While other reported about bugs I did not have any serious issues. Overall this was a surprisingly great game and won me over. I am hoping for a sequel or remake since many years.. Bully 2 is a Masterpiece. The game is so good that even now in 2022, more than 15 after its release the game is still funnier to play than most of the recent AAA games. It has one of the livest open worlds that I've ever seen, the fact that it sets in a school with different gangs of students (Nerds, Bullies, Richs boys, etc.) makes it seems so real. Even the city is so alive with workers, rich and poor districts, it is all so well thought out. The story is also one of the best of all Rockstar games. IMO, it is better than any GTA story, maybe it is only worse than RDR2 story with many memorable characters and a great ending. Also, the OST is by far the best one in any game that I've played, the main theme is so good that I could hear for days straight. The graphics are obviously outdated but for its released time probably it was one of the best. The combat system for me is better than any GTA. I like way more that use the bare hands and non-lethal weapons to fight than lethal weapons. Lethal weapons are so boring, you just shot and the enemy is dead, bare hands are way funnier.. Like it. Good soundtrack and atmosphere. Sad that we might never see a sequel.. A charming and unique game that still stands out, because there's really nothing that similar available even today. It's fantastic!. A classic open world game with an unique school setting with unique combat and unique characters. Overall a really unique game.. One of the best PS2 games out there, always fun (even to replay or just messing around). This game is just simply amazing, great story, fantastic soundtrack, fun af gameplay, weird but cool atmosphere, and just overall pure fun. 10/10.. One of the best ps2 games i’ve ever played. Great plot, unique idea, addicting gameplay, very few terrible missions, music is also very good.. It's surprising to see how unique and inventive this game is. I can only hope a sequel can be made in this day and age.. A very underrated game tho i have spend 15 hour into this game and haven’t beat it yet the story is ok and the character arc of jimmy character is great and the combat system is great but the game need more Gary Smith tho. Bully 2 is a Masterpiece. The game is so good that even now in 2022, more than 15 after its release the game is still funnier to play than most of the recent AAA games. It has one of the livest open worlds that I've ever seen, the fact that it sets in a school with different gangs of students (Nerds, Bullies, Richs boys, etc.) makes it seems so real.

I like way more that use the bare hands and non-lethal weapons to fight than lethal weapons. Lethal weapons are so boring, you just shot and the enemy is dead, bare hands are way funnier.. Bully is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but c'mon, the motivation necessary for a good made screenplay doesn't really exist. This prevents a 10.. Jimmy Hopkins, you Bi-Con!!! In a truly surprising and progressive move for the time - there is the ability to kiss all genders within the game. In 2006 and from this developer this was a MOVE that should be applauded even by today's standards. To go from hookers, blow and explosions to high school drama with such finesse is truly impressive. It was clear that the writers and developers used this detour to prove that they could write compelling characters ahead of the launch of Red Dead Redemption and other later GTA games. There is no shortage of heavy real world issues occurring at Bullworth Academy including alcohol abuse, fallible adults and navigating power dynamics within the school system that go so far beyond towel whipping. Being Jimmy is a fun time. Skateboarding and biking make traversal a joy and classes provide a fun swath of mini-game challenges that reward you greatly for your success. This reviewer's only real complaints are that the in-game time moves too quickly and what causes the story to progress is in some ways unclear (base missions vs. classes and days). Additionally, there is little indication of when a class might be taking place so you may go several in-game days without returning to your favorite subject which is a bummer. Would have preferred to attend any class during school hours. Overall a treasured masterpiece within the Rockstar collection that should not be missed!. This game has a brilliant idea and is applied to the game very perfectly, the gameplay is super fun, the story is creative and the plot writing is good. Might be the best PS2 game of all time. Everything from the map to the missions to the soundtrack is perfect.. ccrogers15, you're pathetic. So are you, Xrayplayer. if you both don't like this game and call it crap, don't play another game in your lives at all. this game is underrated and you both are overrated. get lost. chumps.. great story and original af. the soundtrack is so cool this game is so underrated i have such a place for this game in my heart. what the hell is this what was I playing!!!. this is got to be one of the dumbest games that Rockstar ever developed. the graphics are so ugly even for a game released in 2006 just look at the character models it's gross, the story is weird the whole concept is just dumb playing as a kid in school and bullying people or stop the bullying or whatever you are doing in the game it's just so stupid, the taking over the school part made me cringe and roll my eyes the characters are weird and the dialogues are very cringey and the whole story is just stupid as hell. The gameplay at least can be fun the beat em mechanics are fine and running around causing chaos is fun but it gets old very quickly, yes the map gets bigger but there's nothing you do other than changing your character appearance and the class minegame thing is lame and half of the missions are boring, but where the hell is this stupid idea came from "" kissing girls can boost your health"" what kinda game is this ,, in gta a hot coffee mode and then they came up with this stupid idea what kinda company Rockstar are trying to be WTH the problem is a lot of those games sold very high and a lot kids are playing it, maybe some kids have played bully and learned how to be disrespectful bullying and abusive maniacs, but at least from a gameplay standpoint it's a masterpiece compared to san andreas.. Best Game Ever made I'm a Gamer since 90s played each and every Game but Bully hits different It felt so Real So alive my brother used to watch while I play he used to motivate me. A game very similar to GTA made by the people who made GTA? And it takes place in a school? That is Bully and as a game a it is a very good one at that. This is a PS2 Classic that has been remastered on a number of consoles since then. That should give you testament to how much of a classic this game is. And for a number of reasons at that. In regards to the story, you play as Jimmy Hopkins after he has been sent to Bullworth Academy (A boarding school) what follows from here is your typical run of the mill rockstar story we have all come to love. You start making friends and start moving up the popularity ranks in the school while also dealing with the harsh realities of school life (Bullies, School work, truancy etc) Story wise it isnt the best in my personal opinion but for the setting it is in, it does a good job and fleshes out the characters well. Gameplay is the biggest draw for this game. When you mention this game to people, the thing that springs to mind is ""GTA in School"" and this is very true for this game. Like in GTA you can goof about and cause mayhem and destruction (but remember the setting so you can't go overboard with guns and explosives etc). And you have to go to classes to learn but you have the option of not going at all and instead mess about instead while on the watch for the prefects who act as the police so to speak. Like I say, it gives you the freedom to play how you want to play like GTA does but with the backdrop of school life which I think worked really well for it. In conclusion, Bully is yet another excellent game to add to the excellent Rockstar Games portfolio of games. Yes it is a bit stripped back compared to its GTA counterpart but given the setting etc, I still think it works well and holds up very well to this day!. This game is incredible, the story is good and it has mechanics that, although they were released a long time ago, are very modern and good, it deserved a remake, it would be incredible to see this game with the graphics of today.. Bully is a Rockstar classic that should always be remembered as one of the best PS2 Games of all time.. If only Rockstar were a company that made Remastered. One of Rockstar's most underrated but best games. I think it's an advanced game for its time.. I'm a bit late but Bully is a very enjoyable game. Even today it still holds up.. When I bought this game I was expecting an immersive game that takes me to a world that everything is possible for a bully guy, so-so like gta. Instead, what I received it's a million times better, a trully masterpiece, where the bully is aiming to the bullies. I love this game and makes me sad to see how Rockstar forgot how to make fun games without a slot machine massive multiplayer.. I played this game quite late and I was impressed by everything that can be done and a theme that in principle does not attract in a game to be something unique in its generation The chapters are a bit repetitive, only that can be negative what is rockstar waiting for to release a new one. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Great Story.......................Great Score.....................Great. Best atmosphere. Extraordinary game. Best game. Rockstar Games. Waiting Bully 2.. So, this game has been on my list for a while. After the epiphany that Rockstar is just going to keep remastering GTA 5, I decided to pick it up. The game has a good plot with many named characters. This game taught me chemistry!!!! I now know that the more art I do the better at kissing. One problem is the many no no words they say. Like in the chapter with the biker guy. I Think his name was Tommy Victor? I'm not sure. But he calls his girl a no no word. That why it punch him hard. This promotes violence, but it could be worse. You beat mean people. Though some of the tool in the game are very dangerous. Like fire works. Where are the parents and why do you not go home at night. Also how old is Timmy. He look 45. Does this happen before manhunter. I can relate to the English teacher. I too am not a 5 star man but have all the ladies swooning for me. This game is supra good. Go play now!!! Mike Lindell approved.. One of the best games of the PS2. The gameplay is super fun, the soundtrack is amazing and very markable, the story is weird and funny and the graphics are very good. One of the most fun games I've ever played.. Another classic from Rockstar games! Rockstar really solidified themselves in gen 6 but this one flies under the radar a lot as it was pulled from shelves at the time it was released. A must play if you're a fan of Midnight Club, GTA, Red Dead or any other game developed by Rockstar. Rockstar's logo is a stamp of approval and quality.. I love this game sooo much. My favorite ever. It molded who i am. And I still witing for Bully 2.. Played the game on both PS2 & PS4 and loved playing it again. Unique Rockstar game which deserves a sequel.. Fantastic game, but not the most polished. Some things seem rushed, and way too many things were cut from the final game. Bully on PS2/3/4 is the most polished version, and is the one I’d recommend.. Cool :D Nostalgia Rockstar games very very good i like bullworth academy since 2008. This game is just one of the best Rockstar has ever put out, without a doubt the most unique they ever put out! Sad that GTA is so overrated and this doesn't get a sequel until now. This is my favorite game of all time It is the most Underrated game ever the game is not like any other rockstar game it has unique gameplay when you play it you can’t put it down. i haven't played every single rockstar game. but out of the selection of r* ive played, dis has gotta be the most enjoyable. dis isn't a large open world game (at least not on GTA scales) so it doesnt suffer from empty open world syndrome. although, like san andreas, the world is slowly opened to u thru plot devices. this works better for bully than SA because i feel the pacing of bully is a lot faster. I wont say that i prefer this cast over SA, but i do think it stands above the other r* ps2 games (especially RDR.) IDK if I can say anything else about this game dat really justifies the high score. I just really really enjoyed my time clocking dis.. Great game one of my favourite. Funny and relatable story. Interesting world to explore. Negatives: Graphics especially in cutscenes haven't aged very well. Memorable charactacters and unique missions with a great soundtrack.. Loved this game growing up. The characters and plot are fantastic. I hope some day it gets remastered.. ""Bully"" isn't exactly GTA set in high school, but it does have that Rockstar Games touch. Surprisingly, the game is rated 'T', so there is no graphic violence, sexual content or profanity. However, it is extremely crass. Gameplay revolves around high school life. As troublemaker Billy Hopkins, your job is to excel in classes, while making life miserable for those around you. The game takes place during an entire school semester. It's charming and fun, but not very challenging. While the open-world environment is great, you're never given full freedom since Billy is a teen that must attend school everyday. The game is very good, but it's not a masterpiece. Overall, I would rate this with a 9 out of 10.. Fun game to mess around in and be goofy, and once the city is unlocked the game becomes infinitely more fun with pranks to civilians and getting away on a bike being one of the funnest parts of the game. The story line is goofy and zany. It is just downright crazy fun, and getting into some virtual mischief in Bully is a hell of a lot of fun!. A GTA clone that is just as good as those games as well. Not only that but they have improved a lot of the mechanics and really have an iconic lead that will be remembered for years to come.. My personal favourite game of all time. Brings back so many memories when I go back to play it.. I really like the whole gameplay and the story, it's really enjoyable, and the soundtracks by Shawn Lee is just amazing.. bully is one of the most fun games i ever played. combat system is great, good graphics, the gameplay is easy to adapt, and the characters are well made, the game aged really well. just like the grand theft auto series and red dead redemption series this game is a masterpiece from rockstar. Damn When The sequel Rockstar?just do it for next Gen and i can die happy.... One of the best games on PS2! Rockstar really knows what she does! Charismatic characters are not lacking in this game.. I have been waiting for More than 10 years for another bully but damn on Rockstar There nothing like this Game in The industry,And there will never be exept for bully 2,MOST UNDERRATED GAMR. Oh God,Rockstar this Game is amazing so when Bully 2?! The story is good not That Great,The Gameplay vry fun and the Atmosphere is strong and you really fell like you are in school. The main protagonist - Jimmy Hopkins is something, he isn't like any other main protagonists in GTA, he's a school-kid. But to be fair, this game blew my mind. Who knew that you could've got the experience of GTA in a style of school life? Pretty well made Rockstar, forget the GTA games Bully 2 is what I need.. Rockstar's standard of quality was not broken in Bully, although game not being the producer's best. But it's very immersive, with quite funny sidequests, amazing story and charismatic characters.. The game is fun, but it felt too clunky and the game looks washed out. Still has creative elements and I ultimately enjoyed it. But it's nothing great.. Just like the majority of anything Rockstar games touch, this game excels in many different ways.. Bully is one of them games that has core fun and you can not lose it as well it doesn't save so you will have to go to the save points just to save.. Masterpiece. Funny, incredibly fun with an crazy story. What a incredible game.. When I started playing this game I ""drowned"" in it, this is the game that I can play endlessly, and I'm sure most of the people agree!. One of the best games Rockstar. The game tells us about the teenage life of Jimi Hopkins and about his problems with friends and at school. The gameplay is very diverse. Each owner of the console PlayStation 2 has the obligation to go through this game.. The well known game “Bully” was a PS2 game made in October 17, 2006, formatted for xbox on March 4, 2008. You played as a young boy named Jimmy Hopkins whose parents force him to go to a private school. There you learn the school is overrun by rich brats and menacing bullies. You rise through the ranks of the school and fight a hidden enemy who is much closer to you than you think. Jimmy Hopkins is a troubled boy who picks fights, and often crushes his opponents. Once coming to the open world fiction town known as Bullworth, there are four groups he needs to worry about: the preppies, the jocks, the greasers, and the nerds. They make the open world action lots of fun. Each group has weapons or skills in which can make you jam the sprint button by fear. The overall game play of “Bully” was mind-blowing for its time. Made by rockstar games (the same company who made GTA) Jimmy Hopkins and his town have made a big mark in gaming history. Easily known as one of the best games formatted for xbox and very close to the best PS2 game in history. Although the game has all of these feats there are some minor dislikes. After a while of playing the game may get tedious or boring, the plot makes up for the small problems though. The idea of using weapons such as a firework launcher or a potato gun to scare away bullies still makes me jump and down ready to put the game in my dusty PS2. The game was obviously meant for older kids and contains inappropriate language use and may have some other items like use of drugs and partial nudity.People who also like GTA and action adventure games would love this game for it’s easy combos and very well put together battles. Overall my personal opinion is 5/5 and most editors are 4/5, however most fans of the amazing game agree with 4.5/5. The well made, open-world, and fictional world known as Bullworth will always make me laugh and have fun in the small and exciting Bullworth Academy.. lets just say rockstar needs to put bully 2 between red dead 2 and gta 6 because honestly one of the best rockstar games to date wow buy this now 9/10. This piece of work is the perfect example of flawless atmosphere in video games, Shawn Lee's wonky and soulful soundtrack perfectly accompanies the ambiguous timeline and neo-gothic setting of Bullworth Academy, perfect voice acting, amazing characters, my personal favorite video game ever.. My all time favourite ps2 game a all time classic ps2 game many years from now people will say you heard the game bully and people will say oh yeah i know that game. one of the best games ive ever played, great story, excellent soundtrack, memorable missions and character, fun minigames and gameplay as well as a great artstyle, seriously addictive. best game on ps2!. Ok, this game is just great. I wouldn't give it less than 9.5. Really good graphics, entertaining missions, good story and also a good soundtrack. You can easily get very addictive to this game. For some of my friends its was difficult but I found it really easy. In this game you could do everything you'd like to do in your school or college without taking risks. I played San Andreas and I didn't like it but I really loved Bully (called Canis Canem Edit in Spain).. one of the best games ive ever played. It has a fun combat system with a really interesting story and irecently played it again in 2016 and it was genuinelly still very fun even though i own more recent rockstar games such as gta5 i spent more time on bully. An endlessly enjoyable game that put a unique spin on the open world format. Great characters, memorable soundtrack and brilliant representations of school stereotypes.. Summer 2007, a full week with my cousin playing this game. We finished the game 7 TIMES on that week. Oh man, good memories :') This game gives you the feel of the school, the diversity was awesome. And the feeling when you go to chapter 2 and you realize the gate gets opened, and YOU CAN CRUISE IN THE WHOLE MAP! I don't know what's with RockStar and carnivals, but IT IS AWESOME! So many weapons, so many characters with their own name, everyone has special voices! This game is WAAAAY ahead of its time.. This game was AWESOME!! It's one of my favorite games of all time. I love the story, setting, gameplay, music, and so on, Though it has a bit of a slow start but it quickly makes up for it. This is an essential PS2 game to have. This is a game that you wanna get. Rock star did a great job making the plot/story on this game and the characters its a stereotypical school with Jocks Nerds Preps Bullies and Greasers. This game is basically GTA but with kids its a amazing free roam world with a non-repeating plot. Over all its a great game if you causing trouble and having fun doing it. Still an incredible game as we wait for a possible sequel. There's nothing I can write that hasn't already been written. If you haven't played Bully yet, what are you doing with your life?. Ahh.. Bully 2, a very unique game from rockstar, who usually makes ultra violent games. This game ain't nessecarily kid friendly, but just enough action/violence with a very unique setting in that of a private school. The gameplay itself was very diverse (minigames for classes, the weapons, a outer city away from the school, etc). The atmosphere was really cool, you got the preps, jocks, nerds, etc just like in real life. The story was pretty good, although the game can get repititive with not much to do if you don't follow the main storyline. Overall, I remember enjoying this game a lot, something different, and just enough action, with an amazing atmosphere.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A school-version of Grand Theft Auto, nothing more to say, just buy it period. Even if it's an old game, it's better than half the new games there are.. A classic gta style sandbox. However its essentially a kid friendly version of gta. The size of the map is quite nice, and especially how the map has different sections like; the school, down town, the getto, the docks, the mental asylum, and the carnival. It controls just like a ps2 era gta game, so its easy to grasp the controls. The plot is fun if you are young and still in school, that way you could relate to the whole click mentality. This game has a nice undertone of how hard it is to fit into a new school, and how you shouldn't judge people until you get to know them. The game length is quite nice not to long not too short. There are many aspects of the game that will distract you from the main story line such as, classes, side missions, social interaction, mini games, and of course what is a Rockstar game without collectables. I must say that the idea of school classes is a great one that has never been used before, and would be hard to recreate. The idea behind classes is that you only have two per in game school day, and each class will unlock certain things like science class improves your ability to make items like stink bombs etc... The classes are comprised of mini games that each have five levels. The mini games are also very fun like going to the carnival and playing carival games to win real prizes like a mo ped. The other cool thing is that because there is such a large map they include storage for bikes and mo peds. There is so much diversity in this game, so many places to explore, so many things to do that you really just need to play it for your self. You can find","""bully"" is a great Rockstar game, if not one of the greatest . it has amazing comedy, catchy tunes, an easy and approachable combat system . the game is still as good as I remember it being, albeit a little repetitive ."
75.Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory,"Great game, I would give it a 9. But there are too many issues. The main problem is the unfair behavior of the NPCs. They have eyes on their backs and instantly turn 180 degrees and shoot without any logic. There are also tanks in the game that will spot you and kill you without you having a chance to get past. And at least the Bathhouse is just pain. Really bad game design. The first missions are great. But it becomes worser later. It seems as if the developers slopped along at the end. Quick save and load is important. But there are also differences between the versions on the other platforms. Some are better than others. Some versions may have glitches. I really like the game, but I can't give higher rating due to these problems and weird decisions. I just wish that the developers spend a few minutes more for the implementation. Especially the NPCs behavior and placement on the map. Ok, it's an old game. Maybe a remake would be great. Or a new Splinter Cell with focus on stealth.. The best stealth game that has been made, and shows how well you can make a Tom Clancy game when you have a publisher that cares.. Great stealth action. AI is pretty good too. This game aged like fine wine. I played it backwards compatible on the Xbox Series X and it still holds up. They don't make games like this any more.. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory - The Apex of Stealth Gaming Excellence. Released in 2005, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory stands as the magnum opus of the Splinter Cell series, setting an unparalleled standard for stealth gaming that remains unchallenged to this day. Ubisoft's third installment not only refined the genre but also pushed the boundaries of what was possible in terms of narrative, gameplay, and technological achievement, cementing its place as one of the greatest games ever created.. It's not often that a third entry in any video games is the greatest in the series, but in my opinion, Chaos Theory was peak Splinter Cell. Everything that was great about the 2 first is just overall better. Soundtrack is probably my favorite OST of all time. 10/10.. Both Chaos Theory and Pandora Tomorrow is the best stealth games ever made. Enjoy every seconds of this game, it will mindblown you.. Shockingly amazing game. Absolutely Ubisoft's best work. The gameplay and environments are absolutely phenomenal.. Not only is this game the best game of the series, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the greatest stealth game ever created! Modern developers take note, this what a stealth game should be.. I've played hundreds of games and this is the best so far for me. The game is almost perfect. The only problem I had with the game was when I tried to finish the game at 100%. When the 2 AI's fought against each other and they always detected me especially in the missions Bathhouse and Seoul.. This is the game that introduced me to stealth titles as a kid. Ever since I've been obsessed with the genre, even games that aren't actually stealth games but just use the mechanics, These really were the best in class games. Splinter Cell was a delight to play. I adore it even now, all these years later, going grey and making noises when I get out of a chair.. A stealth masterpiece. This game set a high standard for the stealth game genre and it honestly still holds up.. This might have to be my favorite video game off all time, or at least as far as original Xbox games go. With even better mechanics and graphics, this game seriously upped the competition when it came to stealth action games. The best Splinter Cell game by far, and possibly the best Tom Clancy game.. OVERALL - 84% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 6/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Has the unfortunate task of competing against Metal Gear and doesn't fill those shoes. But for a stealth based games this addition to the franchise is really enjoyable and creative. Definitely the best Splinter Cell game.. Still an amazing game, even after all these years. Just revisited after buying it one XBox One X, looks and a plays surprisingly good. Will forever be one of my favorite games, shame that the franchise seems dead now, Splinter Cell still has a lot of potential.. A stealth game that has aged so great that I can just smell the wine scent coming of of it.. This is one of the greatest games in the history of stealth games, this game is deserve an remake. I love Sam fisher. You are so lucky that you can take control of the Great Fisher Poison and secretly kill the enemy.. This games pretty good not like the best stealth game I've ever played but good non the less. its better then the last two games if only for the fact that we got quick saves in this one.. One of my All-Time Favorites and certainly one of the best stealth Games ever created. The Gameplay offers so many opportunities to access an area and handle a situation. That is what i really miss in more modern stealth Games. The Game also wonderfully arouses the feeling of being a spy. Since then there was no other Game on the market that could accomplish that in this form.. Tom Clancy's Splinter cell chaos theory sets the player as a spy of Third Echelon, Sam Fisher currently investigating a string of events leading towards a major terrorist. All made by a very intellectual person. Its up to you, to ghost your way through highly dangerous missions, to put an end to this ""chaos theory,"" and prevent world war 3.. Too good. I recommend this one instead of the ps2 game. This is just a masterpiece and a very good improvement since the last one. I love this game and the franchise. This is among my top 3 favorite games of all time. Easily the best game in the Splinter Cell series. The game play is fluid and nuanced, the story is engaging and the graphics are impressive for a game developed a decade ago. The soundtrack and voice acting are amazing as well (Michael Ironside is perfection). Love the overall aesthetic. If you've only played generation seven Splinter Cell games, you've been missing out. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the crown jewel of the stealth genre.. It's strange for me to claim this, but I do profess that this is my favorite game of all time. It's hard to describe, but in my opinion Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the perfect culmination of story, visuals, audio, and gameplay ever crafted. This is art, undeniably.. Absolutely amazing game, the best installment in the series hands down. A huge step forward for the stealth game genre and since it's release very few games have even come close to the stealth mechanics of this game. If stealth isn't your thing, Chaos Theory is also an amazing action game, if you choose to play like a super soldier utilizing stunning new moves to take down your enemies. I'm a hardcore gamer, playing virtually anything that comes out. Chaos Theory came out in 2005 and 7 years later, it still remains in my Top 10, no, make that Top 5 games of all time.. Very few games do stealth as beautifully as the Splinter Cell series, and this game is simply the finest out there. Immensely enjoyable, fantastic missions and damn good AI make this a terrific game with innovative gameplay.","the first missions are great, but it becomes worser later . i would give it a 9. But there are too many issues . i just wish that the developers spent a few minutes more for the implementation ."
750.Call of Duty: Black Ops,"the game is nastalgic with the zombies and the campain is great +u can play online nowadays with pepole returning to older cods. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Treyarch's best ""Call of Duty"" game pulls much inspiration from Infinity Ward's ""Modern Warfare"" series. It has an intriguing Cold War story and terrific settings. The graphics are amazing and the action set pieces are fantastic. In addition, multiplayer was in top form and Zombies made a glorious return. Overall, this is one of the best COD games ever made. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. Best cod campain one of my favorite zombies and iconic mp withgoated maps fun no sbmm, gold camo i like this game. Dude, this game is just....AMAZING! Finally, COD has reached its peak here. The campaign is awesome (not quite as good as MW2 but still a good contender), the Zombies is by far the best I've ever played (not even questionable), and the multiplayer isn't broken at all plus just as fun. This game is near perfect in my eyes and deserves the perfect 10/10 score for defining my teenage years in one game. Quite possibly my top 5 favorite video game of all time.. Great game, great zombies, top three best cod games,short but great campaign. I had such an awesome time laying this with the boys back in the day. I know everyone usually preferred modern warfare but black ops was the most fun ever had playing a COD.. this game is a classic. It’s definitely one of the best Call of Duty games.. this game deserves a 10/10 rating. its absolutely goated. one of the best online games of all time. story mode is considered the best by the fans on top of that.. this was the 3rd best cod of all time after MW2 and BO2. fantastic multiplayer campaign and zombies. cod community at it with their nonsense again. this is objectively the best cod of the 2010s alongside bo2. subjectively it has a graphics issue but other than that black ops is goated. The campaign is a fun romp into Soviet-era thrillers and never fails to be engaging. Zombies mode improves on the original. The real draw here is the more arcade-style multiplayer, which is arguably still a series-highlight and remains very playable to this day.. Best call of duty game of all time. I got to be honest when I played this game first I was impressed it's atmosphere and plot. How is this game mixed, Its legit one of the best cods in Call of Duty, no idea how it's ""mixed or average."". There are no words to say, I finished it 3 times, I look at the games today, there are no games with this much action, so I'm going back to the past.. I would love to say that Black Ops was my favorite COD game. It has my personal favorite setting for a COD game, a story on par with Hollywood action thrillers and in my opinion the best new Zombie maps (Call of the Dead best zombies map). Where Black Ops fails for me was the multiplayer system. Needed both a level requirement and a currency system to unlock guns, perks or equipment was really annoying, I'm not a massive fan of grinding in video games when the grind is boring.. my favorite call of duty game. this game has a great campaign, great characters, and great writing. i love this game. The best cod of all time, this game has one of the best characterizations and stories among all cod versions. The best CoD campaign hands down!. Cool of duty. second best call of duty to play until now note: all call of duty severs are fixed in xbox. Good campaign, but more importantly: zombies.. Absolute masterpiece with a mysterious plot, great gameplay and improved zombies mode.. Perfect story, perfect zombies and an almost perfect multiplayer, the only real negative is how slow paced the multiplayer is compared to other CODs released at the time.. keep it nice and short; zombies is good, multiplayer is not. im sorry but its just not it for me :(. I can't say that this is the best Black Ops. But it's still not a bad game. Yes, not quite bad, but compared to Black Ops 3. Or other Call Of Duty, this game is pretty normal. Yes, the weapon physics are moronic, but it's not boring to play.. Call Of Duty: Black Ops has strongly taken the Call Of Duty Series to new heights and is a critically acclaimed successful video game that is indisputably unmatched by any first-person shooter video game. Simply an outstanding video game. Call Of Duty: Black Ops tried things that had never been seen in a Call Of Duty Story before and this was genuinely a good thing to do. The story is very complicated and confusing to be honest and the story jumps back and forth in it's timeline and brings in some confusing twists. Despite this, the story has some really epic and amazing moments that are well executed and constructed to give off a strong sense of reality and accuracy. The story is lengthy unlike the previous games such as Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which is really good, and the story features an amazing and finely picked cast of individuals and characters that contribute to the experience and quality of the game. The gameplay hasn't changed too much from it's predecessor Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and is pretty much the same thing with minor changes and fixes. There are more guns and unique weapons such as the crossbow which is really good. The gameplay works well as usual, the controls are easy to use and no issues or major problems here. Call Of Duty: Black Ops has insane graphics that have slightly improved from the previous game, the graphics are sharper, smoother and look stunning in every mission. The game has 3 Playable Protagonists that are silent when you play as them but the other 2 you don't play as is a character that accompanies you in missions. The voice acting in Call Of Duty: Black Ops is excellent and features the voices of Celebrities such as Ice Cube and Gary Oldman. Call Of Duty: Black Ops has a superb soundtrack that fits the gameplay so nicely and immerse the player in the experience that Call Of Duty offers. The attention to detail in this game is outstanding and raises the expectations for other games in 2010. Environments are accurately structured and the detail in each mission is incredible, really good job by Treyarch here. The game is so full of life, detail, excellence and pure quality. Simply the best that Call Of Duty have offered so far. Despite it's confusing story, Call Of Duty: Black Ops is a video-game success that has carried on the superiority of the Call Of Duty Series. This game is a breathtaking masterpiece and has to go down as one of the best First Person Shooters of all time. An unmissable experience that you must see.. The campaign was very good especially core gameplay wise. The multiplayer was also amazing including a bunch of iconic maps such as Nuketown. The zombies was the best part for me. Kino Der Totten and five are such great both map wise and the guns/items you can use to survive. Some of the dlc for this game was also very good including call of the dead and Ascension. In terms of zombies despite still being great the maps are still not as good as bo2 or bo3 when you consider dlc maps.. “The numbers Mason. What do they mean? Where are they broadcast from?” Okay, but why do the older cod games including this one have mixed to negative ratings from users, regardless of the quality? I thought people enjoyed these games. Does it have to do with the fact it still is pretty expensive? Granted, I too would be peeved if such thing was like that, but how come I hear more people say how amazing this game is than how many people dislike it?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Only one I can be asked to review. It's a classic, I mean everyone already knows this is a great game.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 7. This game marks probably the best point the Call of Duty franchise has ever been. Incredible campaign, excellent multiplayer, and superb Zombies mode that was improved upon in every way from World at War.. One of the best games of the cod franchise, which has performed exceptionally well, especially in the campaign and zombies sections. Be sure that after experiencing it, its story and epic scenes will always remain in your mind.. The best cod game ever, the best campaign, the best multiplayer, and the best zombies.. Okay, I loved the time-period it was set in. I loved the psychological manipulation the character deals with. I did find myself playing it a few times and playing the arcade game. But after awhile it did bore me. The zombie mode is only fun with friends.. this is my favorite cod game and it will remain that way. so many memories of me and my friends staying up late and training zombies. and no, not training like we're their master, yk what i mean. The best all around call of duty. Inferior to MW2's multiplayer by a long way. But has the best Campaign of any CoD with it just slightly above MW2. That along with the best Zombies of any Black Ops along with the best DLC behind Ghosts.. Having played every single Call of Duty campaign from 2 up till the latest Vanguard as of this review and nearly every multiplayer for each game, I would say this has to be one of the best if not most fun experience I've had with a call of duty ever, it's unique vietnam war era gameplay and weapon mechanics had me playing it for hours a day as a kid and the campaign is something special, a must play for FPS fans. Highly Recommended.. One of the best story in any FPS. Amazing and thrilling missions, great plot and unexpected outcomes of the story. Every mission is unique and every one have a reason. It's not only killing for sake. I'm speechless after ending. Highly recommend!. Call of Duty Black OPS is one of the best cod's ever made Black OPS one is my fav campaign or second fav campaign because I need to play bo2 to see if it is the best this Campaign has the best characters for sure the villains are really good not as good as bo2 or even MW3 but still really good villains in the game in this game you have one of my fav video game characters and that is WOODS is one of the best characters his scenes are amazing with woods etc. like one of my fav one is (You can't kill me)One of the best scenes ever in this game and video game in general. Multiplayer wise is ok tbh is not crazy mainly because the maps aren't the best but they are good of course they is iconic maps like summit, firing range, nuketown that is only the problem i have with Black OPS one multiplayer is the maps aren't the best Zombies is almost my least fav just because u die so easily in 2 hits which is laughable it is is bo2 also but u actually have good guns in bo1 every gun is weak so it's like impossible to get high rounds if u don't know how to play Zombies but this has the best maps for sure so all round Bo1 is one of my fav cod's for it's campaign alone Zombies is ok Multiplayer needed better maps and nerf ghost but that's it so I give Call of Duty Black OPS an 9.2/10. Has an remember-able, enjoyable campaign that I believe is the best in the ""Black Ops"" family of the series. The zombies mode was also fun, especially the maps.. I have history with this game. My best friend and I played the campaign simultaneously and loved all of it! We also played a lot of zombies with his brother and the highest round we got to was 23 and then the game crashed. Still, it is one of my favourite Call of Duty’s ever.. Black Ops 1 is my all-time favorite COD Game because of the three big game modes Campaign, Multiplayer, & Zombies. The BO1 Campaign introduces brand new characters like Mason, Woods, Bowman, Hudson, Dragovich, Kravchenko, & Steiner. Not to mention, Reznov from World at War also makes an appearance in the campaign which gives me a lot of nostalgia for playing World at War. The BO1 campaign also tried to show some of the horrors of the Cold War but Treyarch also wanted to make sure it was also playing like an Action Movie. Even though the multiplayer maybe mixed among players, I personally prefer to play at speed of BO1's multiplayer regardless of it being slower-paced. COD Points back then weren't bad at all since it was your in-game currency to buy Guns, Perks, Lethal & Tactical Grenades, Equipment, Character Face Paint, Attachments, Kill-streaks, Emblem Materials, Lenses for Optics, & Reticles for Optics. Black Ops 1 COD Points are obviously better than COD Points today because modern day COD Points have to be purchased with real money and they're used to buy RNG Loot Boxes, DLC Packs, Character Cosmetics, Extra Create-a-Class Slots, etc... The Weapon Balance was also changed dramatically since the Assault Rifles were all OP, the Sub-Machine Guns were WEAK, Shotguns were unviable except the Stakeout & the SPAS-12, Snipers were less forgiving to use since Idle Sway was turned up massively because Treyarch didn't want quickscoping & trickshotting to become a big deal at all. Party Games was an awesome feature because they were completely hectic and pressuring since you could gamble your COD Points in Wager Matches where only the Top 3 players in the 6-Player Lobby would be the only players to get their in-game currency back. But, you could only play Wager Matches if you had enough points. You can enter into matches for a tiny amount like 10 Points or you could go all the way to a whopping 10K Points to enter into REAL Gambling Matches. BO1 Multiplayer was also the first multiplayer to introduce Custom Emblems & Theater Mode. Custom Emblems allow players to make anything they want like making an 8-Ball or their favorite TV character. Theater Mode was another good addition since you could record or take pictures of your gameplay, you can also check out screenshots or clips made by other players around the world. Black Ops 1 was also the last COD Game where your online Create-a-Classes for public play were also your Private Match load-outs. It's kind of annoying at first to grind through those ranks, saving up your COD Points to get what you want out of your classes but the grind is worth it. After Treyarch introduced zombies into World at War, everyone expected that Treyarch would bring Zombies back in Black Ops 1 and the Developers added on another layer of difficulty and progression to the mode since it was incredibly basic in World at War. Every DLC Zombies map got more and more complicated than the Launch Maps. Since the developers added new guns, bosses, wonder weapons, perk-a-colas, and wonder items. The Campaign was fantastic, the Multiplayer was hectic, and Zombies will endlessly stay fun. In my opinion, this is the best Black Ops Game of the Black Ops Series and the Best Game of the Franchise in general!. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 8/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 8/10. **** insane games that feels like a fever dream , An improvement at World at war but still not that good .fun with this game at some point but it was Moses just a podcast game to have something to do with my hands. This was the first campaign I beat which makes it mean a lot to me. The multiplayer is solid, and the zombies mode is quite good too.. What is up with all the negative reviews of this game. It is great! Probably my 3rd favourite call of duty and what a huge upgrade for the zombies gamemode!. best call of duty game ever their is so many active players it's easy to find a match the game is so fun it is so good!!. what was great back then show the test of time. Black Ops released to commercial acclaim across the board when it first released, and i had never played it upon its initial release. but going back to play it in 2021, almost 10 years after it initial release, I was able to experience without rose tinted glasses. and I was blown away, I was never a fan of multiplayer in call of duty but both, the campaign and zombies were packed to the brim with content that even someone who was not the biggest fan of shooters, would gawk at. the story is expertly crafted, taking on a more cinematic approach compared to its compatriots of a similar style, with characters that felt realistic in their current situation. zombies is back, from world at war, and its better then ever here. the maps in black ops feel larger and more complicated then previously, but easy enough that after a few rounds, most players will understand what they're doing. while the graphics look poor and the models don't dazzle anyone anymore. the minute to minute action of set pieces are fluid in its style and have an sense of dynamic beauty that had not been seen previously besides the one part in modern warfare 2 that everyone remembers.. black ops one throw this out along with its horrible zombie mode cons toxic story mode toxic zombie mode. Great campaign and zombies, but hated the multiplayer. 'Your review must be at least 75 characters long.'. I’ve only ever played the zombie mode, and I loved it. However, I’m not sure about the rest of the game, so this rating only includes my opinion of the zombies mode(s).. Best Call of Duty of all time! Amazing Story, Zombies, and Multiplayer. Very fun and ahead of it's time!. Call of Duty Black Ops is a masterpiece. COD Black Ops is a First Person Shooter set in the cold war. The story is great.. A butal story with fun characters and very entertaining visuals and implications, this games twists and turns and changed gameplay from other shooters is what truly shows this as one the of the best COD games ever played. This is my favorite COD because of nostalgia.This is the reason why i love the zombies mode more than the others with kino der toten been my favorite zombies map with the most memorable easter egg song (115). The multiplayer was fun with iconic maps and the campaign was great. Best game in the Black Ops series. Released in 2010, this game does continue to be modded. But back then the game was golden, nice multiplayer maps, an amazing campaign, and amazing zombie maps to play on. Dead Ops Arcade was weird but fun. (10/10).. by far the best FPS game with 3 legendary game modes: Campaign Multiplayer Zombies. ""COD: BLACK OPS"" Is a half decent fps shooter that is better than many of its sequels.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GOOD. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. Solid 9/10 as of today's standards. An amazing campaign, for the majority of the community the best in the franchise. Pretty good multiplayer! My only problem with the multiplayer is the killstreak system where your killstreak kills don't count towards the next killstreaks. I think this was done to counter camping which is understandable. The matchmaking in this game is amazing. Zombies is amazing. Anyone who has played the game knows what I'm saying Only reason this game for me isn't a 10/10 is because of the killstreak kills not counting towards earning the next killstreak. Treyarch’s re-imagining of the 1960’s Cold War and Cuban Missile Crisis is what Call of Duty: Black Ops stands out to be the most respected and praised COD ever made. Alongside with the multiplayer and incredible **** Zombies mode, packs a bigger punch that will keep you going past the ranks that most COD players wants to be. And this is by far the best all-in-one Treyarch COD game ever made.. Call of Duty: Black Ops is one of the best games in a series. After Infinity Ward disorder at Treyarch there came hour of triumph. Fine Russophobic game. With excellent geymply for 2010, but an outdated sound and graphics. On Xbox360 a game looks not bad, it is better than on PS3.. The second best story in the Call of Duty games, but the gunplay is just okay. The Zombies is easily the best part of the game.. Being this is the second COD game I've ever played, this has to be one of my favorite shooter games ever. It has an great campaign, a greater Zombies mode, and an even greater Multiplayer mode. This game is way better than some people will have you believe. It's the best CoD ever made in my opinion... the multiplayer was really good, every weapon felt unique (even tho there were a few which were too good and overused), the campaign was very interesting and I'd say it's the best in a CoD. And the star is the zombie mode, it so fun as hell, I spent hours playing it with my friends. It's a MUST-PLAY.. Following in the footsteps of Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1 did little to hold my interest despite its interesting campaign and zombies mode.. The first ""Black Ops"" is Treyarch's best COD game. It's also the best entry in the BLOPS series. At the time of its release, the developer was often mocked as the 'B' team to Infinity Ward's 'A' team. But with this installment, Treyarch really delivered. I'm sure they had felt the pressure to live up to the first two ""Modern Warfare"" games. While it's not a masterpiece, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" is very good. It contains a great story mode, terrific multiplayer and a solid zombies map. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. Masterpiece! Great game! Godlike single part, very fan and intersting multiplayer, and deep zombie mod.. A memorable campaign with memorable characters. It also has an amazing multiplayer that will amuse you for dozens of hours.. I just love how this game make you feel like a badass with the guns and music (not like DOOM). It has memorable charathers and great-confusing story if that makes sense but it was reveal almost at the end why everything was confusing. It has a great twist to the game and great lines but that's just the campaign. The zombies terrified me, the multiplayers were fun and enjoyable. This is probably one of the best COD games.. This was my first Call of Duty game and it remains my favorite game. I played it so much I think I got to prestige level 13. The maps (including Nuke Town, Jungle, Hanoi, WMD, and Firing Range) will be forever my favorite maps in a call of duty. The multiplayer was amazing and beautiful and I had so much fun playing with my sister. The zombies was really hard but still pretty fun, especially playing in that office as Kennedy and Nixon I think. Moreover, the campaign is harrowing and actually has a good story for once in COD's life. I have so much nostalgia around this game. I would give it a 10.0.. This game was my first real call of duty and I have loved it ever since. I loved this black ops and the second one even more. This one was so simple yet it did so much right. I didn't ever play the campaign or really much of the multiplayer but the zombies was enough to get me hooked. They had the right amount of balance of complexity and simplicity. The new games tried too hard for easter eggs and other nonsense. This game did it right and I have been so trilled with that. I don't think any other call of duty zombie game will be as charming as this one. Thank you. This game earned the perfect score. A refined version of Modern Warfare 2, without all the **** Call of Duty: Black Ops is one of the best entries in the series, and provides a touch of magic from Treyarch who are clearly the leading Call of Duty studio.. With MW2 being a departure of its roots in favor of more popular and commercialized production, I was expecting some sort of return with the series. World War 2 was already repeated twice, so that was a no-go, leaving Vietnam and Korea on the map for the next war game. Would it return to the roots and still remain fresh for the players? In my opinion I would say Black Ops 1 does deliver that war-like feel, but not of the same caliber as WAW. The campaign is not as action-packed as MW2, but it was going for a more twist with the Cold War and having this Black Operative style that reflected that paranoia of the U.S. and Russia in the Cold War's height. The brutality came back and I enjoyed it very much unlike MW2 lacking it. Unfortunately, my fears had surfaced when the hand holding and power of war and sacrifice had been trashed the moment I was given my ""toys"" to play without throughout. Bringing back the soldiers of WAW surprised me much like Soap and Price in MW2, but worked much better I think because it reflected the nature of the political spectrum Russia had when the U.S.S.R. was around. Not brilliantly or anything, but comparing the past three games, I'd say it is better than MW2's, but not as good as WAW and not even close to COD4's. The zombies return and bring three maps instead of one (I only look at the base game here). Kino Der Toten from Nacht Der Untoten was perhaps the most brilliant jump in quality ever, as long as nobody played the DLC maps WAW had for zombies at the time. I really love its larger, yet simple design that echoes the original and pretty much evolves it. Playing with friends, or running solo was always a joy to play on that map and it's an easy top 10 for all maps currently. Five, however, then turns up and is one of the worst maps ever made to this date. A cool concept ruined by the zombie's behaviors and the tight close spaces, it was a dam shame such potential was wasted. Dead Ops Arcade was fun little distraction that takes the idea of zombies into a arcade shooter and (although clumsily) makes some challenge for players. The multiplayer in Black Ops was really really good. Once again, not as well done as COD4, but I loved the maps (mostly), the music and theme mixed with a retro feel of the guns. Perk Imbalance still ran rampant, but what Black Ops also did that I loved was adding emblem customizing, contracts, character customization options, the cod point system and theater mode on top of its multiplayer. Even if the emblem designs could look ridiculous or stupid, I loved the idea of creating your own identity. Adding face paint and wearing certain perks to define your character's outfit really made team tactics good and also define you as your own soldier. The cod point system was genius; you earn points (or money in this case) as you played matches and spend on weapons, camos, sights, and all sorts of things so you could spend it the way you wanted and not the game. The contract system made point gathering easier by allowing you to bet on challenges you set yourself to complete and earn not just experience but loads of points to help further benefit you. Add to that a wager match system where you bet those points in a pool with other players and win them by playing unique modes, and you have a competitive setup that actually helps everyone in the end for getting what they want. Combat wise, it did away with quickscoping and used a mix of old and new scorestreaks with a retro feel to them. Weapon imbalance was and still is an issue and coupling this with the perk imbalance, there was a arcade vibe more than a war vibe. I still enjoyed it for the setting and style however and is still one of my favorite Cod multiplayers to date. Black Ops receives alot of flak by the community on more than its fair share of issues, but I would argue it gave back the feel of what WAW and COD4 had that MW2 was lacking in, even if it doesn't live up to those standards. I always appreciated Black Ops for trying a different take on war through the lens of black operations and make us question what really goes on in our world that isn't always on a open battlefield. A well done game that is in my top five COD games of all time (#3).. Campaign not the best, Multiplayer was actually good on this COD, However it's the Zombies mode that is the real selling point here, especially with all the maps. Definely one of my favorite COD games.. I quite like Black Ops, I don't love it like many do, it isn't one of my favourite entries in the series, but I definitely like it. The campaign is a solid, fun and sometimes thought-provoking experience with great characters and story. The multiplayer is an improvement over World at War and MW2, but it feels fairly similar to most games in the series before it, with some neat additions such as Wager Matches and CoD points (BEFORE THEY WERE MICROTRANSACTIONS IN BO3). Zombies was also a lot of fun, even though I don't play it in newer titles, I can appreciate it here and in World at War. In conclusion, I don't love Black Ops as much as many others do, but I had a good time with it, absolutely one of the better Post-WaW CoDs if you ask me. 7/10. Black Ops is such a great Call of Duty. It has a really compelling single player campaign, very fun cold war era multiplayer mode, and epic zombies mode with a lot of map choice. It was my first Call of Duty and instantly made me fall in love.. Even though the single player campaign doesn't deliver a good storytelling, the multiplayer and zombies mode are fantastic to play with friends online.. If you take a look at the rest of the recent reviews for Black Ops here, you'll notice all of the high scores, especially compared to recent COD games. The reason for that, I'd argue, is because this game did basically every aspect of the series well. Good single-player campaign setpieces, good storyline, good cooperative Zombies mode and maps, good multiplayer gunplay and the general atmosphere to everything. Perhaps each of these aspects alone don't stand out - WaW had better Zombies, MW2 had a more fun multiplayer (if less balanced), COD4's campaign pacing was more focused and had a more climactic conclusion. However, by doing each and every category well, BO forms one of the most cohesive experiences in the series, alongside the likes of CoD4 and CoD2. Take a look at MW3 - the co-op Survivalist mode was arguably shoehorned in. Take a look at BO3 - easily the worst campaign in the trilogy. Black Ops feels like a finished game, if a little unpolished, and it's Treyarch's first real foray into their own territory. Compare that to MW2, which was released a year too early, and the main villain of the plotline has a poorly developed and confusing motive. (As a side note, MW2 should have been released in 2010, Black Ops in 2011, and we should only just be hitting Black Ops II rather than III right about now, but Activision is one **** t y company. Infinity Ward was gutted in 2009, a **** PR manager and like 4 secretaries were all that was left, and that's what was forced into making MW3 for 2011. The series as a whole receives a whole lot of justified flak for being released yearly, and it's obvious that many games in the series suffered for it, 2011-2014 releases in particular. That doesn't make them all not worth playing though, in my opinion.) Overall, BO is still definitely one of the better games in the series, and it should be remembered that way too. I'd personally rank it at something like 4th overall, not for doing anything spectacular in a single specific category, but for being cohesive and doing everything well despite its early release.. I really love this game's campaign . Surely one of the best . The multiplayer is excellent given the fact that there are now bots . With me being mostly offline , this is truly enjoyable . The zombies mode is very much fun as well and this also included the highly fun dead ops arcade . Well done Treyarch !. Although some would disagree, I'd say Black Ops had the best storyline and best twist I've ever seen in a Call of Duty game. The story had some interesting elements of Fight Club and other great movies mixed in, which delivered a unique experience. Multiplayer isn't GROUND BREAKING or anything, but it is fun. And best of all, the zombies game mode was incredible, with some of the best and inventive maps to date.. This is easily my favorite Call of Duty of all time, the campaign was simply amazing, this is the cod that got me into the franchise and this is the only cod i spend hundred of hours playing online, i'm not a fan of fps in general, i mostly play japanese rpg but this was the first fps to get me addicted, it was probably because my friend were all playing, we had so much fun, i have so many great memories of this game, i miss those moment with one of my friend in particular when he ",the game is nastalgic with the zombies and the campain is great . the campaign is awesome (not quite as good as MW2 but still a good contender) black ops was the 3rd best cod of all time after MW2 and BO2 .
751.Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest,"Although this game is not perfect it is quite well balanced for a fire emblem game. Not just in the combat but balanced all around in most area of the game as a whole. The story though basic is quite enjoyable and the cut scenes are spectacular. The minute to minute general gameplay is engaging and fun. Besides chapter 5 being a miserable experience the rest of the game is very tight and well designed. Not my favorite FE on 3DS but it’s up the with awakening for sure.. Gameplay is great, the characters are memorable and the class system is easily one of the best in the series. Also the presentation is incredible and the soundtrack is great as well. While the story isnt great (you should play Birthright for that because it has actually a pretty good story), the rest of the aspects of the game are so good.. Super easy as all modern Fire Emblem games have been. Not an issue but worth noting. The story was painfully boring. I didn't really care much about any of the characters except Corrin and Azula. Some of the maps were fun, others not so much. Wish they did without the incest. I get that romance is heavily emphasized in the 3ds game but letting Corrin marry and have kids with their supposed blood relatives is weird and the primary reason for the low rating. I don't care if they aren't technically related because that's worse as it ruins the whole point of the story. Where's the tension if Corrin isn't actually related to either side? It's just a war between two groups. The only part of this game worth playing is Corrin in Smash. Gameplay is pretty much on par with Awakening, didn't like it as much as Awakening but it was still pretty damn fun. The fate series had 3 games it all put out at once, and while I think they are all of similar quality; Conquest is the best of them. The same issues are present in this version as it's counterparts, 2 chapters at the end are connected, but don't give you a save between them, the game is largely designed on casual play over traditional, the marriage/child mechanic is forced and heavily encouraged, and Corrin is still as personable as dry wall.While this game is treated as the hardest of the 3, in reality it's actually far more fair and reasonable. A lot of the hardness in the game really just comes from being unprepared or not getting proper levels for certain units, and while most games this would be bad design, in Fire Emblem, it's par the course. In fact, a lot of conquest actually feels like it was designed with far more thought and reason beyond. Conquest's story actually presents proper moral dilemmas and doesn't end things as tightly as it's counterparts because that's what war is.Conquest still has some awful moments, most notably chapter 11, and Nohr's family issues with their father, but it largely feels like they were heading to fix the issues till Nintendo ordered more games in Fate. In a lot of ways, you can see what Fate was suppose to be in conquest, but overall this is just a mediocre experience with some interesting bits.. It it so close to be my favorite FE game, but I do not like how the game looks. Still I always have fun replaying it. (version 1.0). My favorite Fire Emblem, best maps ever made, challenging, fun to build your characters, relationships and your castle, you cannot go wrong. The pair up system is much more balanced compared to Fire Emblem Awakening a must have for every fan of the franchise, for starters i would recommend his counterpart Fire Emblem Birthright, which is pretty good too.. Definitely the best Fire Emblem Fates Game. The story is arguably the worst, however, it is terrible in all of Fates. The Gameplay of Conquest is great though. Even on normal Difficulty, it is not a cakewalk. But even on the hardest difficulty, it is beatable, however, you cannot switch your brain off once, this will be punished. If you expect a good story, this Game is not for you. If you want entertaining Turn based Strategy though, it is a fantastic experience.. The most solid gameplay experience in the series outside of Thracia. Unfortunately it suffers from an irritating cast and downright bizarre story.. Conquest had the best gameplay and the story was better handled than in Birthright. It was also the hardest version but enjoyable. Some plot holes but nothing too bad. The original soundtrack was also very good.. The best gameplay in the entire series, but the plot is too terrible to be ignored..

The story is really dumb but hey, the gameplay is great! That redeems the game a lot in my eyes.. Clearly the best of the fates trio. Great difficulty imo (I played in normal casual but am a bit of a noob) and the story was incredible. Birthright feels like a more obvious path, but this also leads to a more obvious story. Conquest feels more fleshed out - although I will say that the deaths in Birthright are more emotional.. Probably one of my favorite games. Highly recommend if you like turn-based strategy games. If you care a lot about story though, this game may not be for you. Pros: -Challenging, largely fair gameplay that mostly avoids giving unique advantages to the enemy -Dragon veins give a lot of variety to approaching a chapter -Lunatic mode isn't just stat inflation and slapping a couple OP skills; groups of enemies change as does how they behave -One route has enough content to make a satisfying game on its own -Rework of the pair-up system is welcome and largely well done -Personal skills are a great touch to make even the worst units viable -Classes are no longer gender-locked; opening up options for reclassing units without being so open that you can spec every unit into one overpowered class -Method of gaining access to classes is complex and appropriately restricted behind how you play with a unit in battle -UI is excellent and takes full advantage of dual screens -CG cutscenes look quite amazing given the hardware running it -Music is pretty good -Enemy capture system is fun to play with and offers alternatives if a unit falls too far behind -Large variety in victory conditions -Many maps are designed to discourage turtling and low-manning; much appreciated considering these strategies are a common cheese in FE -The process behind building a good child unit is actually pretty involved and adds replay value Cons: -Nonsensical plot -Plot-wise, child units felt tacked on -Mostly one-note characters -There is one unique enemy advantage that cheapens the final chapters on Lunatic a little bit since it allows debuffs to stack -Extremely poor localization that cuts content -Extra routes cost money -Weapon system makes many weapon types undesireable even though they're traditionally better -Defense stance is a little too broken compared to attack stance. Is the best game in the fate trilogy And it makes you feel horrible so that's a plus. This game is more challenging than birthright but its problem is it plays like birthright and because of that a lot of character are just useless and you will never use in conquest and the format of the game makes it not only overly difficult but its lacks any balancing for this insane difficulty spike. The story had giant plots which literally in the story said dont worry about it. The big problem with conquest is that it has a better story than birthright but the gameplay is like a glove that doesnt fit. This game is literally the reason phoenix mode exists. I found the story to be meh and gameplays biggest problem is that its not balanced properly and unlike birthright it overstays its welcome because of its balance issues. i'm not a long time fan of the series, so I haven't really felt the heavy disappointment some of them did, but I was always a fan of the strategic gameplay of Fire Emblem and I was glad to play this particular game. it was engaging and interesting as far as gameplay and some of the character relationships go, though I'll say, a lot of characters, especially the main one, leave things to be desired, and they come off pretty Mary Sue-ish, but the feel of the game and the challenges it present aren't half bad and I had quite a lot of fun playing through it. i was still sold on the addition of same sex relationships and I hope Fire Emblem will keep doing that because Niles' romance was amazing.. I honestly loved it even more than Birthright. While Birthright told a more straightforward story, Conquest's story was not only more emotional, it was also filled with characters that were much more colorful and fun that I found myself getting much more attached to. And because I played Birthright first, certain scenes were REALLY emotional (some of you know the ones). The levels were also more fun and challenging, which made the whole experience of beating them more rewarding. Overall this was just the better game of the two, and I loved it a lot, even if it broke my heart several times.. Conquest is a game that I think a lot of people give too little credit over. Everybody knows by now that the story is a mess, but I'd go as so far as to say that's the only bad thing about the game proper. Everything else, I'd say, is superb; the graphics are gorgeous, the characters are lovable, the gameplay is - hands down - the best in the franchise, and I even enjoyed bits and pieces of Fates' extremely flawed narrative. If you want to pick up this game, I recommend you do so gauging it by its own merits and not paying the story too much heed. Even if it's not a good FE game (which I disagree with, but understand the mentality), it's still a good game overall that I strongly recommend.. I cannot in good conscience say anything good about this game or the other 2 routes because there is nothing good to say. It had terrible writing, characters only ranged from bland to terrible and were largely unlikable, the debuffs that replaced weapon durability were ridiculous, the shoehorned in waifu mechanic with it's ridiculously bad excuse for the children being playable only hurt the game even more, the fanservice was really cranked up (Bath houses? Seriously?). The main character was a self-insert mary sue who in Conquest, was treated like a doormat to justify anything that happened. Most importantly, Fates failed to capture anything that made FE, FE. I am a long time FE fan and I can honestly say that this is NOT Fire Emblem. None of this is what Fire Emblem is about. It didn't even feel like an actual FE game. It felt like a grossly anime knockoff trying and failing to be it. So anyone thinking about getting this game, it's truly not even worth looking at. Good gameplay, good supports, absolutely horrible story do not trust the people that say otherwise. I like that Conquest doesn't f*ck around, from beginning to end it offers you a thrilling and challenging experience where a simple bad choice can lead you to say goodbye to your favorite unite or waifu if your'e in that kind of thing or even restart your game from zero. The music if not amazing is really good and as any FE game it has a ton of characters that are interesting for the most part, the game play is brutal and you can't grind so you better choose a balanced team and stick with them till the end or be like me and use everyone and suffer from that. The thing is that the story and that was my only issue also with FE Awakening, at least for me doesn't match the heights of the game play or the characters it has, it feels so generic that you see everything coming from miles away, also the English dub is not that bad because there are a lot of lines but is kinda annoying and you can't switch it to Japanese. In the end Conquest offers a pretty solid game play and solid experience that puts you in the shoes of an strategist, if only the story was at least a little more original and interesting this game could be a masterpiece.. In case you're wondering, yes I have played "" Birthright "" as well **** was alright, a little too easy for me but not bad. With that out of the way, let's talk about "" Conquest "" . This game is amazing! In fact, I'd even say that it became one of my new favorite video-games of all-time. The story follows your avatar ( Corrin ) who was raised in the kingdom of Nohr, ruled by King Garon. After a while, you run into the Hoshidans, who claim to be your birth family. It's up to you to make the ultimate choice, fight with your birth family, or side with the Nohrians who have raised and loved you for years. This game has a decent storyline that is very heart-felt. The game is one of the few games to actually pull at my heartstrings and make me tear up. The gameplay is great, it's easy to get the hang of and it is very addictive. Unlike the missions in "" Birthright "" ( rout the enemy or defeat the boss ) the missions in this one are very unique and they don't make the game feel repetitive ( defend the area, escape with all units, defeat all bosses in 20 turns, etc. ). The soundtrack is flawless ! It fits the tone of the game perfectly and they are very pleasing to listen to ( "" Lost in thoughts all alone "" is one of the best songs I've heard in a game. ). So overall, this game is a masterpiece. I can't think of one thing I had a problem with ( despite some plot-points I won't spoil. ). This game is smart, well-crafted, emotional, and highly addictive. One of the few times I would call a game perfect. 10/10. I bought this game due to good reviews. I feel as if I've been duped because it lacks a soul. The story is so generic and bare, and the horrible voice acting sounds just like it's been copied from Pokemon. I may have enjoyed the game if I was 12, but no. I highly recommend against this game. A good challenge and fun to play as a strategy game. However, the setting, plot and characters leave much to be desired. +Maps now have diverse objectives and are generally well-designed. Reinforcements appear at sensible moments & locations and do not have the potential to completely screw you over like they did in FE: Awakening. +The class system still needs a guide to make sense of, but it does allow for more varied characters over different playthroughs. +There is a good range of difficulty and I found myself playing different styles throughout the chapters. +Some of the character support conversations are genuinely cute and pleasant -The setting of fighting for the seemingly darker empire that is Nohr is a good start. Unfortunately it becomes clear that only the King and his henchmen are evil and that all of your royal sibling are lovable goody-two-shoes, which is a lame cliche and results in no real character development (as nothing changes). -The chapters adopt a predictable pattern of ""go defeat X for your evil king and complain about it"", which grows really tired after the 10th time. -Not much is explained about the world. Entire nations pop into existence when the plot demands it and vanish into obscurity right after the respective mission is done. The world doesn't feel very alive as a result. Overall the game is fun to play, but the story segments are so weak that I just stopped reading them around half-way through.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love this game because of the fact that it returned to its roots in regards to the challenges of each chapter. Chapters usually have a gimmick to gives an advantage/disadvantage to the players but this isn't apparent in Conquest. I was especially surprised in Chapter 10 which required you to defend the line for a number of turn. Gameplay is a 10, however Story is a sad 6 for me and everything else like characters, QoL improvements eventually led me to a9. PROS: -fun gameplay -great characters(although many are Awakening's characters refurbished). -great interactions(as expected in a Fire Emblem game). -great but few cinematics. -visual improvements from Awakening battle system. -amazing level design. Every map is unique and offers a new challenge. -strategic to the extreme. In hard mode, 1 bad move usually represents the death of a character, or a reward missed. CONS: -strategic to the extreme. In hard mode, 1 bad move usually represents the death of a character, or a reward missed. -overly simplistic storyline, full of deus ex machina and childish resolutions. -characters are in many ways copies of Awakening's children. Many are direct copies, like Odin x Owain. -characters are too archetypical, one-dimensional. The main villain is kinda ridiculous, sometimes being bad for the sake of being bad. -Unbalanced difficulty. You're aways outnumbered by large, under leveled, poor, can't afford weapons, can't afford basic health itens, can't find money enough, die in battle with 1 single mistake, and sometimes around round 20! Damn, they could at least let you grind without having to pay for a dlc... -""My Castle"" mechanics are repetitive in a Farmiville way, after some time you basically ignore the castle and just play the chapters/paralogues.. Conquest is a must have for those Fire Emblem fans who want to prove that they are more than just casual fans of the series and up for a fun challenge. Some maps (for inexperienced players) can be notoriously challenging. But with that comes the satisfaction in micromanaging each units move during the mission and finally finishing it after a myriad attempts. If you find yourself easily frustrated and have little experience playing Fire Emblem games, I really recommend Birthright, or if you insist you want to side with Nohr: to only play on Normal+Casual mode on Conquest. Fire Emblem Fates is an excellent follow up to Awakening on the 3DS. It boasts a *very* powerful soundtrack, eye-candy cut scenes and a polished battle system. The small loss in quality that some people accuse it of having in terms of plot/dialogue it makes up in the quantity of having Conquest, Revelations and Birthright. It does suffer from serious localisation issues, resulting in some very obsolete and pointless game features (ex: private quarters/character bonding outside support dialogues). The castle system introduced in this game is not perfect but is extremely enjoyable for those who want to customise their team to the max, and although its been abused, offers some interesting aspects to the game. As a side note - Please ignore anyone complaining about localisation. Yes, a few features were lost but boo hoo we aren't playing fire emblem so we can pet/marry our favourite characters, that's a completely different genre people. Please appreciate the wonderful game we have been granted by our friends at Nintendo.. Improves the already incredible Fire Emblem Awakening in the most important aspect it lacked: difficulty. No longer a great game which ends up in the try a quest- fail- farm until you are OP as **** then retry. This time, you really need to play strategic and almost perfect turns in order to advance. That alone will justify the flaws : story and such.. As a longtime Fire Emblem fan, I always have liked the more difficult games of the series, so I picked this one up hearing that it was going to be difficult. It lived up to this claim. The game is tough, although the level of difficulty goes on from unfair to easy, and that can hurt the game. The story is fun, dark, and has some full emotion moments, but some of the interactions between the characters are really not good. I know that in japan the features are more into fan serive and I know that is what drives in a lot of the fans over there, but I've never very into that stuff, so it annoys me that resources where put into that instead of more interesting interactions or more item variation, or skills. Nevertheless, I've had a lot of fun, and have good hope for the future of this series. If you enjoy Fire Emblem, strategy games, or good story drive games, this is definetily recommended.. Positive: Subpar but slightly entertaining gameplay. Negative: Awful story, bland one-dimensional characters and non-sensical extra features. I recommended playing older Fire Emblem titles before playing this abomination, preferably Fire Emblem (GBA) and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.. Excellent game. While the story is not exactly the best, the characters are great and gameplay is amazing. The level design is top-notch and the music is definitely a plus. Its a must have for anyone who likes Fire Emblem or strategy games. If you are reading this, please understand that many of the other negative reviews are incredibly childish and are not even related to the core of the game. People like them want to be treated like adults, but act like children when complaining about missing features that only deprived losers would enjoy.. Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest boasts to being a tribute to classic Fire Emblem games with no level grinding, more difficult and dynamic gameplay. To begin with, the story is horribly written and portrayed for Fire Emblem games. The villain of the game is already revealed to you before you make your decision on whether to defend Hoshido or Nohr, which makes choosing to be on Nohr's side in this case to be meaningless. The villain can be dumbed down to ""rah rah evil!"" and doesn't leave as much of an impact as the previous games, usually with a king from a different nation threatening dominance onto other nations. Not to mention that a lot of deus ex machina conflicts regarding the main protagonist ruins the overall immersion of the game. I can also conclude that it's one of the worst written games in the franchise, which is sad considering how much time and effort was spent into making the script for the game. However, the game presents really well in my opinion. It has a great soundtrack and its art-style is terrific. The character designs aren't half bad either, and I didn't have an issue with how the game looks overall. Although it may have sounded like I was praising the gameplay before, it's very wishy-washy. The gameplay isn't bad, but Fire Emblem veterans are going to have issues adjusting to this style of game. To begin with, pairing up is still a mechanic, but is more balanced, as the enemies can pair up as well. Pairing up was broken in Fire Emblem Awakening, so it makes me glad to say this. However, the game has decided to put more emphasis on character interactions than strategic gameplay, which I think was a horrible mistake. In previous Fire Emblem games, the support system was always a minor side gameplay element meant to elevate the characters, their personalities, and the story as a whole. I don't have a problem with this, as if you do your research and match certain characters correctly with others, you can have amazingly strong child units. Though, here's the kicker: Unlike Fire Emblem Awakening, children units hold no purpose to the overall plot of Fire Emblem Fates. It serves no purpose and is just a means to pair with units and to get overly stronger units with better skills. If that's what you want to do with your Fire Emblem game, then that's fine, but I think it's an overly forced mechanic without significance. Regarding weapons, I have both a good and a bad thing to say about it. The good thing is that weapons are color coded, making the weapon triangle more diverse and allowing for more strategy. However, none of the weapons in this game, with the exception of staves, can break. It makes a lot of the special unbreakable insignificant in comparison and breaks a lot of the immersion in general. One thing that I hear a lot is that this is the harder version of the Fates collection, and although it is difficult, with a bit of trial and error, you can definitely make it past on normal mode without too much difficulty. The map design is also quite varied, allowing for a lot of interesting chapters. Overall, Fire Emblem Conquest is a good game, but it doesn't quite reach the potential of what's considered to be a good Fire Emblem game. If you want to get into the Fire Emblem series, then you should probably get into Blazing Sword or Sacred Stones, as both games are cheaper to get on the 3DS eShop, and provide a much better first time experience. If you're a Fire Emblem veteran and (somehow) haven't played Fates to this point, then know that this isn't reaching the quality of the GBA and Tellius games.. You'll notice the negative reviews due to censorship- while I disagree with the concept of censorship, I'm glad they did it in this case. The scenes that you spend with your spouse are awkward enough as it is- I'm glad that they removed the minigame that was in the Japanese version. It would have been terribly cringe-worthy. I know next to nothing about the missing dialogue (and I can vouch for the fact that the voice acting is absolutely minimalist), but the writing that is present in the game is on par with that from Awakening- no better, no less. With that said, the actual game is one of the most exciting things to happen to Fire Emblem since I've been a fan. The game retains its strong strategic/RPG roots, but it also mixes up its strategic balance to make things seem fresh. You no longer have weapon durability, but now you have to determine which weapon is best for each situation. You now auto-attack with neighboring units, unless you decide to pair up with another unit to increase your stats. Do you want damage, or survivability? I love the inclusion of shurikens/throwing knives, which are designed to weaken your opponents. Soften them up with a ninja attack and then finish them off with a coordinated follow-up. These kinds of strategies mix up everything that I implemented in Awakening. I loved how this game was also very challenging- I started off on Hard, and about 2/3 the way through I had to tone down the difficulty. That last bit of the game was very easy, but I'd had enough of a challenge by that point. The beautiful animated cutscenes return (although I will always wish they had more of these), but I felt like the fan-service given by Camilla was absolutely over-the-top and unnecessary. I have to be wary of playing this game around my wife.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing. Incredible. Unmatched. The Fire Emblem series is the greatest strategy game franchise in history and Conquest proves what we already know. It's a step down in quality from Awakening, but even then it is still the game of the year.. Hey V-sauce, Michael here! I'm going to be reviewing the newest addition to the nintendogs series of games, **** emblem: tales from the viet congs. In this game, you assume the role of Tupac, the prince of the Iz Israel kingdom with the power to turn into a gay rattle snake. Tupac is the supposedly the son of suge knight but is later beleived to be a clone created by mr Shigeru miyamoto to counter the god awful sales of twillight **** Tupac then joins the power rangers as they proceed to find the **** emblem. Overall, I give thus game a 10/10. The story is too basic, half of your allies are **** your Main Character chose to side with the bad guy kingdom instead of his family... the list goes on. But worst of all: Conquest was supposed to be ""challenging."" And chapters 1-9 were just that: difficult, made hard enough to test you considerably, but not unreasonable. However, chapter 10 was a difficulty spike the likes of which I had never seen before. It went from ""difficult"" to ""psychopathically sadistic."" I picked ""hard"" difficulty, and 1-9 were just that: hard. But chapter 10 took it up to Lunatic-difficulty levels. I have played the entire Advanced Wars series, and 3 fire emblem games before this one, and I expect better than this difficulty-spike BS from Intelligent Systems. 1/10 because I feel betrayed as a player, as a customer, and as a fan of the series.. A great game, I have sunk so many hours into this that I can't even complain that it made me buy the optional alternate paths and DLC as even including those into the cost, it has still been great value. I prefer the characters in this to Birthright and there was more variety in the missions making this the better game but I would recommend playing Birthright first as inevitably you'll want to see the story from that side and it serves as a good warm up. Conquest is hard, even on it's lowest difficulty. I have no idea how people defeat it in hardcore mode.. Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest is a worthy followup to the critically acclaimed Fire Emblem Awakening. It needs to be said however that Conquest is designed to be more difficult. If you want a challenge? Conquest will test even the most seasoned FE fans. It needs to be said that FE:Fate's presentation is top notch. The cutscenes and character animations are well done. The character models themselves actually have feet! In areas like my castle you can tap the L shoulder button to zoom down and see your surroundings in 3rd person. In battle the camera shifts from top down to also zoom in on your surrounding terrain. Conquests' story can be best described as siding with your adopted family the Nohr empire. Birthright on the other hand has you siding with your blood relation of the Hoshido. But as any Fire Emblem vet can tell you; its a bit more nuanced than that. Birthright and Conquest essentially start the same. At mission 5 you will then branch off into that version's storyline. Birthright is the easier more accessible version. It allows you to grind and fight random battles to build up your party. Conquest on the other had requires careful thought and planning to succeed. Fates introduces some new mechanics that shake up some classic Fire Emblem staples. Weapons no longer take durability damage (aside from staves and rods). The map can be altered using what are called Dragon veins. These spots can create bridges, level mountains and more. The game also introduces a new area called My Castle. You can build buildings such as shops, mess hall, fishing pond and more. These often offer items that you can use in a number of ways. In my castle you can also invite party members to your private quarters to boost your relationship. The dating sim elements of Awakening have been expanded here in that once you marry you will have new options within your private quarters. You may also have to use the stylus to wake your significant other for instance. My castle also has a little bit of online multiplayer in it that allows you to siege other player's castles and defend your own as well. Its advisable to play Birthright first followed by Conquest and then Revelation. Buying physical copies of both is essentially a waste of money because you get the others at a cheaper price as a download once you own one version. Overall Conquest is an excellent part in one of the most expansive Fire Emblem tales to date.. Both Fates games improved on or matched Awakening in the best ways possible. The gameplay was fun - I personally prefer the challenge Conquest provides, but all three routes were enjoyable by themselves. If you're new to the series, Birthright is probably better to w","the story isn't great (you should play Birthright for that because it has actually a pretty good story), but the rest of the aspects of the game are so good . letting Corrin marry and have kids with their supposed blood relatives is weird and the primary reason for the low rating ."
752.TowerFall Ascension,"So much fun! A lot of customizations, great controls, and a wide variety in levels. This really shines when playing together with some friends on the same screen.. One of the best - if not the best - competitive couch playstation games I know. It is great to play against friends and for us never gets stale as there are so many stages and modifications to select. You can basically change everything and gameplay has a lot of customisation options. Overall a great game I am very happy with! Only an ""no headjump stump""-modificator would be really nice!. Towerfall Ascension provides fun gameplay to have with your friends. Fun and simple.. One of the best party games to come out on the playstation. Near endless fun. Never gets old.. This is perhaps one of the greatest multiplayer games ever created. Before discovering Towerfall, Bomberman 2 was my favorite multiplayer couch co-op type game. But towerfall has definitely replaced that game as my new all time favorite. This game is a masterpiece. I have absolutely zero complaints, because I truly think the game is perfect. The controls are wonderful. The characters, weapons, customizations, etc. everything about this game is well thought out and crafted so well. Truly a king among multiplayer games!. This is as much fun with friends & family as you're going to have in years. Looks easy on the surface yet is quite complex, this game offers various tactics to take down opponents where precision & timing really matter. An absolute go-to for local multiplayer parties.. Good coop experience, but a little short since the first levels are really easy. Its versus mode works great as a party game. Amazing in multiplayer with friends. It could get really hectic and competitive at times. Its an amazing multiplayer experience although I dont own the game and I only play it with my cousins its a fun game for hours in multiplayer. But the reason why it isnt a 10 is basically that if I were the one to buy the game I wouldnt play it unless people are with me. The game is amazing fun though, the only modifiers you need to have fun is are wings and shields but it doesnt have online wich it would really need and I heard the singleplayer isnt that good.. Basic game semi good online game nothing special has old graphics, and is not particularly innovating. Is similar to many arena games where you fight in an arena to gain power- ups.. Some people knock Towerfall Ascension for not having online capabilities. But, for me, that's exactly what makes it a 10. This is a game that I've dumped well over 100 hours into - because of its couch co-op feature. My group of three best friends and myself are always playing TA when we're together over a few beers. It's the perfect game after we've all had a long week for work. We can kick back, and just have a fun without a huge time commitment. I don't think enough games like this have come out in recent years. From the co-op to the versus modes, it's always a fun time. Gameplay is fast, fluid, rewarding if you're skillful, and unforgiving if you make mistakes. Soundtrack is amazing and all the gameplay customization options call for a fun, different experience on the fly.. I give this one here not the highest ranking simply because theres still one Thing missing - an online mode! BUT Nevertheless, Towerfall is one of the BEST multiplayer games out there on ANY console. Its extremely easy to pick up and Play, the controls are spot on, the game Looks and sounds amazing (very detailed Pixel graphics), its hectic, dramatic, chaotic, and one hell of a blast to Play. Its a must own for any PS gamer that has some friends for Couch coop! Get it NOW - and get the DLC as well - its cheap and Features the 4player Coop and some other crazy cool stuff that will Keep you and your friends busy for weeks if not months!. Towerfall: Ascension is a gem ****. Its concept is simple, up to 4 players battle it out in single-screen arenas, jumping around from platform to platform, aiming opponents with their arrows or just stomping on their heads, Mario-style. Gameplay is simple but extremely effective and fun. You aim and fire your arrow and hope it hits an opponent, or you can stomp them. Warning: arrows are limited and you have to physically get them back, or dodge and catch an opponent's arrow in the air before it hits you. You will laugh with your buddies about getting hit, cheating, being lucky, and whatever! There are power up boxes (drill arrows, invisibility, darkness, lava, slow motion, etc.) scattered in the arenas, and there are some interlinks in most of the maps so you can fire an arrow from the top of the arena aiming up and hit an opponent hiding in the lower part from below, for example. The arrow mechanic can be a bit hit or miss, arrows can ""lock"" to opponents and adjust trajectory even if they jump away, or you can hit boxes and then the arrow will kill opponents falling down, but its randomness is hilarious. Every character available is the same except its color, no special abilities, just another skin, and you can unlock more skins the more you play (in a nice touch, the Dualshock 4 changes color in its light bar according to the avatar you choose to play as). 3 game modes exist: free for all, team death match, and quest mode, which is a pseudo-cooperative against waves of monsters. There is no classic co-op campaign, so you 'll have to buy the Dark World expansion (believe me, you have to buy it, if you like the game). Graphics and sound are retro, NES/SNES style, and while I have grown tired of all these new retro games released in recent years, Towerfall works fine in this regard. When you have so much fun with friends, the last thing you pay attention to is if the game looks retro instead of having ultra quality graphics. And yes, the game runs at 60 fps and controller responsiveness is ultra fast. The only serious downside of the game is that its avatars are just different colored variations of the same base character, with no special/exclusive abilities at all. A little more variation would be nice. The lack of online multiplayer is maybe due to developers lacking the skills to make a proper netcode, but they said Towerfall is meant to be played in the same couch with others. If you like couch multiplayer/party games, Towerfall: Ascension is for you.. Awesome game, just wish they wouldnt be lazy and make online multiplayer. Still its great if You have anybody willing to play game with such outdated graphics - there are tons of fun for You. Then I really recommend it.. I love local multiplayer game. I prefer to play against my friends on my couch than online where mr nobody is your opponent. Maybe i'm coming from an old generation, but Towerfall is clearly a game in my chord. I don't like the aesthetic, but the gameplay is solid and funny. Compared to other local multiplayer is a little bit repetitive, but it's an overall good game. Conclusion: If you want to have some fun with your friends for some nights it's the title for you, but it will become boring after a while.. TowerFall Ascension is a good ole' time. Couch co-op at it's best with a lot of time spent yelling with friends while we battled each other. It does start to get repetitive however, and there isn't enough changes in stages, weapons, etc. for the game to be something I would recommend people to put a lot of time in. Games like Duck Game do the same thing as this, but a whole lot better. The game is fun, but lack of any single player, and lack of differences match to match hurt the game. 6.7/10. A fantastic couch co-op. The single player aspect is alright but shooting friends and ruining friendships is where this game really shines. Your each a little archer trying to stick each other with a variety of arrows that you must retrieve once you're out. It offers a variety of game modes that keeps things interesting and the levels allow of fun, sneaky tactics to trick your enemies. It might not be the best game to pick up if you don't have anyone to play with.. Friends + TWA + beer = magic. I was very skeptical with this at first, but it has entertained us for so many hours. Highly skill intensive platformer, where you must simply shoot your opponents with limited supply of arrows. Power-ups spawn at certain times which give you some sort of bonus from plethora of choices. Games are also highly customizable, and you can choose to begin with different sorts of power-ups etc. making replayability very high.. Are you setting up a party? Do you want to make your party 100% better? Buy this game, grab your controllers and play this game, versus or cooperatively! Seriously though, this game is one of the best 'backseat gaming' game. Had a lot of fun.. Not only that, yesterday this game got a workshop support! More awesomeness! If you want to play this game online, its not possible unless you buy the newest geforce beta gamestream thingymajig which will probably work. Honestly though : 9/10 (need more cooperative campaigns) This game is a must buy. Especially now when it's discounted. TowerFall Ascension can be described in two words: fun and stressful. It is so fun that it is addictive, but also is quite difficult. I was on the edge of my seat while playing it.. Pros: Versus mode Co-op mode Difficulty Cons: Not a good single player game More variety with versus mode for two people would be nice Custom levels would be nice. This is the most fun I've had in a local multiplayer game, ever! Our previous favourite Bomberman doesn't stand a chance compared to this one. It doesn't matter if you're a hardcore gamer or never touched a controller in your whole life, Towerfall welcomes all with its very simple yet extremely entertaining gameplay.. This may be my favorite game I've played so far. Let me explain. This game has near perfect difficulty spikes and, overall, including the expansion,18 levels on multiple difficulties and bosses, too. It also has a multiplayer mode (even more expansive than the single player) and a trials mode, in which you have to quickly destroy dummies to get a good time. It's a lot more fun than it sounds. Extra MLG people can also try to beat a level on a hard level without dying for a gold skull. They can also learn a surprising lot of special maneuvers to become even better. This game had me playing for multiple days of time so far, and I went for a lot of the extra challenges (I don't even want to leave it yet, either.). Now, there is one major problem I have with this game. It's not the local-only multiplayer (I prefer local only, since this is a game that's meant to be played with other people. Beginners could also breeze through earlier levels by playing online with other people using co-op.) The problem is the co-op. It makes the players much more powerful, and allows them to move through the levels all too easily. It makes my achievements (except for the gold skulls) feel much lesser. My advice? GET THIS GAME AND IT'S EXPANSION.. Good couch game for 2 or up to 4 players, game is fun but graphics are not that great... A bit challenging in some levels but that is nice considering the short length of the game.Worth to take it when on sale if not sure to pay full price for it yet.. Great fun to play with friends, fast-paced and simple but challenging. Don't let the pixelated graphics put you off! If you are intending to play it alone, there is a 'Quest' mode but it is meant more so to be played with friends. Only thing it's missing is network play, hence my score of 9/10.. I guess it could be fun for couch co-op, but there were better games for that 20+ years ago. There's no valid reason to sacrifice gameplay and control fluidity simply because there used to be bad games 20 years ago too. And if you feel the need for pixel graphics, please at least emulate 16bit pixel instead of 8bit. 8bit is just horrible and many brave and nobel programmers sacrificed much to improve your life so that we would never have to go back there.. This is my favorite game on the PS4 so far and has given me more play time than anything else. This game is an absolute bargain for the entertainment you will receive. The games at it's best when playing with a group of friends, I only wish there where more games like it.. I feel i have wasted my money on this game terrible controls and not fun game play. In the end TowerFall ascension is a Over hype game that supports the hateful views and ideas of sexist and racists culture that has infected the gaming culture of late.. One of the worst games I have ever played. Almost felt asleep while playing it. The graphics look like the game was developed in the last century. Including a character which resembles Anita Sarkesesian in their next dlc addon or whatever they are doing is just a pathetic move to get this game into the media. (probably becdause nobody else would care for the game otherwise) 0/10. Like tennis and tandems Towerfall Ascension isn't made to be enjoyed alone. There are single player modes that are distracting enough but these are little more than a ball launcher with which to practise your technique when friends are unavailable. Multiplayer itself is local-only and is great with two players, fantastic with four. It's sociable, the simple controls are inclusive and, for a relatively small outlay, it provides balance to the online-only component offered by most modern multiplayers. Having said that, though not native to the game, the PS4's share play feature now allows you to take on psn friends at a distance. I got the game free with PS Plus and have since bought it on PC to support the developer, Matt Makes Games, in return for hours of enjoyment.. Towerfall Ascension is played on a single screen with the aim being to shoot your opponent(s) with an arrow or jump on their head before they do the same to you. Each player starts a limited amount of arrows but fired arrows, along with a host of power ups, can be picked up and used and this adds a little more variety to proceedings. Games that are designed to be played, competitively or cooperatively, with friends sat in the same room have become increasingly rare breed over the last few years and this proves just what a shame that is. Single player is not all that entertaining but, whether playing against each other or working through the campaign levels with a friend, it is always good multiplayer fun making for a title that I still return to now and again when the opportunity arises.. Towerfall Ascencion is good **** is a deception because there is no online multiplayer. Buy additional controllers is expensive.. Graphics 5/10 Music 6/10 Gameplay 6/10 Multiplayer 1/10 My overall score is 4. Simply, this game is ridiculous fun. At its core, Towerfall Ascension isn't much, but the rivalry that will grow between you and your friends is. If played alone, I can't recommend. The game has a lot of options for custom games and it has a decent number of maps and secrets. As a pure multiplayer experience, I can hardly think of a more intense and exciting game. To anyone who dislikes this game, it is essential that you play with a friend, couch co-op style. I believe it is important to review a movie, or a toy, or a game within its intended context. This game is perfection in terms of playful and skill based competitive game play. I prefer AAA FPS single player games with depth of story and good writing. TowerFall does not have my preferred aesthetic or type of play but it could not be better for what I believe it was intended to do: Couch Co-op Competition and Cooperation.. 3-4 player local multiplayer is a must. Otherwise, avoid. It's pretty fun to play but multiplayer is so fast and fun! Closer to the fun of Smash Bros multiplayer than Playstation Allstars was.. Hands down one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had in years. This nostalgia driven romp through several worlds and dangerous archery is a can't miss for anyone. It's simple game play mechanics hide a deep and strategic game where twitch reflexes meet fast thinking and calculative shooting. I'd recommend this to anyone who can see past the simplistic graphics, which are in themselves beautiful in their own way.. Horrible game. I am not a graphic-effect lover and do not request from every developer to spend tons of money for the visual effects ****. I simply get lots of fun from games like DEFCON, FTL, PAPERS PLEASE, EUROPE UNIVERSALIS. Also in PS4 games like FEZ, TRANSISTOR, ROGUE LEGACY or CHILD OF LIGHT tshows that graphics are not essential for a good gaming experience. As you know, we can not say a game good because it just has fascinating graphics, but also we can not say a game ""indie-cool-back to roots"" because of its pixel graphics. This game do not offer anything fresh like FEZ, any depth in story like CHILD OF LIGHT or revolutionary character selection idea ROGUE LEGACY or anything new or fresh. Just a shallow slashing game with PIXEL graphics that you may only have fun when you play with 4 people in the same house. That is all. Please do not use C64's or Amiga's name even for this ultra shallow-boring slash game. If you really want to play a game from the roots play MOONSTONE or ALIEN BREED. This is a game just tried to be retro with its pixel graphics. It has no similarity with its ancestors. For an indie arcade game this game is great! It's 2d, looks retro and it's flippin fun. If you like Smash Bros, you should check it out. Really. The combat is quick, short, and clever. With a dodging system that adds more on the fly strategy because of the dodge's ability to catch opponents arrows in the air. The only downfall I have to say is that there's no online multiplayer, which is find if you have at least enough friends to play with (and controllers). The game is fun 1v1 but of course, naturally, it gets way funnier and more chaotic with 3-4 people playing free-for-all. There's a quite a few game modes to choose and from and a flurry of game rules to mess with that add to the fun. Highly recommend the game for anyone who has at least one friend that plays with you and there's a extra available controller.. Good fun for about one hour... then it get repetitive. I played coop with my friend and we were like.. ""that's all?"". Always the same gameplay, they just spawn more monsters to keep things harder as you go.. I've been playing games for 32 years now, and Towerfall, though claiming to be a throwback, has none of the charm or fun that I found in any of the classics. The single player of this game is completely horrible, with sluggish gameplay and an odd infuriating pause after EVERYTHING that you do. The arrow shooting doesn't even incorporate 360 degrees, and while I understand that the game is supposed to be a throwback, the fact will always remain that 8 directions in this day and age is inferior,(I'm looking at you, Strider). The multiplayer is fun for a moment, but there is no online multiplayer, which means if your real life friends aren't all gamers, then this game will only be fun for about 10 frustrating minutes. I should also point out that although I did beat the single player campaign, I found it in no way fun or a challenge to my skills. The only skill needed to complete single player is memorization, because everything about it is predictable. I suggest this game only to people who have a load of real life gamer friends and four controllers to use. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.. This game is spectacular. Played it all weekend (~8 hours) with two 10 year olds. Reminds me of the retro Mario games when you're fighting in one static screen. I love this game when playing multiplayer, the quest is quite boring. The only drawback is that I want more maps, more weapons and more characters to select from. Overall, superb game.. all is fun and games until someone gets shot with an arrow. this game features an arcade style game with a multiplayer that will ruin friendships. the multiplayer is amusing and fun for the gang while the campaign provides different areas with challenging opponents that make you want to play again. the music pumps you up for more battle. i feel like their needs to me some sort of online but for a 20$ game it is worth it. pros: -fun to play -good graphics -exciting music -fairly challenging opponents cons: -no online -no upgrade system. Played it because a friend recommended it. It was 10 minutes pure crap. Poor gameplay and most important totally not fun. After 10 minutes i quit because i hated it. It loos like the creators from this game made some random pixel Crap on a screen.... Towerfall isn't a bad game, but it has quite a few flaws. The graphics are great. Some of the best pixel graphics i've ever seen, and the gameplay is solid. However, one of it's biggest flaws is the lack of online multiplayer. Local multiplayer is a nice idea, but i am an adult with a job whos friends are the same. I dont have time to bring people over just to play towerfall. And in the quest portion of the game, in some of the later levels, it feels kind of like the game is cheating. the way an arcade machine always manages to off you to get more quarters, towerfall seems to do the same to get more of your time.. Utterly terrible game. I played for 5 mins and turned off. Multiplayer is not online which is the biggest flaw in this game. Poor graphics and very basic gameplay. I'm not sure why it has high reviews, I can only guess that people are easily amused by games that require no thought, skill or attention span. This game may have worked on the NES back in the days of living room multiplayer but it does not cut it today on the new generation of consoles capable of 1080p and 60fps. I like indie games and I understand that graphics isn't the be all and end all, but Tower fall is a sloppy game which any bedroom programmer could have made within an hour. Avoid at all costs if you want more than mindless dull gameplay.. Easily the local multiplayer game on PS4 right. It's cheap, it's fun, and if you're playing with a group, you're never going to get tired of it. The co-op mode provides a a Mario-like world progression and a challenge that feels like an actual challenge, not a brutal punishment. smart AI and tight spaces make for frantic and enjoyable co-op experiences.. I will keep this one short and sweet. Towerfall Ascension is the most fun you can have with friends and a PS4. It has a multiplayer that is purely chaotic, crazy, tantrum inducing, friendship destroying, and will leave you and your grown up dude friends giggling and squealing like 12 year old girls for hours upon hours.. Best local multiplayer game I've played in a long long time. Up there with Micro Machines, Bomberman, Mashed, etc. Has NES graphics but it proves gameplay is what makes a game worth playing. Similar game to Bubble Bobble & Snow Brothers. Multiplayer is fun as, but 2 player co-op is just as good, if not even better. Best game on PS4 so far, hands down.. Before buying it should be noted that this is a local co-op type of game. Now with that being said i played this on multiple occasions with a group of friends and let me say it was a blast.. Its one of those games that isnt too hard to learn but once u get the hang of it the game becomes really addicting. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun retro Smash Bros. type experience.. For those looking for a simple to play but hard to master game to enjoy locally with friends. Don't expect to play this game a lot, just for occasional fun. And you will have fun I tell you.. Incredible gameplay. If you ever have an opportunity to play local multiplayer, this game will be worth your money. Versus is endless fun with 2+ people, and if you're by yourself, the trials and wave based campaign will keep you entertained for a long time. These modes are the perfect difficulty for you to be able to start off with very little skill, learn the ropes, and even hone your skills until you're able to get all the different awards available, unlock characters, and try for medals and skulls. It is all incredibly rewarding. The art style is great, and never ceased to be eye candy for me. If you're not into 16 bit retro style, then that's okay, you'll be able to get over it because the gameplay is so perfect. If you are able to play local multiplayer, GET THIS GAME. Otherwise, still consider it. I'd still get it just so I could play the campaign and trials.. This is a retro game created for the OUYA, and yet..made its way to the ps4 and PC, it is probably one of the best indie games out there. And for such a good game to be developed by one person is astounding. It really grabs you from your first time playing, you just can't stop yourself from going to the next stage. The 4-player versus mode is awesome, but its a pity there is no online, but yet we still have a lot of fun. It is good for if you're having a small party or get together, could even be reconsidered for tournaments...from the team of GamePlay_RSA we approve of this quality, entertaining game, you really do get your money's worth with this game. We hope to see online in its future updates, as that would complete the game.. Brings multiplayer back to the couch! Fun to play with friends, but there's enough content for you to enjoy the game by yourself. The art and music bring the game to an older era, but the game still feels new. The simple mechanics provide for an infinite amount of interesting, funny and amazing moments of gameplay. The only other platforming-fighting game I can think of besides the Super Smash Bros. series.. The most fun I've had playing a game with my friends in a long time. Controls are tight and responsive, and the game is always fair, even in the insanely difficult hardcore mode. Multiplayer is where it shines the brightest, and it does shine bright.. This game is an easy 10. It's pure joy and has a steep mastering curve. Its like a SNES Smash Bros. and I couldn't be more happy about it. I honestly have been playing just the single player for the past week and its a blast too!. This is about as close to capturing the experience from the LAN/ console parties of my younger years. It is tough for many people to get friends together for the local co-op, but if you can manage that it's well worth it. The matches are short, and anyone can jump right in. There is a lot of room for advanced tactics and gameplay though. All of the sounds, animations, graphics, menus, unlocks, mechanics, and gameplay are excellent. It's a great game if you can organize your friends for a get together. Unfortunately, as I've gotten older this becomes quite hard to do.. This is simply the best local multiplayer of recent years. If you like to have friends around playing with you and if you like to laugh and have fun this game is a must buy. If you don't have any friends and only play solo, the quest mode is still great, so get it anyway =). This is an awesome throwback of a video game. There just aren't many local co-op games anymore, meaning you all share the same screen and actually enjoy the game as a group. Towerfall does this very well, and in a way that is approachable for almost any skill level and can be enjoyed by both the hardcore and casual gamer alike. If you ever have friends over and own a PS4, Towerfall is a must buy. And be sure to spend a little bit of time with it, as it has much deeper gameplay than it originally seems.. I wasn't expecting much when I got this game but this is actually my current favourite game on the PS4. When you first get it, the artwork looks a little stupid, but don't be discouraged since it is definitely worth it. The games versus mode is some of the most fun I've had in ages and It never gets old. The quest is also fun but versus is the true highlight of the game. Even without online play, this game is so much fun when you have friends over. This a definite must-get for the PS4, and the best couch co-op game so far. This is better than a lot of 60$ games I've played. PROS: - Great versus mode, that doesn't get old - Solid quest mode which helps when you don't have friends over - Easy to learn controls, which still have enough complexity that you can always get better - Gameplay is fast-paced exciting, like Super Smash Bros Brawl except with bows - No glitches observed yet, a very clean indie game - Cheap price of 14.99$ which is well worth the cost - Wide variety of maps -Best couch co-op game on either console right now CONS: -No online play, so if you don't have friends over often, or someone who you can play with it many not be worth it - Artwork could be a little less stupid (personal opinion other may like it). Great game. Its very fun to play with three of your friends and is extremely well designed and balanced. Its some of the most fun I have had with a game. The only problem is the lack of online multiplayer. I would prefer to play this game on a couch with friends, but my life is busy and I just dont have time most of the time. This means I rarely have time to play the game which hurts it in the big picture.. The gameplay is great, it is very humorous and its overall a blast to play. Currently its the best PS4 game. However the game does lose some of its appeal when it is taken into consideration the lack of online play.. I think it's funny that Sony released ""TowerFall"" on the same day as ""Titanfall"" and Towerfall gets a better score on Metacritic! Good move Playstation! I absolutely love my PS4 and this is a great game!. Having spent lots of hours in the original Ouya release, this version is an overall improvement: more responsible controllers, better feedback, more particle effects and a unique coop-Quest mode. My only complaint is the lack of support for ps3 controllers (a shame compared to the ability to use them in the Ouya version) but I understand it's not the dev fault. Oh, and for those asking for an online mode, I highly recommend to try this this game as it's meant to be played: with others players around, it is a great part of the core-experience, as the game is very accessible for newcomers (even with non-gamers).. 30 some years ago I started playing video games, in the arcades and on C64. I still play video games on most platforms. PC, consoles, handhelds. The reaction of my kids when they started playing TFA is priceless. Within seconds it was screaming, laughing, joy. It reminded me of how I reacted to the games I played in the arcades so many years ago. We are going to play this for a long time... We played on PS4 with two controllers and a ps vita but I plan on getting this on steam as well to support the game developer, such a good job!!! We just need another controller now. Love it, it's a lot of fun and a challenge for sure. INSTANT PIXEL PERFECT CLASSIC.. Great game. Extremely fun. Reminds me of the good old days of playing super smash bros with my friends on the couch. Unique game play, and creative art design make this game a must buy for all those interested in a great local multiplayer game.. Best game ever! How can you hate on this game. I swear it's probably xbone fanboys that hates on this game. I had very fun playing thi game. IF only we would get more games like this.. Best local coop fun you can have! Slick design, cool visuals and ridiculously fun and smooth gameplay. Shame there's no online, but the single-player is great enough anyway, and plus playing without lag locally requires perfect skill and precision, which makes winning all the more satisfying!. **** brilliant. This game is simple to learn, yet provides for fast paced and frantic versus matches with friends. The Quest mode is alright, as it gives you something to do when nobody's around, but it's easy to see where the emphasis is. In an era where local games are dying off (as is the case with nearly every major PS4 release so far), it's great to see a game like this. For just $15, this game is great for a few hours of fun every time you've got a few frie","towerfall ascension is one of the best competitive couch co-op games on the playstation . the controls are wonderful. the characters, weapons, customizations, etc. everything about this game is well thought out and crafted so well ."
753.Tearaway,"One of the best Vita games available. Think little big planet but with less emphasis on creation and more emphasis on the world the messenger lives in and his/her journey. This is a prime example of using the hardware of the Vita correctly. The graphics look great and the way the game is designed around using the unique features of the vita like the touch screens, microphone and accelerometer all work fantastically. This is a must play if you still own a Vita.. One of the best games I've ever played, regardless of platform. Looks great, handles better and uses all of the Vita's features. The story is really captivating and fresh, accompanied by fantastic music and funny dialog. Voice acting is superb, on level with God of War! If there is one game you have to play on the Vita, it's this one.. Could possibly be the best game to have come out on the Vita, or at the very least makes the best use of its hardware.. To be honest for me it was just a really dull experience. I get it that ps vita have a lot of inputs options... But whole game is built around that unnecessary inputs like blowing into the microphone or rubbing back screen. The gameplay is nowhere near great platformers, like those from nintendo for example. But it's kinda fresh though... Only for an hour.. An excellent 3D platforming game. It has unique art style with a world that is created fully by Origami and paper. It uses all of vita,s mechanics, Every button has a cause of action, it also utilizes the touch screen, the touch-pad, both the front and back camera and last but not least the moving sensors. All of these and yet is easy to follow as 1-2-3.. The game also allows you to customize the environment by giving you papers of different colors, a pencil and a scissor to create you own items within the world OR use the camera to photograph color patterns to add to the world. Every minute spent in that world is worth it. Whether is to do side activities, side quest or just looking around is really worth your time. I would highly recommend this game.. I rarely allow myself that kind of praise but this game defines the PS Vita. Cute story, awesome paper-like graphics, memorable soundtrack, excellent level design and platforming, perfect use of PS Vita's unique hardware features that feels natural and not forced as an optional gimmick. Definitely better than the Tearaway Unfolded which seems cut in a few aspects, compared to the original Tearaway.. This game is wonderfully weird. I played it just a few weeks ago to completion and was extremely impressed by the level design, atmosphere and the usage of all of the features on the Vita. One of my most enjoyable experiences playing on my Vita - I plan to return to this game in the future. There is a little minor puzzle solving and some collectathon features - but all in all this is a game the features pretty basic platforming features. That being said - there is no other game like this out there and something most gamers should try.. PS VITA's best game is creative, fun, and makes great use of the VITA's gimmicks. Just wish it had more varied enemy types and was a bit more challenging.. A truly fantastic game, so colourful, fun and great controls, using all of the vita controls perfectly. The art style is lovely and the music is also brilliant. You can even put your face in the game what's not to love.. Tearaway is a artistic and creative game on the PS Vita. The graphics and animation in Tearaway are magnificent. The touchscreen parts of the game are very cool too. The controls are easy to use also. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is starting on the PS Vita.. It is a beautiful game, very entertaining and fun, its very original too. This game takes full advantage of the vita, because it uses all the features of the PS Vita. One of the best Ps vita games.. From the creators of LittleBigPlanet comes one of the most original games I've played in recent memory. Is this a platformer? Is this an adventure? Is this a fantasy? It's all of the above with outstanding art and sound design in a game that makes actual good use of all of the Vita's innovative features. The only drawback is the game can be completed pretty quickly, but the replay value is high with the need to want to see ever nook and cranny this game has to offer. Highly recommended.. Really Really God Damn Good best Vita Game overrall. Media Molecules you out done yourself, good on you Media Molecules. Clap, Clap, Clap yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This game is what should of been the launch title of the vita in my opinion. The game is a perfect show off title for the vitas capabilities, it uses the front and back touchscreen, the camera, gyro controls and more. The game looks gorgeous and the paper comes to life on the brilliant OLED screen. Gameplay wise I can't fault it, a platform/adventure title it sees you collecting items, killing bad guys and making things by drawing with the vitas touch screen. Everything is made of paper and moves just like it. The poor marketing decisions by Sony has hampered the vita and I firmly believe if this was the title that launched with the vita it would be doing so much better.. It's a delightful little game that tries just as hard to unlock your imagination as it does to capture your heart. Next gen platforming at its finest, utilizing the Vita's touch capabilities without forcing it. This game might not be action packed, but it's sure to put a smile on your face in ways other than some of the mindless violence games that are a dime a dozen these days.. It sincerely believes that imagination really is the most important faculty, and in turn, succeeded in transporting me back to a time when I built strange worlds equipped with nothing but crayons and card.. This game shows what PS Vita is capable of and what Vita game is meant to be. It's absolutely fun and keeps surprising me from the beginning to the end. Shame that I didn't discover this game until it's free for PS+ members. The only thing not so good is that I can't control the camera all the time at my will.. Things are pretty bad in the gaming industry right now. You've got billion dollar companies that want to make more money than what reality can allow, and they want to do it with the least amount of effort as possible. We see the same stuff every year and with the advent of the PS4 and Xbox One, we can see the industry isn't getting any better than last gen with the same bullsh#t just with a slight graphics upgrade. Call of Duty is what it is and so is Assassins Creed. Although, every once in a while, a game will come around to surprise us. One that defies what the executives and their charts say. A game that we like to call, a gem. Tearaway is a gem. And I'm proud to own it on my Vita. I think the most unique thing to me is just customising little aspects within the world, whether it be customising your character, deciding how a scarecrow looks and sounds, or what the crown of the King of Squirrels looks like. Not only that, but the amount of beauty and colour in the papery world around you is phenomenal! The only drawback is the ""combat"". The enemies in this game are called scraps, they're ugly things that terrify the inhabitants of the world of tearaway. It's not much the enemies but the fact that you don't have an attack button, you essentially have to dodge the scraps attacks and let them fall on their arse so you can throw them away or at other scraps. It's not the games strength at all and I sigh every time I have to fight a whole bunch of them. But other than that, the game really is unique and it also has some real life rewards, as the collectables in this game are essentially paper-craft that you can unlock the schematics for so that you can ""bring the papery world of Tearaway to life"". The way Sony is treating the Vita right now, is worse than how Nintendo was treating the Wii U. It's games like this which really made me want a Vita. Unique experiences which fail to be found even on Sony's own PS4 system right now! I recommend you give the Demo a go. It swayed me to finally pick it up as I was wondering if I would really like this game. And I did. So if you've got a Vita, give this light-hearted game a try, I'm sure you won't regret it!. Tearaway is awesome vita game its fun and it's made by the same people who made little big planet. This game has no multiplayer but the story is great it uses the vita's rear touch pad it's front and rear camers and motion sensor and it's only 20 bucks i give this game a 10 out of 10 it is worth the money but if you still don't trust me yet then get the demo.. One of the best platform game I ever play. The game has an excelent use os Vita gimmicks, the gameplay is fluid and responsive. This is a game to have in the game library.. Tearaway is a experience. The art style is unique. The music is wonderful. The story is different what we use to. Gameplay takes advantage of the vita perfectly. I say get it.. Ridiculous game. I'm like 25% into it, and the concept is so awesome. Very original content. Can't seem to put down the game unless my vita's battery goes kaput. I have a pretty good collection of games, and if you're new to the vita, I would suggest you grab a copy, no matter if this is a game that'll be a year old in a couple of months. And if you have a copy, I would suggest keeping the game, as this is a wonderful title for keeps.. This game is incredible! It's also one of the most innovative games that i've played, especially on the Vita, it really makes use of everything that the Vita has to offer, without it feeling to ""gimmicky"" The story is also alright, maybe abit to juvenile, but you really get a connection with the character. I would recommend this to anyone who owns a Vita.. This game is one of the games you should buy a connsole just to play the game. When I first started playing it it felt like a wierd game, but after playing it about 30 min I realised this game was a real treasure. The story is fun, entertaining and to a degree filled with action. And the idea **** looking like paper is also amazing. Not only does it look amazing when everythin is paper, but you can also print out pictures and make 3d models of characters, animals and other stuff! Then I come to the music. The music is a masterpiece in itself. All from the funny start, the exiting middle and the sad end, the music makes the feeling stronger and everythin blends together perfectly. Only bad thing about the game is that it sounded a little bit wierd transelated to my own language, but I cant pull it dow for that. So I whould recommend this game for everybody that want a game that is entertaining and fun.. I don't exactly understand the praise this game has received. The visuals are great, the controls work for the most part (had some trouble with the rear touchpad), but the combat is incredibly repetitive and to me, the story was lackluster.. fantastic game mm have done it again the one problem i have is that the last two levels felt like sony approached mm and said use all the vita controls so there is a lot of motion control front and back touchscreen unnecessarily thrown in other than that its a must have for vita owners. Tearaway is a great game that’s brimming with creativity, style and flair. It just lacks substance and, at times, polish. It’s a great experience that’s a bit too easy and is over far too soon and while sometimes leaving your audience wanting more is a great thing to do, this feels like it left the stage before it was done. You definitely should buy it if you own a Playstation Vita, but wait until you can get it on sale, if you can. ****/2014/03/28/review-tearaway/. This is what I call being really innovative. Everything from its artstyle, gameplay and the narrative is something I've never experienced before in my 16 years of gaming. This game is charming, it controls perfectly and in a way never done before by controlling the world utilising every feature the Vita has to offer, has stunning environments and music fitting to all places you'll get to. The **** feature makes collecting the character models by making photos of them worthwhile and transports the world of Tearaway directly into your house by letting you download models of most of the handmade things in the game. The only downsides to this game are the lack of challenge and the short length of the game, which pale in comparison to the pros. This game is a must-have for every Vita owner!!!. Love this game! The art style is so unique and so very cute. It's great how you can customize your characters etc. The use of all the Vita controls is handled very well and feels very natural. A little short - let's hope for a sequel???. A truly amazing game in every way. The music, the gameplay and the control scheme that takes full advantage of the vita without being gimmicky. The way everything you do effects the world and at the end every bit of influence you had shows in the levels it truly amazing and the story is also brilliant with a very touching and motivating message. Do yourself a favour and get this game.. I'm only a relatively new Vita owner, and I got Tearway with the package I **** I'm so glad I did. Tearaway is utterly awesome. At first it took a while for me to get used to using a Vita, but once you are into it, Tearaway uses it to perfection - and from what I've been told, better than any other Vita game out there. The gameplay is very smooth, with only very short load times, and the graphics and music are fantastic. It's simple enough that everyone should be able to finish it in 10hrs or so, but also challenging enough if you like to chase trophies and want to go for Platinum. But what really makes Tearaway great is the storyline and integration with the player themselves. Despite not saying a single word, you can't help but fall in love with Iota by the end of the game and without giving anything away, the ending is spot on. In summary, if you own a PS Vita, there is no question about it, YOU MUST PLAY TEARAWAY!. The game is quite short (Seriously, even picking up 100% you will take a maximum of 7-8 hours) and everything else is pretty easy, not to mention platform elements. However, the game uses the maximum Vita and has a very sweet and beautiful style. But believe me, it's not a platformer and even bit-em-up.. from the makers of little big plant gives us an adventure platform game with a cut out art style resembling the times of arts an crafts in grade school. the world feels alive as you use the camera, the touch pad and your imagination to save the world from scraps. the only real complaint I have with the game is that it is short witch most critics are going to say but in a way that is its greatest strength like portal. it had a good amount of game time for the adventure they wanted to tell. along with that it is pretty easy with no real difficulty. all an all if you have a ps vita I would get this game.. Tearaway is one of the best games in ****'s original,too original.Music is **** of course is so funny when you play.Every single player in this world should play once this game,even if you don't own a **** this game is a good reason to buy a Vita too.I'm so happy with this game.. Charming is not a word that can often be used to describe a video game but it is certainly more than apt in this case. From the unique visuals (everything is made from paper) to the way it combines traditional gameplay with brilliant use of virtually every feature of the PS Vita it’s simply a joy to play from start to finish, a finish that must surely rank amongst the best in video game history. There is the odd flaw, such as a few platforming sections for which the controls aren't quite precise enough, but if you own Sony’s handheld this is a must buy.. Phenomenal game that truly deserves a perfect 10. Iota is adorable and so fun to play, the visuals and music are top class and the story is very unique and amusing. A must for every Vita owner.. In all honesty... in a year full of amazing games (Bioshock Infinite, Last of Us just to name a few) this gets my game of the year. No other game have I connected so closely with its title character I became emotionally invested in Iota like no other game I've ever played. The way Tearaway allows you to make its universe your own is unparalleled (LittleBigPlanet the obvious exception). The entire game is so beautiful, so charming, so inherently JOYFUL. There's no other experience like it, and you owe it to yourself to play this at some point in your life. With Tearaway, MediaMolecule cements its status as the most creative, imaginative studio out there. This game uses every possible input on the Vita to its full extent, introducing new gameplay elements right up to the penultimate chapter. The only downside I would say is that the game's quite short... and I say that because at the end, I definitely was not ready to let it go. The final chapters are an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end no spoilers, but I definitely teared up at multiple points. They're beautifully realised and perfectly paced for maximum emotional effect. Thank you to MediaMolecule for creating an experience that will stick with me forever. This wasn't just a game... it was MY game.. Tearaway is one of the greatest Vita games out there right now. The game is so unique and the art style is just beautiful. The paper world is cool plus as part as the story you can make items and give them to characters. Plus you can customize your own character through an in game shop. While the stuff in shop isn't to expensive it will add up from all of the amazing things you can buy. Level design is just amazing. Since the levels are made of paper you can change the shape of the paper with just a flick of the finger. The levels truly make use of the Vita's touch screen and its back touch screen. The puzzles are not that hard but they are fun nether the less to solve. At some points in the game you can see your face as part of the game due to the Vita's front camera and you have a camera that you get in game that you actually take pictures with in game and with it occasionally you take a picture in real life with it a character will get the texture of the picture. The character are simple but they truly give you emotion through there successes and losses. The games character are designed very well and the introduction of the characters is great. The only characters that have voice acting are the narrators but for the other characters it is unneeded and can be expressed through facial expressions. I won't go in depth into the story for spoiler reasons. The story is outstanding and will give meaning to everyone you met throughout your adventure. This game is not short at all it will take you awhile to complete and once you do complete it you will want to play it again to get all of the things you missed. This game is just truly amazing and puts other platform games to shame. The characters are great, the story is amazing, and the art style is beautiful. In my opinion this game should be a contender for game of the year. If you have a Vita I highly recommend you get Tearaway and experience the magic of this game.. Tearaway is jewel ****. Coming from the makers of Little Big Planet it’s has the inevitable adorability and charm that made that former so enjoyable. It pits you as Iota or Atoi (depending on gender preference), a small paper person with an envelope for a head, travelling through a paper world with the aim of delivering themselves, the message, to you. The Vita’s features are fully integrated within the game. Touchscreens, cameras and the six axis are all utilised in a way that mostly feels natural, an issue with past Vita titles. The only part I found awkward was destroying the evil scraps through the rear touch pad. But this doesn’t really matter in world that crafted as beautifully as this. It’s not the prettiest game on the PlayStation Vita but its distinct art style and charming soundtrack speak for themselves. The paper craft world is wonderful to explore. Cute little touches are aplenty, such as opening the collectible presents with the touchscreen and seeing your face as the sun (using the front camera). The collectibles aren’t a grind either, they’re fun to collect and collecting the paper craft ‘planes’ with the in game camera unlocks Origami models on ****. I’ve even made my own Iota, just because I can. The issue with Tearaway is that it’s over too quickly. I was able to complete the game in less than five hours and all the collectibles only added an extra hour or so onto the play time. When you have awesome games like Guacamelee on the store for £7.99 it seems hard to justify the price of a full title. Tearaway is beautiful game, the story is cute and charming and adults and children can both enjoy it. It’s short and overpriced for the length of the game, but it is the first game that has used the Vita’s features in a fun way.. Truly an amazing experience and one of the best handheld games ever made. this is an experience that will only ever be possible on a playstation vita and it uses each of the vita's gimmicks in a truly interesting way. the addition of unique and fascinating art style using papercraft, fun platforming and a really unique story. what makes this game so special though is the additon of you. you are not just playing it, you are the main character and fully featured in the world of tearaway. fun things like photos, recordings and your own creations are fully featured in the world of tearaway and pop up in expected and unexpected places. it really makes it a game that is fully tailored to you. This is your story and it is something that i have never quite experience before. this game must be played by everyone who has a vita.. This game despite being ""for all ages"" and by that I mean usually built for kids. It's so addicting I can't put it down. I absolutely love the ""paper craft"" that you can print, gives extra activities I can do with my son.. A true joy to play. Takes full advantage of the PS Vita features such as it's cameras and rear touch pad. Played the first two levels right next to my 10 year old as a sort of bed time story last night for both of us. Beautiful, fun, engaging. What more could you ask for in a game?. A game where AAA production values meets creativity and brave approach of indie devs. A game, where perfect gamedesign meets art and none of it is important, because of You. It is a game about You, made for You and made by You. Awesome stuff.. This game is simply amazing! The creativity is amazing and I love how it uses all the ps vita features. This game is with out a doubt the best handheld game of the year and so far the best game on the vita. This game adventurous creative and beautifully colorful fun. I haven't stop playing this game since I got it. This game keeps on surprising you as you go and is overall a perfect game in my opinion. Fun and can be replayed over and over and never get dull. If you have a ps vita and don't have this game you might as well not have a vita. Get it!. Absolutely brilliant. One of the best platformers of 2013. Flawless. Every vita owners should buy this game. It is truly unique in it's genre. From it's level design to the atmosphere to the graphics, it really is an experience that you can't afford to miss. Especially if you like platforming and puzzle games.. It should have a chapter in every book about creativity and design. Exploring and wandering around the world of Tearaway is pure joy and this time you will be part of the story also.. Unbelievably creative game. This reminded me of why I love gaming for that feeling of awe and joy when being surprised by something new and wonderful. I really can't think **** that wouldn't love this game, and I think it's a great reason to get a Vita if you don't already have one you won't find this experience anywhere else.. This game is just amazing! I'm 23 years old and I still think this game is one of the best handheld games ever created. The world is just beautiful, and literally everything is made out of paper! You can't possibly get bored since Tearaway uses EVERY single feature of the Vita. I strongly recommend you to buy a vita for this game cause trust me, you'll love it.. Ok, the game is really pretty and original and you can check there is a lot of work behind it. Sometimes it's a little bit boring and childish. Sometimes you get stuck if you don't have enough ""money"" and you need to go back... I felt like writing this review simply because I have never in my twenty years of gaming experienced anything like this! This game cost me more excitement an awe then any game I've played. Media molecule have created a game that is truly extraordinarily fantastic on all fronts. I've never really cared for little big planet. Not that I think it's bad just I never really got into it but tearaway I feel totally different. This game is made for creativity more so than little big planet. Even though I only played the demo I know what I'm talking about. The fact that you actually become a part of the game drawn into the world of tearaway is truly breathtaking and unique. I really love this game it's a wonderful experience and well worth the time and money. I truly hope everyone would give this game a chance to see how great it really is. Creativity and imagination has led this game in triumphant. Outstanding job media molecule.. If you own a Vita, you have to own this game! Yes it's that good and it's almost reason enough to buy a Vita, if you don't have a Vita. Tearaway is a brilliant platformer, which really takes advantage of the hardware in Vita. It's not a kids game, but it can be played by kids and adults, just like eg. Mario for the Nintendo platforms. It is without doubt one of the best handheld games I have ever played and hands down the best handheld game of 2013.. Media molecule once again creates a world that is charming and magical, achieved with such simple style. Going along this paper craft adventure made me feel like a child once again. Vita elements were effectively used throughout the game and gave a very interactive experience. The story itself although seemingly simplistic, was rather a heartwarming experience by including the player into the game. Hopefully it will also spark the creative side in you.. tearaway is absolutely incredible. it has an unique style with immersion that is unrivaled by any other portable game. It deserves the 10/10 rating. definitely a must have vita game.. This game is absolutely phenomenal. A simple yet really good (for a platformer) story, with amazing uses of the features on the Vita, more importantly without feeling gimmicky but instead charming, awesome level design. Oh, and the ending (I won't spoil it) is one of the most amazing I have ever experienced. From the creators of the infinitely fun LittleBiGPlanet, bring you one of the greatest games on the Vita, the astounding, short but long enough that it can tell it's story incredibly well, non-gimmicky vibrant papery world that is, Tearaway. Highly addictive, creative and I'm sure your girlfriend will love it! This game made me fall in love with the PsVita once again! Worth every penny. You can't expect nothing short of wonderful from Mm!. This game is incredibly fun and addicting on the PS Vita! The control scheme takes advantage of the Vita's extra functions like the touch pad and camera. Graphics are really good and artistic. You won't regret this purchase! 10/10 for me. The world Media Molecule has created is one of the most original and imaginative of all time. The way paper is creatively used for many things is beautiful. And their cast of quirky characters, along with the neat and heartwarming story are charming beyond belief. The graphics, controls, framerate are all so smooth and perfect. Everything actually looks and feels like paper. The physics are critical in this feel, and they're spot on as well: every piece of paper you walk on moves believably. Just play Tearway asap. This game is really something, its an adventure you never saw before. Made on a full paper engine(i mean it) this game not only looks beautiful but plays realy fantastic, i enjoyed every second of this game, i was taken away with his story i was shocked from the graphic and i was crying when i came to the story ending. This game should be under every christmas tree for players that love an adventure and cute story telling, Only bad think about this game is a short gameplay, the games is long about 6 hours but it give us the best 6 hours of our life. This is 2013 I MUST HAVE TITLE. I love mario, zelda, jax, ratchet, but this game was really something thats is made only once in a decade.. Words cant describe the the charm and beauty of this game. It your looking for something truly unique you MUST play this game. Sony truly knocked this one out of the park. Media molecule is truly a gifted devoper. This game is a piece of art. Among the few truly great exclusive titles on the Vita, Wipeout 2048, Uncharted GA, Killzone Mercenary, Tearaway is something special. Instead of creating a regular 3d world Media Molecule created a living, breathing paper world. Every single detail in this game makes the experience a pleasure. A must own title for anyone who can appreciate a charming game that provides a experience off the beaten pass of fps et. a.. Tearaway is everything a video games should be. It's unique, innovative, charming, and overall brilliant mediamolecule makes the most creative games too bad People don't give them enough credit. Media Molecule has done it again. Tearaway is utter brilliance. The story is cute, the art style is fantastic, and the game also utilizes all of the vitas features in a good way. This game is definitely in the class with all of the little big planet games that Media Molecule created prior to this game. While, in my opinion, Killzone: Mercenary is still the best vita game out there, this is another masterpiece for vita and a must buy for the young, old, and young at heart. This may be the vitas system seller along with Killzone.. This is truly impressive! i never been really on platform games, usually an rpg or fps fan. But this is a game made for the Vita and that only can work on the Vita. Really creative use of the mini-console capabilities: camera, rear and front touch **** action is fun and the graphics are charming and artistic. Probably one of the best game in the year on every platform. A lesson about how to work out PS VITA potential. was never a huge fan of littlebigplanet but this game is ace, highly recommended to any vita owners. it might actually be my favorite game of the year. Tearaway is an excellent showcase of the Playstation Vita's capabilities and an excellent game in its own right, with vibrant visuals, innovative controls, a deep and meaningful story, and substantial replay value. Unfortunately, in its quest to be inclusive to all audiences, it adds a small handful of features that ultimately serve little purpose in the **** are not significant enough to mar the overall experience. The graphical quality seems to have been one of the most criticized aspects of the game leading into its launch, but I can easily say that such accusations are unwarranted. Even though the graphical design seems to be one that was done to compensate for perceived hardware shortcomings, in reality there are plenty of fine details that show the graphics were merely a stylistic choice. Small folds in the environment bend when you walk over them, shadows and lighting are as vibrant as any other game, and you even have the capacity to populate your entire screen with custom, complex particle effects during one section. Controls were something I was initially worried by, mostly because previous games that exploited the Vita gimmicks either used them for no proper reason or completely failed to make the fe","this is one of the best games I've ever played, regardless of platform . looks great, handles better and uses all of the Vita's features . gameplay is nowhere near great platformers like those from nintendo for example ."
754.Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. Though this game is probably not worth playing in 2022, it was a genre defining game that went to be implemented in later metal gear games.. I think this should have gone back to the top down style of 1 &2, because as is this is a very compromised experience. It has a lot of cool ideas, like multiple playable characters and the recruitment system, but they're all done poorly and bog down the game. Environments are tiny, but enemies sight range hasn't been changed so you'll find yourself getting spotted by a dude on the entire other side of the map and theres not a whole lot you can do about it. The story is boring and I'm not a fan of the random inclusion of the 3 codec crew.. Sorry Kojima ,games is boring story compare Metal Gear Solid Peace perfect Walker.. underrated game and very overlooked story in the series, sets up a lot of things for the game after and before it. If you are fan of metal gear , there alot of things that we dont know. for example how and why big boss made OUTER HEAVEN. and how the philosophers become to patriots. as a story its very great story and its very important. some poeple think that portable ops is a simple metal gear like ACID, well thats not true , portable ops has one of the most important story and you will find alot of answers. and you can see how Gray fox has joined big boss army of outer heaven. the boss of this game are important in metal gear story and they are fox hound unit. 1- PYTHON : He joined the fox with jack together and he has been trained with the boss too. 2-NULL : He is Gray Fox , here you can see how fox hound made frank to null and erase his memory and make him a perfect soldier. 3-URSELA - ELISA : They are twin with big sorprise and they can read mind and see the future - and elisa tell big boss that he will made his oun metal gear and his children will save the world. 4-CUNNIGHAM : He is Arms Specialist. 5-GENE : He is the final boss and he is very faster , his power is mind washer. so if you are metal gear fan , you must play it and end it,I dont consider this game a spinoff. Game: Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Genre: Action/Stealth Developer: Kojima Productions Publisher: Konami System: Playstation 3 (PS3) Year of Release: 2006 Length of Playthrough: 12 Hours Total Score: 75/100 Value Score: 7.5/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 6/10 • GamePlay: 7/10 • Graphics: 7/10 • Sound: 8/10 • Music: 7/10 • Length: 7/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 7/10 Pros +Multiple difficulty modes +Recruiting system with the ability to designate characters to certain roles that further change the outcome of gameplay depending on how you set up the roster of characters +Mission based story system with side missions for characters and items +Introduces a team based gameplay style along side the usual stealth mechanics of the MGS series +Cutscenes are in animated well drawn models with voice acting Cons -Levels are short and easy -Not as much voice acting content as past games -Story and cast not as strong as previous entries , game is more of a filler than a actual canon entry -Game is shorter than previous entries -Gameplay can be frustrating due to the fact that the controls of the PSP. If you played MGS 3 & loved it you'll love Portabe ops, i personally liked the origianol MGS & MGS much more but make no mistake Portable ops is on standed with the console serices. my two biggest grips with this game are that one they left the stamina meter without leveing in wildlife. & two it's too short, you'll find yourself playing it all the time & beating it too. More of a strategy game than a classic stealth MGS game. Mechanics are different and it may take time to get used to.. I liked it so much! In some aspects it's even better than the Peace Walker. I mean the story is very touching. The art is very cool and beautiful, and the mother base features are pretty awesome. I never expected from a psp MGS game such a great enjoyment. I recommend this game to every MGS fan!. Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops is a very unnecessary and uninteresting entry into the Metal Gear franchise. The controls are finicky and hard to make comfortable, the story is unnecessary, only there to set the stage for Peacewalker. Don't buy this game, just skip to Peacewalker.. This game is still worth Your time (im writing this in 2015). The only downside comes from the nature of PSP and its the lack of second analog stick.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think that this is game is pretty great, the story and even the whole thing is great... though, the controls could be a little better or so. It's true that most of the new MGS games have kinda difficult-to-learn controls, but when you get used to it, you'll pretty much fully enjoy the game. It personally took me few minutes to learn the basics, such as CQC tricks and other things, I also like the cut-scenes... I like Manga after all... although, they could change few things... it's kinda hard to knock every soldier down and try to bring back soldiers to the truck so that you can recruit them, because don't forget that you have Stamina... and if you're using a soldier, but with low stamina; it will pretty much decrease 'till you pass out. The box/radio thing is neat, but still... some people find this kinda pissing... I do myself, not from those patience type and that's it. Also, even if you're mass-fan of the MGS series, you'll understand that they could of had made it better... that's my opinion.. Portable Ops manages to meld the flavor of Snake Eater and some new features to make an impressive Metal Gear game. Strong story with amazing ost, cast of characters and more... Although Kojima did not direct this game, it still feels as though he did. If you played any MGS game, then you know what to expect. But this time, you can kidnap enemy soldiers and convince them to join you. It's really cool. Gameplay is the same. Enemy soldiers see you? Alert Mode. Then Evasion mode. Then Caution Mode. And then Normal. Just like any MGS game. And, of course, that's a good thing. Believe or not, the story IS canon, that is, it IS part of the timeline. The story is set in 1970, six years after MGS3. The Special Force Unit FOX has rebelled against the USA, and is supposedly sided with the Soviets. Snake has been framed as the mastermind. It's his job to find out who's behind all this and clear his name. And it has its share of twists and heart-wrenching moments like its big-brother consoles. Unfortunately, they have shut down the online-component, but that was just the icing on the cake. As it is, the game can stand on its own. It's $9.99 on the PSN Store now, so if you have a PSP (or better yet, a PS Vita), buy it now.. This game is great! I do find the stamina meter extremely annoying, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying this. The storyline is wonderful. Voice acting is SPLENDID! (David Hayter AND Steven Blum). The gameplay and graphics are sweet! I'd say get this if you can find it in a retail store or on PSN.. The only thing better than the poopy-brown graphics is the horrible, Monster Hunter-esque controls, coupled with tons of dialogue with no voice acting and some kind of autistic army management system. This game has hours and hours worth of exciting gameplay, slowly trudging around the blocky levels, not being able to crouch-walk but still having a third person camera implying that you could. My favorite thing to do is to play as characters who aren't even Snake, such as guys who are in disguise, invalidating stealth. The team-based action really gets me going, too. What happens is, you get a bunch of guys and hide them in boxes all over the level, right? As if that wasn't awesome enough, you can switch between them by hiding whoever you're playing as in a box. That's not even the most exciting part! If you're ever in danger, your box-hiding comrades absolutely will not help you because box-hiding is just a way to make a team-based game with no teamwork and the developers were too lazy to program friendly AI. So cool!!!. Stealth action and CQC adapt well to a portable console, with gameplay mechanics feeling similar but fresher thanks to the inclusion of teams. These teams add a new depth to planning and strategy, with the enticing ability to recruit more and more followers. The story is absorbing and fittingly complex and the graphic novel cutscenes look great . Voice acting is of a high quality as is the soundtrack.. Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Its a solid game, good story, good gameplay, good control, and good graphics and voice acting for a psp game, its generally better than most metal gears, though I sometimes find its story over soppy or far too much, this was good. Its multi-player is pretty well rounded if you get past the hackers, and I cant help but be addicted to getting the best soldiers possible. 8/10 My Opinion /Unbais 7.5. This instalment was very fun especially for players who closely follow the story as players once again take control of Big Boss as he is once again thrown onto the battlefield from retirement against a new enemy and through the story realises that the battlefield is where he belongs and must find his own calling if he is to find something which he can believe in and fight for. The game play is good as well for the system they provide as much of the fun as possible from other metal gear instalment.. Very good, it cleared the fog that the MGS series has ( Mostly MGS3, it really explained and made everything soft too understand the series) it also make proud the PSP, there arent too many great games on the handheld, the cutscene are creative ( comic style). This is an important tittle for the PSP.. A worthy addition to the MGS series. Interesting (and comprehensible) story, good stealth, decent controls. Dragging guys around to recruit gets a little tiresome, but the team-building aspect is fairly cool and fits well with the story & MGS canon. There are some control issues and the camera is far from perfect, but neither are debilitating and the gameplay and story are worth it. The stylized cut scenes may not please everyone, but I got to like them. Missions are a good length for a portable game too.","underrated game and very overlooked story in the series, sets up a lot of things for the game after and before it . as a story its very great story and its very important . the boss of this game are important in metal gear story and they are fox hound unit ."
755.Theatrhythm Final Bar Line,"Straight up one of the most underrated gems **** on the Nintendo Switch. Even if you don’t normally enjoy rhythm games there is still a-lot to like with this title. The first two games were phenomenal and I was nervous that losing the stylus and touch screen would make it less fun, but the button controls were flawlessly. I have sunk about 90$ into the DLC for this game alone which hate but I’m also just happy to have gotten all the extra content cause it truly was worth it. This will be one of those games that I will throw into my switch to play occasionally even many years down the line. Chefs kiss on this one square enix bravo!. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line took the formula established by the other games in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy subseries and not only made them even more fun but made the role-playing elements more apparent and interesting.. If a Final Fantasy rhythm game is what you want, that's what this game is. I've been playing the Theatrhythm games since the first one came out and always greatly enjoyed it. I didn't think they would make another one after Curtain Call, so the announcement of Final Bar Line was a delight. I love rhythm games and the Final Fantasy series has so much fantastic music that I love to see represented in these games.. (MY SCORE : 8.3 /10) A quite exciting Rhythm-Musical game accompanied by nostalgic music from the Final Fantasy Series games!There are Series Quests, Music Stages and Multi Battles in this game!In the Quest Series, I myself only need to ""Clear"" 8 Series (Including Stages and Quests in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Series) out of a total of 29 Final Fantasy Series to finish this game. And after the Credit Scene, the Endless World Stage will appear which is Never-Ending Mode!. If you are a fan of FF music this is a must buy. There are lots of great tracks in there from almost every FF entry.. I've played all the Theatrythm games so far and this one is definitely the best.. Nothing new from the previous titles, but still really fun. Some of the quests take very specific builds and characters to do and are not too fun to pull off, but it doesn't really take anything away from the game as the core gameplay is solid.. The game is very addicting and had made it difficult for me to put the controller down. The wide selection of music ensures that there is something for everyone to enjoy. The DLC tracks are amazing too!. A magical wonderful celebration of the series. the most tracks including more from square RPGs and many great features. Expansions of difficulties and modes, perfect for handheld play and travel. DLC packs can get to be a lot of cost but man the OST and celebration is worth it. I hope they keep expanding this game.. Quantity over quality. That's how I'd sum up this game. I don't hate it, in fact I really, REALLY wanted to like it, but man as a long time fan of this series, FF games, and rhythm games, this game completely watered down the series in a huge way. It feels like it was streamlined for a wider audience, adding just a whole bunch of ""stuff"" while taking away a lot of the elements that made the first 2 games so **** lack of ANY sort of Switch touch screen compatibility, let alone a mode similar to the old swipe screen, is honestly kind of baffling. That said, this review is limited to the Switch version. Before you say ""bUt thE new ModE is So muCH beTTer"", my point is more that the players have the OPTION of playing in different ways. Curtain Call had FOUR different modes to play. And I've already heard people retort by saying that styluses don't work on the Switch, to which I say that this is something that can be slightly modified to a finger tap/swipe instead. It currently just feels like every other rhythm game I've had to play using a controller. And the fact that you can't even use the touch screen in the menus is kind of infuriating. Anyway, next point.Some of the character/song choices. I get it. They're trying to cater to as many people as possible. But some of the choices are just... odd. Why are there SO MANY FFXIV tracks??? The story mode for this game was PAINFULLY long. [start rant] Not to mention 2 Yshtola's? MAYBE if #2 was unlocked AFTER beating it, but both being unlocked from the off. ""Oh but Cloud and Yuna both have 2 versions!"" you say? Yes, but both have the character from 2 different titles. And let's be real, did Yshtola of all characters really need a second version (this comment goes double for the sheer number of FFXIV songs). [end rant]Abilities. The CP system, one of the most interesting parts of the previous games, especially Curtain Call, has been completely cut, along with most of the strategy involved in making a team. IN ADDITION, they cut the total number of abilities from 4 to 3 across the board. Like... just why? I will say, I do love the new summon system and the slight gacha-style qualities associated with it. The old summon system was very arbitrary and just bleh, but the fact that you can choose summons more easily and they can now happen more than once a battle is a nice change.Next, and woo this is a big one, FMS mode is now just slightly different than BMS mode. Chocobos? Gone. Airships? (Kind of there but mostly...) Gone. And then there's the EMS stages, which have almost completely gone by the wayside, a practice that started with Curtain Call. All sense of uniqueness among tracks is completely gone. Not to mention that the BMS tracks, which used to have one line per character, is kind of just a jumbled mess now with no real meaning to even having 4 tracks anymore.I feel like they literally just tried to win over so many people with the sheer amount of tracks and characters, but here's the thing: it worked. All of the reviews I've seen are solely focusing on the nostalgia, and track and character selection That's cool, but man the mechanics have suffered so much and it feels like the devs just got lazy. Like, the formula was already there. You just stripped it away to a watered down mess. All that being said, am I still going to play it? Yes. Am I a hypocrite? Also, probably yes. I'm mostly just hoping that my mind will change and after about 15 hours of playing, it already *SLIGHTLY* has, but only time will tell. If I wanted to just listen to FF tracks, I'd load up Spotify or Youtube and let it run. But I wanted a good Theatrhythm game. The original, while it had its flaws, came out of nowhere and provided such a great experience. Curtain Call, while it did away with the original story mode which I personally really enjoyed, added so many good mechanics and touch-ups to the original. Final Bar Line just... stripped all the work away. I'm praying they put out some patches, though I'm not hopeful. Maybe I'll change my mind, but for now, I really can't give it higher than a 5.. Some of these reviews on Metacritic are idiotic and those reviewers should be banned frankly. Seriously @Freya_Crescent , "" game is good but my favorite character is not in there so it's a 3"" ??? Had to give this game a 10 just to balance out this nonsense. I'm a fan of rhythm games so I might be biased, but objectively I think this game is easy enough if played at the ""Easy"" level for FF fans who aren't rhythm gamers to enjoy. It's at least an 8 imo but bumping it to 10 just cause of the stupid reviews that are on here.. The game is fine, as far as rhythm games go, but they've severely over-filled the starting games (which I'd suspect are those you can access in the demos), and ignored the rest. FFVII has 7 characters. FFX has 3. So for the first game, which you can unlock right away, there are nearly 2 full teams. For the second, you don't even have one team. Your options are play FFX levels without a full team or break your immersion having a random character from another game along for the ride. The tutorials also need a lot of work. They're fine for the basic levels, but there are none I could find for the higher difficulties, which have new combinations of actions which are required. That would be somewhat less of a problem if the requirements for completing some levels wasn't to do so on the higher difficulty levels. EDIT: I have discovered that not only to the DLCs only contain songs and no characters or scenes (semi-expected), but that the ""news"" option on the main page of the ""Premium Digital Deluxe Edition"" is just ads for more PAID DLC!. An amazing celebration of the Final Fantasy franchise, filled with a lot of heart and charm. Very accessible to newcomers to rhythm games and great for hardcore players. Tons of songs that will last you a long time and more if you with to become better and tackle the more challenging difficulties. Leading up to Final Fantasy XVI there was no better way to get pumped than playing Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. Since the last entry on 3DS the franchise has released lots of tracks from new titles like 14 (which had 32 tracks just to itself), 15, Type-0, 7 Remake, PC/mobile games and even showing love to older obscure entries and side games. This was an absolute joy to play because of that because I could relive some of my favorite moments through playing their tracks, but also hear music I never heard before from titles I never played. Doing this was also a good reminder that even if some entries in the franchise aren’t my favorite, the music is always fantastic and a joy to re-experience. Theatryhthm serves as a perfect tome of Final Fantasy, showing that music is just as great a factor as story in solidifying this franchise as one of the most iconic of all time.. Wonderful game. I have spent hours and hours playing my favourite songs and discovering new ones. There are some quests, rpg mechanics and things like that, but I don't need them (they are nice, btw). The main problem is that some main songs are missing and we need to buy the DLC to get them (like To Zanarkand).. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is an absolute delight for fans of both great music and Final Fantasy. The game combines all of the classic Final Fantasy tunes with an exciting rhythm game, giving an entirely new twist to the series. The game itself is incredibly easy to pick up and play, with the basic mechanics being easy to learn, yet still providing a challenge in the higher levels. The soundtrack is composed of a wide variety of genres, featuring both classic and modern tracks from the Final Fantasy series. The game also features a variety of characters to play as, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. Overall, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is an enjoyable and unique game that is sure to please fans of both great music and Final Fantasy. The game offers a great combination of rhythm and exploration, and the soundtrack is sure to please fans of the series. It is a must-buy for anyone who loves both music and Final Fantasy.. If you like music and want to experience your favorite games from the well-known ""Final Fantasy"" franchise, you can't go wrong with ""Theatrhythm Final Bar Line"". At first, it takes a bit until we understood how it works. But then we had a lot of fun. The game concept is well thought out and the many possibilities of unlocking, is really successful. Fans and newcomers will experience many great moments, and undecided players can also try the free demo version.. My first Theatrhythm game. As a fan of Final Fantasy games, this games is so satisfaying to play I can't put down the controller. Incredible polished and addictive, with some amazing rearrangements and multiplayer option. This game is a treasure.. Excellent game with a few hiccups, Final Bar Line is a fantastic celebration of music, rhythm gaming, and Final Fantasy rpg mechanics. I will surely be playing this one for many, many hours. Runs great on Switch. There are some things that could be fixed however. The audio delay settings may not work for some TVs. This can easily be patched. There is currently a game breaking bug involving deleting summon stones that corrupts your data. I believe SE is aware of the issue. I also don't think there are enough team slots (5 is not enough). Overall though, I highly recommend this game to music fans.. Nostalgia bliss in its purest form. Simply the best rhythm game square enix has ever put out yet.. Bangers after bangers, and a fun game to play with a friend or significant other.. Not only excels as a rhythm game, but also as a tribute to the long history of final fantasy. 500+ songs with DLC is amazing too. A must buy for rhythm and final fantasy fans alike.. While the game is nice, it lacks Freya Crescent and a few other favorite characters I like in the series. This overall dampens my experience.","if a Final Fantasy rhythm game is what you want, that's what this game is . there are series Quests, Music Stages and Multi Battles in this game ."
756.Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure,"A fun point and click puzzler with a cartoonish exterior that belies the games stern challenge, this is one of the Nintendo Wii’s hidden gems.. It's really a shame how under the radar this game is. From it's cartoony Saturday morning theme story, to it's clever puzzles, and it's stylish look, Zack and Wiki is easily one of the best puzzle games on the wii.Zack and Wiki goes for a more point and click style of adventure game, opting the wii mote as it's closest counterpart, remotes. While the game does have a child like nature and wonder, the puzzles themselves are far more challenging than they appear, often asking a lot of forethought about the actions you take before and after. While a hint system certainly is there, their are just some clues that are a little more obtuse or confusing in terms of how to interact, but these moments are usually few and far between. On top of this, each puzzle has a certain amount of points to collect, often given the full amount when you are able to do puzzles fast enough and not make too many mistakes. This in turn helps provide for some fairly interesting replay value as the game also has secret treasures to find on each map and collect, making you think extra hard on top of the usual puzzles.While you won't find a lot of action in Zack and Wiki, the humor, art style , and puzzles are more than enough to burn this charm game into your heart.. This game simply doesn't respect the players time, having to restart entire levels doesn't make the puzzles more challenging it just makes them more monotonous. The controls are slow, picking up ""new"" items or interacting with ""new"" objects after you die takes too much time introducing the item again and again. Walking around is tedious with trying to click everywhere and slow movement. Fast reaction speed is randomly required and interactions aren't well telegraphed making for cheap deaths. I just got to the lava world and I quit after 5hours+ of pain. If the game had checkpoints/infinite revives I could look past most of it. I have no clue who thought this was a good gameplay mechanic to force the player to repeat the same steps over and over again that provide zero challenge after you solve them for the first time. It's like the developer got puzzle games and action games confused. There's definitely a good game here if it were ever to be remastered with some additional gameplay polish.. Zack and Wiki: Quest for Barbaros's Treasure is a charming and inventive puzzle game, although it does have some slightly annoying controls. While the game's concept and puzzles are engaging, the motion controls can be imprecise at times, leading to frustration during critical moments. The game heavily relies on motion gestures for interactions, which can occasionally feel unresponsive or require overly specific movements. Despite this minor drawback, the clever puzzle design and intriguing gameplay mechanics shine through, making Zack and Wiki a worthwhile experience for puzzle enthusiasts. One of the game's strongest aspects is its amazing and challenging puzzle design. Each level presents players with intricate and clever puzzles that require logical thinking, observation, and experimentation to solve. The game encourages players to think outside the box and discover innovative solutions, rewarding creativity and critical thinking. The puzzles become progressively more complex and require players to utilize various items and abilities, adding depth and excitement to the gameplay. Zack and Wiki successfully strikes a balance between providing satisfying ""Aha!"" moments and maintaining a steady challenge, making each puzzle completion feel immensely rewarding. Zack and Wiki's art style has its highs and lows. On the positive side, the game's vibrant and colorful visuals create a whimsical and delightful world to explore. The character designs are charming and memorable, while the environments are beautifully detailed and evoke a sense of adventure. However, some players may find the graphical quality and character animations to be a bit lacking compared to contemporary titles. Additionally, the game's fixed camera perspective can occasionally hinder visibility and make precise movements more difficult. Despite these drawbacks, the overall art style of Zack and Wiki contributes to its unique charm and reinforces the game's lighthearted and adventurous tone.. Zack & Wiki didn't sell very well and it's fairly unlikely that there'll ever be a sequel and that's a shame because it's a great game. First the game looks great for a 2007 Wii game with a very nice cartoon art style and animations, sure it's helped by the genre with small levels but it still took some nice developing skills at the time, specially given the fact that the game runs smoothly. But the most important thing is the gameplay and here it's really sweet with well thought puzzles, but always logical (you don't need to click on everything to find out the solution by luck), there's also a very good, natural and varied use of the motion controls. Point and click never seemed so active. Finally the story is very predictable, with very few dialogs and it's probably the worst part of the game, it will take something around 15 hours to finish game, far from the lying cover that guarantees 40 hours (a shame, specially that 15 hours is very honest for the genre). So in conclusion Zack and Wiki is a very good game if you want to put your brain to the test, the only better option I see is the Portal games (for the incredibly funny dialogs) and they're not available on Wii, so if you want a puzzle game and own this console go for it, just don't believe the cover, it's a big lie.. Don't be fooled by the infantile presentation. When you start this game, you'll feel like you've made a mistake by buying a game for babies. But the puzzles get really difficult really fast, and this game has some of the most clever puzzles I've seen. There's a level where you have to examine a lock and make a key of that shape... out of ice! If you stick with this game you'll find the characters to be likable and the overall experience very satisfying.. If you have a Wii or Wii U, this is a must have! This is the Wii-remote fully utilized. One of my absolute favorites! Pros: + Very Clever Puzzles + Wii-remote FULLY utilized + fun and memorable characters + superb level designs + tons of collectables + humorous + fully replayable Con: - not for the easily puzzled :P. The worst game I've ever played. I play video games to have fun and this ""game"" was the complete opposite of fun. I never once enjoyed playing it. It looks like a charming kids game with an anime style reminiscent of One Piece, but in actuality this game is aimed at older, more hardcore gamers. Each level is a giant puzzle, and it all looks very engaging at first. But when you dig into the game all it does is make you angry that it was even made. Let's start with the controls, they're awful. First off you move around by pointing and clicking where you want to go and the objects you want to interact with on the screen. It's not an enjoyable method and all I could do was wish they would have let me use the nunchuck. In order to complete puzzles you have to deal with the games awful use of the Wii's motion controls. To keep it simple the motion controls are awkward and can be erratic in responsiveness. Now for the actual ""gameplay"". Completing levels is simple and mostly boring at first but quickly ramp up in difficulty and can be controller smashingly frustrating. This is mostly do to the horrible design choices that make the game feel like on big trial and error scenario. Puzzle games always require you to experiment with many wrong ideas before you can determine how a puzzle can be completed, but the problem with this is that the game punishes you for this. Mess up and you will quickly die and get sent back to the beginning of the level, or worse not die and just render the level un-winnable. This is especially frustrating if you've almost made your way through a level as a simple mistake will cause you to lose all your progress. There are ways to prevent having to restart a level in the form of tickets that can revive you shortly before you die, but even these are rendered useless in the later levels. For instance you've almost made your way through a level but didn't do one little thing at the beginning of the level and got yourself killed, the ticket is made useless and you'll have to restart the level anyway. In the later levels which are bigger, longer, and more complex, an simple mistake can mean redoing up to 30 minutes of progress. It's angering, heck the whole game seems like it's just a way to piss of gamers. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game. I take my reviews very seriously and the fact that I'm giving this a zero means you probably want to take my advice and make sure this game NEVER finds it's way anywhere near you or the people you care about. Unless of course you just like getting angry and playing garbage video games.. This game is so much fun, and it's an utter travesty that it does not have as much recognition as games like Super Mario Galaxy or Metroid Prime 3, as it stands right with them as some of the best games on the Wii. Full of absolutely amazing puzzles (seriously; some of the best in gaming), a very nice art style, great music and by far the best use of the Wii remote, Zack and Wiki is an adventure classic.. Zack and Wiki is one of the few ""point-and-click- adventure games a la the early 1990s that has been released on a console. It would be a superb game if not for multiple annoyances that drastically detract from the overall experience. The graphics, sounds, and most importantly the puzzles are excellent. The puzzles hit the sweet spot of not being too easy or too esoteric, and most veteran adventure game players should get by without needing any hints whatsoever. However Zack and Wiki suffers from 3 huge problems that bring down the score: 1. Story - A non-existent story is not a problem in a game that does note contain emotive characters, but Zack and Wiki is full of colorful characters, lengthy cut scenes, villains, danger and intrigue. Yet nothing is done to advance the characters beyond blasse anime tropes. Either flesh out the characters, or just place the puzzles in disconnected rooms with a faceless protagonist and cut out the rest of the garbage. 2. Death, saving, and dead ends - Dying in adventure games pretty well expired with the Space Quest series, and it hasn't been missed. But even in those games, while death was annoying the ability to save at any point meant it was only a setback of a few minutes of time. Dead ends, a situation where the game becomes impossible because a critical item was destroyed, has also been eliminated from modern adventure games and for good reason. Zack and Wiki tragically suffers from 2 problems: Puzzles that contain dead-ends (fortunately not many) and puzzles where death can occur suddenly, without warning, and without the ability to save. You can buy 'platinum tickets' which will revive you moments before death, but these cost money, and worse, the price of each successive ticket increases exponentially. I was very frugal with my tickets and I still ended up using a lot of them toward the later levels. Having to repeat 20-30 steps to get to the point where I died is inexcusable in a modern video game. 3. Wii-mote usage. This is strangely one of the most praised features of the game yet is a big drawback. Items are used by waggling the Wiimote in the same manner as the item in question. The only problem is in many instances you simply cannot get the item to behave how you want it to. This is infuriating in time sensitive puzzles especially when they case death (see point #1). Since the actual usage of the item is generally straight forward, making us use the motion controls adds nothing to the game except frustration. The above 3 points should not take away from the actual level design, which is fantastic. It is tragic that such well crafted levels had to be shackled inside such awful restraints.. The puzzles are truly fun and make the game worthy of much of its praise but I think most reviewers are ignoring all the incredibly annoying garbage between puzzles. This game also has the longest and most useless intro to any game I've played on the Wii. I also think the puzzles go from too easy to too hard a little too quickly.","a fun point and click puzzler with a cartoonish exterior that belies the games stern challenge . the controls are slow, picking up ""new"" items or interacting with ""new"" objects after you die takes too much time introducing them again and again . the game simply doesn't respect the players time, having to restart entire levels doesn't make the puzzles more challenging ."
757.MLB 13: The Show,"More than 10 years later and this is still an exceptional baseball game with silky smooth gameplay that not only plays great today, but still looks great. The graphics in this game and it's presentation is fantastic for a PS3 game and despite a few limitations in the franchise mode, this is as close to perfect a baseball game can get and still holds up remarkably well today.. Even though this and Thomas Was Alone wasn’t the best idea to buy, the fact that I paid for it and it’s surprisingly good is a MASSIVE understatement. Presentation is probably the best that it has ever been in that point. Gameplay is also fun too, and overall, fun as expected.. As a series MLB: The Show has been the most consistent of all the yearly sports representations this generation. Consumers have come to rely on exceptional baseball authenticity, realistic gameplay, fantastic graphics, and deep franchise and career modes to invest time with. What has been missing though is sense of accessibility and an acceptable online experience. Visually, MLB feels like as if I'm there in the game just by looking at it! The graphics are crisp and neat. I love the detail they put in the stadiums as all of them feel unique!. For all these review that praise this game....what are they smoking??? Sure, this game has excellent graphics and the attention to detail is outstanding, but the actual gameplay...horrible! This game has more bugs and glitches that make the game almost worthless playing, unless you like to stress yourself out by dealing with it. An example, would be the ""catcher freeze"" glitch. This is where you've struck the opponent's batter out with a pitch in the dirt, and all of a sudden, the catcher 'freezes,' you cannot move him, or do anything. In the meantime, the opponent's batter that just struck out runs to first base, and if the opponent decides to take full advantage, he will seamlessly run around the bases to score and there is nothing you can do about it. This must **** if you've pitched a perfect game with a 1-run lead going into the 9th inning for something like this happen to you. There are other things, such as your pitcher throwing the ball into the stands out of play when trying to pick the runner at 1st base off. I mean, often does that happen? Once in 'blue moon?' Not in this game. It happens so much, that you become reluctant to trying to pick the guy off at 1st in fear that you're gonna give him 2nd base for free by throwing it out of play. I can't tell you how many games have been lost due to pass balls. Its beyond ridiculous. I mean just because the pitcher throws a pitch in the dirt, doesn't mean that it has to go all the way to the back-stop. I mean give me a break. These guys are professionals and practice countless hours on blocking pitches in the dirt in front of them. Again, how often do pass balls occur in real life? Not here, you'll be lucky if the catcher keeps the pitch in the dirt in front of him, otherwise, if there's a runner on 3rd base, you may as well just guarantee the other team an added run to their score. There's also the network connection bug that should get an honorable mention. That's where out of nowhere, the game will end due to ""network connection lost with opponent,"" but really, its a game server problem, because you will see that the opposing team will be awarded rating points even if you were winning 5-0 in the 6th inning. And the winning team is suppose to be the only one being rewarded with rating points, not the losing team as well. The list goes on and on. Anybody who has played this game long enough, I'm confident can relate to these issues that I've mentioned. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these guys have had to replace their own controllers because they've thrown them across the room out of frustration, not because they're losing, but losing because of these flaws that they have no control over. What surprises me the most, is that they have actual forums and a place where you can report these bugs; however, months, and months have gone by, and still the problem exists. If these bugs and glitches didn't exist, this game would easily be a 10+ score, but since that's not the case, I give it a score of **** that's being generous.. The Show proving once again why they are the best sports franchise out there. Graphics are top notch, as usual, and gameplay is as good as it gets. Hoping they add some more game modes, but all in all, a perfect baseball game.. I love this game. I play as the Red Sox usually facing arch rival Yankees. The graphics are top notch and the new features are great. I am in the middle of the playoffs tring to win my first world series.. This will be as much a review of the MLB Series as much as a review about MLB The Show 13. This years addition is again stellar, as fans of this series have come to expect. I myself love sports games and sports, though I will admit that baseball is low on my list of sports I follow. I like hockey, football, rugby and THEN baseball. So this is coming from someone who is slightly jaded when it comes to baseball as I lost interest after the first decade after Bonds left Pittsburgh and the Pirates stunk. I know we are doing well this year, but it takes more to wash away 20 years of anguish. In any case, I still respect the game, it's history and it's nuances. This is where San Diego Studios mastery of the MLB series really lies. No detail, no stat, no game mode feels unbalanced. Every player, uniform, stadium, score board....every little detail is painstakingly recreated in this game. I recently went to a game with my girlfriend to PNC Park and even she said, I feel like I'm in your video game. This is by far the best looking sports video game, There is absolutely no competition. EA wishes they has a game that looks this beautiful. There is no excuse. This game visually is stunning, even at the end of this current console run. As for gameplay....again, this game will please you. Not only are the animations spot on, the control is excellent and then on top of that, they offer you multiple modes to bat, pitch & throw. There are also customizable gameplay sliders that let you tailor the game to your liking. As for me, getting up to 37 years old now my brain doesn't fire off like a 12 year old's anymore. So I can tailor pitch speed & contact to have a fair balance as well as making myself good enough to have fun in Road To The Show. This game also sports some fantastic ball physics. Rotations, bounces and delections.....dying quails that drop in, slicing gap shots & frozen ropes are all present. I suggest playing RTTS and using a Classic Cather Cam Zoomed all the way in. You get a First Person feel to batting and really see the breaks and velocity of the pitches. Just leave a sliver of the top of home plate so you can judge your strikes. All in all every mode is fun, whether you like Franchise, Season or RTTS this game brings all the elements together that really make sports games great....attention to detail, gameplay, presentation, stats & above all atmosphere. You feel like you are in the ballpark. All that's missing is the smell of dogs and burgers & the drunk guy getting escorted out of your section. In my opinion, The MLB The Show series in addition to MLB 13 The Show is the pinnacle of sports gaming this console generation. The only missing element being Online Team Play. Besides this one aspect, EA Sports can only look at this game with admiration & wish they produced such a fantastic sports package every year. If you are a fan of baseball or a fan of sports in general & you do not own this **** get it now!! It's the best sports game currently produced by anybody, anywhere. Not Madden, NHL, FIFA, NBA 2K....Nobody can touch the MLB The Show Series. Thanks to SONY and San Diego Studios for such a fine closing offering to this generation, I look forward with anticipation to what they throw down in the next gen.. Hands down, this is the best baseball game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of them. The difficulty has been scaled back just a little, which is exactly what it needed. RTTS is as good as ever while the graphics are better than ever. A must-own for baseball fans.. Here's the thing. Baseball is baseball. The PS3 is the PS3 (read ""old) so we are not oging to get massive innovation. Baseball hasn;t suddenly changed teh rules and the PS3 hasn't suddenly tripled in power and capacity. Let's face it harly anyone uses ""move"" and when they do it barely works. So what of MLB13? Well we are told it's the last ""Show"" for the PS3 as from '14 onwards the main focus will be on the PS4. In itself it is THE best baseball game (alongside OOTP as a management baseball game) on the market. But what it is not is a huge change over 2012. If you bought a game from this franchise every 2...better still 3 years. Then this game will be a breath of fresh air. The graphics are tighter, pulse pitching is good, more stances, more pitching...great. If you have MLB12 then 13 is not an essential purchase. If you have '11 then it's viable but not required. If the last MLB game you bought was '10 or earlier then this is pretty essential. But with '14 on the PS4 looming there will be an essential purchase for us all next year and I can't wait!. MLB The Show has got to be the class of the sports video gaming world. This is the first time that I've jumped onto the Show ship since MLB 2008. The graphics are impressive, and the presentation is very well done; the developers have done a great job with the camera angles and the cut scenes to make the game resemble a TV broadcast. Road to the Show is very easy to get into, and you can play through entire seasons without simulating within a few days if you play a lot. However, the online play is fairly disastrous, to say the least. It could be due to my connection (which I've rarely had problems with on other games), but I found online games to be very laggy, which makes gameplay impossible, since baseball is a timing-based game. Offline modes are very addictive, and the game is worth picking up for them alone.. Yea so if you haven't heard, this game hasn't changed all that much from last year. Same silly bugs we get ever year. Same goofy problems. Biggest aspect of change you'll want to know, the guess pitch feature. They changed it so that you either guess correctly on pitch & location & lock on, or get one wrong & get no feedback whatsoever. The rankings, as you also probably heard, are atrocious. I can site examples all day but here's the bottom line: if you don't play online, stick with the 12 or older version of this. If you're the kind of person who has to have the new thing when it cones out, don't say you weren't warned.. As an huge MLB fan, I've played The Show series for the past five years. This is one of the only sports series, along side NHL and NBA 2k, that consistently improves almost every year. A great simulation, that adds a level of difficulty that comes along with the actual sport. If you are a baseball fan, and have a PlayStation 3, this is worth the $60.. you will not find a better baseball game. its almost flawless with only like a couple problems but should be fixed with patches. this game has amazing graphics and mlb 14 the show will have a hard time beating this one everthing has improved. Amazing game great features the new playoff feature is great the show games have always been great.. MLB 13: The Show adds better graphics and gameplay, but no new and unique game modes. The show still looks great and runs smooth. There were a couple of moments where there was some rough or low resolution textures. The player's face look like faces, and the iconic ballparks look like their real life counterparts. The gameplay is still fast and smooth with some minor additions thrown in. The batting is still difficult to new comers, but put some practice into and you will get better. Pitching has added the pulse option, which does not make pitching any better or worse. The new mode in 13 is the postseason which does not feel any different than an exhibition game of baseball. Returning modes do not make enough changes to make them playing through again a must. MLB 13: The Show is still the best game of baseball of there, but is plagued by the problems all yearly sports games suffer from.. The key factor for this game was the vastly improved commentary. It's much more faster paced and put together than the previous game's long periods of time without a word of commentary. It now competes with 2k in that category, as that was THE only category 2k was better in. Loving the new camera angles that get excellent views of inside the stadium that were missed in all the previous games. Sound is fantastic as always. I can't find issues with the game after a month of playing. The new features just make it worth the purchase.. Simply amazing. Again, YoY this game gets it right. With some subtle upgrades in the Franchise mode, this game is great. If you're a baseball nut, or even just a hobbyist do yourself a favor and pick up The Show 13. The online leagues are fun, and the new matchmaking system for online ranked play add to the depth of the game. -1 point for some overall connection issues during online play, but the gameplay and presentation provide enough enjoyment to overlook and keep playing. Bravo.. Great game with awesome graphics and a ton of control over how you want to play. Almost everything can be customized by using the sliders. Most of the changes in this years edition are subtle and won't be noticed by casual players but anyone who has played past games will surely notice. The graphics are top notch (almost life-like), the sound is as realistic as you can get without actually going to a ballgame, even the commentary is annoying--just like real baseball!! now go out and buy this game or you'll be missing out on the best sports game ever made.. I'm not going to preface my review with silly things like ""REAL REVIEW"" like fish6132456. I could tell you I've been playing sports games all my life, but that just makes me another gamer who likes sports games. What I can tell you is MLB 13: The Show continues the tradition of being the best baseball game on the market. The changes are noticeable, even to those of us that have been playing the series since it's initial incarnation, but do not take away from the overall feel of the game. Point is this, if you want the best baseball game, this is the one for you. If you haven't played any of The Show before, you're in for an absolute treat. My only suggestion would be to eventually graduate to All-Star difficulty, as the AI pitchers throw way too many strikes in the lower modes. Enjoy!. Very similar to MLB 12, great game but little can and innovate in the current generation, but still experienced the franchise as many options on the team, stadium, travel, team organization not only in the sport also in non sport, great game. By far the best sports sim available. This game quite literally defines what a MLB game should be; other sports sims take notice. They've revamped batting completely. You can even allow the game to teach you to be a better batter and you can increase the difficulty as you start to see yourself improving to different levels (it also has it's own levels within that difficulty it can scale to fit your ability). When you hit the ball the physics are a million times better. It's no longer like bouncing a ping-pong ball on a table. When it hits, it'll skid, turn, stop short. There is no longer a consistent amount of ground-rule doubles when you knock a ball into the outfield (it doesn't just automatically bounce out). It's loads more realistic in the physics. Postseason mode is amazing. From the music, to the crowd interaction, to the interaction from the other players (the ""1st person-mode"" is really cool you don't see the game in 1st person, but the noise in the game comes from around your player: either from your teammates to even a snarky fan giving you grief or even one cheering you on). It's amazing. I don't really need to comment on how perfect pitching is in this game. What this boils down to: MLB 13 The Show should be your one and ONLY choice for a baseball game. 2K cannot compete. Sorry Xbox (only) owners, you do get a decent game but nothing like this.. I'm not sure why people have such a problem with this game. The Show is, year after year, the best baseball game I've ever played. I feel like they've nailed down how to make a great game, and there won't be massive improvements or changes from here on out because there isn't much to improve upon, until they completely redesign and redevelop the game. I like the small improvements and changes this year that I've noticed so far, like FINALLY using a numbering system for player ratings. It was always just the red bar or letter grades. I'm not a big online gamer because most people who play online quit when they start losing, and it's not fun. Or they play like morons, which is also not fun. But as a game to play on your own or with other people in who are sitting right next to you, it's great. They can't change the game completely every single year, because it's costs a ton of money to do that, and they'd never get it done on time. The game isn't broken like Madden has become, or like 2K baseball has pretty much always been, so there's no need for a complete overhaul. The graphics and animations are as smooth as ever, and the interface is only slightly altered, so there's a very, very small learning curve. So stop complaining about the little things, like how this minor league isn't in the game, or that guy's tattoo isn't in the game, and appreciate the fact that you have a choice of baseball games every single year, and you're not stuck with the garbage that is 2K.. Sorry for the late review. Been having too much fun with RttS mode. It isn't that this is basically a spruced up version of last year's title, there's a real cohesion to the mechanics this time around. Getting you into the game is swift and has flourish. The ambient audio is incredible. And the hitting is tight. If you've passed on this title for the past few years, know that this one is solid and, more importantly, fun as hell. Gotta go. I'm up.. I don't really write reviews on metacritic, but I just wanted to come in here and speak for those who are skeptical. Those other guys dont know what they are talking about. This years show is the most refined show I have played. Mind you, I have started with The show 10 for PS2 and PS3 and havent found a Show better than that one it terms of all around quality and for the period in time. This one beats out the Show. They did everything the community wanted, especially for online. I have no idea why or what those other guys are complaining about. This is THE BEST show to date. I live in Toronto, Canada where baseball is not popular, but I am still finding ranked games with no problem and virtually no lag. They really did a good job with the netcode for this game this time around. I also like the fact that I can make my ranked games suited to how I like to play now (which makes this an auto 10 for me) I like to play guess pitch 1/4 with all realistic settings on (ejects, injuries, variable ump) and the hot zone to preview (which only shows the hot zone first for the first pitch of every batter) Its the best. Another cool thing (mplayer is my main focus since I dont have many people that like the show) is that the matchmaking is based on who you pick for starting pitcher as well. you dont see who the other team picks until the game starts. the system matches your pitchers as well as teams! Anyway, pick this up, you wont be disappointed. Those other guys are butthurt cause they cant glitch now or something most likely. Having allowed MLB 11 the Show hold me over until this year, I've found that this year's installment is a must buy for all baseball fans who haven't had the pleasure of playing last year's game. It's the best baseball game money can buy and Road to the Show alone is worth the purchase. I'll gladly shell over $60 to not have to listen to EK ramble on during my RttS play-through.. Sliders people. It's all about finding the perfect options. If I didn't figure that out I might have gave it a zero. Sliders people. I love you all. Just find your sweet spot.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm writing this to warn people who like RTTS that there are now dizzying spins of the camera when you are on the field/coming to bat. So much so, it is making some ppl sick. The devs know this and just don't care. Last time I'm ever getting ripped off by sony on this POS!. hey fish,a 3? are you serious.this is not call of duty it's mlb how many changes do you **** players to float? it's the best mlb sim period.changes?nobody listen to fish mlb 13 is great. REAL REVIEW from someone who has played every single game since The Show came out in 2006. Same as every other year. There are little improvements here and there, but nothing major. They added ONE new main feature (The Show Live) which isn't fun or interesting at all. This game is becoming like Madden. All they do is add tiny little features each year and you hear the word ""Improvement"" A LOT. Go ahead and read/watch some dev. interviews, you'll see/hear the word ""Improved"" a lot. They ""improved"" this and they ""improved"" that. Instead, they should be innovating (which this game does NOT do). You'll notice too that (just like Madden) they don't come out with more than just ONE new main feature each year. This year's main feature is The Show Live. Last year's main feature was Diamond Dynasty, see the pattern? They do have a ""new"" beginners mode. I put quotes around the word ""new"" because it's just another feature that they ""improved"" really. Also just take a look at Badasz's review... notice anything about it?? I'll take some quotes from his review if you don't feel like reading it.... ""The game has a lot of improvement's from the last version""..""Graphics and game play are the same""...""RTTS mode, its more realistic than ever"" (another example of ""improving"" something)....Then he talks about the commentary and not hearing them while you play... umm... every single other The Show since 2006 allowed you to turn off commentary (which I always did)... so nothing new there. He talks about playoff atmosphere, just another little tiny improvement, I've always felt the atmosphere was great during playoff games in past The Show games. Manager mode, just ""improved"". They do this so that they have more to add into their game next year. They don't add other features ON PURPOSE....which I kind of understand, they are here to make money, not please their fans.... and we're the ones who suffer for it. They ad just the minimum amount of new features and improvements to fool players like Badasz into thinking it's a completely new game. Whatever happened to Create Your Own Stadium, Classic HOF players (Ruth, Mays, Paige).... I know they need legal rights to their names, but they've done it in the past, they can do it again.... what ever happened to players wearing their own team jerseys in the All-star game (like in real life), how about adding Fantasy Baseball in the game (like how you have fantasy baseball on yahoo or mlb .c o m. Where the HECK is The World Baseball classic... perfect year to have it. We've been waiting for The Show to add the WBC. I know they won't be able to use players real names, but isn't that what the Roster Vault is for?!?! Definitely wait for this game to drop to around at least $30 before buying it. With everything I said, If you loved last years game and aren't expecting/care-about huge changes and innovations and don't mind the exact same gameplay... then get this game. This game would be deserving of a 10/10 if it were the first or second baseball game to ever exist. It's a great game standing by itself, but since this game is part of a sports series, it deserves special treatment when reviewing it. Bottom line... Nothing new. Same Gameplay. Lots of little improvements (batting stances, things like that). ONE new main feature (The Show Live).... that's it. This is probably the best baseball game I've ever played. The changes to this year are excellent. Playing in the field and running the bases is incredibly immersive, intuitive and fun. The game now teaches you how to become a better batter, a feature I've desperately needed for ages now, and it really helps.. I've been playing this franchise for since back on the original Playstation, and I can honestly say I am blown away by this year's game. I honestly was not expecting much this season, but the improvements the devs made for this year really improve the overall gameplay. Hitting is no longer so difficult that every game is a pitcher's duel; now hitting is easy enough on the Veteren setting as to be fun, but still realistic. I'm sure after a few games I'll bump up the difficulty a bit and see how that goes. As for the presentation improvements, new camera angles, commentating, and cut scenes make the game look even more like a real TV broadcast. The new Postseason mode is really cool as well. The entire presentation changes to create a playoff atmosphere, and is nice for those who don't want to play through a whole season to experience the playoffs. As a diehard of the series I probably notice more changes than the casual player, but I can honestly say that this is the best baseball game I've played and am more than happy with dropping the $60 for it. A must buy for baseball fans!. Its the same as last years game. There are a couple changes to RTTS but nothing to warrant dropping $60 or trading in a bunch of your games to get this. Personally I think MLB 10 The Show was the best game and was almost perfect.This year pitching is harder and batting is also more complicated. Do I feel cheated again? Yup. Will you? Without a doubt.","more than 10 years later and this is still an exceptional baseball game with silky smooth gameplay that still holds up remarkably well today . presentation is probably the best that it has ever been in that point . gameplay is also fun too, and overall, fun as expected ."
758.Psychonauts 2,"Psychonauts 2 is one of the greatest and most well thought out 3D platformers I have ever played. Every element of this game was placed with an intent and a story function, trying to help you understand the characters and their respective mental states, which is at the center of this entire experience. The game is an expert at show-not-tell through its level design, where unlike its contemporaries, aren't designed from the concept of scenery, but from the concept of character and story potential. Its wealth of collectibles are all very fun to collect and all depict nuances of the minds that Raz explores. Each world also just looks visually so gorgeous, and the accompanying music and world design are all top notch here. Raz's movement mechanics and combat abilities are also greatly enhanced, and while they honestly don't create the greatest feeling moveset, they were designed to work perfectly with the world around it. The improvements from the first Psychonauts are also more noticable, not only in its technical capabilities (uh, yeah i sure hope so), but also in its portrayal of mental health, humor, and story design. Raz is no longer just a character caught up in a bunch of these events, he now has a reason to explore all these minds and uncover the truth behind the villains to stop them. As somebody who was lukewarm on the first Psychonauts game, Psychonauts 2 blew way past my expectations and created what I would consider one of my favorite games ever.. Simply charming graphic design, surprising boss levels, quite unique approach to such a delightful concept of peoples minds az mazes. Its just has that grippy magic that you have to experience yourself for solid 20 hours of stunning platformer game.. Psychonauts 2 is a visually stunning game with vibrant graphics and clever, engaging dialogue that brings its quirky characters to life. The story is deep and thought-provoking, exploring mental health in creative ways while keeping players entertained with its humor and adventure. However, despite its strong narrative and charm, the lack of a proper map makes navigation frustrating, which ultimately detracts from the overall experience and led me to not finish the game.. A marverlous game! Such incredible characters, amazing art-style and deep stories! Hours and hours of pure entertainment!. Compared to the first one this one is much more consistent with lower peaks but less drops in quality. IT IS A COOL GAME WOW REALLY NICEEEE.Really really really good and fun game. I had low expectations, and I was blown away. The story characters and voice acting was top notch, and the gameplay was fun and mostly engaging. But best of all was the nuanced and thoughtful commentary on life, love, and all of us being both flawed and redeemable. Masterpiece.. this game reminds me of ratchet & clank but also its different in a lot of ways. 10 hours in, I have no motivation to finish the game. the good: the story is complex, the characters are unique, the main character is very likable, some puzzles are satisfying to complete. the bad: There's not many powerful weapons, very weak. the focus is more on platforming over combat. theres only 4 buttons for picking between a wheel of weapons, very annoying. exploration of areas feels daunting with no live map. too many random collectables, confusing gear upgrade shop. I like the concept of the game overall, the older mechanics of the game make it unpleasant to play.. The game is a natural sequel, however it lacks innovation. It was surprising the design is not as original as in the 1st part. The music is not so touching either. Very strong, however no innovation in this sequel.. So imaginative, creative,just has that spirit of adventure to it! Made me fall in love with the whole genre.. Whilst I LOVED the first game, I just found the second one... boring. The story is much more grandiose, so it must be better right? Well... It just had me losing interest more than anything. The portrayal of the minds were also much more detailed this time too, portraying mental illnesses and conflicts much better than the first... however I felt like it sacrificed fun too much for art. Actually the whole game felt like a masterful art piece, however it prioritized it's art over gameplay and as a result, made the game feel a little too slow at times. While the game didn't resonate with me much, it could be right up your ally depending on the type of person you are. I 100%'d the game btw, and these are my closing thoughts.. A globally well designed 3D adventure / platform game, with an appreciable psychodelic twist in the artistic direction which is appreciable to see and a clear reminder of the first opus. The story is good, graphics are ok. The not so anecdotic cons being : the game include way too many collectible for its own good and for me it somehow fades the main adventure and its good sides. A good game to play anyway, given you don't care too much about collectibles.. Creative and fun to play. There is a mystery, humor, action and all so well done. In one boss fight I was laughing hysterically and had lot of fun. (Kitchen reality boss fight). A must play game.. One of the best platform games I've played, very beautiful, fun and with very good mechanics.. Psychonauts 2 is a work of art in all respects. This is the most fun I have had with any game in a long time. Bravo to Double Fine and Xbox for making this masterpiece.. What a game this is, I am a casual player and this game just absorbed my attention for a few weeks, to be honest I even felt a bit empty when the game was over. You should definitely try it, you won’t be disappointed !. Awesome game! The writing is hilarious and Tim Schafer remains a creative genius, with amazing art design and aesthetic. The game can feel occasionally ""low budget"" in its transitions and cutscenes, and combat is sometimes frustrating, but overall, Psychonauts 2 is by far the best platformer on Xbox.. Great game great story great humor love everything about this game looks like a Saturday morning cartoon double fine has done it again I highly recommend. One of the best 3D platformers ever made, absolutely loved this game. From the characters the gameplay, setting, everything is super high quality and fun. Masterpiece. One of the best 3D platformers. I highly recommend playing Psychonauts 2. Huge improvements from the original.. I played the original Psychonauts quite a long time ago. Earlier this month, I got an Xbox Series S (my first Xbox console) and a Game Pass subscription. Had no idea which games were on it, but I got really happy when I saw Psychonauts 2. Went in thinking mostly about the achievements, but ended up enjoying the gameplay and how rewarding the exploration was. What I wasn't expecting was for the story to still be as amazing as the original game. Something that today's adventure/platforming games lack.. Game has great story, infinte creativity level and many polished ideas. Thank you developers for this great game. Amazing sequel! Double Fine did a wonderful work with Microsoft's support. Art style, story, dialogues were super good.. What a game! I kept seeing this game being mentioned online so i downloaded it off gamepass to try out. Am I ever glad I did. The game is amazing, It really should be a ""must-play"" here on metacritic. It keeps getting better the further you get. The world design is so creative and unique. The levels where you go inside other peoples brains are so fun, cool, and interesting. I can't recommend it enough. Cheat and use YouTube walkthroughs if you get stuck, it's definitely worth playing until the end.. Psychonauts 2 delivers a great story with well written characters and smart dialogue and themes, albeit a bit of a slow burner with some levels and mechanics that hit and some that miss. I played on Series X and the game ran and looked great and I imagine the game would play and look even better on an OLED with 120hz capability(which I do not own). The Good: -Great story full of witty dialogue and thought-provoking ideas -Fun gameplay (sometimes) -Amazing artwork -Amazing audio The Bad: -Some levels can feel like a chore -Combat sometimes feel clunky and it can become a little frustrating. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best playformers ever. Awesome graphics, great story. A true gem.. I had never heard of the Psychonaughts games before trying this one on Gamepass and I wasn't disappointed. The platforming elements brought me back to my childhood and the story was far better than any platformer that I have ever played. Boss battles were great.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An original game where you can enter in the mind of people and fight with the emotions of the person, but this situation will soon be bigger and problematic. This game rapresents the aspect of old games but reasembled in a new one.. Excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Razman the boss of psychoteams. Great puzzles, fun platforming, great characters, funny moments, awesome story, this game is underrated.. I played 3-5 hours then stopped, not worth my time. It's a kiddie game from what I experienced correct me if I'm wrong. Maybe it gets better later but a game should be fun in the beginning.. Excellent gameplay, Graphics and sound playing on the Series X. Goty contender.. Absolutely fantastic. Love this game. one of the best 3d platformers ive played in recent years.. Congratulations to whoever wrote the storytelling for this play. Such a successful story is rare.. overrated cartoony game with laughable graphics, this game is sooooo outdated, it's 2022 not 1998, wake up developers!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favorite games this year, and one of the most fun 3D platformers I ever played. The history, art direction, and soundtrack shine for me. Loved every second of it.. The good: Psychonauts is back with Rasputin in the lead and Right at the time the first game left off. Humorous and “Burtonesque” type graphics (as if they were designed for a Tim Burton movie). The Transitions of worlds is spectacular without so much drama or inventions of Magical-comic-musical SSD. The sound effects are well done. Boss fights will leave you speechless (not all) The bad: Some skills are very useless. It is not for a child audience. The platform mechanics feel very 'New old school' type N64. Some worlds can be very strong and emotionally impactful with many eyes and holes or gloomy like the dentist. The soundtrack could have been better. It is a difficult game to see/watch Lo Meh: It feels like a continuation (which never came) back in 2005. A lot of criticism of the character and world design, but if this had been done by a certain Tim Burton they would be praising the project in a thousand ways. The James Bond-type song commercial was great. ""The nightmare of trypophobes: the video game"". I created my account because of this game. It clearly deserved to be a 2021 GOTY contender, and in my mind it should have won. Everything is perfect: platforming, abilities, story, level design.. playing this game was a privilege for me. Amazing. Just an upgrade from the original. Better mechanics, awesome boss fights, awesome platforming and an enjoyable overall experience. Overrated, Boring as hell thank f---k I played this on gamepass trash as game. Perfect story and great pacing. Felt engaged during the entire experience. Loved this game, especially the story. I played the original Psychonauts on the Xbox way back when. While I don't remember each and every detail, I do remember it feeling very unique and captivating. It was quite the gem in an era where 3D platformers were a more appealing genre. Upon hearing news the sequel released (and straight to Game Pass), I was very excited to play it. The hype around it being a ""Game of the Year"" candidate only fueled my excitement. But unfortunately that's where the joy ended for me. I think my expectations being as elevated as they were contributed most to my disdain for this title. It's really not a bad game, but getting through the 3 hours that I committed to it was a bit of a chore. While it's very colorful, bright and **** sort of lacks heart. It's one giant repetitive collectathon that still manages to feel like a tutorial even beyond the first level. Alot of people enjoy the game and they aren't wrong for thinking it's amazing cause I see what makes it good. But the shortcomings are too hard overlook, especially for a seasoned gamer such as myself.. Super underrated game. Great story, crazy ideas and tons of unique jokes. Pure fun.. Having played the first Psychonauts and thinking there would never be a sequel, and then finding out about the sequel, then realizing the sequel is actually excellent.. ah, thank you!. i hate indie games and everything which looks like indie but this game is awesome, exactly my kind of humor. i am glad that i tried this one thanks to the game pass, the jump n run passages are awesome, story is awesome, the way everything is explained is awesome. each character is awesome. i am glad that i tried it, def a awesome game :) and jordonmoli7 is probably someone who fanboys some specific console, all his reviews are on good xbox games and all are scored 0. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Psychonauts is a very good, enjoyable and entertaining game. With interesting, large locations, unique plot twists and fairly well developed characters, this cartoon-like game gives hours **** gameplay. It is very creative and diverse, the storyline is engaging, even if the payer's choices have little to no impact on an actual plot. The tasks can seem pretty repetitive, but at the end of the day, this is a very solid platform game with tons of surprises. The soundtrack is awesome, it adds an excellent dynamic to the game. It portraits well the game atmosphere - naïve, nostalgic and absolutely magical. The only major problem that I can see is how inconsistent the graphic is. The locations are beautiful, very cartoony, nice to look at. However, the textures on the characters, especially on their faces are still very off. I know that it was meant to resemble an old-school game, but they look odd comparing to all the rest. Pixelated and just not polished. Overall, it's a decent piece of entertainment. A big plus for being able to enjoy the game after completing the main quest - it gives you a good few more hours of gameplay and lets you complete all the side tasks.. Boring. I really want to like this game but combat and platforming feels outdated, and the story is just super boring. I do not recommend this game, not even for kids.. A very creative and imaginative game, but also an overstaffed and undercooked one. (Disclaimer: the first Psychonauts is one of my favorite games ever.) Pros: + Some levels are awesome. My favorite one was the Bob's mind. + Tim's writing is still funny and his puns work. + I did enjoy the boss fights (except the first one) + Most of the treasure hunting in the open world sections are nostalgia inducing and great. + This time around the game is relatively easy to 100%. Cons: - The platforming itself and movement never felt right. Double Fine games has never been mechanically impressive, but here it hits the hardest. All the other platformers in the market moved the future and this game stayed in the past. The gap is painfully wide. - There are also just too many mechanics in the game and none of them are great. You can see how more and more stuff was added over 6 year development span and most of them are mediocre at best. Feels more like an Assassin's Creed game then a Psychonauts one. - The levels are also very inconsistent. Both visually and gameplay wise. Some of them (like the Hollis's brain) I didn't enjoy at all. - The open-world structure is also gated weirdly. After entering Green Gulch you can't go back to Questionable area, and that prevented me from doing side-quests when I wanted them. And there is no good reason to structure the game this way.. A masterpiece!! This game deserves so much more, it's one of my top 5 of the year!!. Wonderful game. A travel into the mind. Nice graphic and audio, great story and so fun to play. I recommend the game to everyone love games.. The characters are amazingly charming weird funny lovable. The story kept me hooked and the platforming was so easy. It grew harder but you grew with new powers to traverse thru the worlds.. EN: The best platformer in 2021. Double Fine did a great job and faithfully conveyed the atmosphere of the first part. They did not lack creativity. The levels are beautiful, the colorful colors leave a phenomenal impression. The story is interesting, as are the levels themselves, minus only because of the smaller amount of humor compared to the first part and the relatively easier boss fight parts. Another must-play game on the Game Pass service. SRB: Najbolji platformer u 2021. godini. Double Fine je uradio odličan posao i verno je preneo atmosferu prvog dela. Kreativnost im nije falila. Nivoi su prelepi, živopisni koloriti ostavljaju fenomenalan utisak. Priča je zanimljiva, kao i sami nivoi, minus samo zbog manje količine humora u odnosu na prvi deo i relativno lakših boss fight delova. Još jedna must-play igra na Game Pass servisu.. Psychonauts 2 is one of the best games I've ever played, the art direction is beautiful the level design is very interesting the voice acting is top notch, the game is screaming with personality and the story is very engaging and memorable.. Great game across the board!!! What a joy it was to play this masterpiece.... i had never hear Psychonauts game before I start playing Psychonauts 2 game. Game is fun to play with game humor was very fun and sharp. When you start playing Psychonauts 2 game you immerse yourself in the game, after a while you will notice that you have played to the end of the game and will be thirsty for DLC or a new Psychonauts game. I can't play the game comfortably as it doesn't even have Russian subtitles. I don't understand Microsoft's attitude to the Russian market, how do they want to compete with Sony if they have full localization in almost all games?. Review. Story 3.7/5 Gameplay 5/5>8.7/10. follow me on Xbox @qp TYRESE qp.... Average game,,, So so much bla bla bla, stretched a little bit, not bad graphics but not Next Gen,,, If you are buying, then go for it takes two.. a great sequel to one of the most creative games in history. Special thanks for the fact that, albeit not immediately, they added support for the Russian language, now you can comfortably immerse yourself in the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Psychonauts 2 stays true to its roots from the original that came out 15 years ago. The writing still has the same whit that Double Fine is known for and the platforming is creative and mesmerizing. I think the combat was a bit lackluster after a while due to there not being many creative ways fights are utilized, but this game makes up for it with some gorgeous animation. Each level feels different and the hub world has more to explore. Definitely deserves a solid 9/10. This game should have been the GOTY. Its gameplay is so smooth and responsive, the art style is amongst the best of all time, its characters are iconic and memorable, and the levels are clearly made with passion. This game's storyline is one of the best I've ever seen in any medium.. A must play and the best platformer of 2021. Unique, beautiful, funny and brilliant from start to finish.. Greater than RetGreater than Retch ch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch Greater than RetGreater than Retch ch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch Greater than Retch. Absolutely amazing fun game that’s filled with character and uniqueness. The level design, characters, and story are all spot on. There’s also quite a bit of collectibles and open world elements that allows for a more nonlinear experiences. One of my favorite games ever and I cannot wait for a 3rd game.. I just had to write a review for this game, it's just so good. From its unique 3d platforming sequences, to the way it manages to balance its cartoonish animation, and the serious subject matter it handles. It is an amazing game. I enjoyed posing from beginning to e nd. Not as good as the ratings, boring game where the visuals are nowhere near Ratchet and Clank. Bang average!. This Game is FIRE!!! Psychonauts 2 is an amazing game with an incredible history.. A truly unique artstyle with a deep and engaging story, humour and the gameplay is top notch and on the series X it ran flawlessly, Psychonauts 2 is a riveting game that has many deep and meaningful story points that are relatable it helps give the game a very real feel to it. A great package for audiences of all ages that’s also available at no extra charge if you have gamepass I honestly can’t ask for more. Great game. This wonderful game can be also a movie it really looks like old school movies .. A great game! I enjoyed this as much as the first on the OG xbox. Stunning 3D platform game. One of the best storylines in recent years. Despite the more cartoony graphics, the theme is quite mature, for adults.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is so exiting the level of imagination and originality are just amazing!. Best Platformer I've played in years, certainly the best this year. The game is full of so many unique levels, fun mini games and fresh concepts it keeps me entertained throughout! Great narrative as well. Psychonauts 2 Go play this game Psychonauts 2 is a 12 an a half hour long 3D platformer and is one of the best games of the year.. Taking place just days after the First psychonauts game, you play as Razputin, theres a moele in the psychonauts so you set out to at first, sneakily get to the bottom of this.. I was impressed with how the game manages to not pretend like you magically forgot all of the powers you learned in the first game, you get them all almost instantly with a little hey, remember that thing you can do, that would be helpful here.. as well as introducing new abilities tht make for some interesting puzzles early on.. And for better or for worse psychonauts 2 feels very much like a PS2 game.. there is no handholding here, The game takes place in a semi open world where you have to find a cast of charcters and enter their minds for the more linear parts of the game.. so you ve to figure out what to do with whatever the previous character told you.. no arrows, no spot marked on the map, just go find them.. but once you do and things get rolling, psychonauts 2 is a blast… now there isn’t as much variety gameplay wise as there was in the first game as you were learning new abilities, so it sticks to straight up 3d platforming with new elements here and there based on the new power, but the game still manages to feel fresh throughout, even throwing you into a cooking show for one level.. and one of my favorite moments when I knew I loved this game was going through this dark forest in search of some bees.. Theres so much charm here, such a special game.. My only complaing with Psychonauts 2 is the combat, it just isn’t that fun, you have so many powers but only 4 action buttons so you have to constantly remap depending on certain enemies, and I feel enemies are just so spongy for how much the game asks of you, but there are accessibility optiosn to make you invincible if youre just over a section or don’t care to deal with the annoying combat, but definitely turn this off for boss battles, because these moments are really fun and special and youll be missing out not giving them your all. Psychonauts 2 is a really special game full of charm and humor. A must play I give Psychonauts 2 an 8.5/10. This game looks like a Hollywood mega-production. An incredible and surprising story with excellent game-play and fantastic worlds full of colours and magic. This game is a true gem, an experience no one must lose. A beautiful game, really funny and a great experience, this can be the game of the year. Psychonauts 2 features interesting levels and fun characters, but the constant gameplay-interrupting cutscenes have worn my patience down to the nub. It's a neat game, just know that fun 3D platforming often takes a backseat to story.. Very smart and weird game ! Excelente and very fun Game! I playin it on game pass!. Best game from Double Fine ever! Love the story, fantastic gameplay and had so much fun!. Psychonauts 2 is pretty great!. Graphics aren't the best but they're pretty decent, especially in the cut scenes. What i strongly disliked is that repeating-look alike missions we had to do. I'm talking about the ones with the bottles & the ones with Cassi'oPia. Also it took me 25 hours & 36 minutes to finish it that was quite unpleasant. Other than these, the game worths it!.. This is the best game I have played all year. Great graphics, rich characters, diverse gameplay and a entertaining story.. A Masterpiece... Funny jokes, amazing design et good music... I recommend this game for everyone (and comes free in the game pass). Mindblowing, Beautiful, Addictive Gameplay, Fun and Carismatic cast, Great Graphics. A truly masterpiece platformer game.. This game would have been better if it had a higher budget and more effort into it. No Russian language? Disrespect. Thought Double Fine cares for their gamers. Gorgeous game with an awesome art style and fantastic world/level design. Really is a pleasure to play through and experience it!. Very interesting story and gameplay, great graphics and music. Everything is fully optimized for Xbox Series X and the game looks as impressive as possible. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is by FAR the most unique game I have played, maybe ever.. It is phenomenal. The fantasy behind it is limitless. No two levels are alike. It is Persona 5 (castles) on steroids. The mind levels are beyond description. Characters are cartoonish and lovable and the story bizarre AF. P.S.:If you don't like platformers you will have a hard time.. What a masterpiece. Great story, great gameplay, great graphics and wonderful music and sounds. Congratulations for the great work! It's definitely a must play, and I dont see anyone being even near to it as goty candidate.. Very much a step back from what made the original game fun full of cutscene no gameplay. Psychonauts 2 is a one of a kind game. The artstyle of this game gives a surreal feeling and this mixed with the atmosphere the game is going for it just gives you pure quality in a artistic way. If you look for a game with the best graphics this will not be your game but if you like the artstyle of this game than you will still constantly say this game looks beautifull just the way it is. The story of the game is amazing. it amused me the whole game through with constantly giving me new information and a lot of OOOHHH moments. While I havent played the first game it wasn't hard to get into and I felt invested really quickly. Im not going further into the story because its mostly why you should play this game. gameplay on the other hand was a bit boring. While the game is not really heavy focussed on combat or platforming it is okay as you can see the devs putted everything in the artstyle and story which hold this game up perfectly in my opinion. What I liked the most of the gameplay was actually the fact that there is no waypoint. Instead of a waypoint the main character often says where he should go to and you have to memorize where that person or location is. This makes you as the player constantly invested in what is told. Meanwhile if you forgot where to go to or the location where someone is you can also open your menu (a textbook) to read where to go. While this may sounds old and lazy this is in my opinion a lot more fun than just go to point A with a waypoint. So why should you play this game? You should play this game if you like the artstyle and want to go on a trip to bizarre worlds with a good story attached to it. if you look for gameplay you should look for somewhere else as psychonauts 2 has not lot to offer in that regard and that is fine. Why an 8 out of 10? because the game is good and a masterpiece in its own way but not yet a 9 or a 10 as the gameplay does fall behind from other platformers like to say mario. But this game is for sure a must play and especially a must play from gamepass.. Didn't think I would feel this game it didn't really appeal to me but once I started playing it I couldn't stop this game is really a master piece it's written Soo well I have to say it's amazing without giving the game away and the visuals are better than I thought a must play imo. solid 10/10 GOTY for me for sure. good characters and nice story telling. well done double fine!. Really great game. It's funny, witty and story is interesting. Lot of abilities to play around. I did not play the original, but about 7 hours in to this I can tell you I will be going back and playing through the original. The story is fantastic and the game play is fun, with a host of mechanics that let you tune to your play style. I'm HOOKED! The game plays smooth and looks fantastic. I feel like I could be a lot further in to the game than I am but I keep going back in to brains to collect things that I missed every time I get a new ability. Its addictive.. They put love, it is not a difficult game as gameplay, but it is a great story, they develop all characters quite well and talk about real issues of people behavior and personality, quite deep subjects, which I enjoyed to play and I explore, it is a must play. Doublefine created nothing less than the game of the year 2021. Creative design and Gameplay are simply superb. Soundtrack and graphics are very good, and the whole storytelling is just fantastic. Don't miss this game!. Great game. The controls are good, and the psychedelic story telling is amazing. The art style reminds me of something out of a Tim Burton movie. Best platform game of the last decade. smart, great graphics and gameplay! You need to play this!. The accessibility features were awesome and the game was amazing. Story was great, creative, and fun. Just another masterpiece by double fine. Got the 1000 achievement points. I have not like a game so much in a long time.. Not a huge platform genre guy but this game has a really fun story and gameplay. The level designs are beyond creative. I feel bad I got it on gamepass and didn't pay 60 pounds but the perks of xbox I guess. Go play it. Psychonauts 2 is just a great game, full of charm and fun. This is the kind of game that youcan watch somebody play and still have fun, just from watching. The art style respect the first game, the story is a continuation of that story. Raz is a really good character, his Psych abilities are fun to use and to learn. I'll recommend this game to everybody.. If you liked the first game, you’ll absolutely love the second game. I 100% recommend this to anybody.. A near-masterpiece. The art is great, the humor is great, the gameplay is great. i loved every minute of the game but took off one point because: some levels don't let you get 100% on the first playthrough of them. Sometimes you don't learn the ability required to get collectibles until much later in the game. Other times, you will enter a room and trigger a cutscene. You can see the collectibles during the cutscene. You plan to get them as soon as the cutscene ends. But then the level just ends instead. Mildly infuriating.. The humor in this game is a win in it self, the art style is a huge plus for me. The world building and people all are different in their own way. Good game and a possible GOTY. Very creative art style and level design. No chapter is the same as before","Psychonauts 2 is one of the greatest and most well thought out 3D platformers I have ever played . the game is an expert at show-not-tell through its level design . the lack of a proper map makes navigation frustrating, which ultimately detracts from the overall experience ."
759.MechAssault,"One of the first games I've ever played and it still holds up decently well as a destruction sandbox mech fighting game the co-op is awesome the destruction is definitely outdated but for the time was pretty awesome it's just a very good arcade game that tries to lead you on into the whole Mechwarrior gaming scene. If you want a mech game where you destroy **** with different mechs and weapons this is for you. If you want more this is not for you. And I love that when your mech bumps into buildings, it leaves a mark on the buildings. Same when you fire at them. Impressive damage detail. Puts many modern games to shame. this game multiplayer is amazing. there is a mode you can play solo or multiplayer where you just destroy enemy mechs and each new mech respawn gets harder.. Found it a bit repetitive and dull sadly. Appreciate the metal soundtrack, though. And I love that when your mech bumps into buildings, it leaves a mark on the buildings. Same when you fire at them. Impressive damage detail. Puts many modern games to shame.. MechAssault is a lot of fun but it has it's draw backs. The story is rather barebones, the gameplay can become repetitive and levels lack any checkpoints. Multiplayer was a big part of this game and obviously your not gonna get much out of that nowadays other than a horde mod to play with. And one other nitpick I had with the game is the final levels in the lava area look really bad. But even with those negative aspects I'd say MechAssault is still a fun game. Piloting the mechs feels really good and blowing stuff up is always fun. It may of aged a bit but it's still worth picking up for anyone who's got an original Xbox lying around.. Out of all exclusive titles on the Xbox Original. This is by far my favorite out of all of them! MechAssault is a excellent mech simulation game with good graphics, decent soundtrack, a good plot, and amazing gameplay. The campaign mode is epic, but the multiplayer mode is even more epic! This game also features a great library of mechs to choose from, from light mechs to heavy mechs. The only problem with this game for me is that on campaign mode, when you failed the objective or get killed, you have to restart from the beginning. Overall, excellent Xbox title, so 9 out of 10 for me.. Games like these make me wonder how the gaystation 2 got ahead of the xbox when the xbox was clearly more powerfull more gamer oriented , more bad ass games and better online ifrastructure. MechaAssault was one of the many unrecognized kick ass games that the xbox ever had, and to this day i am looking foward to a succesor.. This Game is great for those who want an action packed mech game. Unlike MechWarrior, there is an exclusive mech called the ragnorok . the game has a great campaign and excellent multiplayer. Oh, and there's power armor.. This game is pure mech action. The multiplayer is fun and the different mechs allow for different playstyles. Destroyable environments are a great addition. The single player is decent but the multiplayer more than makes up for it.","MechAssault is an excellent mech simulation game with good graphics, decent soundtrack, a good plot, and amazing gameplay . multiplayer is amazing. there is a mode you can play solo or multiplayer where you just destroy enemy mechs and each new mech respawn gets harder ."
76.God of War: Ragnarok,"The Atreus part is an embarassment,the game has a 3 hour hole halfway through.. God of War: Ragnarok is a masterwork that makes for a perfect next installment to the God of War series. It introduces new and exciting mechanics that keep things fresh while still providing the proper “God of War” experience that has kept fans coming back for each new release. The story of the previous God of War game continues with a heart tugging narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A captivating story combined with the classic God of War combat makes this the game that keeps on giving.. Everything you can want from a sequel. A clean experience with great visuals and voice acting. An absolutely breathtaking game. Builds upon every gameplay element introduced in the first and I would say that the 9 realms in this game were more enjoyable to explore than the first. Much more linear and much easier to remember the different parts of each realm that you had been to. Story is great, although in my opinion doesn't come near to the first. But that is not a bad thing because the first game's story was something I knew couldn't be topped. If you played GOW 2018, you will love this game for sure. Great improvements, and you will have more fun playing Ragnarok for sure, even though the story lacks in comparison to the first. Must play game.. Here is your text translated into English:A game that’s completely mandatory if you have PS Extra, no **** a true fan of the series and having played since the first GoW (I was 13 years old), these are my ratings:As a game: 9.5/10As God of War: 3.5/10Before anyone attacks me, the explanation is **** game is undeniably almost a work of art—everything from the story, the plot, character development, video and audio quality, environments, boss designs, weapons, and magic… that’s why I gave it the score I did as a ****, here’s the big issue.I miss playing a GoW with that immature, brutal Kratos, ripping off heads without thinking of the consequences, going straight for his goal, destroying anything in his path, whether innocent or not, solving problems by obliterating everything without reflecting on **** that’s exactly what I expect from a GoW: that essence of what Kratos was **** make myself clearer:I want to rip eyes out and stab blades into people’s chests, not spend 2 hours looking for fruit for a mammoth with a girl who looks like Zendaya.Playing this game, I can tell you that the moments that truly opened my eyes were the finishing moves on bosses or enemies (R3), because for a brief moment, I saw that real Kratos.Maybe the series nailed the change it made in 2018, and the success of the two games proves **** I think what really hooked us fans was what came before, and the attachment we have to the **** early games stood out for their relentless violence and a fixed camera that turned every setting into an epic spectacle. With today’s technology and graphics, a game in that style would be absolutely ****’s the path I think they should take, and it’s very easy for them. Just look at how GoW III ended—we still have so much story left between then and the current games.I just hope, from the bottom of my heart, that they don’t leave the series in the hands of that annoying kid Atreus. Kratos is, and always will be, irreplaceable.Thanks for reading until the end :)Let me know if you need any adjustments!. Aside from the story and scenery, God of War has very dated gameplay. You don't feel like a god because the smallest enemies can stagger you or even kill you with just a few moves. Invisible walls and a very limited tube-like level design only emphasize it.Enemies sometimes repeat themselves from the previous part. This continues until the end. There are exceptions and interesting / well-staged opponents. Unfortunately too little and with very poor pacing, as many are repeated (**** puzzles are very limited and you sometimes have to do exactly what the developers ask you to do, even if that's exactly how you thought it out, but you don't act with pixel precision. It also takes you more out of the game. It feels like a pattern. Hordes of enemies, hose passages and then monotonous puzzles. If you want to immerse yourself in the story, the unnecessary RPG nonsense will get you out of it. Equipping may be a little improved from the first part, but it's still too much. Like the combat system with the camera problems and the question of whether it should be Hack'nSlay or more tactical Souls-like, the entire game doesn't really know what it wants to be. It was like torture for me until the end. Motivated by the good scenery mentioned at the beginning, the interesting characters and the story. But to get to these points, I have to deal with outdated gameplay that offers poor pacing. It is one of the worst games I have played in 2024.I wish the combat system had been made more fun, short-winded, and freer. Without RPG elements, or really just a minimum of new armor parts. Skill unlocking would also have been nice to be able to happen automatically (and intuitively). Almost everything is ripped out. I would have liked more individuality and variety in the opponents. And when you fight against crowds, please do so in a way that makes you feel like a god (quickly and well staged). And don't laboriously process every hundredth opponent like a stronger one. The strengths were this hidden world, where you later go with Artreus. Epically staged boss fights (not the annoying little bosses), the visual environments (not hose levels), such as on the way to Odin, and the characters in general. 6.2. Games like elder ring have perfected difficulty by making you do tons of damage and receive tons of damage. God of war Ragnarok made me regret my decision to push the difficulty up because the enemies and bosses became toooo damn spongy. I hope the studio change this aspect in future games,stop giving enemies so much health when raising the difficulty , its becoming tedious and annoying rather than difficult. Elder ring is difficult, this is tedious there is a difference. Other than that the game is excellent in all aspects. An amazing game, if you played GOW 2018 you will really like this one, it's not a revolution, just an evolution, the graphics are way better, the mechanics are polished with new combos, habilities, movements, even weapons, and the story is really good but goes really fast, they wanted to pack everything in this game but for me it would have been necessary another game to end the nordic saga, but besides that, everything is excellent. Highly recommended. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10/10!! The game is a literal masterpiece; every gamer needs to experience this godliness in their life. The emotions I experienced throughout this game, the overall feeling it left me with...actually speechless. Will be thinking about this one for the rest of my life.. First game from this soft reboot was amazing. But this one is just a DEI slop with extremely repetitive gameplay. Story is a simple teenage drama with unnecessary and very lazy woke garbage. Oh and our beloved character Kratos is just a neutered wimp now.. The greatest experience you will ever get to feel in life! The last game lacked variety of boss fights and this one here delivers just that. More boss fights plus characters plus new areas to explore it really is just a better version than the last game.. God of puzzles…because first thing I think of when it comes to Gods & mythologies is all the puzzles. A fanstatic story, nice gameplay, one of the best games I have ever played.. It's good but it could be a lot better, Tyr is a disappointmentt. I hate teenager Atreus. I just finished this game and I can tell you that this is for now one of the best games ever made especially for ps5 because of the prefect graphics and gameplay. And the story of course. And the whole game is huuuge! It doesn't matter if you're into this kind of games but even so it is a MUST to play.. God of War: Ragnarok builds on the strengths of its predecessor, delivering an even richer experience. The combat is more refined, with new weapons and abilities adding depth, while the expanded world offers more exploration and variety. The story dives deeper into Norse mythology and character relationships, providing more emotional weight and satisfying arcs. While the first game set the foundation, Ragnarok elevates everything with grander scale, improved pacing, and more impactful moments, making it an unforgettable sequel.. A fantastic squeal. Good boss fights, great story ad just all round fun. Arteus is growing as a really good character as well.. God of war Ragnarok is everything from the first game but improved making it one of the best sequels to date.. The woke is strong with this one. They absolutely ruined these characters. The new game engine is klunky, and the ""improved"" visuals aren't worth the trade off. If you love this franchise I would recommend you do yourself a favor and skip this one. This one was a little bit like visiting your best friend from college only to learn they have changed for the worse and you can no longer connect with them. You will wish you had just held on to your good memories of the previous games.... WOW. Really wow. This is by far the best game I ve ever played. And believe me when I say that I have already played a lot of games. I recommend it to everybody who wants to try it. The thing I liked the most is the story and the storytelling.. I didn't think it would be possible, but it's even better than the first part. Unbelievable.. I like this game a lot and it lives up to its expectations. The game overall is quite excellent when it comes to aspects like: exploring, combat and action, and story. Exploring the game's map was quite fun, it was interesting to see little crevices and secret areas I had missed. The action and combat were equally as exciting and thrilling, I loved the finishers and different techniques you could do with the weapons Kratos has. I also loved the story, it was emotional and even eye-catching, which is a massive thumbs up in my opinion. However, I think that this game lacks replayability, as in starting New Game Plus and further because it eventually gets boring.. Its a great game, from amazing graphics to amazing characters, to amazing story and the fact that you get to play as atreus makes it a whole new feeling like you couldn’t do that in God of war 2018 which i think is amazing.. it’s a great game, but it has some flaws, especially with the pacing. I wish they split into two games instead of one, but overall it’s a great game with great character characters in the part at the end made me cry.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. They tried to made the best game ever. This game looks gorgeous but also very complete without bores you a bit. You chsnged roles, areas, graphics are amazing, story well made. Really the game it was great experience. The combat, the art design, the animations, the character development, the damn story - this is the game of the century folks. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The story eclipses that of the Witcher 3, the combat blasts Elden Ring out of the park and the world is more beautiful than than Ghosts of Tsushima.. I love it. I love Kratos. I used to hate Atreus. The gameplay is better than the previous one. More thins to do and upgrade. Music is still in my brain. Combat isnow the standard of industry.. I’m sorry but this game is heavily overrated. I actually stopped playing this half way through and deleted it from my library because I was so fed up with it. I’m gonna break it down for simplicity. Pros: - amazing cinematography + visuals - characters are well acted and portrayed Cons: - in terms of gameplay I felt it was to linear - I felt bored most of the time and actually procrastinated instead of playing this - the combat is not satisfying at all - some of the puzzles aren’t good at all at giving you hints of what you’re actually supposed to do most of the time. (A game isn’t that fun if you’re having to spend half your play time looking up a tutorial for 1 puzzle after running in circles for half an hour trying to figure out what to do). Simply amazing. Great story, graphics, ambience, music and narrative. A must play if you own a PlayStation. Also the Pro patch was a work of art.. Absolutely top Tyr. Rarely is there a game that grips me as much as this one has.. The game is a great showing of story telling and character development. I just finished my third play through of the game. New game plus gives some tweaks to the mini bosses and boss fights from original play through. It is my second favorite in the franchise.. Amazing game, good and satisfying gameplay but I feel like something is missing in the story, I can't really explain it. Combat is bland and boring... gets repetitive and predictible rather quickly. Graphics ok. Story kinda of meh if you are not really into this type of stuff. Only buy because it was on sale. Still dont think this game worth more than 30$.. incredible game, hats off to the tam that made it. combat, graphics, character development, story, art, all insanely good. ran well on PC too. First of all, the graphics are amazing. The art style and open world are so detailed and well done. The characters are also very well developed and keep you interested. The playthrough can feel routine at times; going to an area, fighting all the enemies, going to the next area, completing a puzzle to traverse to the next section, and repeat. The combat was very well done and fun throughout my playthrough.. Great videogame! The history is one of the strongest things in this game, but also stands with its gameplay I think in depends on what kind of player are you, but I felt this game a little bit slower than god of war 2018, but also great, but in the other hand I have friends that say that this is better than the last one, so that´s on You!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. overall this game is amazing, thats all I can say, the ending was a bit underwhelming so im removing 1 point. other than that, gameplay is more of what we loved from the 2018 game with improvements and quality of life changes and its great!. After 30 hours I was done. In summary it can be said that, like its predecessor, it is a very good game. Starting with the characters and the story staging through to the gameplay and graphics. But the musical background and the underlined tonality of the game are also very good. Nevertheless, just like its predecessor, it didn't keep me consistently entertained. I kept putting the game aside and only picked it up again after a while. I also lack depth in this part when it comes to the setting and Loki is clearly better but was still very annoying, especially at the **** in all it may not be a masterpiece but you have to play it.8/10.. my all-time favorite game, not boring even after the third playthrough, extremely cool combat system. Spear is fun and the new rune attacks, as well as the bosses are really cool and the story is a masterpiece. Smart choice to make this a duology - this sequel finishes the story with aplomb. Very similar game to the first one, which was the correct choice, as it's hard to improve on something already terrific. The new spear weapon for Kratos gives the combat more variety, as does the different shield options. It's just as epic, beautiful, and heartbreaking as its predecessor. The DLC offers a fun roguelite twist on the gameplay, too.. Fantastic game, the first was good but this one tipped it over the edge, I love how you can have the experience of a relaxed fighter or a really tough fighter. The best story game i have ever played, i have played almost every story game out there, i have tried all the games out there, this one is on a different level, 10x times ahead of any story game i have ever played, played the 2018 game it was great, didnt think they could do something better than the 2018 game, and they did we asked for more enemies they gave us we asked for more bosses they gave us, doing side missions are not boring nor repetitive, only down side of this game is the irowood mission, i give that mission a 6/10, but i understand that mission had to happen, other wise i dont think i disliked anything about this game, pure masterpiece, glad i played it, kratos is wiser than ever, glad i grew up playing this game, played the first god of war games when i was 7 years old, and now i feel i am as old as kratos, the writing of the story makes you really attached to the character, well done santa monica, cant wait to try your new games. Not as good as the first. They crippled Kratos' character and made a bunch of other weird character choices that make no sense.. God of War: Ragnarok is a masterpiece that perfectly balances deep lore with engaging gameplay. The way it builds on Norse mythology is incredible, weaving a story that feels both epic and deeply personal. Every interaction with the gods and creatures of the Nine Realms adds layers to the lore, making the world feel rich and **** gameplay is just as outstanding. The combat is fluid, brutal, and satisfying, with plenty of options to customize your playstyle. Whether you’re swinging the Leviathan Axe or summoning runic attacks, every fight feels dynamic and rewarding. Combined with jaw-dropping visuals and a perfectly paced story, Ragnarok is a game that’s as fun to play as it is to experience.. Pros - expanded 2018 combat system in all the right ways - breathtaking performances - fun exploration - higher difficulties highlight the best parts of the combat system - insanely better enemy variety compared to 2018 // Cons - the boat/sled exploration is made annoying by voice lines getting repeated every 10 seconds (every Mimir story has two sentences to catch the player up if interrupted, and those can last just long enough to not get anywhere before the new point of interest and then repeat again) // The follow up the incredible God of War 2018 had a lot to live up to. And it somehow exceeded every expectation I had for the game. Every aspect I liked about the 2018 game is better than before and it is not even close. The expanded combat with some of the skills from the previous entry becoming basic abilities is so much fun. New Runic Attacks and the use of the triangle button to add extra potential to every weapon pays off so much that by the first two hours it felt like something that was always a part of the 2018 formula. What aids this feeling is the expanded enemy variety. Several factions, with distinct abilities and bosses that are far more varied than the 2018 six flavors of troll. All of the enemies have clear attack patterns, reducing a lot of the 2018 screen clutter. All of the weapons being part of exploration is also a lot of fun. While the game still has that glued to the ground issue, the blades especially add some much needed briskness to movement. Then there is the story. This game does far more with its narrative than I ever expected. Going through the base game, it builds slowly until about chapter six. After that the game just does not let off the gas, ending in one of the most epic sequences I have ever played. And then comes Valhalla. A free piece of DLC that gives genuinely emotional redemption to Kratos. They cooked with this game. And they cooked hard. All in all, God of War Ragnarök should be a glowing standard to what sequels should be. Improvement on all fronts, with satisfying gameplay and narrative. Could not recommend this game any harder.. Totally lives up to the hype. Epic drama, intense action, heartwarming story, well-thought-out gameplay, creative bosses, hordes of lore. I think my only critique is the pacing. To level up efficiently you must do a lot of side quests, and I felt that some of the side quests weren't as executed as well as I'd like and are forgettable.. Improves upon the first in every conceivable way. Bigger set pices, better boss fight, new gameplay mechanics, amazing story and graphics and music. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A game so good I had did 3 play thought. Combat is fine tuned and rewarding. I personally like the more soulslike feel they went with in the new GOW’s and the story is truely immaculate. Love it and recommend it highly. this game was too good to end on this way, i hoped that game had a sequel, but it didn´t. although, this game is a masterpiece by santa monica.. Definition of more of the same. And Kratos only gets softer and softer while he strands away from all the characteristics that made him one of the most loved characters ever.. More of the 2018 version, but with flaws that show late. This game is a banger in the early hours but becomes very stale gameplay wise. I shouldn't have platinumed it and just left it after the story. The combat is still lackluster and can't decide if you need to have a power fantasy like the old games or a challenging combat experience like the other popular games nowadays but fails at both. It is heavily carried by the acting and funny dialogue which makes it bearable in the end game where the gameplay gets stale.. Sappy, over-rated, dull game. Takes the formula of the 2018 game and adds terrible dialogue, pointless DEI, and 2-3 hours of Atrius fruit picking. The combat is ok, but honestly… in 2022 I would have expected more. It’s mediocre at best.. Great game. I wouldn't call if perfect. Same as GOW 2018 but with some improvements. The pacing of the story is all over the place and lacks cool bosses or replayability.. A masterpiece, from story to combat, graphics to enemy variety. Highly recommend for everyone.. God Of War Ragnarök masterfully builds upon its predecessor, delivering an epic continuation of Kratos and Atreus's journey through Norse mythology. The game introduces a rich narrative filled with emotional depth, complex character development, and stunning visuals that draw players into its beautifully crafted **** gameplay mechanics are refined, offering a seamless blend of brutal combat and intricate puzzles. The addition of new abilities and weapons enhances the combat experience, allowing for a variety of playstyles. The boss battles are particularly noteworthy, showcasing challenging encounters that require strategy and skill.Visually, Ragnarök is a feast for the eyes. The landscapes are breathtaking, from snow-covered mountains to lush forests, each area bursting with detail. The voice acting and soundtrack elevate the storytelling, immersing players in the emotional stakes of the characters' journeys.However, while the game excels in many areas, some players may find the pacing a bit uneven, with certain segments feeling drawn out. Additionally, there are moments where the narrative could have benefited from tighter editing.Overall, God of War Ragnarök is an extraordinary sequel that successfully expands upon its predecessor's legacy. With its compelling story, engaging gameplay, and stunning presentation, it stands as a must-play title for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.. God of War: Ragnarok isn’t just a sequel; it’s a meticulously crafted masterpiece that elevates every aspect of the series. Right from the beginning, you’re drawn into a story that feels like it's woven from the finest threads of Norse myth and human emotion. Every character, from Kratos to the supporting cast, has depth and complexity that keeps you invested throughout. It’s rare to see storytelling of this caliber in gaming – the kind that makes you care, that feels profound and rich with purpose.Visually, Ragnarok is a feast for the eyes. Each realm is meticulously crafted, bringing a variety of landscapes and atmospheres that feel distinct and full of life. The environments range from icy fjords to fiery pits, and each locale feels like its own unique world, brimming with detail. These environments are not just backdrops but are intricately connected to the narrative, making exploration feel purposeful and **** gameplay builds upon the foundations of the previous installment with a variety of new dynamics and fresh combat mechanics that keep the experience exciting. Every encounter and puzzle feels balanced, challenging you just enough to feel rewarding while constantly **** the end, God of War: Ragnarok stands tall as more than just a follow-up. It’s an unforgettable journey and a modern gaming classic – a testament to what happens when every piece ****, from the story to the visuals to the gameplay, is crafted with artistry and passion. A must-play for any fan of the genre and a defining moment for the medium itself.. Good game, last chapter was short and the final boss fight was a bit bad, left some unanswered questions. Epic fights were few. I love this game. I was able to play all of the series, and so far, they are doing great. I hope it will continue to be of the same quality.. Much like the first game, the other characters that aren't Kratos or the blacksmiths are pretty much forgettable or annoying. They hold this game back from being what could've been modern masterpieces. Both games had the potential to be timeless classics but instead are just good visual feasts that are gonna be forgotten through the years.. Kratos is soft, this is not the same game at all. They killed the real GOD OF WAR with the reboot. Its like days of our lives, pathetic drama. One of the most engaging games I've ever played. Great story, great combat mechanics, graphics and music!.. Never thought this would be better than the 2018 game but this is even better one.. its like the first one.. the onlybad think is that your friends when you have mysteries to be solved, they speak the answer from the first second.. if you except this, the game remains and look wonderful.. Fantastic sequel. Great story. Almost movie like . I have no real criticism towards this continuation. Hope we get another sometime.. Atreus is theonly problem. His parts are boring, fortunately, the parts with Kratos are good. Atreus and the others companion just spoil every puzzles in the game and it's really annoying.. As much as I’ve been enjoying the world and combat in God of War Ragnorok, the game’s narrative and level design is really starting to ruin the experience for me. It forcefully pushes you along from set piece to set piece without letting any of the big moments breathe and at the same time, those big moments don’t seem to have much impact at all. (compared to scenes I remember in GOW 2018 at least) Any attempt at exploration outside of the game's line of direction gets you yanked back by annoying flavourless dialogue telling you that you should probably be getting a move on now. If your gonna talk while I’m exploring at least make the dialogue worth listening to. On top of this, solving most of the puzzles seems to only get you nothing but a dry well done from your companions as they hastily continue to shove the solution down your throat every 5 seconds. I’ve had moments where puzzle hints still came up after solving the puzzle myself. I did not buy this game so I could feel like a child. Please let the game just be quiet, for 5 minutes. Why is Sony so scared of letting their players fail? Your characters do not need to fill every moment of silence. Not every item pick-up needs to be acknowledged. Not every action needs a quip attached to it. I’m just left feeling disappointed as God of War 2018 gave you plenty of moments to reflect on things said and actions taken in previous scenes, this game just throws Marvel-level quips in your face. It feels unfocused and diminishes all of its attempts at the emotional moments scattered across the story.. completely destroyed Kratos and the saga. Atreus is a soyboy and Kratos is soft af in this game. They really wanna kill men's testosterone nowadays lol. Gameplay is improved over the 2018 one with more enemy variety and a new weapon but is still held down by the ""cinematic"" approach, restrictive level design and over the shoulder camera. The new story is not as good as the previous game and suffers from terrible pacing, underwhelming antagonists, inconsistent character development, and an overall lack of direction.. This is not god of war **** like the previous chapter. The son of kratos is boring and annoying. Except for the graphics it is an empty game with few stupid riddles, few enemies and too easy. Give me the old Kratos back!!! face immense armies, fight Olympian gods, titans or hydra!!! This game is garbage it **** i asked for a refund never again a god of war game. they ruined the god of war again, what a shame,camera look like a last of us game, it was a little better than 2018 but ruined the legend god of war in a bad way. Very strong 8. A must play if you’re craving a AAA adventure filled with stunning scenery, beefy sound design, Hollywood level acting, and a thrilling time beating up monsters on a moderately challenging level. Pacing and flow is prioritized. I often use this game as a benchmark for what I think a fun action game should be. However, in an adventure I’m also looking for a story to remember, and to be emotionally invested. GOW makes the effort and is reaching for all that too, but the masculine power metal lyric energy just makes it impossible for me to embrace. I would’ve needed a straighter story focusing on some core philosophical question, but instead it’s mostly about the X magical purple portals, defeating Y inter dimensional beast guardians and of course gathering ye olde saving the planet army of best friends you met 9 minutes ago.. Full of bugs, it's a shame to release such an awful boring gameplay again and again, now with bugs even in the controls. Inverted A and B, as I've played in the previous game, and the majority of the interactions still require to press B, even if the game displays the text saying to press A. God bless this did not steal another game of the year.. So boring,especially you played BMW days ago. You have to knock some **** bells to open a treasure chest, it's a outmoded and frustrating game design. It's just wasting you time and life. ****!!!. Not as good as the previous one, probably due to SBI's involvement. Please stop working with those kinds of companies.. If you've played God of War 2018 then you've already played this game. Don't be surprised if you end the game feeling a bit disappointed with it. Gameplay and graphics hasn't changed much, but the plot is much worse. This is probably due to the new writers. And yes the Angrboda/sweet baby inc controversy is well deserved. A better way to add representation to the game would be to have a god from Egypt, Africa or Japan stalk Kratos around the game world through cut scenes, perhaps assisting him during a boss fight and then making a final appearance during the post credits to say that they need to bring him to their land for a mysterious purpose. The fact that I or other fans online could write better representation shows why the criticism is valid.. This review is not influenced by the PSN account requirement. Gameplay is excellent, and there is a healthy suite of visual and performance options. However, I found the story lacking (especially when compared to GoW2018), the character designs for a few of the new characters are hit or miss, but the most egregious offender was the extremely poor, somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I half expected Kratos to shout “Boy! Let’s hop in da sled and bounce out this joint!”, it’s that badly written. It really detracted from the experience, and I found it quite immersion breaking.. Horrible optimization on 6GB graphic card constant crashes with, Out of bound VRAM error. Great game, wish it would be longer for the story , it seems rush at the last 1/3 of the game.. gameplay wise, ragnarok is an undeniable step forward from its predecessor, where god of war already had an amazing gameplay system. This sequel, th",the story of the previous God of War game continues with a heart tugging narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat . a captivating story combined with the classic God of War combat makes this the game that keeps on giving . a clean experience with great visuals and voice acting .
760.NFL 2K2,Honestly I love these 2k sports games and NFL2k 2002 is no exeaption if you have the hardware needed to play this game and you love football like I do I highly recommend this title.,NFL2k 2002 is no exeaption if you have the hardware needed to play this game and you love football like I do I highly recommend this title .
761.Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns,"Great game, played it a lot. Mechanics are good, gameplay is good, Difficulty level is balanced. Perfect.. Fantastic game for it's time. It had the unique concept of companies rather than individual units which greatly reduced the combat micro allowing greater focus on battle strategy. This was complimented by a great economic model that got rid of the 'resource gatherer' and construction micro of Warcraft series, The biggest drawback to the game was the multi player match making which could not compete with Battlenet.","Mechanics are good, gameplay is good, Difficulty level is balanced. Perfect.. Fantastic game for it's time."
762.Animal Crossing,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Where it all started, Animal Crossing on GameCube is a great life sim. Although there are some flaws improved on in the later games, Animal Crossing on GameCube has it’s own unique content and charm. If you’re able to, give this game a try, preferably sooner than later. The In-Game clock only goes until 2030, so it’ll be hard to play it authentically past then.. Yeah, I know that a lot of people love this game, but it definitely could have been a lot better. The problem is that they were originally gonna get Francis Ford Coppola as the director for this game, but he was busy with the Godfather part III (which I've never seen), so he had to be replaced with some other guy instead. And the other guy clearly didn't understand how to make a good game, because this game is riddled with glitches and bizarre decisions. For example, there's this glitch where you will NEVER receive oranges unless you start with oranges or peaches. Stuff like that makes the game unplayable compared to modern games with microtransactions.. A fantastic life simulator experience that was far ahead of its time upon release. While it may not seem like it can offer much to the kind of player that seeks something more adrenaline-fuelled, Animal Crossing offers a deeply satisfying progression loop, tons of excitement and a cast of endlessly quirky and charming characters, such as the money-hungry Tom Nook, the neurotic and nitpicking Mr. Resetti, and the ineffably cool K.K. Slider. It is easy to see how this game inspired the numerous sequels that it did - while difficult to verbalize, Animal Crossing did so much in its original iteration. It oozes charm, and offers such a unique experience that few other games have managed to capture (beyond the other games in the series). All in all, an absolutely excellent video game with tons to offer.. A Gamecube classic that still has aged well. I recommend it to people of all ages and I promise you it will never get old.. An amazing title for the Nintendo GameCube. It's the best Animal Crossing game of all time.. I cannot express how amazing the original Animal Crossing for the Nintendo GameCube is. It's the definitive version of Animal Crossing, and will always be my favorite one. New Leaf, while a close round, doesn't have the same train feels as you get here. There's always something new here. The music is catchy and fun, along with amazing. 10/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i adore how unique this game is compared to the others. you can really feel the passion for this game oozing out of it. i love the much more aggressive and spontaneous villagers (because tbh new leaf's villagers have kinda wore off on me, as much as i love new leaf), i love the larger towns. i adore this game, probably as much as new leaf honestly.. It's too difficult to get bored of this game. Warning: you will be addicted to this game!. I was insulted by a low poly frog after I refused to get his glasses case from a low poly duck 11/10 Would recommend. Great game. But again, like every other review. It's 1 island per switch system! Which is ridiculous and player 2 literally cannot do anything on the island. Absolutely ridiculous if you ask me. TL:DR PURCHASED AN ENTIRE GAMECUBE, GBA, AND MANY REMOTES JUST FOR THIS GAME AND THOUGHT IT WAS A WORTHWHILE PURCHASE! Top of the line dialogue and characters. Buy it if you can for sure! Second best game I have ever played. Not as empty as City Folk or Wild World. The graphics are great considering it was originally an amazing looking N64 game. The NES games are great as house decorations. The soundtrack is spunky and out there. The dialogue is more funny, gritty, and realistic than any other installment. I have nothing but love for this game I have spent so much time on. Easily my favorite N64 and GameCube game. I didn't dislike any aspect of this game. Top notch cannibalism- best representation of Thanksgiving. Only time I've actually liked that holiday. The Sports Fairs were great and I also loved the Cherry Blossom Festival remixes. The black market was very good in this game along with the ability to get mugged. Really love the insults from villagers and frequent usage of the word ""ingrate"". Can't find some of this greatness anywhere else. Also the dirt looks like an onion for some reason. Sorry if this review sounds **** because I am very tired and up later than usual writing this. The pattern designing and typing aren't fun with an analog stick but I love everything else in this game. The island is great and this game is infinitely better with a good town name and layout.. I positively love this game! The game is relaxing and also entertaining. The only flaw that I could find are the villagers. Most of them are mean and can do annoying things. Besides that the game is phenomenal!. Still the best Animal Crossing. I know it lacks online play and all, but I feel that makes the whole game more personal. I enjoyed filling up museum and upgrading the house, as well as playing the NES games, especially during rainy days; I loved when it rained in both the game world and the real world. Too bad my save got corrupted a long time ago, but those memories will stay with me forever.. Addictive and fun. This game has cute graphics. I would recommend Animal Crossing. While it does get boring here and there but it is fun and cute. 11/10. This is my favorite game besides sonic adventure 2. The graphics look adorable and it has a charm that no animal crossing can never have. Not even new leaf. The game aged 100% well and probably the best aging game ever created. It's my favorite nintendo series and I recommend you buying it. You'll be addicted to animal crossing once you play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. How could you not give this game a good rating? It was so amazing and going back and looking at it again brings back so many memories of watching my brothers play. I do remember that there wasn't a bank and storages could only hold 3 items so my brother would leave his money on the floor of his house and I would secretly go in and steal it to pay off my house.. This game is good, has just as much charm and character of the other games, but there are things here that are quite monotonous that get fixed in the other games. This game is good, but It pales in comparison to city folk and new leaf. It's just hard to love as much as those games. And those close up graphics. Ewucguh, :(. Besides been the first life simulation other than the Sims that I have played. Animal Crossing was really enjoyable, the town you live in is really innocent, the towns people have emotions like actual people. The goal of the game is simple, the whole game is just trying to collect bugs, fish, fossils, and paintings that are all around your town. Things you collect go to the Museum first and anything you have left over goes to tom nook who runs a town shop. Tom nook is who gives your house upgrades and tools that you can use for cutting down trees, fishing and a net for bug catching. The game also has a lot of events that happen through out the year, also the real world and the in game time are both the same. They will have forth of July parties, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and any other holidays you can think off. The game has a lot to give, with more than one hundred hours of game play this game is worth a look at.. Animal Crossing seems to have gotten some controversy over not being the same old COD-styled nonsense that everyone seems to hail as the best game ever. I'm generalising a bit, but it's accurate than anything else. First up, the good: It's a welcome break, and it's a game that works to your own pace. There's enough to do, and more importantly, there is no end. You could play forever, getting you and your town into all kinds of entanglements and then getting them back out of it. Plus, it's the only game I know of for the 'cube that allows you to get stung by bees. Now, the bad. The Real Time Clock (RTC) is a bit of a pain in the bum, and the fact that it takes real time to do anything is annoying. Of course, you could time travel, and I don't mean the kind that the TARDIS does. However, that can really mess stuff up if you're not careful. If you're looking for a decent, casual game to break the monotony of the MMS games out there, then it might be worth your time searching for a second-hand copy of the game, or failing that, one of the other titles in the series.. Whether it was catching a rare fish, designing new clothes, digging up new fossils, or planting an orchard of foreign fruit, this game never ran out of things to do. Just don't take a long rendezvous from the game or *sob* all your old neighbors may move away, and you'll have a lot of weeds to pull. 8/10. A charming game for the GameCube, Animal Crossing offers addicting gameplay elements, a wonderful setting, and lovable characters to create a relaxing escape into a world where you are free to roam.. This game is very entertaining and very cute! Each time I play I feel the excitement I felt from the first time playing. One thing I don't like about the game is how they promote the Game Boy Advance and increased playing. The game is fun for everyone; even my mom wanted to play. The soundtrack is by far the coolest soundtrack I've ever heard on a video game. The characters are never boring so it's really just one of the most fun games I've ever played.. I was never disappointed by the game. It took a year of waiting for the DS version to come out to get old. The game thrust me into colorful characters, events, and randomness. It was an amazing experience and I love the customization. The newer games are great, but the originals are always the best as they introduce the true meaning of the series.. Must try. The cuteness, the NES games you can collect and play, the furniture, and the trading. Animal crossing kept me hooked for a solid 6 months back in '05. Great game. Fishing, planting trees, all becomes so addicting.. i bought this game in the advice of a friend who just raved how great the game was and we usally like the same games. this how ever was not one of them . the game is basically like the sims to a point except feels like it was made for a 5 year old. i even gave the game a chance and played it for about 15 hours . all i did was get more and more bored of what i was doing which wasnt much because ultimatley there isnt much to do in this game. i mean unless your idea of fun is collecting dinosaur bones , fish , butterflys, and doing delivery quests also collecting clothes and makin your house better looking . there is no fun gameplay at all . i wanted so bad to take that shovel and beat all the other anamals to death with it but it wouldnt let me >< . all i could do is send them threatening letters which i would only get a response to i couldnt understand your letter. i dont know whats hard to under stand when you tell them to ""go die you jerky **** head moose"" . the game is differnt ill give it that but its made for a very certain typ of person and i am not that person.. With a ton of variety and depth in gameplay, Animal Crossing is a life simulation phenomenon that some gamers are STILL playing. Pros: Addictive and seemingly limitless gameplay; rich, colorful visuals; variety of things to do and items to collect; charming characters; lots of extras/secrets; additional NES games. Cons: Requires a GBA, link cable, and at least one friend to uncover all extras/secrets; dull graphics.. Animal Crossing is a life simulation phenomenon -- and one the most addictive Gamecube titles to date. Pros: Unlimited amounts of gameplay and secrets; rich, colorful visuals; accessible NES titles. Cons: Multi-player and accessories are required to access a lot of the bonus features; unimpressive graphics and audio; too time consuming for selected gamers.. Animal Crossing is still one of the most unique and charming games of the past decade. The amount of things to do, the real-time aspect, the overall design and the great collection portion wraps into a very addicting package. The graphics may not be fantastic or anything, but it fits the atmosphere of the game and fits it very well. If you have not yet tried it out, I suggest doing so soon.. This was the game that made me want a Gamecube. I played it for quite a while (like, a few hundred hours over the course of two years), and even now occasionally play it a bit. No, there isn't a storyline, and yes, the graphics and sound are simplistic and weird, but I loved the quirkiness. Some people will, and others really will not. Either way, I actually have memories from this game: certain events and accomplishments, like when I paid off my house. A few things could be better, but it's sad to think that there really isn't anything new for it after a certain point. If there were something like episodes, or updates that varied the game ever so slightly every now and then, that would be amazing. The only negative, really, was that it ended. Sounds corny, but my opinion. Also, this game got me into ragtime music. lol. Honestly my husband was begging me to play and i always told him not yet or not now then suddenly one day i played and i figured out this game it's very real and exciting, you don't have any idea how much make me sit and play for hours.This is the GAME you need to play and share it with your kids. i give this game 10","Animal Crossing on GameCube has its own unique content and charm . the in-game clock only goes until 2030, so it'll be hard to play it authentically past then . the game is riddled with glitches and bizarre decisions that make it unplayable ."
763.Fight Night Round 4,"Very good boxing game. The best boxing video game that exists. Controls and physics are nearly perfect. Overall rating: 8.9.. FNRD4's additions were fine with me. Fun game, not a technical boxing game if that is what you are looking for.. This is one of the most addictive sports games ever, me and my mate where playing the demo for months before I actually picked the full game up and the legacy mode was amazing and made the game even more addictive beyond the satisfaction of knocking out your opponent. Boxer customisation is also fun with the ability to create stupid looking and absurdly named sluggers. Truth is I got rid of this game because I was skint and still miss it to this day as, when I owned it, the game was played on a regular basis. Overall this is the only boxing game I've ever really got into and I would recommend it to anyone, it looks good, plays fantastic and has a strong collection of fighters to choose from, however, this being an EA release some boxers where held back for DLC......... **** that!!!. I sometimes had a hard time throwing the uppercut when I wanted the **** that's really a small complaint for so good a game. Once I adjusted to the control I found it to be loads of fun...addictive.. What the heck happened?! After the on-line joy that was fight night 3 I was so psyched for this game, talk about a let down. The fact that the whole punch control stick flick setup was forced on us gamers before the patch was just absurd. I enjoyed the career mode but most of us play FN for the on-line challenge which is just gone now. They had a great control scheme in 3 but had to go and mess with it and it really shows this time around on-line. Not only is the game clunky to play but the interface is awkward as well. The blocking has been completely ruined with it's instant timing or no dice counter method. How this game took such a giant leap backwards is beyond me, a text book example of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" If you are looking for good on-line boxing FN3 is till the only game in town.. Truly an awful boxing game. When you come up against difficult opponents, it becomes a counter-punching spamfest. Almost every decent punch you throw gets blocked and then you get whacked. The game also runs at 200mph making it impossible to judge your own counters. It's an unrealistic, cartoon boxing game.. This is a boxing game for people that like Street Fighter, this is not a boxing game for fans of the Sweet Science. The problems here are far too numerous to mention, but I'll try: 1) Tedious, extremely difficult minigames. Nobody in the world wants to play these, and if you auto-play them, you only get 50% training effectiveness, severely limiting your progress throughout your career. They're boring, frustrating, and psychotically difficult. I have never actually gotten Champion once on a couple of them. 2) Bad movement and collision detection. A lot was made about this game having real physics but you'll be hard pressed to find them. Even the knockdowns are canned animations, each one appearing based on what position the fighter was when he was hit with the KO punch. 3) Cheating AI. Oh boy, this is a maddening one. The AI cheats on every level starting around Pro but becoming much, much worse as you get to Champion and especially Greatest of All Time (GOAT). The computer can take dozens of KO punches and stay on his feet, get up as many times as you can knock him down, has godlike statistics compared to yours, can easily knock you down with 1 punch (often no ""ringing blow"" stun punch beforehand), and has limitless stamina, health, and regeneration. With a created boxer with very high stats (I had painfully trained by repeating training via reset over and over) was on a 24-0 rampage with 24 KO's playing on Champion difficulty, I had no problem at all until I fought Tommy Morrison and I then lost to him 38 straight times (reset and retried again). Once I knocked him down 4 times in the 3rd round but he still came back the next round to knock me out. Did I mention my boxer was 6'8 260lbs with a humongous reach? Even sticking the jab and dancing wouldn't work, as the tactic of ""boxing"" simply doesn't work in Fight Night 4. Slugging is -always- the most effective. I eventually gave up in frustration and decided to retire both my boxer and the game. 4) Unrealistic AI behavior. I put the AI on Champion and GOAT and watched a bunch of classic fights to see how they played out (or would have played out). Dumb. Ridiculous. Toney over Jones in 60 seconds with a KO in the 1st. Ali over Tyson in 90 seconds with a KO in the first. I thought Ali/Tyson was a fluke so I watched it 3 more times, Ali KO'd Tyson in 1st 2nd and 1st again. Riiiiight. 5) Bad menus. It's absurd how many things you have to click through and navigate to do -anything- in FNR4. 6) Mind numbing, repetitive, totally useless commentary. They got the real ringside guys and only got 10 pre-recorded, totally canned lines for each one? And to make it worse, they use the wrong lines at the wrong times. I knocked down Ricky Hatton 3 times in 1 round and he stuns me once and next round they talk about how I got my bell rung. Right. The graphics are great, there's a lot of famous fighters to choose from, and on the surface the prospects look bright. Still, this is a total failure as a boxing game, it does the sport no justice whatsoever and rewards button mashing, body punch spamming, and stupidity. It **** in single player and it **** online. I regret pre-ordering and purchasing it. If you are totally ignorant to boxing, you might like it, but for a hardcore boxing fan it's all flash and no heart.","i got rid of this game because I was skint and still miss it to this day as, when I owned it, the game was played on regular basis . i was so psyched for this game, talk about a let down . not only is the game clunky to play but the interface is awkward ."
764.The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,"I finally recently played this after playing Phantom hourglass years ago, and this game is a huge upgrade. Although the stylus controls can still be a pain and the spirit tower area is very repetitive. This game still feels very original for a Zelda game atmosphere wise.. Very underrated game, i love the story and characters, the dungeons are creative, short but fun game. For the DS, the game is magnificent. The console's touch screen is a pleasure to use. But the game is not without its faults. First of all, Zelda. Or at least when she's on a spectrum. She's slow and stupid. The second is the Tower of the Gods, which was a good idea at the outset, but it soon becomes long and repetitive. It's a shame because I liked the concept of closing the seals. The third is the final boss, which is useless. No interesting backstory, nothing. Just a demon with no motivation apart from ruling the world. The last negative point is the shrines. It **** to have to make a melody that you'll never use and that's boring to reproduce, and to think that you'll have to do it five times (six if you count the final battle where you have to do it with Zelda). The game is otherwise very good, just a little disappointing.. This game is an improvement over Phantom Hourglass, but itis still ruined by the controls. At least in this game the dungeons are a lot more interesting and the music is awesome.. Really Good Puzzles, But still worse puzzles than spirit tracks, the train was good but worse than the boat, besides the music this game is just a slightly downgraded phantom hourglass. I LOVE this game, it Was my first Zelda game and it's one of my favourite games so far. Very solid Zelda game, did not expect such a big game on a ds and the controls were fine aswell, definitely better controls than Metroid Prime Hunters.. The sound track, the mechanics, the story all combine to make one of the best games in the franchise.. This game is a really great game, and a massive improvement on The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass in many ways. It has very good dungeon design, A great soundtrack, and one of the best stories in the Legend of Zelda series. That said, this game is held back by a few things. The biggest problem is the control scheme. It remains largely unchanged from Phantom Hourglass, and will likely hurt your hand. That said, while the control scheme takes some getting used to, the controls don't ruin the game at all. Spirit Tracks is a wonderful and unique Zelda experience that should not be overlooked if you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series.. My favorite nintendo game of all time. Every 6 months or so, I start up and 100% the game.. The follow up to The Phantom Hourglass follows the formula to the letter, but with trains instead of pirate **** some reason. It doesn't work quite as well for this very reason but it's still pretty good fun.. Focusing on what this Zelda title excels at, dungeons are clever and don't overstay their welcome, the visuals are vibrant and impressive for the system, the music is great, and the story is quite heartfelt and impactful. As far as the rest, mechanics could have been more creative, some quests feel uninspired, and I often felt discouraged by using my finger to control Link while lacking a stylus where I wish I could have just used the D-Pad/circle pad. Still a great title overall, just one that could have been better.. It was good, not the best I’ve played, however it was worth the money and time one the first playthrough, it had pretty good graphics for its time and it has good music, but unless you are a collector I wouldn’t get this, I would probably choose to play it on a Friends Console, if they let you of course.. While the new train mechanic may sound more restricting than a boat, it actually adds a sense of strategy to the adventure, which being a distant second sequel to ""The Wind Waker"", continues the younger-fan-focused handheld gameplay we've seen for years already, but with much better cutscenes and the welcomed twist of Zelda herself as a companion.. My first and favorite zelda game. I hated the game as a kid because I couldn't figure out how to beat it, but I came back a little later and completed it. I loved the puzzles in the Tower of Spirits with Phantom Zelda the most and I still come back and play the game for that section in particular. There is so much charm and creativity in the game. Will always be my number 1 zelda.. Jesus, this might **** even harder than Phantom Hourglass. There are some minor improvements here and there, like Link's walking speed and the improved cinematics and use of the dual screens. The Spirit Tower is obviously so much better and more fun then the Temple of the Ocean King and Zelda actually has a personality this time. But overall, it's really equally as tedious and annoying as PH or even more so. You're still forced to use the dumbass touch controls, even though they do literally nothing better than button controls, which is especialy infuriating in the heat of a (boss) battle. Riding the train is EVEN WORSE than than the boat in PH because while you're still just drawing your route and tapping on stuff you need to shoot while you're on your way, you now also have to avoid bad trains coming your way and if you touch them JUST ONCE it's GAME OVER. What kind of moron thought that this was fun? Oh, and did I mention that the train moves PAINFULLY slow and you cannot upgrade it to go faster? So, you're forced to pay attention to a mind-numbingly boring activity because otherwise, you might die and have to do it all over again. Fun times. The cherry on top of the **** is playing the Spirit Flute. Seldom have I seen such an asinine mechanic in a video game. Whoever thought that this was a good idea hopefully lost their job a loooong time ago. Even going beyond that, there is just way too much dumb microphone-blowing going on, for item-use, for dialogue... We get it, Nintendo, the DS has a mic. Good for you. Doesn't mean that over-utilizing it results in a fun experience. Overall, one of the worst Zelda games in existence, together with PH.. This game is an improvement of Phantom Hourglass by my opinion. The story, the overworld and the dungeons are great. It's a very fun little adventure in the Nintendo DS and one of the best games in the console.. I love all Zelda games but this game is one of my least favorites. I didn't like traveling on rails. Because it takes too long to go from one place to another and new warps are not opened without the passenger quest. Likewise, 'Zelda with the phantom armor' takes a lot of time to manage. Some dungeons are boring. Some puzzles are weird. The story and characters didn't really interest me. Even though the phantom hourglass was weak as a dungeon, it was more fun to go by boat. Most of the time, when I want to go somewhere, another train comes in front of me and I have to deal with it. Anyway. A nice DS Zelda game. Some people's favourite. This is the best feature of Zelda games. Every game has a fan.. This was one of the most fun games to have zelda with a companion from the link during her journey. Great game. Very underrated and the music is phenomenal. Great final boss too.. I hated Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks shares almost all of it's same flaws and annoyances. It's just a slightly more polished piece of stool. Just like Phantom Hourglass, the amount of annoyance and frustration I felt far out weighed the amount of enjoyment I got from this game. The Spirit Tower is in some ways worse than the Temple of the Ocean King because the later floors are huge and very intensive. And the stupid flute, I'm not trying to give myself a headache or get spit all over my 3DS. It's like they decided to force themselves to use all these features on the DS regardless of whether it enhances the game or not. This game was just a slog to get through, don't play it unless you're doing it for completions sake.. Generic medieval music in Zelda?! The graphics might be good for DS and the overwold maps huge also for this system but the frames drop around 10 FPS if not lower when there are 2 or more ennemies on the screen on the overworld. The gameplay would feel good though...except the freakin' flute ruins it all. Not matter how you play, it never seems to register. After a while of doing exactly the same thing, the game decides that thing you did that wasn't good enough suddenly is. Basically, you need to quickly play your partition in rythm. No DS or 3DS mic is good enough to ask the level of precision they're asking. Sometimes, I just blow in the mic but it registers as puffs. Easily my least favourite Zelda game because of that dang flute alone. The train is also kind of dumb. Early in the game, the tracks disapear. The characters need to reach a destination NO MATTER WHAT. But there aren't any tracks! How could they possibly ever get there?! Idk, what about....WALKING?| Crazy idea, I know, right? It's not like other incarnations of the Hero ever did that. I LOVED Phantom Hourglass, to death! But Spirit ****. I tried to love, even only like this game since I'm a huge Zelda fan, but this one, I cannot recommend. It's mechanics are both dumb and broken. The cutscenes were really nice though, I gotta give it credit for that. Felt like watching anime with DS graphics. But that's it, nicely animated cutscenes and (I know I ranted about the generic medieval music, and yes, that IS lame) but there are also pretty good tunes in there also. Overall, a poorly executed idea. I get what they were going for, but it just doesn't work very well.. Now this is not a game for me. Still take my opinion on this game with a grain of salt.. This game has a lot of good and bad things. This game uses the features of the Nintendo DS in a very creative and fun way, which is this game's main appeal, but other than that this game's travel is quite annoying and really slow, you also have to revisit the same dungeon after every single other dungeon, and with the travel being so slow and annoying it can make you get annoyed with this game, not to mention the fact that there are only 5 main dungeons, which are all incredibly simple and easy to get through, however it is mainly the travel that really hurts this game.. The game receives the lowest score I can grade a game. It left such a sour taste in my mouth, so lets get it al out right now. Lets start with the gameplay. Its rubbish. The dungeons are really easy and controlling link through the stylist is just akward. But ehat ruined the game is the godamn flute mechanic. Never have I experienced something so utterly stupid. Who testet this?! It just broke the game for me. Ultimy I quit the game at the fire temple and used the pc version to get past the flute sections because it just didnt work on my 3ds. Garbage!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good game overall. But many of the side quests are boring and similiar. And the oundtrack is spectacular. 9/10. The game was really fun, and in my opinion, a good improvement in comparison to phantom hourglass. The music was just perfect, specially the train theme. The puzzles were really challenging, but what I appreciated the most were the characters, one character in particular had a really cool arc, and the fact that Zelda is not just a useless pretty face is so good, she's not just an objective, or a price, she's your companion and actually helps you a lot, how cool is that? Aside from that, the flute was really frustrating. Not a perfect Zelda game, but a really good one, definitely.. Similar to Phantom Hourglass, but with this weird train system. Makes getting from point A to point B pretty tedious. Why is there no proper fast travel? The dungeons are mostly good, but the dark dungeons and the stealth part is pretty annoying. The controls overall kinda ****. Movement is only possible by tapping, not with the D-pad. The phantom controls are horrible and prone to miss-tapping. Fast-switching between items/weapons is not possible. It all makes the game more challenging than it actually would be. Also, there's a big dungeon tower that you need to revisit couple of times in the game where everytime, the game makes to climb more and more strairs instead of a quick travel to the dungeon entrances. Fun! Towards the end it gets worse, and the final boss requires you to have perfect timing with those fuzzy controls instead of some witty puzzle to defeat him. And if you die even once, the game makes you replay the whole final boss battle with its 4-5 stages from the beginning. Even more fun! The story is better than in Phantom Hourglass and having Zelda as a character you actually talk and interact with (and she even helps in the dungeons!) is way better than her usual 'damsel in distress' role, but other than that, the story is your usual 'defeat the villian who is evil for no real reason' thing. Also, in you ever take a break from the game and decide to continue it afterwards, it's quite hard to get into the game again. There is no encyclopedia or similar where the game mechanics, weapon effects, defeated enemy types, etc. are described. Similarly, the world map has only very basic hints on whats on the map. The game instead makes you take notes directly on the map. Good luck with figuring out what your notes meant after half a year. A simple green mark next to the already visited locations would have been great. So your best bet is just to grab a guide, or starting over. I don't like this. Despite quite the criticism, overall, it's still not a bad game per se, and if you enjoyed Phantom Hourglass, you will enjoy this one and (most of its) dungeons too. But keep in mind that the game lacks fast travel, has meh-ish controls, that the train travel isn't great and towards the end, there are couple of frustrating moments. Not a game that I can recommend. Phantom Hourglass was overall a better experience.. I know its kinda unfair for me to rate this game since i played it with an emulator on a mobile phone so i don't have problems with the controls and spirit flute. But even if i'm playing this game on the DS and the spirit flute annoys me a lot, i say its still an amazing game and worth the time and struggle. Honestly one of the best games I've played sometimes the spirit flute is glitchy but other then that being able to play it again is super enjoyable would play it a million times over great story and over all nice game. Music: 5/5 Game Play: 4/5 Graphics: 4/5 Story: 4/5 Time-Value: 4/5 Overall:4/5. The game is a piece of art! I totally loved it! However... sometimes my hands ached. You can't spend a lot of time in a row playing old 3DS with a stick. However, the game was totally worth it :). Best portable Zelda ever made. The soundtrack is better than Ocarina, the panflute is amazing.. Great dungeons, very linear story and HORRIBLE FLUTE game mechanics, it simply doesn't work. It killed whole joy of gemaplay. In the end 10 points for dungeons and minus 9 points for flute.. After the disgrace **** known as Phantom Hourglass, this great game arrives at the station. This game improved upon everything Phantom Hourglass did. Pros: + Controls: WAY better than PH's. This was the game that mastered touch screen controls. + Dungeons: Really cool dungeon design honestly. + Items: While it's not the largest variety, it still has really fun to use items like the Sand Rod. + Soundtrack: Riding the train around Hyrule has to have my favorite Hyrule Field theme, if you can consider it Hyrule Field. + Trains: Honestly, while trains shouldn't be in Zelda at all, they were pretty good in this game. Cons: - Final Boss: Portal time! Honestly, that brings the final boss down in my eyes. - Zelda: She's extremely annoying in this game, worse than Navi. - Rabbits: ...Really tedious fetch quest. Overall, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is a really great game and warrants an 8.5/10 from me.. The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is easily still one of my most favourite games to play, despite it being almost 8 years old. The entire game itself is simplistic but still makes you think enough for it to be classed as a puzzle game. The storyline isn’t entirely a prominent feature it’s more just woven through everything else to progress certain parts without it not making sense, it is however still a good storyline for those who enjoy a good plot. The story begins in Link’s home village whilst he’s being told the story of why the spirit tracks actually exist, this obviously sets up the base for the whole game or else nothing would make sense. It quickly begins the tutorial of how to use controls by weaving it into the story instead of just simply stating what to use for what, it’s more immersing using the story as a way of teaching controls. It soon begins the real story when Link has to make his way to Hyrule Castle by train to see the Princess and gain his engineer’s certificate, again the train journey mainly being used as a way to teach the train controls rather than being anything else important. A lot of cutscenes later the first ‘real’ playing begins when Link has to help Princess Zelda escape so that she can investigate why some of the tracks are mysteriously disappearing, this of course eventually leads to the typical “something bad happens to the princess and she needs saving by the hero himself, Link”. After the story is set up for the princess needing to be saved the real and true story begins filled with travelling, puzzles and enemies of all shapes and sizes. One of the best features, personally, is the use of the spirit flute for puzzles and shortcuts since it’s a new feature for spirit tracks which adds to everything else. The graphics are interesting since it’s much more basic compared to the other games and it’s played more on a 2D basis since you use the stylus to tap and walk around whereas in a game like Ocarina of Time you use the control pad to walk and look around, however I think that it makes it much easier to navigate and fight since you have more control using the stylus, therefore the overall game experience becomes better as you spend less time grasping the controls. If you were a fan of Phantom Hourglass you may find yourself a big fan of Spirit Tracks too since they are very similar in style, just you drive a train rather than a boat.. I had many problems with phantom hourglass, but most of them have been fixed in this DS sequel: the touch screen controls are now more responsive (although a real pain during the final boss) and the main dungeon (the spirit tower) that you will be returning to during the whole game is much better in Spirit tracks than in Phantom hourglass. The fact that Zelda can control the phantoms adds fun gameplay, and Zelda's important role throughout the game makes the story pretty interesting. Driving the spirit train is pleasant, mainly thanks to an amazing overworked theme. Although the game may be linear at times, I don't actually care: excluding Breath of the Wild and the original Zelda for NES every Zelda game is pretty straightforward. The spirit tower and sand temple are some of the best dungeons on a handheld Zelda game: the rest of the dungeons are nothing special though. The boss fights are okay, and the addition of new items such as the sand wand make the game very fun. The best part of this game is undoubtedly the customisable pieces for the spirit train. The game has a very slow start however and getting from one place to the other is sometimes very time-comusing. the touch screen controls although improved are still unresponsive and make link roll instead of attack several times. This game is definitely flawed but its still a good game. If you own a DS and want to play Zelda, get this one it outclasses Phantom Hourglass.. In 2007 Nintendo released Phantom Hourglass. Most of the people liked it, and a bunch of people hated it. But I think everyone will agree that it wasn’t precisely a stellar Zelda game. So when Nintendo announced Spirit Tracks, a direct sequel with the same gameplay style, the hype was relatively small. Another Phantom Hourglass, but with a train instead of a ship? I totally understand people who didn’t give a **** about this game. But when the game came out, it turned out that it was actually a fantastic Zelda title that surpassed Phantom Hourglass in every aspect by far. Today, it still stands as one of the most unfairly underappreciated Zelda games. Spirit Tracks has everything you would expect from a great Zelda game. The overworld is way better than Phantom Hourglass’. It is big, charming ,varied and full of interesting locations to discover. It also feels more lively and believable than PH’s. The villages are all lovely. The story is much better and engaging, with cool characters like Byrne and some pretty good villains, as well as some epic and memorable moments here and there. The dungeons are far superior to those in PH, now offering a bit more of a challenge, as well as a better aesthetic design. The bosses are great too. As in any good Zelda game, there is a great deal of side activities to do, like helping other people with their requests, catching the bunnies, a really cool minigame where you have to fight rounds of enemies and finally bosses, and even a secret dungeon. A whole secret dungeon!!! How awesome is that? Speaking of dungeons, this game also has a master dungeon similar to the Temple of the Ocean King in PH, and it is the Tower of Spirits. Needless to say, it is much better designed and way more entertaining than its predecessor. Being able to control a Phantom in the Tower of Spirits is a really nice gameplay mechanic, and I think it was well carried out overall. People like to speak **** of this game’s train travelling mechanic. Ok, the train is a bit slow. But I don’t know, I never had an issue with this. Travelling through the world with the train is a nice experience to me, as it managed to immerse me into the game’s world even more. And it’s not like you spend all the time travelling either. The soundtrack completely humiliates PH’s pathetic excuse for a soundtrack, and it is clearly among the best Zelda soundtracks of all time. Listen to the Overworld Theme, and you’ll get a grasp of the quality level of this OST. Definitely one of the best aspects of the game. On the matter of music, Spirit Tracks introduces the Flute, which is kind of nice, but can get a little frustrating in some parts. Like, when I played it for the first time, I got stuck for hours on the final boss because I couldn’t perform the flute song correctly. Maybe I was being a stupid kid, because I did it on the first try on my second playthrough, so I don’t know. The flute songs might bother some people. Can you think of any other aspect that defines a great Zelda game? Well, if you can, it’s probably present in Spirit Tracks too. 6 years after playing it for the first time, it’s still my favorite game in the DS’ library, as well as my favorite handheld Zelda title. Score: 9.3. This is the first and still only Zelda game, I didn't finish. I was simply too bored to continue. I didn't like the villain Malladus at all. He was like a bad cartoon character. The concept with the trains was fun at first but in the long run too limiting and slow. I liked Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, so the graphics and gameplay were absolutely alright. But all in all it was the biggest disappointment in the franchise to me.. The reason why I loved this game was because this was my first Zelda game ever! I played it since I was 7 and I had been making theories about what did the Tower of Spirits look like before Zelda was basically killed. It also had one of the best music and I almost thought of a new Zelda game that takes place after the story that is called The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks X Phantom Hourglass since I also love that game.. The only main problem with this game is that this game is strange and out of place. Overall this game has great gameplay, good controls, and you can play on the go!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is the scum of the Zelda franchise. You can only get enjoyment out of this if you love torturing yourself, or if you don't know what a Zelda game is all about. This game is an instant turn off to the series if you have never played a Zelda game before. I recommend a good game before you tread into the evil that is Spirit Tracks So finally, without anymore banter, I will tell you what **** about this game. -=-=Travel=-=- The travel in this game is the most boring aspect. The train is very limited, its not like roaming freely around a vast area, its more linear than anything I have ever seen. -=-=Controls=-=- This is more of a personal gripe. If you have ever played a normal Zelda game (other than the overrated n64 titles) you will know that the controls of a Zelda game feel real freaking good. The stylus controls just cant do it justice in anyway shape or form. Again just a personal gripe. -=-=Adds Nothing=-=- This game adds nothing new or good to the series. Its like a phantom hourglass ripoff... with trains(づ￣ ³￣)づ This game seems like it could be a Chinese bootleg or something with the amount of unoriginality that is being spewed at your face while playing this. That is all of my ranting, I hope I could open the eyes of all these reviews that said it was good. Good day, and good night. This game in a ""Deku"" nutshell is good. There isn't much that stands out as amazing and there isn't much that is bad either. The towns in this game are fun but they aren't very big with only the dungeons being of any large size for this game. However there are lots of towns/villages with many stations to find on other tracks. The side quests in this game are fun and numerous and they unlock more of the spirit tracks that you have to travel along to reach destinations which allows for faster travel across the lands and adds some tracks that reveal new stations that have things like mini games or treasure on them. I also love the train customization as there is a few choices and all of them are different but you have to collect treasure to build them which is a problem as some are very difficult to find. If it had been done like Phantom Hourglass I would have liked it more but I understand that some people didn't like the way it was done in that game. The bosses are all cool and unique and some can be challenging like the Sand Temple's boss. The problem is that none of these are super unique and everything is done to a good standard. This doesn't mean that it is a bad game but compared to other Zelda titles like Ocarina of Time and A Link to the past it doesn't stand out. Thanks for reading my review.. This was my first experience with Zelda on a handheld console, and I got it Christmas morning. Didn't put the DS down for hours. Great story, great enemies, and great bosses. My only pet peeve is the use of the microphone in the game which can be hard and touchy. Nintendo should remake this game for 3DS with an extended storyline and DLC.. To get my main complaints out of the way, traversing the overworld is boring and uneventful. You eventually activate Stargate-looking warps but they each take you to one specific spot! It's bad enough that you can't warp from anywhere like in Wind Waker, but once you enter a warp you can't even choose which warp to go to from there! And completionists will have a problem because you have to collect treasures to buy all the train parts, but you have to rely and randomly getting the right treasures from the environment. You have to grind by leaving and reentering areas over and over again hoping you'll get the right stuff. But enough complaining. You're a Zelda fan: if you can get over the train segments then you'll like this game. And interestingly, I think Zelda plays a larger part in this game than any other Zelda title, because the titular princess is now your very own sidekick! This lets you get a better impression of who she is as a character, which I liked. And Spirit Tracks also has the coolest instrument of any Zelda game in my opinion, because blowing into the microphone gives the impression that you are actually playing it! Reasons to skip this game: - If you don't like Toon Link or Zelda in general - If you're a compulsive completionist and can't stand to have missing items - The overworld is slow and boring to traverse - There's not a lot that's different about this installment in the series Key differences between this and Phantom Hourglass: - Because of the titular tracks, Spirit Tracks gives you even less control in the overworld navigation - Spirit Tracks is more detached from the Wind Waker storyline - Spirit Tracks gives you a cool instrument to play like in other Zelda games - The recurring dungeon in Spirit Tracks has no time limit, and doesn't require you to redo sections. This is a great game that is definitely underrated by most. Yes, the graphics are cartoonish, and the train ride is a bit long, but there are some sweet puzzles in the game. Definitely a must play for any Zelda fan.. This game gets too much hate. It is a huge improvement over Phantom Hourglass, with better dungeons, music, gameplay, story and boss battles. Traveling is also much better than before, some people might think it's tedious, but at least it adds some variety unalike in Phantom Hourglass where absolutely nothing happens.. I didn't like this game as much as I thought it would. The game is very constricted due to the train mechanic, and there isn't much to explore. The characters and story were also pretty bad and even annoying. However, I think the dungeons and bosses were very well made, and the flute was pretty interesting, albeit difficult to control.. Phantom Hourglass was a good game and it was a lot of fun, but it had lots of little problems that irritated a lot of people. Spirit tracks fixed lots of those problems such as the very boring over world, and the train to me just seemed more fun than the boat. It is much more detailed than Phantom hourglass in just about every way. Its main dungeon the tower of spirits is more interesting than the temple of the ocean king because you can control a phantom. It has less dungeons than most zelda games but a lot of side quests some of which are quite fun! I cant think of many things that this game did wrong, i can only think of things that would have made it better. Spirit tracks is one of the best games on the ds and a great entry in the legend of zelda series.. A wonderful addition to the DS and LoZ library of games. The touch control similar to that of Phantom Hourglass is greatly designed, although I would've preferred D-Pad **** does take all the capabilities of the ds and uses them well. Although some puzzles and the story may be a bit dumbed down, it's definitely a fun game that's worth your cash! The multiplayer is addicting as **** the ability to have single card download play is a great addition to this game Gameplay: 9/10 Story: 8/10 Music: 8/10 Presentation: 8.5/10 Length: 8/10 Overall: 8/10. Spirit Tracks is the standard zelda- dungeon structure, items, bosses, puzzles. Though it doesn't innovate as much as it should, it's a solid adventure. Link must, as usual, take on some terrible evil, rescue someone, and save the land of Hyrule. To do this, he must traverse dungeons, fight enemies, solve puzzles, and explore Hyrule. This is the ordinary zelda we have known for years. I won't talk about the structure of a zelda game, or any of that, because you know it already. Instead, the differences. The graphics are good but not great- scenery is especially flat, but dungeons look good. The music is often great, woth a lovely overworld theme, though I wasn't keen on the dungeon music. Spirit Tracks has an unusual control scheme ehich using the stylus for everything, like Phantom Hourglass. While this sounds cumbersome, in reality it opens up new possi","i finally recently played this game after playing Phantom hourglass years ago . although the stylus controls can still be a pain, the spirit tower area is very repetitive . for the ds, the game is magnificent, and the touch screen is a pleasure to use ."
765.Raw Data,"IMHO, the only thing that makes Raw Data a game worth playing is it's melee character - telecinetic cyborg-ninja that is basically just a jedi. I'm still waiting for someone to do a full game around lightsaber swordplay and jedi powers and Raw Data is the closest thing I've found so far. The rest of the game is kinda mediocre - it is a lot like a Robo Recall but worse in every aspect. The missions are probably the weakest part - all campaign levels after the first one are basically the same: defend core against waves of enemies. It is not very exciting to defend something in an action game and especially annoying for solo melee character. Well, at least they are not an escort missions, I guess)",i'm still waiting for someone to do a full game around lightsaber swordplay and jedi powers . the rest of the game is kinda mediocre - it is a lot like a Robo Recall but worse in every aspect . the missions are probably the weakest part - all campaign levels after the first one are basically the same: defend core against waves of enemies .
