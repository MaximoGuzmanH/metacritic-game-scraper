247.Forza Motorsport 4,"Because this game relied so heavily on its multiplayer community, I can't say this game has aged as well as everyone else thinks it has. Sure, it has a lot to do, and a whole lot of quality content to experience BUT, the A.I. is weak compared to modern games so you will eventually get bored. The graphics have aged.... alright but nothing to write home about. What makes this game stand out, is the sheer number of cars and tracks, Jeremy Clarkson, and hours of things to do.. The best Forza Motorsport has ever been, before and since. 2023’s Forza Motorsport pales in comparison.. This might be the best racing game of all time FOR it's time period. It gets hard to pin some of these above others. The sounds, the aesthetic(with Jeremy Clarkson), the progression, the visuals, cockpit view was unmatched, the handling. Fujimi Kaido. This game made me good at drifting in virtually EVERY other racing game, or reduced the learning curve. It also helped me memorize Sebring for track days. Thousands of hours spent online drag racing the Sebring straight. *Chefs kiss*. Best simulator racing game of all time! Simple as that, a must play for all enthusiasts of cars, 10/10. This is best Forza game IMO , for it´s time it had amazing graphics, great controls, killer selection of cars, tracks and modes. My favorite racing title ever.. They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. Another sequel to the Gran Turismo wannabe with the requisite additional cars and tracks. Otherwise virtually identical to the previous game but with the addition of ""Top Gear"" challenges, if that floats your particular boat.. Gran turismo fans can **** off, this game is god, make this the second most rated user score game on metacritic #JUSTICEFORFM4. Flawless. This game looks like it belongs on Xbox One, and whats more the one and only JEREMY CLARKSON narrates!. This game is a masterpiece, it not being in the top 100 user rated racing games is criminal. This is simply the peak of the franchise. Enough said.. Best Racing Game on X360? YEP One of Most fun racing games ever? YEP OG Top Gear? YEP. Pinnacle of forza motorsport. Huge selection of cars including dlcs, very good gameplay, good career progression, nice graphics, good customisation, and litterally jeremy clarkson talking about cars in the forzavista. I wouldnt want more, except for better graphics.. That was something... something really dominating at a time, huge respect from me to this game. Best driving game of last generation and in my opinion better than the Gran Turismo games when playing with a controller.. This game is the pinnicle of the Forza franchise. The cars feel amusing to drive, the career is unique and covers all areas of car culture, every car has absurd detail, the sounds are absolutely phenomenal, and there’s multiple ways to play it. Easily a top 5 best racer of all time, no debate.. The best racing simulator game I've played so far. The feeling of driving a car is fantastic, and the customization is great. I love the rewind option, you always have a second chance when you are about to crash instead of having to restart the entire race from the beginning. The cars look great, there's a lot of detail to them, and it's worth to mention that the graphics are ahead of their time, this game looks phenomenal! The only downside to it is that it can get monotonous after a while because it's focused on being a simulator and it doesn't have many arcade aspects. I have to say though, this was my first racing simulator and I really enjoyed it, so that's an achievement in itself. Final Rating: ""Great"" - 8/10.. This game had Kinect feature which I didn’t use but did like the car intros by Jeremy Clarkson. Spent hours on this game and loved it.. The best racing simulator game I've played so far, the feeling of driving a car is fantastic, and the customization is great. I love the rewind option, you always have a second chance when you are about to crash, instead of restarting the whole race from the beginning. The cars look great, there's a lot of detail to them, and not to mention that the graphics are ahead of their time, this game looks phenomenal!. This is the best Forza game out there, even after the release of Motorsport 7 and Horizon 4. Took what the 3rd game had and improved upon it and then some. This is peak Forza. Sorry Polyphony, you screwed badly when you released GT5. Too bad the next game was a disappointment though.. The gameplay and graphics still hold up in 2020! You can pick these games up for stupid cheap as well. I’m giving this a 9 as it’s not backwards compatible. Great game nonetheless.. The game is great, steering feels good, nice car sounds, even better career mode. One thing I dont like is that last part of career mode (League of Legends part) its like the previous part, same tracks, same cars, they should make it shorter but that not that disgusting. Overall great game.. As one would expect Forza Motor Sport 4 features an almost endless selection of tracks and cars (all of which can be fully customised) with which to play and, unlike the rather dull Gran Turismo, the vehicles can actually be damaged. There is also a decent selection of race types to mix things up although the lack of different weather types and off track events, such as rally driving, is a bit of a disappointment. Hopefully these issues will be sorted for the next installment but this is still the best racing sim available.. This is the game that truly got me into gaming. I may be a bit biased, but this is my all time favorite racing game.. A decent step up from Forza 3. Otherwise nothing particularly special. Still a solid game.. The good: Debuts the Autovista option (which in the future would be known as Forza Vista) in which cars from all angles are observed and there are data and a brief explanation in addition to challenges. All cars have a cabin view. Many events to play both in season mode and once finished with the ""blackboard"" of events that returns from Forza Motorsport 3. New tracks like Bernese Alps. Here begins the support and collaboration between Forza, Turn 10 and Top Gear. The song of the beginning of Alex Metric “It’s Start” shudders at your skin. The sales showcase works great. The tuning and car customization system is refined in this game so that it has been the basis for subsequent deliveries. The ease of uploading .png and .bmp files to improve the vinyls created from here the best community of content creators for cars (in FM3 it made the leap but this is where that was refined). It includes a Porsche expansion with more events and cars that extend the board further. Kinect compatible to drive by extending your hands as a steering wheel, fun and fair. In this game came the exhibitions of overflows of cars and chase down the road (replacing Super Laps Days). also here sponsored by Top Gear we watched the first matches of Futbool / Soccer Car (laugh at Rocket League) The bad: The track of New York (old and new layout), iconic of this saga, was lost. The best cars and updates arrived in DLCs. There is a DLC of the FM3 that includes new cars but that mistakenly confuses thinking that it is a patch to level FM4, but it is not. Except for the intro song and some other tunes that were removed with patches, there is no licensed soundtrack. Unfortunately it is not Backward compatible with Xbox One. Lo Meh: This game of Turn 10 spent a lot of money to try to attract and gain the trust of video game analysis writers and the most staunch players in Japan and Spain including their most iconic clues taken to the Forza saga (Ladera Test Track, Road old to Monserrat, Valencia GP for Spain and Susuka, Tsukuba, Twing Ring Motegi, Fujimori Kaido (full rise and fall for Japan), but these people turned their backs on them and spit in their faces scoring it very badly and supporting Gran Turismo, although from here Forza would definitely take off from the shadow of the Sony game. If I was to describe this game in one phrase it would be “ahead of its time” forza Motorsport 4 for the Xbox 360 is an incredible racing experience. With graphics that still hold up today, immersive gameplay, and a great career mode, this is one of the best games I’ve ever played.. Forza Motorsports 4 is a great racing game, but it could've used a little more track variety.. I would definitely give this a 11 out of 10. The devs worked hard on this game, a lot of track and cars to choose with, a must have for the xbox 360. Even though Gran Turismo 5 and 6 have more cars, I still like this forza and the greatest forza ever made.. Excellent simulator, with a very impressive realism for the xbox 360, and have a lot of content, although it is true there are dlc`s for forza 4, but that does not ruin the good experience that can be carried with this work. Game very beautiful, an absurd variety of cars. But there's a few details that I can not pass up. as when we go into a tunnel and the car does not turn on and everything is dark. It has many parts that the game is much clearer and other very dark side. More taking this game is perfect!. After playing Forza Motorsport 5 and coming back to this in 2016, I have to say I'm very impressed. Even though I got the essentials edition (with only 320 cars instead of the 500+) this is crazy value for money in an age of microtransactions, season passes and DLC. It's not just the number of cars, but the range of them in terms of performance and variety. What makes Forza so great is its ability to represent car culture and history from various regions. Forza 4 is by far the most representative game of the Forza Motorsport series, with the most and arguably best content. It has exciting modes such as Autocross (from Project Gotham Racing), Bowling, head-to-head races amongst traffic, multi-division races amongst others as well as including a plethora of events aimed at specific manufacturers, body styles, performance categories, regions, classic rivalries and more in 26 locations around the world. For a circuit-racing simulation, this is a game with endless content thanks not only to the number of cars, tracks and career events but also to Rivals mode; which provide a variety of challenges with varying restrictions on the vehicles for those that enjoy climbing leaderboards. It's not only the amount and variety of content either, but also everything else that matters in a game like this. Visually, I dare say that despite running on ancient hardware, it still manages to look gorgeous at 1080p 60 FPS with great car models both inside and out. 1080p60 is something even modern console struggle with, so to be able to pull it off so late into the Xbox 360's lifecycle and still look modern. The interior views are a huge step up from Forza Motorsport 3, as are the exteriors from the embarrassingly cartoon-like Forza Motorsport 2. Every car has really accurate interior to a decent level of detail. Further still, there are some cars that get their own special tour in Autovista, allowing you to fully examine the car from every angle and learn more about it through commentaries. The customisation is as strong as ever, allowing you to create the wildest of designs. Performance modifications are very flexible too, with options to upgrade and also tune every aspect of any car as before. Forza is a game all about the appreciation of cars, and offers you limitless ways to make a car your own be it through performance or livery modifications. And of course there's the Top Gear track, along with some commentary by Clarkson which adds instant appeal, at least for me. The inclusion of the auction house is also noteworthy - something that was very exciting in Forza 2 to try and do up cars and sell them because of their performance or artwork - something which is missing from the latest entries. However, it is difficult to recommend the game now due to it being ""end-of-lifed"". You can't get the free DLC cars that were included on disc 2 anymore, but even still with the amount of cars and tracks already included in the game, there's plenty of offline content. It would take one hundreds of hours to see and do everything. So far this is the definitive Forza game in terms of content, quality and innovative features added from the previous title. It also has the best soundtrack. Combine all of that with the faultless driving mechanics, general gameplay, the straightforward money and XP system, and you have what is unquestionably the greatest car game of the generation.. This is a great game . Very many different real car . Many Ford , Many Mazda , Many Honda and other . Very good graphics and amazing gameplay . Best Xbox 360 Racing Game and best Xbox 360 Exclusive with Halo 4 , Gears of War 2 and Forza Horizon 2 . Excellent . Poor Nine of Ten . 9/10 .. Improving what seemed unbeatable, lighting is the best ever seen on Xbox 360. The sense of speed is perfect. And the level that reaches the community drawing cars leaves a beautiful gallery. Definitely the best racing game of this generation.. The game is just amazing. I love play this game. For me this game is amazing ! Nothing more to comment because this game is amazing ! I rate this 10/10. I wasn't that enthusiastic about track racing games. I used to be more interested in free roam racing games such as Need for Speed and Midnight Club, but Forza 4 is a masterpiece and I have put so much time into it and yet, I still have not finished the career mode. I really like track racing games now because of Forza 4.. Just bought Forza Motorsport 4 for Xbox 360 as a second hand buy - the graphics are pretty smooth and I love the BBC Top Gear intro accent! Groovy English. I got all excited by the Ferrari test drive to start the game, but was bombed to see that my first car was a **** Ford. Now I need to earn my way up - fun!. Forza 4 is a game that all 360 owners should have played when it came **** game has a stunning 500 cars,or over 600 cars if you bought all the DLC. The graphics are **** the cars have interiors that look the exact same in-game as they do in real-life. Gameplay is where Forza 4's biggest strength **** the cars handle differently,meaning you need to really catch-on to the controls,and when you do Forza 4 showcases it's brilliant design. Top Gear is used lots in this game,with the track and numerous challenges from the show crammed into the career mode. Forza 4's career mode is deep and lengthy,providing lots of replay value,with it's 800+ races,with different requirements as to what cars you can **** each time you level up until level 50,you get to pick a free car Overall,Forza 4 is an amazing game.. Whether if it's the stellar visuals and amazing A.I. or the large amount of cars to choose from and fantastic online mode, everything about this game is more than amazing.. It's an extremely fun car game, to be specific. The game has beautiful cars and beautiful environments in which you'll find the track your about to tackle. Unlocks leave you feeling rewarded and driving around the Top Gear test track never gets old. Motorsport 4 deserves plenty of praise.. I have never really went online with this but the single player has some issues. The computer AI is set to ""extremely easy"" and there is no way to increase the difficulty of the AI. You can change all the other settings to difficult like no guideline etc and still breeze through the levels. Also every map is sunny and that does get old after a while. Graphics are good. Its the kind of game you play to relax before bed. 7/10 id say. I guess I should get Forza 5 now that I have the Xbox one, mabye it will be more challenging.. I absolutely loved this game. It was a ton better in many ways to Forza 5 other than the graphics and how the game ran. More tracks, cars, and a better community in general. I have clocked hours into this game because of how good it was. I still play it to this day. I would definitely recommend this for those who do not own next-gen consoles.. GREAT game when it came out and I played it up until this year. Fantastic physics, graphics, and presentation. I love the almost endless list of cars, each with a unique ""feel""!. I really dislike the DLC policies. Taking Porsche out of the game and making it an expansion pack?! Are you **** me? Any car that looks fun- DLC. It's like FM3 with a giant patch. Like MW2 and MW3. No major difference. New tire physics. Wow. Rivals. **** ""unicorns""-Wtf, turn10? I expected a lot more. But you rip people off.. Graphics: 9.5 Sound: 9.0 Gameplay: 9.5 Fun/Story: 9 A slight improvement of Forza 3. I loved to play it with Kinect or Racing Wheel. It´s a extremely well done climax of the last Forza franchise for Xbox360 (apart Horizon).. Great cars, great tracks, great DLC, great fun. Forza Motorsport 4 will always be a personal favourite of mine, thanks to the various categories of racing involved. Classics, tuners, GTs, LMPs an so on - there's always something for everyone to enjoy. This is the last true Forza Motorsport game that truly gave value for money.. ""forza motorsport 4 is the most frigging amazing creation that ever lived on xbox"" . i love driving games but this game is even better then just driving games .. Forza 4 is brilliant, beautiful, challenging, and addicting! Over the past two years I've logged several hundred hours, and have loved every minute of it! Although there is tons of content the game offers lots of DLC too. Fortunately this installment is completely fleshed out, and I never felt the need to purchase DLC in order to have the full experience. In the long run, I actually did end up purchasing most of the car packs, but was comfortable in not being pressured to do so. As for car tokens, I never purchased any. Tokens are unnecessary (but a convenient alternative) because Forza 4's economy is well balanced an fair.. Outstanding visuals, Detailed customization, Responsive A.I., these are just some of the perks this game has to offer. with hundreds of cars to choose from to fit your play style this game will easily keep you occupied for hours on end. One of the better racing games out there.. I own both Forza 4 and Gran Turismo 5, everyone who plays racing games knows this 2 are the best, but i think that forza is way better than GT5, Why? We could talk about the graphics, tracks or cars, but for me is all about gameplay. Forza as superior gameplay by far, it's just a shame that dlc's are expensive, around 20$ for the Porche dlc? Come on. Turn 10 want's to gain more money with dlc's than with the actual game, or what? It's enough we got to pay to play online since it's on Xbox. In GT5 we don't pay, because Sony is cool :) To finish, both games have ups and downs, but Forza takes the Prize.. i don't give it a 10/10 because the Kinect support is disappointing. the player just turns, everything else is automatic, even brakes...equal to Kinect on Forza is for kids... This is in my opinion THE racing game for the Xbox 360. It seems every iteration of Forza Motorsport gets better and better, while keeping the core gameplay intact. The graphics are the best I've seen in this series yet, the controls are as fluid as ever, and the selection of cars and race tracks is mind-boggling. Difficulty adjustments can be tailored to your skill level, and depending on how you set it you can more or fewer credits when you play, which are then used to buy upgrades for your cars and of course new cars. You can also go to auctions to buy cars from other gamers, as well as buy tuning set-ups, decals and paint jobs. Online play could do with some balancing, though. Being pitted against the fastest cars every time is just unfair. Other than that, this is one of the best racing games I've played and, without a doubt, the best racing game on the 360 in my honest opinion.. Well, Microsoft has created an opponent for the GT series, and i have to say, i Forza won! Why? Some people say: ""F4 has arcade driving and physics, while GT..."" MAN! Have you ever tried F4? Because it has a very good physics, physics like in real life. If you want to drift you have to learn first what is the best car for drift, AWD or RWD, you have to know the power of the engines and control them. But if you like racing you have a World Tour option, which gives you about ~30 hour gameplay, then you can take part in the Event List mode, which give you +100-150 hour gameplay. And you have the Rivals menu, where you can race against people around the world. F4 have multiplayer, but i don't like it, because dumb people can't take the collision off, and your opponent will knock you out like in burnout, or when you drifting and have a nice big score, somebody deliberately crash into you. I don't like multiplayer for that. Also, you have a local split-screen mode, you can race against your friend, but only with 2 maximum AI player :/ Anyway, i have to say this is one of the best racing game i have ever tried, and the DLC cars are coming regularly, and some car is f**king worth it, for example: Suzuki SX4 hillclimb version, Audi Quattro s1, Mazda 787b and so many other car. So if you like simulators, you have to try this!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably the best racing game on Xbox 360 bar none (other than other Forza's), but to call this a simulator is like comparing the brightness of the sun to a candle. Great fun for mucking around in, though sadly this only outlines exactly the difference between PC gaming and console. I am a huge xbox 360 fan, but this game just doesn't compare to racing sims on PC. Bonus point for Jeremy Clarkson dialogue!. Wow.... This truly is game awesome game. You can build YOUR dream car maybe even Drift, Drag, or put it on the Circuit for fun. The amazement of this game is awesome and has a awesome community in which the GT series cant bring to the table.. i have been a huge fan of the Forza series but 4 is basically a slightly upgraded Forza 3. Same old tracks, different misic, enhanced graphics but definitely feels like the same old. This series is still the simulation racing champ in my opinion but got rather stale. The mediocre score comes from the DLC. it has got to be at least over half the cars require a DLC {Day 1 DLC nonetheless} pack which is asinine for a simulation racer. Want any Porsche? You will have to pay for it which I found laughable. i would recommend Forza 3 over 4.. Honestly the best racing flagship for the Xbox360. What a fantastic game that delivers everything in this game. I'm a huge fan of racing games ever since I was little. This game proves to be worthy successor to those familiar with racing games. If you are not interested into simulation, then this is not the game for you.This game has everything to do, from driving visually beautiful tracks to just adding a fresh coat of paint of your car. The tracks are all great as they are all real, tuning is extensive such as elevating tire pressure, gear/ratio adjustments, braking to be rough or smooth to ride height, suspension levels and many more. Upgrading is unique such as changing parts, stylish rims, engine swaps, andtires for street, race, and/or drift **** AI in this game can be really dumb at times like when they are in the lead and they crash. You can do everything from buying any model of cars(some are DLC), auctioning them, selling of course and many more. The online is very fun and even HAS SOCCER!!!! LOL What a great game and that this game is basically endless because their are way too many challenges to complete and will take you some time to **** THIS GAME ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!. Forza Motorsport 4 is personally my favourite racing game. Every car performs differently whether its due to your upgrades, chassis length or drivetrain. Very realistic right down to sound of the engine in all gears and to reflection of the sunlight as your driving.Single player is a blast. however I found multiplayer to be frusterating at times due to lack of care from other players not racing clean i.e bouncing off anything possible to get through the course) Another pet peeve is that in the VIP map pack few cars are actually worth having and VIP pass does not entitle you to all car packs. But in all great game and amazing competion online when done properly. I'm not usually a big fan of racing games, but Forza 4 is one of the best racing games I've seen and played. I played this game at a friends house and I really didn't expect much. I thought it might be a basic generic racing game. Boy was I wrong! Forza 4 has some of the best controls for a racing game and the graphics are to die for. I don't own the game this is just when I was at my friends house playing Forza almost none stop. Last there is like a mini campaign where you can race in many different counties. You can also rank up when you play this campaign. It is not exactly a story, but still a fun experience. I highly suggest you buy this game it will be worth your $60.. Let me start by saying, you must love actual track racing. If you do not, do not play this. I love track racing and real driving physics, so I love this game. If you are love arcade racing that's great, but do not expect this to be that. Anyway, a very fun game with endless customizing (engines, looks, etc.).. This game deserves a far better rating than lousy 7.9! It destroys GT5 in almost every aspect and delivers one of the most realistic racing gameplay ever to be seen. Sad how a couple GT5 heros can sway the user rating.. This one is easy, it is better than Gran Turismo in almost every way. The thing it's missing- the true power and weight of the car while you are behind the wheel. That is why GT, with all it's faults, is a 10 and this is a 9. If you combined them to make a game with GT on track and Forza everything else, you would not onl;y have the best game ever, you would have a game that Metacritic would allow me to rate a 1,0000,0000,0000 out of 10. Thank you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the first ten I am giving to a game with several glaring flaws, and I will address these faults immediately. First, and most maddening, is the idiotic AI that has lost the ability to start a race, drive in tight formation, and recognize a passing vehicle as a solid object. Many times, while driving side by side, the computer will simply turn into me and not stopped until they are back in the race line, often to the point of pushing me right off the track. How did Forza go from a brilliant, tough, precise AI (in the hardest settings) to this? Second issue I have is with a bugged audio system, where engine notes will get stuck or will cut out altogether for several seconds, both of which cause havoc you shift manually in the game and rely on that engine noise. My third, and final issue with this game, is a delay issue I am having that is getting worse and worse the more races I complete. After a race, as you select to see your winnings, the game jams, sometimes for as much as a minute, sound and video. I've cleared the cache, I've reinstalled the game, nothing works and it's getting worse the more I complete. That's all the bad, and it would seem un-redeemable except for three incredible changes from Forza 3. First, is the most brilliant racing physics engine ever devised, period. This is especially evident when you drive older cars with skinny tires and flexible bodies. Every car is an experience and different types of cars feel more different, so driving a variety of cars becomes more rewarding. Second is the absolutely incredible variety of quality performance vehicles, from vintage Alfa Romeos to obscure modern supercars. Along with variety I'll also note that the car modelling seems to has also taken a large leap forward. Thirdly, the addition of Topgear and Topgear personality Jeremy Clarkson takes this from being another car game to being THEE car game. From Clarkson's humorous takes in Autovista, to the topgear track, to some of the included cars in the game, the quality of presentation is greatly amplified by this partnership. I can play no other car game without feeling that in some intangible (and sometimes very tangible) way, all other racing games have been rendered inferior.. Brilliant graphics and great game play makes this a very enjoyable and thrilling experience.Definitely one of the greatest car games I've ever played. :). Wow, Forza Motorsport 4 is, without question, the best racing game of the current (or any) generation. The handling feels incredible, the visuals are simply staggering, and the car selection is wonderful. Not only do we have the typical super cars, but the everyman's cars are also represented; I unlocked and tricked out a 1994 Celica that I just adore. It's really too bad that there is so much DLC because each car is so lovingly recreated that it feels like tragedy to not be able to experience all the cars, and to purchase all the DLC would cost more than an additonal $50 (something a seemingly inevitable FM4 Ultimate Edition would rectify). But as it stands, FM4 is without peer in the racing genre and one of the best overall games of all time.. This is the best realistic driving simulator on the 360, if you are a car lover or a racing fan buy this game. With a ton of tracks and a **** load of cars spanning over 80 manufacturers there is a wide range of races to complete........ AMAZING !!!. Great game, having a lot of fun trying out all the different cars and racing on all the cool looking tracks. Best racing game for a long time. Guaranteed fun. 9/10. Absolutely worth a 10, only a 9 because of the sheer fact I played Forza 3 and all the tracks felt copy and pasted aside from the Swiss Alps race track.. Best racing game ever. The handling is so good, every car feels different, and you can tell the difference if you tweak or add parts on. The Cars are all beautiful and all individual and theres a good mix, you will be able to find a car you love and drive with, for me it was the Ferrari 458, which isnt the quickest in its class, but handles soooo well. The tracks all very good, the new Alpines one is fantastic, only gripe I guess is that lack of new tracks , most recyleced from Forza 2+3. Multiplayer, very good. Finding games easy, lots of different cars used.. Awesome game. Thje game ships on 2 discs with 530 cars+ depending if you get VIP or not. Each month 10 new cars are released. Contrary to some of the complaints I have heard the dlc system is awesome. We get a whole lotta game on the original 2 discs and the 10 cars each month just freshen things up. I get more value for money out of each 10 car pack than I would from buying a new game so to me it saves money. Rivals mode is awesome as it provides plenty of friendly ""rivalry"" with friends. Highly recommended game.. EXACTLY! I have the Forza 4 demo, and it's good, but I'd still say that graphically GT5 wins. Gameplay..... Never mind. I'll be labeled a troll since I'm on a PS3 site. I'll leave that alone. lol Wait, no I won't. Forza 3 was better than GT5, so IF Forza 4 is to be better than 3, then you can imagine.. Absolutely Brilliant!! The Graphics Are Stunning, The Gameplay Is Next To Perfect and Online Play Never Gets Old. The Cars Are 99% The Real Thing and The Tracks Have Almost Every Bump and Crack As In Real Life. This Will Be An Addicting Game If You Play It For More Than 2 Hours When You First Put It In, So Watch Out.. Awful Single player for experienced players and absolutely stealing methods with DLC cars like Alfa Romeo Giulietta that they were ready before launch but you had to pay for them!! They did not manage to give players the choice for measure units (??!!) In the next Forza they should respect more their buyers. I really feel cheated... I played the game for just some weeks and returned to Forza 3.. Before I start to write my review, I just want to say t","this is the best racing game of all time, for it's time period . Jeremy Clarkson narrates the story in this game . the graphics are weak compared to modern games ."
248.Resident Evil,"RE1 started one of the longest running videogame series in history and defined the survival-horror genre. It might be outdated from a modern point of view, but back in 1996 it was a unique experience. It's cinematic presentation and ""Dungeons and Dragons"" like, decision based gameplay were new and interesting. On top of that it made itself a name for beeing ""too scary"" for the average player. Blood and gore were not common in video games, so for many young players it had a kind of illegal feel to it, what made it even more appealing of course. It is a great game, and has earned it's place as a classic in videogame history.. 10 of 10. It remembers me really GOOD TIMES and it was a WONDERFUL GAME to play with!!!!!!. The game is crazy for it's time. It has an involving storyline , it has a nostalgia to **** graphics maybe aren't the best ,but the coloring is enough to involve you into the story. It's madly interactive and interesting. You could sit and play it for hours.. The game has a good story but has annoying controls and a bad camera angle such a shame that this hasnt gotten a remake instead it gets a remaster which always ****. This first entry in the legendary franchise is a PS1 horror classic. Partially inspired by the George Romero zombie films, RE is a highly-inventive ride that is both cheesy and scary. It established the foundation of survival horror that is still emulated to this day. Set in an empty mansion filled with hidden areas and puzzles, the game offers two different ways to experience it. At the start, you're given the choice to select either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. Each character has unique abilities and their own story plays out differently. While the GameCube remake was an improvement, it's still worth playing this very first release. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. The story is fantastic the vibes from this game are phenomenal only down side is the game is really slow to me otherwise this game would be an absolute 10 that's not fact its just my opinion if you haven't played this and you enjoy zombie games this is a must play. If I were to make a film about Resident Evil, I would start with this part! And it would turn out better than what was filmed today. This game hasn't age well but back when i played it as a kid I totally lost my mind. It was hard but i remember beating it and feeling like a king. Now whenever i try to play it i can't, because the remake fixes every little issue of this game. The game that started it all. A legendary game that paved the way for almost every game today. Even silly action games now have puzzles and horror elements because of Resident Evil. I read a review on here from someone named ""Cchh"" who gave the game a ""0"" for superficial reasons. He complained about the graphics and character designs ""looking like it was designed in the early 90s."" Uh, the game was designed in the early to mid 90s, you id!ot! Smdh. I recommend pick up one for Halloween and this game awesome story and lot action and graphic amazing and good day. Capcom's classic coined the phrase ""survival horror,"" and still holds up today as one of the best examples of the genre. Resident Evil features pitch perfect pacing and a fantastic blend of puzzles and tense gameplay, even despite its low budget voice acting and dated visuals, not to mention incredible replay value with multiple characters and endings.. Where do I even begin with this abysmal excuse for a game? Resident Evil for PlayStation is an utter disappointment, and I'm convinced it was designed to torment players rather than entertain them. Capcom should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this steaming pile of digital horror. First and foremost, the graphics are an insult to the PlayStation's capabilities. I've seen better visuals on a Game Boy! The character models look like they were created in the early '90s, and the environments are so bland and pixelated that I wondered if I had mistakenly booted up a retro game. And don't even get me started on the controls! It's as if the developers purposefully wanted to make the simplest tasks, like walking or turning around, a Herculean challenge. I spent more time fumbling with the awkward controls than actually playing the game. Is this some sadistic attempt to add artificial difficulty? If so, they succeeded, but not in a way that makes the game enjoyable. Furthermore, the so-called ""storyline"" is a convoluted mess. It's as if the writers took random horror clichés and tossed them into a blender without any regard for coherence or logic. The plot twists are predictable, and the dialogue is so cringe-worthy that it had me rolling my eyes more than cowering in fear. But wait, there's more! The audio design is another travesty. The voice acting is laughably bad, and the sound effects are so jarring and poorly timed that they end up killing any semblance of suspense or tension. Oh, and let's not forget about the infuriating save system. Limited save slots and the absence of an autosave feature turned the game into a frustrating exercise in repetition. It's 2023, for crying out loud! How can a modern game lack such a basic feature that has been standard for years? To add insult to injury, the game is riddled with bugs and glitches. From clipping issues to game-breaking freezes, it's clear that little to no quality assurance was done before releasing this disaster. In conclusion, Resident Evil for PlayStation is an absolute travesty. It's a shameful cash-grab that preys on fans' nostalgia without delivering anything remotely worthwhile. Save your money, spare your sanity, and stay far away from this nightmarish disaster ****.. Ground breaking adventure that inspired the entire ""survival horror"" genre. Hugely atmospheric and unique at the time, although the camera angles can sometimes be awkward (ie having to shoot at enemies you can't actually see) and the suspect dialogue and voice acting is occasionally unintentionally hilarious. But it's still a hugely enjoyable blast from the past.. The game is divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Resident Evil marked a generation and introduced survival horror to video games, which influenced other major franchises to come in the future.. The original Resident Evil for the PS1 is a true classic. Capcom's innovative zombie game is a cheesy, but intense ride from beginning to end. It inspired countless of other similar horror games. While it's very much a creation of the late 90's, the game still holds up well. I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. This game is legendary. Great music, atmosphere, gameplay, storyline. The acting is hilarious. It can be difficult and how this is not a metacritic must play i'll never know. The truth is that it's a good game and the only thing I see as bad is the slightly high difficulty peak, which may be the only one and seem unfair, but apart from that it's a good survival horror game with very iconic moments that. It's worth playing.. I like this for the pure greatness of the juggernaut title. I like the director's cut for that silly soundtrack.. I've wanted to play this game for a long time, and now I've got my hands on it. A classic Japanese horror game. The puzzles are extremely interesting and not too difficult at the same time, which is a plus for me, because in the same LEGO games it can be very difficult to figure things out. Most of all I want to appreciate the soundtrack, it's a masterpiece. The fixed camera view did not bother me at all. 9/10, minus a point only because of the difficulty of compatibility with modern OS. This game is incredible. Tension, horror and locations are all distinct and excellent. The cutscenes however are noticeably cheesy which ruins a lot of the tone. Some outdated design choices.. This is real survivor horror this is real resident evil anything horror Puzzles Management of resources is very few, places and monsters are difficult to withstand, difficult to escape from them. I'll be synthetic. The game is filled to the brim with entirely gratuitous scripted actions. I hate those. Many scenarios are likewise gratuitously slow. I hate that. Zombies' reactions to attacks reek of brawler games. Tekken wasn't as clumsy though.. This game was one of the first genuine horror games that scared me as a child.. Where it all began. Zombies, Mansion, Redfield, Valentine, Wesker, S.T.A.R.S.... need I really say anymore?. Resident Evil 1 is a game I have a lot of respect for what it did for survival horror and for starting one of my favorite game series. With that being said I do think that this game has aged pretty poorly and I am of the opinion that the remake pretty much improved and perfected everything this game was going for. That's not to say that this game doesn't have value, merit or isn't worth playing today cause I do think it does. It's just a lot harder I feel to recommend the original over the remake or at least the directors cut of the game. Because when I say the original I do mean I played the original version of the game which when you really boil it down means that there's few unlockable and the music is better. In fact the music is really good on the original release the basement music being my favorite piece for how it heightened the tension I felt while going through. The basement music is my favorite song in the directors cut as well just for entirely different reasons. In addition the original release only has alternative costumes for each character you can unlock which kind of ****. And there's no auto aim which with the camera angels can make it really difficult to hit enemies some times. But the core gameplay of preserving ammo and healing items and solving puzzles is still really fun and even scary at times. Despite the games very dated visuals it does still mange to bring tension and dread in it's encounters through out the game. Another dated aspect is the story and voice acting which has critical levels of campiness. I think every one already knows this but the voice performance is on another level of how bad and unintentionally funny it is and I do love it. Some cutscenes have what I can call some of the worst 3d models I've seen in a game and I just love how bad they look. I think the game has a difficulty problem in that Jill's campaign feels kinda easy while Chris's campaign feels a lot harder and far more tedious due to his smaller inventory space. Leading me and seemingly most people to not what to play Chris more then once. The combat in the game is very slow due to in part the fixed camera angels and tank controls. Both of which I don't mind and I think really plays a part in the charm of the game and they work to heighten tension and make encounters all the more threatening. But I don't think it works with some of the enemies such as the hunters. Who can move very fast and sometimes will decapitate you killing you instantly which can be really annoying. I think this same issue is present for most of the boss fights due to their speed they can get a lot of hits in before your able to turn around and properly aim at them which again is very annoying. With all that being said I do think the game is a very charming experience and is still a good game at it's core just a terribly dated one.. Resident Evil 1 earned a place in gaming history as it is considered by many as the first true survival horror game and with that it created the genre. It was a remarkable B-movie inspired game that spawned a strong franchise including movies. The story focus on an elite police squad named S.T.A.R.S. who went out on a mission to investigate a series of mysterious deaths in Raccoon Forest. After the stylish and cheesy B-movie intro you and your team are stranded in the Spencer mansion near Raccon Forest. Already the team is trapped into what seems a nightmare. It is solid B-movie entertainment and I considered it fitting for the game. This is about entertainment and not Game of Thrones politics or Shakespearean plays ;-). You can chose between two playable characters. Jill Valentine who can pick locks, has an inventory space for 8 items and can play piano (Last one is not useless information) or Chris Redfield who has only an inventory for 6 items. The story differs a bit for both characters and there are also some minor branches including different endings. The atmosphere of the game is great and scary. You are quite limited and must make hard decisions as inventory space is limited (This includes weapons and ammunition too!) and you cant save at any time because you must use a typewriter in save rooms with a limited number of ink ribbons (I know this is blasphemy today but here it made the experience intenser). You can store the other items in a box in save rooms. Part of the game is survival as you face a lot of enemies and the ammunition is limited (You can use a knife instead but this is a bit tricky to master). The enemy variety is good and the bosses are impressive. Another part are the riddles. You have to solve a few puzzles and use the correct items at the right places. It was these combination of a B-movie story, intense ammunition management, survival and puzzles that made the game so good back then. This is a fitting direction to my complains. The game does not hold up today and without nostalgia googles I would rate it today far lower. However there are a view strong remakes. Back then my complains would be that the intro is not in color and the controls as you can move only forward and backward as left and right change only your direction. This created the term “Tank like controls” in gaming. Other aspect like limited inventory are O.K for me but I can see that others are annoyed. Overall this was a classic and I have fond memories even if it did not reach a 10/10 for me. I would advise that you play a remake instead like the excellent HD remaster.. OVERALL - 90% Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 9/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 8/10 Replay Value - 8/10 At the time of release this in my 5 year old opinion was the scariest, most atmospheric game I had played. The clunky slow controls and awkward camera angles added to that.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Alone in the Dark has invented the survival horror genre, but it was Resident Evil that popularized it. As a fan of Resident Evil 4, I was curious about the first game which paved the way for one of the most successful video game series today. I played the original PlayStation version, mind you, not the remake. Resident Evil starts strong: A phenomenal, super cheesy 80s B-horror movie cinematic. You are in a mansion and the game is creepy from the get go. I consider myself an experienced gamer and usually play in harder difficulties, but I have struggled too much early on in Resident Evil. I had to rely on knife to preserve ammo (which I have found too difficult) or I had to run away from zombies rather than killing them (which I have found too boring). I then switched to “training” difficulty, which translates to “easy’. I liked the atmosphere, loved the music. My gripe was the generally boring puzzles and the backtracking. Overall, I don’t regret playing through Resident Evil. But this is not a case of the original entry being the absolute best of a video game series. Resident Evil started it and some of the later games made it absolutely better.. Resident Evil series is a top of the top games! I'm a fan of resident evil games. And this part was a first part of this best horror games.. Great start to the series. I loved the horror aspect mixed with action. The storyline was solid. So good that, look, it broke off into a never ending series! The whole build up of the zombies, the danger and the threat, the bad guy, and good guys. Everything was built up perfectly. Setting it up nicely, for the destruction that awaited. The gameplay was a little clunky (in the original ps1 version. It is much better in the remastered.) But it was still a lot of fun, and manageable. The puzzles were good, and not too hard. But it was mostly the story and anticipation on what will come out at you next that kept you going.. Giving birth to the legendary series that is RE, this game set the survival horror formula perfectly well. It's a metroidvania game, where you navigate through the unknow, dangerous mansion unlocking new areas as you find new keys exploring, while making you feel the oppressiveness of the mansion in it's atmosphere and is it's notorious difficulty. This game is a masterpiece, it's atmospheric, it's difficult, it's scary, it's memorable. A better survival horror game than this, only this game's own remake.. Summary: Raccoon City has been completely overrun by mutant beasts and bloodthirsty zombies. You are a member of S.T.A.R.S.--a rescue squad sent into the community to investigate the ominous mansion at the core of the disaster. Take the role of operative Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield and uncover… Expand. A classic of Survivor Horror games! Epic, vreat characters mas enemys, Capcom have tô learn with the past.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A game that has transcended through time. The beginning **** saga; horror on every corner, an interesting story and good challenge. Their failures, a little intuitive control, and bad performances (it is understood by the time). Even though this game is outdated and have tank controls, this game show what survival-horror in video games looks like. The music and the funny voice acting (including Barry who is my favorite in this game) fits the atmosphere in this game. The things they do in this game is creepy but also corny just like The Evil Dead movies. When you feel frightening, the iconic dialogues from this game can make you get a laugh from horror to comedy of a sort. This is how you start **** series.. This game kickstarted the survival horror genre of games and it was a great thing. The monsters we cool and the characters are now iconic and even some phrases from the game are now always quoted.. I would like to start by saying that survival horror is not my genre of choice. With that being said I completely agree that this is a good game. After never playing a survival horror game I figured I would give the granddad of the genre a try and it did not disappoint. My first observation was the apparent lack of hand holding that you get from many games these days. I was six when this game was originally released so maybe that was just the way games were made in the early PS days but either way it brought about a very different experience from what I was expecting. This game made it frustratingly obvious at times that this was no combat game and I had to use my brain to figure out how to advance (I may have also asked a few of my friends who played this back in the day but I refused to use the internet lol). Once I understood that everything is a puzzle things went a lot smother and quicker. The puzzles could be frustrating at times but once I figured them out I found myself saying ""well duh"". Combat is fairly primitive. Shooting is as simple as aiming in the enemies general direction and firing till they fall. I found that often times is was best to run away or run around certain enemies to conserve ammo as it can often be scarce and needed for later enemies. My biggest frustration was with the camera system. I thought it looked great from a cinematic perspective but as far as combat goes it was really annoying at times. I would often run right into enemies that were standing right in front of me because the camera angle in the section I came from was facing my front. Decent variety of weapons even though the suffer from some balancing issues. The music is creepy and fits the atmosphere fairly well. The AI reacts as they should and do as you would expect. The games real strengths in my opinion is the story and the atmosphere. The developers did a great job of creating a genuinely creepy and scary atmosphere that made a very non skittish late 20 year old man jump on several occasions with some unexpected enemy attacks and a good balance of slow moving and quick attacking enemies. I am not sure if it was the intention of the writers to create a story that was filled with lovingly terrible voice acting and awkward character interactions but they did..... and it works. By today's standards the story would be considered bad but for some reason it just fits within the narrative of the game and gives the game a certain charm. The game also offers multiple endings I came to find out later (apparently I got the good one with my first run through with Jill). The biggest criticism of the game is that I did not feel that my next play through with Chris was nearly as enjoyable. There wasn't that much of a difference other than a few less inventory slots and few different weapons. I got through the Chris story much faster. All in all this was a good game given that this genre is not my cup of tea but was successful in making me want to try more Resident Evil titles in the future. It scared the crap out of me at times and made me think a lot. 7/10 Good. This is what started it all, from the cheesy yet wonderfully hilarious opening cinematic to the one of the six equally hilarious yet satisfying endings, this game keeps you on the edge of your seat. The scene where you meet the first zombie, though censored in America and Europe, people knew that they were about to enter a world of hell. Even the terrible voice acting has a unique charm to it, though it is still bad. Without this game, we wouldn't have the franchise we have today.. A classic in the survival horror department. The game that launched the series was a must play when it released in 1996 and is still a must play today with the HD Remaster version out on modern consoles.. Resident evil brought us the true game of terror and survival. Despite the Alone in the dark be the father of survival horror, but I'm sorry the fact of terror began with resident evil, it contains much horror unlike Alone in the dark where his main focus and puzzles! The game takes you there is an incredible level of immersion, you really feel threatened with a simple zombie. The puzzles are great and in the right dosage! Graphic arts good for that time. Plot great, but horrible dubbing, but we highlight and game of 1996. The more elaborate voiceovers were beginning. Finally, Resident Evil and a work of art and that in my opinion and father of survival horror !. True classic. One of the best horror games ever. Deep atmosphere and good gameplay. You move in giant residence filled with traps, secret rooms and zombies. Your task is to find missing team at first, but then you realize that your task is to escape this place alive.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. And so it begins! Must say Im surprised that 9 kids gave this game negative reviews, but of course, **** have freedom of speech, yeah yeah, I know.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is not even scary, and it should not belong in the survival horror genre. I dont know why most ppl are praising Mikami, he is not even an good at making survival horror games. Plus the game thats very bad graphic, poor voice acting, poor dialogue, if yur looking for a better survival horror, play silent hill, fatal frame, or dead space.. My years of nightmares was worth it for this game! Years of nightmares because of this game, I am now 22 and I am perfectly fine *Checks over shoulder for zombie* -There is nothing wrong with me whatsoever! Moving on... This is one of my all time favourites to play when I was growing up, I have completed this about 3 times? It's a game where you can go back and play it and still (sometimes) get stuck on what you have to do! The famous iconic moment in this game is when you go throw the dining room to find (possibly Chris's blood) on the floor, then you enter the door in front of you, turn left, then poke your head round the corner and what do you see? A zombie enjoy his MANwich (See what I did there huh?)... He slowly rises his head and turns to you, staring you directly in the eyes as if you're now his dessert! The camera angles, the cut scenes, the ""omg I think I've just **** myself moments"", totally worth it! A very eerie soundtrack to this game, along with the cut scenes too, it kept the whole ""suspense"" going, it's like you needed a bowl to sit on just in case... Y'know? The dialogue... Well, now that was laughable! Who could ever forget ""You were almost a Jill sandwich"" HA-HA BARRY! That was... That was just dreadful! (Nice try Capcom, nice try). My only upsets were, controls were very clunky, dialogue was... Garbage! Very good storyline! Shame the acting was terrible though! 9/10.. Where do we start off with such an amazing series. This is probably the scarier of the Resident Evils for PS, not including PS2. I can't wait until they release the remastered version to play this on PS3. This game series is highly addictive, but well worth the time invested.. The game that started them all. And what a masterpiece it is! I re-lived the survival horror yesterday, finished the game in 7hrs, which is pretty speedy... All i wanted was the game i played as a kid, whilst not as nerve chilling now, it still thrills to this very day. For those disliking the controls, try to get the Director's Cut, a rare version which included RE2 demo on a separate disc, you also benefit from dualshock compatability which never was implemented into the original RE.. The graphics are awesome 4 ps1 (especially character models), with a PS controller it plays great, though it didnt scare me but not much else comes as close to doing so, Audio: Eerie and epic, EVERYTHING: how do you make an infinity sign on keyboard?. It might not be the best in its series, but no one can deny, the first Resident Evil redefined the survival horror genre. Playing it for the first time in years I couldn't help but cringe, its blocky graphics, scary in a bad way voice acting, and sluggish controls make it by todays standards abit dated. Rub at its surface and you'll however inevitably find its diamond core. The eerie music, groan and sounds from the enemies and the horror it invokes still has a class of its own, inspiring real fear and helplessness. The story is good but nothing sensational, but those who enjoyed the game before will be happily nostalgic playing it in this day and age.. Long long ago, when the Resident Evil series was an adventure/horror series and not an action/shooter series, Capcom actually knew how to make good games. The original Resident Evil is one of them. It's plot is simple, yet intriguing. The game is one of the most atmospheric games of this era and even though it's quite old, you can still tell that it is well designed. The gameplay is excellent as well. Need I say more? This game is a classic.. For a series that started off so well it truly saddens me to see how the recent ""RE"" titles seem to have forgotten what this series was (is) about. Being that ""RE2"" was the first one I played, the PS1 Trilogy is something truly special, birthing ""survival horror"", a huge conspiracy filled character driven story, raw fear for one of horrors most endearing icons and cementing Capcom's status as a real ""for the player"" type company, Resident Evil is a shining example of what rival developers still fail to replicate. Simple story, An elite team from the local town police force goes missing in the mountains, forcing the other team to investigate, upon arrival they are chased by the bizarrely crazed heavily bloodied dogs forcing the surviving members to take shelter in the secluded Spencer Mansion, upon arrival they stumble across the horrifying truths of the previous occupants and you must help Chris/Jill find out what happened to their fellow colleagues in a plot filled with twists, mystery and deception. I mention this because the Introduction video to this game is fantastically cheesy and very self aware, however having it performed by real actors and not rendered in FMV help bring this B-Movie style some extreme level of quote on quote ""realism"" and bonding to the main cast making you want to help them see their way through safely, however you'll be put to the test through a wealth of challenging puzzles whilst having literally less than nothing in terms of items, ammo & health etc. Progressing through the game never stops having you on edge, what shines is how much the actual Mansion itself slowly begins to turn on you, no matter how much you manage to prevail or remove the undead threat, the narrow corridors and later areas constantly challenge and overwhelm to the point where you doubt whether you're going to get Chris/Jill through this and for 1996 these themes were beyond tricky to portray given the industry's lack of horror prior. When all is said and done, Resident Evil was a landmark upon arrival, even with the horrendous voice acting and dialogue that has enjoyed many a legacy as an internet phenomenon, to spoil anything would be a disservice and I look forward to playing the equally superb GameCube remake (Review Pending ;-)). Final Verdict: Where games like ""Silent Hill"" may render you to scared to play it, ""Resident Evil"" throws strategy in the mix to help conquer those fears and ultimately see it through to the end. Solid gaming entertainment.. Besides the controls, which I hate immensely I love this game. The fact that you have very little saving points and ammo makes this survival horror actually scary, because you never know when you will turn a corner and something kills you and you have to start all the way at your last save point.. Great, definitely worth attention. Revelation in horror games, scary and fun. Full of puzzels and monsters, this game will **** you in for hours. This is what we shall expect with every Resident Evil release.. Resident Evil’s clunky controls are less forgivable nowadays and the graphics simply look horrible but at the time this was quite rightly considered a classic. One of very few games to be genuinely scary it was like nothing else available and demonstrated just what the Playstation was capable of. Anyone wanting to experience the birth of one of gaming’s most well known series should really check out the superb GameCube remake.. The game has it's scares, but people, take off your nostalgia glasses and look at it. It pretty fun and entertaining and all, but these controls are some of the worst, EVER. Don't even bother with the analog, because you will be frustrated to breaking your controller with your bare hands, the digital mode (the arrow keys to the left of the controller) may be better, but that isn't saying much, not at all. So be warned, if you can get used to the controls, it is a pretty decent game, just not a classic.. For when it came out it was a great game and truly set the genre for decades to come. Graphics were good and very detailed and looked really nice on the PS1. Sound, music and lighting set the atmosphere perfectly. This is the root of survival horror and it shows (the good and the bad.) While it has since become a bit iconic the voice acting is just terrible, even then. I've heard fan made re-recordings that were better and more professionally done. But voice acting aside the gameplay is just first rate. Overall: Truly a classic, in the B-horror movie kind of way. It hasn't aged well and would rather defer to the Gamecube remake if you want to experience the game.. A true innovator and creator ****, Resident Evil is the first (and one of the best) ""survival horror"" games. Borrows elements from puzzle and action games with a splash of B-movie horror and acting. The classical and ambient soundtr",the first entry in the legendary franchise is a PS1 horror classic . it's a highly-inventive ride that is both cheesy and scary . the game has a good story but has annoying controls and a bad camera angle .
249.Crusader Kings III,"What a Great strategy game. It is virtually infinitely replayable with innumerable options to use. Love it !. For starters, I like this game's in-depth character creator. While I’m not particularly skilled at using it myself, I’ve seen players recreate celebrities and other real-life figures with impressive accuracy. The graphics are another standout feature, marking a significant step up from other grand strategy games, especially its predecessor, Crusader Kings II. The visual upgrade really enhances the experience. The gameplay is equally commendable. This game incorporates RPG elements by allowing you to play as a dynasty rather than a nation, as is common in other grand strategy titles by Paradox Interactive. This unique approach makes Crusader Kings stand out from the rest of the catalog and leads to some truly engaging and memorable moments. Additionally, the game feels more accessible when it comes to downloadable content (DLC). Unlike its predecessor, this installment doesn’t overwhelm players with a reliance on extra content. The base game is enjoyable on its own, which isn’t something I can say for other Paradox titles. Lastly, the modding community is exceptional, second only to Hearts of Iron IV in terms of quality. If you’re interested in total conversion mods, I recommend The Fallen Eagle, After the End, and Prince of Darkness.However, some aspects feel simplified compared to Crusader Kings II. Many gameplay elements have been streamlined: for instance, you can’t play as republics without mods, you don’t deal with decadence as a Muslim character, and secret societies are no longer part of the game. While this reduced complexity may make the game less appealing to those who preferred the depth of its predecessor, it also makes it more approachable for casual gameplay—sometimes, I just want to enjoy some straightforward map painting. On the downside, the game tends to slow down as you progress, especially in the late-game stages. This issue isn’t unique to Crusader Kings III—it’s a common problem across Paradox games—but the improved graphics can make it particularly challenging to run on some systems. In conclusion, this game is a must-have for fans of the medieval period, grand strategy games, and history in general. I’ve been playing it on and off for years since its release, and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. The game is broken beyond repair with bugs more than F76 on launch. Oh, and the newest update with Eastern Roman Empire made them so broken it is impossible to play in Europe now.. Best game off my life the gameplay is so good for an history fan and medieval fan. All things in this game is good, soundtrack, graphics characters, interface, ... I love it. The story is unclear, where does Russian come from, where is this word from the 860s. Perverted nations.. If any game deserves a perfect score, it would be Crusader Kings III. Rich content, GBs of history, and optimized gameplay. I can't think of a more unique and well-done game.. It feels like the devs don't understand what makes CK2 a great sandbox roleplay game. The events are repetitive, most civs play the same, the balance is absolutely broken (in particular, the way the activities' costs scale is one of the dumbest idea I've seen in a video game and makes any attempt at roleplaying a doom to your whole economy), no strategy in war: enemy ai armies are just lost and confused, just like Paradox' devs. So, RPG elements are repetitive and overall way inferiors to CK2, most game mechanics are either broken or just unfun, 5 years and 150€ of dlc for this result.... This game is alive. The endless possibilities and the whole strategy. It's so cool. And especially with the latest DLC you can play as a landless adventure wow. A well-deserved 10 out of 10!. One of the best srategic games. And as always parasox dropped a banger. So much things to do and to test. You just need to understand every aspect of the game and enjoy some incredibles playtroughts.. Crusader Kings III is a game that’s hard to put down once you’ve started. If you’ve ever wanted to live out your medieval fantasies—whether that’s ruling with an iron fist, engaging in courtly intrigue, or simply trying to survive the chaos of the Middle Ages—this game delivers on every front.. As of writing this review, I have nearly 1,100 hours in CK3. After writing this review, I will likely get hundreds of hours more. This game, while being fun at times, has some massive glaring issues. For being a game so focused on the roleplay aspect of grand strategy, there are far too few roleplay elements in the game. Sure, you can make stories in your head about feasts, and friendships, and rivals, but the game does little to nothing to actually make these mechanics interesting flavor-wise. The events that are in the game are extremely repetitive, and most often not worth reading, and instead it is simpler to just click on an option to just get it off the screen. Events and event chains generally have very little real impact on the geopolitical situation of the world, and the roleplay within the game can (due to lack of flavor for characterization) mostly only be done through the geopolitics of the world. Even this roleplay is extremely limited though, as geopolitical regions themselves lack flavor. The game needs to do much more to encourage, or better yet, FORCE the player to roleplay than it currently does, if it's going to continuously market itself as a game about characters. The warfare mechanics in the game are far too simple and unfun. You cannot lose a siege. You can only have offensive alliances. You cannot trade provinces in a war. You can only declare a war for one purpose, and the war is all or nothing for that purpose. It is impossible for a war to have shifting alliances. The AI is generally also not very good. Rulers will grant de jure provinces to their vassals even if it goes directly against their interests to do so. Almost no enemy army knows what it's doing in a war. Crusades, the game's namesake, are laughable at best, and miserable at worst. The economy is far too simple to be enjoyable long term - it devolves into having a list of holdings open, and cycling their improvement. Another issue is artificial (and ahistorical) difficulty. Kings in medieval Europe often chose themselves how their heirs would succeed them, and what they would get in inheritance, but this is extremely limited at least until the year 1200 when you are able to unlock primogeniture succession. If the game is about roleplay, and tries to be historical, this forced partition should not be in the game. It hampers the players ability to roleplay, assumedly in an effort to prevent powercreep, but even this fails, as powercreep remains a massive issue. Despite the game's roleplay and strategy foundations being simple, boring and repetitive, it still manages to be fun, at least to me, but I don't know if I would genuinely be able to recommend anyone play the game. If you can make up the roleplay in your head, and are dedicated to doing so, the game becomes much more interesting and dynamic - and for those who can do this, the game is good. But this is not something that should be up to the player to do - the game should already be doing it, and it fails massively in this regard, and in any strategic gameplay. I love it dearly, but it is far too often boring.. This is one of the best strategy game ever made. It has many ways to play. Maybe it is hard to understand at the beggining, but you learn quickly. Game is good.. Crusader Kings 3 starts with a disclaimer that tells you that this game cannot be won. The purpose of the game is to play out the story of a mediaeval ruler for your own amusement. That would be fine if I didn’t feel like I was playing a video game, but I definitely was. The game throws in the option to create empires, take over the map, and dominate religion. Winning is very much on the menu. You immediately see all the limiters put in place to hold back the power of players. Aside if goal, the game has “prestige”, “faith”, and “renown” and currencies. Players can only wage a holy war on a kingdom once a lifetime. The player character can only hold so much land and have so many vassals. Rulers have to pick one discipline to follow. These game mechanics are so blatant that any experienced player will have an easy time abusing them. They are also so blatant they ruin the premise of enjoying the story and not trying to win. I would dump all of that and focus on the two mechanics that matter: gold and public opinion. Public opinion is presented in positive and negative percentages. NPCs have plusses these numbers right in front of you. (Apparently no one can hide their true intentions.) public opinion affects gold. Too much tax lowers opinion. Bribes raise opinion. It’s simple enough and complex enough that the game should dump the made up currencies of prestige, faith, and renown. Gameplay is hampered by how poorly the game runs. The UI is no help. The UI throws up a lot of useless information and hides important information. You cannot easily see how titles correspond to the map. You might enter into an alliance and then find out your ally is on the other side of the map. You might make a vassal too powerful because you can’t easily see their holdings. I’m sure this looks fine on a PC with an ultra wide monitor, but it doesn’t work so well on console. Some things don’t work. Contextual information might disappear. Items might not be selectable. Numbers might not be real. Army sizes are ridiculously obtuse. A tiny country might have a huge army. Iceland, for example, might have the largest army in the game. Options like marriage will show no possibilities on one screen and several possibilities on another. My praise for this game is limited to the well developed system for the relationships between royals. This isn’t a Civilization game with its immortal leaders. If you don’t set up succession, your heir will inherit a fractured kingdom. If you don’t marry for alliances, you may be outmanned in warfare. The meat of the game is setting up marriages, alliances, and proper rights of succession. Little stories are interspersed during each reign, but they are repetitious and of little consequence. These interpersonal relationships could also be helped with some UI changes. Personally, I would like the game to dump a lot of the numbers based UI elements and go full skeuomorphism. Show me a court of advisors I can order and see what happens. All in all, I cannot say Crusader Kings 3 is a good game. Overall, it is merely mediocre. It is unique in its genre, though, and I cannot say it has any competition for the type of game it is. There are certainly other strategy games that do strategy better, but they do not have the depth of personality that this game has. I’m surprised that the third iteration of the Crusader Kings franchise hasn’t figured out how the game should look and play. Full disclosure: I downloaded Crusader Kings 3 from my PlayStation Plus Extra catalogueCru. This is the best game in it's category. I, personally, **** at the game but I keep coming back to get better. Absolutely brilliant as a strategy game that brings war and politics as it's vital components.. Simply masterpiece, love the game love every single dlc. This game is a truly amazing strategy roleplay game.. Peak Paradox Gameplay. It's what you expect and not much else. It would probably be higher rated if it was the first version of CK I played, but since it isn't, the novelty wears.. An enjoyable game, you will have plenty of chances to write your own history. However, this does not mean that the game is half-baked and still lacks many features.. If you like a good deep strategy game and are willing to tackle 3 or 4 false starts, as you learn the various systems and how they interact, you’ll love Crusader Kings 3. With no ""win conditions"" you take on the role of successive rulers through the ages, interacting with those around you. Deciding your own goals, or rolling with the punches to make the best of an awkward turn of events.. Enjoyable, but too easy and simple, with its only difficulty being death and inheritance. Unless you go are particularly unfortunate with RNG or are just beginning, you're rarely challenged in both the RPG and mapgame aspects. Its DLC add new features, but these only seem to serve to make the game easier, being poorly balanced.. Extremely hard for new players, too much information, it's also relatively hard for new players (even in easy difficulty) and you need to read every single thing, overall it's decent but definitely only for hardcore players that want to be invest 30-+100 hours. Not bad, but nowhere close to as good as Crusader Kings II yet. Give it 3 to 5 years and I can see it being better.. Crusader Kings III - A 9/10 Gem Crusader Kings III, the latest offering from Paradox Interactive, is a medieval strategy game that has taken the gaming world by storm. This grand historical epic allows players to step into the shoes of rulers from across the world and centuries, guiding their dynasties through the turbulent waters of medieval politics, intrigue, and war. With its vast scope, modding support, and countless hours of engaging gameplay, it stands as a remarkable testament to the grand strategy **** most striking aspect of Crusader Kings III is the sheer breadth of choice it offers. Players can take control of a wide variety of countries, from the powerful empires of Western Europe to the fragmented kingdoms of the East. The depth of historical research is evident, with each character, region, and event reflecting meticulous attention to detail. This diversity of options keeps the game feeling fresh and exciting, even after countless hours of **** of Crusader Kings III's standout features is its robust modding support. The game's modding community has flourished, creating an array of mods that range from small quality-of-life improvements to massive overhauls that redefine the game's mechanics and settings. This level of customization breathes new life into an already captivating experience and ensures that players can tailor their game to their preferences.However, no game is without its flaws, and Crusader Kings III is no exception. The primary criticism that often surfaces is Paradox Interactive's approach to downloadable content (DLC). While the base game is undeniably compelling, Paradox has released a plethora of expansions and additional content packs, many of which come with a hefty price tag. This DLC policy, seen across Paradox's titles, has led to concerns about the cost of fully enjoying the game, particularly for those who want to access all its features and improvements. It's a drawback that can be frustrating for dedicated **** conclusion, Crusader Kings III is a magnificent strategy game that offers a sprawling, immersive experience. Its depth, historical authenticity, and modding support make it a true gem in the grand strategy genre. Despite the concern over the cost of DLC, it is a game that provides countless hours of entertainment and a platform for players to rewrite the annals of history. With its vast world to explore, Crusader Kings III earns a well-deserved 9/10 rating.. Not a bad game at all, however it falls a bit short given that it's supposed to be a sequel to what is currently a superior game.. i don't actually like it but it is a very good game, very complex and lots of thought put into it, multiplayer a bit buggy but doesn't take away from how good it is in singleplayer. Got bored after 10 hours of playing it I guess my adhd is just too big to play this game. Great because it's more of an rpg featuring your character than a 4X game. The major issue with it has always been the ai as you couldn't win crusades without insane effort AND luck, though that seems to have been addressed in recent expansions/patches. Its paradox so they still charge way too much for DLC, so just buy em on sale or from a key site.. Can't recommend in this state at this price. * Too much focus on RPG part of the game (frequent random events that get repetitive/annoying very quickly) instead of the mechanics. Many parts of the game could use new/deeper mechanics (HRE, papacy, crusades, diplomacy, republics etc.). Unfortunately the DLC seems to focus on even more RPG events instead of core game mechanics. * Game too easy overall. Limitless aggressive expansion is possible. Intrigue is too powerful. * Bad UI, even by Paradox standards. The new map lacks many important viewmodes that were essential in CK2, and requires you to zoom in/out constantly to finally fade in the content you need (armies, counties etc. - but at the same time you get useless terrain features, snow effects etc.). This requires constant use of the mouse wheel, which makes for very poor ergonomics. UI Scaling beyond 130 % not possible without losing content, making text too small on UHD displays.. Crusader Kings 3 improves upon its predecessor in every way possible, there is a lot more content in the base game than there is in CK2. There is still plenty locked behind pay walls but it's not as bad as it is in CK2 or other paradox games. The map and graphics have also greatly improved and you can now actually see an animated version of characters. You can also design your own character now with a detailed new system that allows you to edit the physical features of characters as well as their traits. The UI in CK3 has also seen huge improvement when compared to CK2, you can actually find what you want. CK3 allows you a lot of freedom in how to deal with threats and at times it resembles a RP game because of how deep your dynasties story can become and because of that I would highly recommend purchasing this game.. I have to admit, I'm a paradox fanboy. I love this game. Creating your own character, or playing as a historical one, and living out a historical rendition **** style fantasy is truly an awesome experience. Ruling a feudal fiefdom and working your way up from a count to Duke, King, or Emperor is truly an amazing experience. Friendships can be formed, Love can be found, Lands can be conquered, Enemies can be made, Religions can be founded, Families can be built....Incest can be....*cough* *cought*....I didn't say anything.... Seriously though, there is so much to be done in this game, it's crazy, at least as far as RP and storytelling goes. It MAY get repetitive after several hundred **** honestly that's a good investment in my book. The main downsides of the game lay in it's nation-building and strategy elements. Outside of interpersonal interaction diplomacy is much more limited than in CK2, and in regards to warfare and events the game also lacks a bit of **** that's been improving with time. Much like CK2 did. Overall a great game that I highly recommended if you are a fan of Medieval strategy or general larping **** 8/10, would marry my sister-cousin-daughter-wife twice removed again.. This game is pretty fun, especially if you’re a fan of grand strategy games, but I did not have a clue what I was doing half the time. I really did try to learn the game from guides, tutorial videos, and friends, but I couldn’t make much sense of this game and it’s mechanics. Plus it’s a huge time sink for something that feels like such a sandbox ****.. In my option, one of the best strategy game of all time. Re playability is great, in game wiki is awesome and really clear, graphs are good, achievements are diversified, DLCs are somewhat interesting (some beeing completely useless for their price, but mostly are a great adidition). I give it a 9 because the game gets really slow when you conquer a big part of the map, performances could maybe get better. If you like strategy game, definitly try it out.. The best strategy game I've ever played. I really like the stories that are formed during the game with the help of artificial intelligence.. This game is great!! While you can conquer different realms there is huge rpg behind all the mechanics. First you can participate in tournaments, hold events and hunt, which upgrades your character. It feels natural and remind me about best years in DnD. Second struggle for power between your heirs. You can do a lot to help your chosen heir to ascend to throne. Third conquest. You can create huge realms and even create your own empire!! Fourth changing your culture and upgrading your dynasty. You can get a lot of awesome bonuses from it!! And especially from merging cultures. I would recommend it to any rpg fan - it is more of an roleplaying game rather than strategy!. Super well realized game. It has less going on that its predecessors in terms of deep systems or simulation, but exceeds it when it comes to the personal and dynastic stories of the characters. It sells the individual fantasy of being a ruler incredibly well. Amazing if you're into history or alt-history. Has room for growth, definitely not without flaws, but the base product with DLCs is so good it still deserves a 10 fro me. I am tired with paradox selling me unfinished products released on different overpriced DLC stages in order to milk my wallet for the years to come. Thus they deserve a 0 for being anticonsumer and predatory.. Not as good as CK2 there's some stuff that's better but also things that are worst and overall CK2 is better, CK2 is also way way way more newcomer friendly in fact CK2 is the most newcomer friendly out of all paradox games CK3 on the other hand loses a lot of that newcomer friendliness of CK2 one of the big reasons for this is that they moved the main part of the Ui from the top left to the right top and sadly i don't think there's a mod to move it back to the top left like it is in CK2 and this might not sound like a big deal for new players who never played CK2 but it's just kinda painful and hard to use when it's on the right, i do like that you can make your own character tho without losing the ability to earn achievements but if you're new to crusader kings just get CK2 it's even free now meaning even if you don't like it you're not gonna waste/lose money like you might with CK3. Very complex strategy game with never seen before range of options to win your way to the throne, be it through politics, conspiracy or brute force, the most challenging aspect is to manage your kingdom and maintain power. Managing one's bloodine to make sure they stay in power or undermine other clans so they get weak, there is so many layers of strategy to make sure you stay at the top, even though at some point you find the best way of doing that, there is lot of mechanics that can turn things around like your ruler having bad traits or getting assassinated, and so on.. A great game, I spent dozens of hours in it, my main achievement was losing to the Mongols.. The game is beautiful and definitely has potential, but the development process has been so terrible that I can't give it a high score. The way the production company treats their games and their players is a disgrace. The game will probably only be fully playable in 2025 or so.. An improvement over CK2 in every way, but it will take a few years and a few DLC and mods for it to rival CK2 with DLC and HIP.. The one who had to be the true strategy Goty of 2020, the best Paradox game so far, a very deep but friendly game for learning and newcomers to this type of title.. The best strategy game I've ever played in my life, the game has completely lived up to fans expectations, considering how high the bar was set by its predecessor Crussader Kings 2. Ck3 has a great variety of mechanics that will make you spend all day playing it and you will feel like you will be missing a lot more time just to finish a single game. What a great game!. Updated (-2) Instead of repairing the flaws of the game, overpriced DLC - including stuff that used to be free in the predecessor - has hit the market, and loading times as well as frequent crashes tell me that the architecture of the base game can't really hold them. Something like the autosave being highly unreliable in a game like this is simply unacceptable, and yet Paradox blames it on mods even if users point out that they don't use them. It has all the addictive qualities of it's predecessor, and has become more accessible. The 3D models of your characters are a huge improvement and emphasize that the focus of this game is more on the roleplaying aspects than, for example, Europa Universalis. Even though it has it's hick-ups and is cheating a lot, the AI manages to create a dynamic world that will redefine European history every time you start over, and I will never not find the results hilarious. Observing the competition while constantly (and most of the time unsuccessfully) trying to keep your own dynasty in check will never get boring; following the lives of even the most unimportant peasants can tell wonderful stories down the path. The expanded religion system is the second big improvement that makes Crusader Kings 3 worth buying. The only downside to religious as well as personal traits is that the AI doesn't really roleplay at all; too many entities on the map are cheating, lying, fornicating warlords that will turn into child-murdering cannibals if you give them the chance, no matter how peaceful, calm and honest they are in theory. Right now there are balancing issues, especially when it comes to the AI using female characters as anything but currency in negotiating alliances, that hopefully will get addressed in future patches. Alliances itself, especially if you need them in your wars, are another thing that needs to be fixed. Still, as of now this is a game worth playing over and over again, and where losing is just as much fun as succeeding. Even though it's missing the long, long, LOOONG line of DLCs that CK2 had, it already feels quite complete; as a matter of fact I feel like someone cut all the fat away. At the same time there's already a promising modding community out there, so this game's future looks like a 9+.. I'm new to Paradox titles and I must say out of the ones I've played, CK3 is by far my favorite. It has the right balance of complexity in the gameplay mechanics without being too over bearing, and the UI was purposely designed with the player in mind. I find play throughs very streamlined and dynamic, every playthrough is different and you can literally choose to play as any one of the characters at any given time, and there are easily 100+.. The best grand strategy out there on the market. Paradox did a fantastic job. There's just so much in this game you could replay it for years to come.. I had not given CK2 a chance because it seemed overwhelming but I bought CK3 with a friend to encourage my desire to play it, spectacular mechanics, the game punishes you if you are stupid or make absurd decisions, excellent customization strengthened by the mods. Without anything else to add a complete and totally enjoyable game.. Amazing. Very addictive. Soooo tired. A masterful symphony **** that is much simpler and easier to get into than ck2, while still retaining the general feeling from ck2. You could play the exact same ruler, with the exact same scenario a hundred times and have it still be different each time. The graphics have improved substantially and if you have some extra cash, you should definitely get this game, but wait for some of the DLCs to go on sale, 25 dollars for the Royal Court DLC is absurd.. It's a solid 6.5-7 for me. It's a fun game, but it feels a little flat when compared to CK2. Hopefully it grows into a better game. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 8.. My friend bought this game three days ago. He has been talking non-stop about it. I don't think he will ever stop. Send help. 10/10 game.. This game is total **** **** you **** eaters that think this game is good. Your all full of **** for like this game being sold for $60.. First of all, game is absolutely stunning and I really love it! Just one thing that I wish was different is giving random stats to rullers in beggning of every new games, I played Gilan and Saffarids empire, everytime in the start of new ones your rullers have new stats which effects your entire game! sometimes your ruller is stronger and sometimes weaker depends on your chance by the way score is 10!. Great UI, much easier to understand than earlier Paradox games. Missing some more for long games.. Nice bubble simulator They create a great game, potentially AMAZING and an history masterpiece around the stupid basic idea of a common MAP PAINTER. If they can fix this in futures Dlc (making hard way to conquer the world, make this impossoble with a lot of mecanism that they can put in, and focusing more on the rest of the expirience) the game can ideally easly get a 9,5 because yes, this game can really be a total giant masterpiece, but it is not, for that reasons. I.a. totally broken and is a shame for a strategik games. Game deserve a 6 or a 7 but i give 0 cause reviews are unfairs.. Another Paradox game where you start it and 6 hours fly by without even realising. Builds on everything CK2 did right, and by the time all of it's DLC comes out, I'll have sunk another 300 hours into it.. This is legitimately one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10 would castrate my uncle again.. This game is an unrewarding chore interspersed by occasionally interesting fragments of written text. Whether I owed a county, or a duchy, the game is pretty much the same. Children are born. Marriages happen. And players continue having to scrutinise the similar stat lines of hundreds of NPCs.. Your product is really great, but finally rename Russia to Rus. Russia is not successor of Rus!. This game is truly amazing and an absolute improvement over CK2 in almost every way. There are so many mechanics and fixes for the worst aspects of CK2 while improving on it in almost every way. I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment playing this gem.. Paradox wasn't actually busy sexually harassing employees while making this game, very good!. CK2 with improved graphics, interface and clipped content. Yes, the new CK does not have any content from Ck2's DLCs and you know what it means if you played paradox games before... For next ~5 years this game will have around 20 DLCs implementing content that already was in previous game.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 94 IIIIIIIIII====================. A feature rich masterpiece that has infinite replayability. You can be a cannibal mongol, a converso convert in castille that ironically does reconquista, a christian persian shah that deislamizes persia and conquers the caliphate in baghdad, a viking jarl that creates mega norway and converts England to paganism. Buy it right now.... Potentially good game but no Ukrainian language. If dont speak English well - dont bye it, there is a LOT text in the game.. Good graphics, repetitive and empty gameplay. We have to pay for a lot of dlc for play a decent game.. Big Paradox fan here. An amazingly made game. It is intimidating at first with everything going on. Once you get the hang of it though you'll find yourself **** into a world of strategy that is unlike any other! I still find myself feeling surprised by the game every once and a while. Absolutely worth your time. My only complaint is how many menus and things there are on the screen. It just feels a bit crazy to new players but I guess that might be part of the appeal for some people? Anywho I'm just glad to have finally figured out how to understand this thing.. Playing as a medieval lord is good, mechanics are good, need to be developed and added new stuff like ck2. Better graphics of course.. Could be better with the AIs in the game. Apart from the AI everything's great. The system of traits and lifestyle is quite interesting,. fantastic and incre","the game incorporates RPG elements by allowing you to play as a dynasty rather than a nation . the modding community is exceptional, second only to Hearts of Iron IV in terms of quality . the downside is the game tends to slow down as you progress ."
25.The House in Fata Morgana - Dreams of the Revenants Edition -,"This was definitely a unique ride of emotions; doubts, plot twists, and questions more than answers. This, The House in Fata Morgana is one of the greatest stories I've read, and I commend everyone who has made this game a huge success. Thank you so much for creating this masterpiece. I wish I could play it again for the first time. If you guys want mind-boggling, psychological, tragic, heart-warming elements in a game, then this game here is for you.. Greatest of all time. Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. Legend among legends. Peak fiction.. Absolutely brilliant visual novel. Shocking plot twists, an unusual yet alluring soundtrack and some beautiful art all in one package along with my personal favourite main character of all time. It was a little slow for the first 4 doors but I still loved them and doors 5-8 were impeccable.. The story is incredibly good and very emotional. The writing itself is top notch and its soundtrack is also excellent, with songs that complement the scenes well and enhance the experience. Personally I think the exposition could use some brevity at times, however that's just my subjective opinion. It's definitely the most emotional story I've experienced, and I can't recommend it enough.. The negative reviews are completely unjustified, they just aren't used to visual novels.. Covers a huge array of themes, and not just those you'd expect from a gothic horror story. Characters will in turn surprise you, disgust you and somehow the humanity at the core of each character and the story as a whole remains. A journey worth experiencing and knowing.. I ain’t even play it I just watched an hour long video but this **** fire. Play this game.. great story telling, great story telling,great story telling,great story telling,great story telling!!!. A beautiful storytelling masterpiece with the most emotionally reasonant and human characters in all of media.. The House in Fata Morgana is a one-of-a-kind visual novel that stands apart from the rest. Unlike the usual anime art style and tropes, this story employs a more realistic style and shading, perfectly complementing its serious and gothic tone. Set in a decrepit old mansion, the narrative immerses you in a haunting atmosphere that enhances its mystery and depth. The quality of both the soundtrack and the art is exceptional, and the story subverts expectations multiple times. The characters are deeply developed and masterfully written.While the visual novel can be a slow burner, stretching to around 40 hours, the payoff is well worth it in the long run. If you're looking for a beautiful mystery story that explores themes of tragedy, love, and forgiveness, this game will not disappoint.. While I understand this won't be everyone's cup of tea since Fata Morgana isn't a game, but a heavily text-based Visual Novel. But if you don't mind that and are here for some engrossing, rich in narrative story, then you will have a blast as this VN not only has some unexpected twists, but also a very well written cast, some very dark and heavy themes, memorable soundtracks and some pretty heartwarming romance.. I will never forget this VN. Its not much **** but hell of a story! Had a slow start but got better and better, made me cry, kept me interested and touched me deeply. Well worth the time if you dont mind reading. Sadly none of my friends are fond of reading so I cant share the experience but I would recommend it to everyone who likes a good dark story. Beautiful artwork and music as well, very original. However, I played the PC version and think the artwork is a little different for the switch but beautiful anyway. Story contains: Mystery, love, drama, tragedy, violence, fear, hate, passion, abuse, mutilation, hope, fate, plottwists, curse, different centuries, lgbtq, and more.. Masterpiece story, characters, OST & unusual visual style. I can't say that is my favorite story, but it's the BEST story I've ever seen or read. Peak fiction, barely a game but still. Great ost tho, songs like hex, giselle or everybody's crying are burned in my ears. Great story! I enjoyed every minute going through this. Even though there are just still images and music, they do a great job of creating atmosphere. This was my first graphic novel, so I was a little confused on how to bookmark my progress and pick up where I left off quickly. Wish there was a little more explanation on that but perfect otherwise.. One of the greatest stories ever told. Initially, a gothic-horror vibe is felt as you enter the mansion for the first time. A sense of uncanniness and desolation fills the air, made more apparent as you first meet the maid. The story goes in interesting and twisting ways, best-experienced blind. The game not only includes the main game but also its companion piece that further expands the characters and world of the novel. Visual Novels are not always games. This is a prime example of that; however, if you are a fan of storytelling and are willing to sit back, read, and let this novel weave its tale, then you will be in for an experience rarely had in other media.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. GOD THIS WAS AMAZING what a story. A House in Fata Morgana has the best story in any form of media I've ever seen, which makes this the best Visual Novel you can buy. A gut-wrenching story of betrayal, love, death.. This is a story about humanity at it's most primitive, vulnerable state, through the good, the bad and the terror that it can afflict. If all visual novels were this good there would not be other types of games. Do yourself a service and read this if you haven't yet, even if you don't think you like visual novels.. Well why is this a 10/10 how can this game just pressing one button surpass great games like soulsborn and rdr2 is it's overrated I don't think so it's simply a near perfect storywhitout a doubt this is the best story in any game of all time and maybe the best story in the existence the characters are human the development the plot twist the writing I'm not a fan of VN but this this is above anything else if you found it boring just try to get into door 5 after that is the best arc in fiction the best writing in fiction the best characters in fiction this masterpiece becomes my favourite game of all time and my favourite story of all time above the castlevania symphony of the and zelda ocarina of time I don't want to say anything about it about what's in the story but trust me it's flawless I can't name anything bad about it. The eerieness of the game stick with it until the end. the house in fata morgana is one of the most beautiful video game stories ever if not the most beautiful story, a perfect story accompanied by human and realistic characters, a perfect soundtrack, the best ever.. Make no mistake this is a visual novel. There should be no misconceptions about buying this with anything else in mind. The story when you invest past the introductions will blow your mind. It brings out emotions and feelings that I quite frankly haven't felt in a long time. It is one of a kind.. I want the developers over this game to create another masterpiece. I didn’t think I could enjoy a visual novel but I loved the storytelling and art in this. Story is top-tier.. Best story i ever read period and i felt robbed paying only 60 dllrs for this. i wish i could give moire money sice it doesnt let you down in any categorie, story,music,plotwists, after youre done you will remember that its not the destination its the journey since i didnt want this game to end.. Congratulations (or sorry) The House in Fata Morgana for being the only game that has Jacopo Fatamorgana in it.. I couldn't possibly find the right words to properly describe just how good this story was. I started it because someone said that at some point, ""it was better than berserk's best"", which I could hardly believe but I trusted the opinion, so I decided to check the game out. By the end, I could not believe just how well everything fell into place and how emotionally powerful of a story everything truly was. The best part about it though, in my opinion, was that every character felt human, which I believe is exactly what they were going for in the first place. Never once did I think, ""this doesn't make sense"" or ""no one would ever react this way"", and each character also had their own hopes, desires, faults, etc, that were all too human as well. All in all, an exceptional story that I truly enjoyed.. Excellent story, although convoluted at times. It's over a year since I finished this ""game"" and it has definitely been memorable.. Ever since I read The Sandman, I'd been wanting more to scratch my itch, and while the new Sandman universe titles are decent... THIS, this right here is PERFECTION, I wouldn't say that its like The Sandman or not but it scratches that itch perfectly. If you've read the original sandman, the comic series or the novel, not the audiobook or netflix adaptation then This game scratches that itch perfectly. Its not for everyone, just like some people I know didnt like the Sandman comic, it's crazy I know but this game is perfection and one of the best things about it, is that you get to play its sequel which is just as good if not more. The story is pure art, if i was a painting, if it was a painting it would be that 10 million dollar painting that can make people cry just by looking at it. Its is going to go down as one of the best written pieces of fiction ever created alongside the greats if only in the hearts of the 15 people who actually played it. How did this game even manage to get so little recognition is beyond me, its honestly an ACHIEVEMENT that something THIS good is so poorly recognized. Best game with the best story' i ever played, the music the story the graphic 10 out of 10. If you are not familiar with visual novels, it's important to be aware that this is not a videogame in the traditional sense - there is virtually no gameplay. Think of it more as a book with images and sound. You will be doing A LOT of reading. That being said, this is the best book I have ever read in my life. I can say with 100% honesty that no other work of fiction has ever made me cry this much. It's also the first videogame EVER that, on the same day that I finished it, I immediately started a new game to replay it all again. Seriously, please read this, and stick with it for a while because it starts a bit slow.. Just stunning . I got goosebumps playing this. I even cried at times. Artwork and music create a surreal atmosphere that you have to experience. Just wow!. Pure perfection.. I have played a fair amount of Visual Novels and honestly I find this one to be upright excellence. The writting is poetic. The plot is flawless and incredibly well-thought with some serious plot twists. The game touches human sentiment to a huge scale, which makes the characters and most situations in game unforgettable. The artsyle is outstanding, fitting perfectly with the theme. And the soundtrack is just exceptional. I could even say it is some of the few I find that good in games. You have to read this masterpiece.. Truly the most powerful, poignant, and well executed narrative in all of the fiction I’ve encountered. An absolutely essential experience.. Having finally reached a proper ending, I'm left with very mixed feelings. It started off nicely with enough mystery and intrigue to reel me in. The writing was a bit stilted but didn't bother me at first. The story, at its core, is truly compelling. The way the seemingly unconnected stories slowly unravel and interweave is incredibly impressive but there is so much redundancy and unnecessary sub-plot. I don't feel like any of the ""choices"" it occasionally offers do anything but sandbag the reader if unlucky enough to pick the wrong option. There are some really exciting moments, but, man, does it drag. The plentiful dialogue feels unnaturally bloated the way a lot of Japanese-translated games do. The final climax was intense and emotional. I was on the edge of my seat, tears welling up in my eyes - very moving stuff - but then it just kept going! On and on, cast credits, epilogue upon epilogue, staff credits, more epilogue. A proper narrator and a discriminating editor would have done this game so much good! It would have been better as a regular novel in my opinion. I went in with an open mind and tempered expectations but it was a bumpy ride for all its high points.. After playing the game I can still taste sh-t in my mouth this thing was so bad that if you wanted a good time might as well buy it just to break it the story is bad and my thumb is sore from pressing A so much. The best VN i have played!! You need to be so numb as **** to give 0-3 score like the kids in this site lol.. terrible gameplay, this game is so lazy and is really not good it all, very boring. this game is boring. the gameplay is not good. anything here is so bad, dont like it. The House In Fata Morgana is really phenomenal in every aspect. Intricate plot, beautiful storytelling, morally conflicting characters, great character dynamic accompanied by gorgeous art and music. Fata Morgana is a story about overcoming trauma, understanding each other, looking through a scene with different perspective.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I will come back and write a proper review when I believe I have found the words to describe just how beautiful this game is. A story that sticks with you, like when I watched Forest Gump for the first time I knew it would be one I come back to again and never grow tired of. A story that gives you a meaningful experience and perspective like when I read past the prologue in Vinland Saga for the first time. Like all great stories and even masterpieces they are not for everyone, but at the end of it all, these stories did what they set out to do masterfully and The House In Fata Morgana did so in stride. The story in The House in Fata Morgana is an extremely impactful web woven together carefully and in a very natural and believable manner within its own narrative, allowing the many vibrant and intricate charaters that you will grow to either love, hate, or at least understand thrive within it. The characters that thrive within this story are complex, fickle, cruel, kind, weak, strong, and most of all human. Along with the masterfully done plot and characters it is coupled with a soundtrack just as impressive and used in the right way for all the right moments to help envelope you in the history of the mansion as the maid takes your hand and guides you through it, imploring you to never let go. The character art and backgrounds really standout in this visual novel especially among other visual novels in a great way. The style of art used compliments the story perfectly for the tone it has set, from the backgrounds to the character art. The additional stories included in the Dreams of Revenant edition add greatly to the base experience, with Requiem of Innocence despite being more linear in it's narrative rivaling the main story and in my opinion just as emotionally impactful. My hope is that you will allow the story to open the door to yourself as you open it's doors and find the same faint yet powerful sense of hope that can be found within this beautiful and grim narrative to it's climax along side the characters.. One of, if not the best stories I've experienced. Incredible soundtrack and art.. The best story I've ever **** music, the characters, the atmosphere, there are not enough words to describe how much I love this novel. Thank you, Novect.. Cool!!! Didn't know my switch could become a E-book reader POCKETBOOK Touch Hd 3 Grey.. it's a goodish visual novel, and only attractive to a very small niche. Personally, I didn't enjoy it, and I don't believe this game should be ranked this high.. This isn't a game. How come Citizen Kane isn't on the best games of all time list?. its a visual novel and is no where near the leagues of botw and odyssey so it just should not be rated near them. No gameplay, you just read text. If you really want to read a lot of text and at least have a bit of gameplay play pokemon rangers. 96/100?! That’s 1 point off from amazing games like Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2, GTA 4 & 5, Red Dead Redemption II and some Tony Hawk games! And don’t worry, I’m not just hating on it for the sake of it, it’s bad too. It’s literally just a visual novel with BARELY any interactivity, if this was like DDLC where you still do you’re own thing that’d be fine, but no, you have NOTHING to do with the plot, it’s basically a movie at that point… SO WHY NOT JUST MAKE A MOVIE?! Long story short isn’t as good as Sonic 06 or some dumb joke. This is one of the most overrated games ever. I played my fare share of VNs and this one is mediocre at best. It's tedious. I mean TEDIOUS. Pacing is horrible. Story itself is alright, but nothing to write home about. But IMO the biggest problem of that game is dialogues... It's something 14 years old girls writting in their blogs. It's so... Unrealistic. Poorly written. Cheesy. I don't recommend this game. Go play Stein's Gate or Zero Escape series.. I love black people but sadly there are none in this game but besides that its pretty solid.. It’s a brilliant Visual Novel, with a incredible story, if you like the good books, you’ll like this, art, music, … all is fantastic.. an almost perfect visual novel experience. it touched me deeply, shook me to my core and left me feeling seen and sad. a melancholy affair, i felt joy, despair, anger, hatred, delight and catharsis going through it. it handles the vast majority of its heavy, heavy subject matters with grace and respect that most media barely puts in the time for. the music is incredible, the characters are incredible, the story is intense, violent and as dark as pitch. it’s also a wonderfully hopeful story about redemption and forgiveness. what a journey. PLEASE do look at the trigger warnings going into it. it is a dark game.. Fantastic plot without visible holes, everything has been completely explained. I had a great time to read this VN. Definitely recommended. This game is one of the most wonderful story in a visual novel. It's a tragedy from start to end, and nothing will make you smile. This game includes the main story, a prequel story which is glossed over in the main story, and a switch only post story about some characters. The music is great, and i'd speak for the fact that the 3 first chapters of the main story are the slowest ones, because they establish context of a really complex tragedy.. Incredible. I have no words to describe how good this visual novel is. I used to read quite a bit and this would be one of the best things ive ever read as a standalone novel. If it helps, my background and tastes are that of a single-player western and jrpg story driven gamer or rpg-like games like god of war. There can be pacing issues esp near the beginning but stick through it. It hits you right in the feels and all i wish is that novectacle develops more than these. If youre listening novectacle this is art, please!. The Visual novel genre is something difficult to understand and it's clearly not for everyone. But that goes for any genre, you can't be a fan of everything out there. That said, when something gets the highest of praise it can be just enough to get you to learn and fall love with a genre you weren't keen on before. Is The House in Fata Morgana that game? Well no, it isn’t. This has nothing to do with this game lacking actually gameplay elements. A visual novel game that contains only a story to click through can be perfectly fine if the story is good enough and the visuals, music, sound and text all complaint the story. But House in Fata Morgana fails in doing that by several ways. For one, it's far too long. But that has to do with its pacing. Almost 50% of its text doesn't need to be there. Something happens, a character says something and then the exact progress repeats itself with text just being slightly different to feel new while you’re just being reminded of the thing that just happened or has been said. Is a character evil? Here are several scenes to show you just how evil he or she is, even though it was obvious from the start. Or things are being described while there is no need for it. This is a visual novel, so we see the characters and the background so there’s no need for descriptions of what we see and yet this happens constantly. Everything gets stretches out far more than it needs to be and that causes this game to feel incredibly slow and more like quantity over quality. It’s structure is also not good. You start as a character who doesn’t know who he or she is so the chapters are treated as memories, so after several chapters it is implied that you’ve regained your memory and the story ends there (and you can choose so, for a very lousy ending) only for it actually be just the beginning of this tale. Even one of these memories is called out by the main character as bad so why did the game made us sit through a useless, boring memory if only for it to be a twist? And that’s what this story relies on too heavily, twists. Twists just for the sake of twists. You’ll quickly become so use to them that nothing feels shocking anymore (and that while this game deals with some very dark themes) and the twists serve little to no purpose other than to make things feel ‘scary’. The art and music also doesn’t stand out. It’s very basic. Backgrounds are bland stock photos and the characters look like they’ve been drawn by several different artists who didn’t align their artwork together. The music is more annoying than pleasant and it only gets stuck in your head because it keeps looping like crazy. House in Fata Morgana is not good. It is strange that it gets such high praise while it clearly has some huge flaws. It is a story with dark moments, yet it is written as if it is for children. I can only give it credit for keeping me curious at the start, with the promise of it becoming better later on and it all to be worth it. But it doesn't. If you’re not of a fan of the genre, this will not change your mind.. I never know what I'm getting into with a manga or graphic novel, but this one was legitimately great.. It's a visual novel, so it's very light on gameplay. Think of it more like a book with some visuals and an unbelievable soundtrack. If you like a deep complex story and character interactions, definately check this out. It is definately the best VN I've ever played.. Somehow a visual novel made it as the top Switch game of the year... seriously?. The best VN I haver played. Stunning soundtrack. Great art. Mind-blowing, emotional and intense story. In my opinion, a true and mature masterpiece.. It's an evolution of storytelling in any entertainment product. Unparalleled craftsmanship in writing, creating mystery, and atmosphere. The horrific story turns will blow up your mind . Fata Maroqa is the pinnacle of visual novels.. The House of Fata Morgana beautifully tells one of the most disturbing stories I have ever read. You will see some of the ugliest aspects of human nature, you will see multiple depressing tragedies, your emotions will be greatly provoked. But in the end, it will be worth your time. Even in the most bitter coffee, there some sweetness hide within it. Additionally, The House of Fata Morgana has many beautiful soundtrack to elevate the emotions further. Some of the tracks become my daily playlist along with Nier, Final Fantasy, Chrono and Xeno series soundtrack.. made an account just to give this masterpiece a 10, it sure seems all the Gamers with a capital G must be really upset about how high a rating this game has gotten since they’re illiterate and can’t sit through more than five minutes of inaction before requiring a QTE to keep their attention, but this visual novel genuinely pushes the boundaries of the medium and presents one of the most phenomenal stories i’ve ever witnessed. sorry to everyone complaining that there aren’t more fight scenes, maybe stick to your shallow aaa releases with about as much narrative depth as you could fit on a napkin or your rose-tinted circlejerks over (often nintendo) games that in reality have aged as well as milk sitting out in the sun next time.. The art, the music, the atmosphere, all are suitable and perfect. It is one of the best visual novels out there.. Visual Novels are NOT games, stop labeling them as such. This kind of practice is destroying the industry nearly as much as microtransactions.. I consider this the gold standard for mystery visual novels alongside Umineko and for good reason. The setting, the characters, the premise, the design, everything is unique and gives readers hands down, one of the best experiences I've ever had a playing a game. True, the game lags at times and I've had to put it aside a couple of times, but with a payoff such as that I cannot argue with the score.. How can this thing take such a high rating when it's not even a game very disappointed.. I absolutely loved this. What an incredible tale of tragedy and layered consequences of selfish actions. The story is a slow burn and takes a bit of time to set the stage, but really comes with the gut punches in the fourth act. I don't want to spoil anything, so just strap in and let this game enrapture you.. I you DID complete this VN at least 2 times, you will turn back to give 10 scores like me.. There's no guns or rpg mechanics or cars or anything. The story is good but it's so boring and not even a game. It cannot even compare to the godlike masterpiece that is DDLC which only real gamers play. Literally the worst game every made -0/10. My favorite VN of all time Fata is a story about humanity, in a way. What makes people commit the actions they commit, how we influence others, and how we're influenced, and how we learn to love, to open up, to accpet others into our lives, and most importantly, finding it within ourselves to understand each other. Fata does this to such a great extent, in a way that doesn't feel cliched or in a way that feels forced. Throughout the course of it, you see the worst of people, and yet you see what causes ""the worst"" in them. There's never something as simple as ""good and evil"", and people never are under those two labels. People are people, because we are forged by others, whether good and bad. It's an incredibly potent message, and its amplified so well through the protagonist, who experiences this through their own character journey and through others, and how they begin to open up, and cause others to open up at the same time, and allow them to understand others.. This is one of the greatest games I have ever played, an amazing and engaging experience. 5 Stars, 100/100, 10/10, not a single doubt. However, I’m using the term “game” broadly. I have seen those stupid clickbait articles saying “Is Fata Morgana better than Zelda BotW or Mario Odyssey?” or some other ridiculous variation… And I believe the answer is that you can’t compare THIFM with what people traditionally think of as “game”. It sounds weird, but this game does not have gameplay at all, no great bosses, no level design… In fact, not even compared with other graphic novels I have played, in which there are way more decision points and timed choices or weird control maneuvers to spice things up gameplay-wise… There is not much of that here. I see why some people do not consider it a game in the strict sense. So be careful, because even if it is a great game, maybe it is not your cup of tea. THIFM is more like a book, a more innovative book that not only provides the story through plain text, but gives you also great and immersive music, art, and a sense of aesthetics and presentation that fits the general atmosphere of each section (happy, scary, nostalgic, dramatic) and takes the story to the next level. I believe the developer takes a traditional book, and elevates it using all these different aspects made available by the gaming platform (pacing, delivery, presentation, music, art…) very effectively, creating an amazing experience. I’m confident this story (if properly written and paced) would have been great in a traditional book… I mean, the story in itself is great! But the other ingredients make it much better, much in the same way that a tabletop game sometimes feels better and new in a console thanks to quirks and design decisions that expand on the concept. THIFM is long; it starts as if you will see a series of short stories, and unfolds slowly towards what ends up being a long and intricate narrative. For me it was a bit frustrating as I wanted to finish it and finally discover what the whole deal was about, so when other chapters kept appearing it felt a bit like grinding. I wish I knew in advance its expected length, I’d have enjoyed it more… In a book you know how many pages are left so you have some awareness of how much is still ahead… With the game it is different, and it was difficult for me to have a general idea of how much progress I was making, as I felt I was about to finish and boom! Another 10 hours of gameplay… THIFM takes its time to present its characters and unfold its story. Sometimes it felt as if there was a dialogue between characters that was unnecessary and not moving the plot forward… You are all engaged and wanting to see how everything will fit and the characters end up talking about roses or how nice the sea was or how long it will take for a train to be ready… So in that aspect it might feel a bit longer than needed. However, I believe this is a crucial aspect of the game, as it makes all characters and situation in each specific era feel more real and deep… Through this apparently superficial exchanges you get to know these characters intimately… They give you a glimpse of their fears, their wants, their internal conflicts… And that gives more power to the whole story… So, when you are presented with the more dramatic portions you really feel the rage and sadness as if all the awful things narrated happened to a dear friend. I played this game on my switch in portable mode, lying in bed all engrossed as 9 PM turned into 3 AM and I kept advancing and advancing… There are some portions of the game that I wish I had seen in TV mode, and I feel the game will be effective on any platform, as long as you give it time to grow and develop and take the story as it comes… If you love good stories and twists, try it and prepare for 30+ hours of great characters, settings and stories. TLDR; The House in Fata Morgana might not be for everyone, but if you love reading and like fiction, it is one of the greatest gaming experiences available on Nintendo Switch. Do not miss it!. Go read a book if you like stuff like this. Why in God's name is it rated so high? Pathetic. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the most powerful stories you'll experience in any medium. Yes there's little to no gameplay, but that's not what you're here for. You're here for a tale that'll stick with you for the rest of your life.. The game is bland, original, and derivative. Why it's top 4 of the greatest games of all time is absolutely absurd. The devs should be ashamed of making such a terrible effing game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Recently finished 9.9.9, am playing Danganronpa, and so recently bought this because it's the ""best game on Switch"". Not even by its own genre standards, this is not a good visual novel. Less player engagement than the previously mentioned games, and from a visual novel perspective very dull and slow in terms of pacing. This","the house in fata Morgana is a one-of-a-kind visual novel . it covers a huge array of themes, not just those you'd expect from a gothic horror story . the writing itself is top notch and its soundtrack is also excellent ."
250.Battlefield 2,"Favorite game of all time. It redefined how multiplayer PC will be played in the coming decades.. Best Battlefield by far.. Considered an all-time classic, but not for me. Battlefield 2 is considered an all-time classic and a gem ****. Sadly, I cannot share this opinion. It certainly does have something to do with the fact that I was really bad at it, but even today, I still think this game is boring, unfair and the maps too big. Of course, I will back this up with arguments. It all started for me when I discovered that this is a multiplayer only game. I did not know any better back then and was expecting a campaign mode, like the Call of Duty games and the previous Battlefield games. It was not there, and while this was certainly my own fault, it still disappointed me. Graphically, this game looked, and still looks, amazing. The detail in the surroundings, buildings and vehicles is really nice, the sun and weather effects still make this game feel very realistic. The animations and walk cycles look great too and I only wished that I could experience this beautiful graphics in a campaign mode in the game back then. The sound is solid and bullet impacts and explosions sound amazing. It really feels like an all-out war and I cannot complain about the sound design whatsoever. The controls for moving, shooting and aiming work fine but I found the many different things and inventory screens a little confusing. It is certainly not as easy as Call of Duty in terms of understanding the controls and menus. The combat itself is far more realistic then Call of Duty and for this reason, aiming and killing your enemy is a lot harder in my opinion. When I accepted the fact that was multiplayer only, I got started and was ready to play some matches. Immediately, I felt miserable, and I hated every second of every match. This was because of two factors: Firstly, the maps in Battlefield 2 are massive. Not big, not huge, massive. It felt like an entire continent was placed in a single map. There is room for half the population of earth to fit into a single map of Battlefield 2. This all sounds fun and dandy, but when trying to reach an enemy point to capture or simply search for someone to shoot, it felt like walking through five marathons in a row before I saw something of interest. And when I saw something of interest, after walking a thousand miles, it was the bullet that landed between my eyes. I died, re-spawned and needed to walk to the end of the world and back again. Many times, an encounter with another player took ten minutes to reach and when it did, it was two seconds of fun and tension, before I bit the dust and needed to start over. Yes, I mentioned walking to every place. I am well aware of the many, many vehicles in the game that you can use to navigate easier and faster around the map. But now, we arrived at my personal vendetta number two: At the start of the game, all the vehicles are snatched away and take off in mere seconds, leaving me and some other unlucky noobs behind, forcing me to walk everywhere. It was really impressive and mind-blowingly ridiculous to see how incredible fast the vehicles are taken and blast away, leaving you to choke in the tire smoke and exhaust fumes. It really felt like Black Friday and when the countdown was over, it was every man for himself, trying to get some sweet wheels. No matter how hard I ran, how much I begged in the chat as a pathetic child to wait for me or give me a chance to ride along, it was always: “sorry bro, git gut”. My biggest challenge in the game, besides not dying or killing one single player in a match, was getting to a vehicle. I tried so, so hard but I never made it to one single APC or truck. This experience made me hate the game to a level that I cannot express in words. Like I said before, I **** really hard at the game and to call me a noob in Battlefield 2 would be an understatement. However, I just felt that I did not get a fair chance to learn or to get better at the game. The vehicle snatching, the endless walks, the insta-deaths from an unseen enemy five hundred miles away, the huge environments with nothing to do except dying made me really hate Battlefield 2. I despised the game, and this feeling has not changed to this day. So, based om my personal experience, I would not recommend this game.. The best game of my life. Spend so much time playing it. So fun and chalenging. I have found so many friends in this game so we became friends in real life. Hate EA so much for shut downing servers and community servers.. Funny Awesome Game Score 90 Full Action Game Full Action Game Funny Awesome Game. While this one doesn't even have a story, it's focused 100% on online........ After the success of Battlefield 1942, the second edition saw a nice improvement in graphics! Undoubtedly, all BF marked the time and this one was no different.. This was a blast at LAN parties with friends and lots of NPCs driving and shooting around, causing mayhem. I had great time playing it.. One of the best Games of the Series and a true cornerstone to the Battlefield Franchise! Buy!. Nine year old me would rate it a 10, so i did the same...................... I played the game long time ago, when I was still going to school (I am 25 now) and it was the first Battlefield game I have ever played and man, I loved the game. I didn't have internet back then so I played with bots but still the experience was amazing. Now when I think about the fact BF2 was released in 2o05 it blows my mind - the game was definitely ahead of its time. I am sure you still can boot it up and have plenty of fun with it.. Battlefield 2 is one of those rare games that only comes along every now and then. Some players may be put of by environments being smaller than those in previous entries to the series, but from the start of the mach until the score readout, Battlefield is one journey you don't want to miss.. Great refresh after bf1942. Was nice to have some updated guns and vehicles but was said no navy like bf1942. Best Battlefield all the time, this is a real game, not casual trash like the new ones!. my childhood game i played again and thats beatiful my first played fps game. This is the second bf I played and I didn't had fun with it. Big and open map but it is just meh to me.. Best BF game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! And My favourite battlefield game. this game is very playable in 2021. I prefer playing this game.. This is best battlefield gamer ever to many maps (you can download from extra more maps) very very beatiful expension packs and very nice gameplay. Disclaimer: the BF2 community is still alive on PC (usually 100-200 players online) as of 2020. See BF2Hub for more info if you're interesting in playing again. YMMV Singleplayer: since patch 1.5, the single player features twenty maps to play on against bots. By default, only the 16-player version of the maps are available but the 32 and 64 player variants are available via mods. The singleplayer is not representative of the multiplayer experience due to the simplistic AI. Multiplayer: LAN parties, ranked servers, and unranked servers are all available to players to choose from. The options provided to server owners are excellent and are becoming increasingly rarer in newer titles. Maps: BF2 featured 12 maps on launch, 4 post-launch maps added via patches, and 6 booster pack maps made free via patch 1.5. The map design in this game is probably the best in the entire franchise with all-time greats such as Gulf of Oman, Karkand, Sharqi, Wake Island 2007, Kubra Dam, and many others. They are very well balanced, provided opportunities for diverse playstyles, and facilitated a great flow to them. New features: Battlerecorder allowed players to download files that had individual matches, Commander facilitated more teamwork than 1942, the 7 class system had new features like reviving, sprinting was now present in the game. Mods: BF2 had a great modding community with one in particular, Project Reality, having a profound influence on future milsim titles. Forgotten Hope 2 was a WW2 mod for this game and is imo the best one available. Pitfalls: unfortunately not everything was great about BF2. 5 of 7 classes carried 4 frag grenades when caused grenade spam on most maps, claymores couldn't be easily disposed of and locked down chokepoints, servers were unstable and hitreg was unacceptable. Air-land balance was very poor as well because the mobile AA was a joke, TV missiles were one shot kills against all vehicles, twin seat bombers wasted everything beneath them. Overall, this game gets a 91/100. Although it had problems with bugs and crashes during the beginning of its lifespan, it went on to deliver one of the greatest multiplayer FPS experiences I've ever had and is a top 3 BF game.. Absolute masterpiece at the time of release. One of the best multiplayer games, where communication was the key. I remember to this day playing with one dude almost everyday, almost always in a chopper :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games in BF series. This game was the foundation of battlefield multiplayer.. The game is good. It has an unusual mechanic that was only in this series of games. The level of AI has increased.. All around great online shooter for low end PCs. Mod support and community-ran online systems keep it running well, even today. It has its fair share of age, though. Even with a good connection, there is the occasional lag or hitch.. Best FPS of the past decade !!! BF2 at the time it was the most beautiful the best and the most fun DICE and EA GAMES got lost in time. I have decided to give Battlefield 2 a go, after reading in various places that it is the best Battlefield title. Having played and enjoyed Battlefield 1942 when it came out, I was curious how its sequel holds up 13 years after its release. To my disappointment, I have found it to be a mediocre game by today’s standards. In my opinion, everything Battlefield 2 tried to achieve, is done better by another online shooter in 2018. Note that I am very fond of classic shooters and do not mind wearing my nostalgia goggles at all. Yet, I did not enjoy the time I have spent playing Battlefield 2. First and foremost, that horrid game presentation. The game menu has such a bad design and does a wonderful job making you lose the little excitement you have until you spawn. You choose a class which ranges from medic to engineer and the game encourages team play. The more you play the game, the better weapons you can unlock. In a way, Battlefield 2 is one of the early examples where the developers implemented grinding into online FPSs. It is true that you do not need better weapons to be able to kill your enemies, yet they do make a difference. Unfortunately, I did not spend enough time to find out how long you need to invest to get higher up the ranks, mainly due to some gameplay elements which I did not find enjoyable. Combat feels like a huge mess. From aircrafts consistently bombarding the map, to infantry throwing grenades to every possible square, the game made me feel overwhelmed with its imbalanced and chaotic design. Let’s not forget that you can literally throw grenades to very long distances and bunny hop the whole time while you are engaged in combat (provided you have stamina), the game was far from finding the sweet spot for me in an arcadey shooter. Last, but not the least, the shooting mechanics are quite poor and do not feel satisfying. There are, however, still some objectively good things about Battlefield 2, mainly the audio design and the open world feeling that does not feel dumbed down. Sound effects are very impressive and the native language voiceovers add a good amount of realism. Graphics are ahead of its time and the explosions look good. To give the game its due, Battlefield 2 is not a dull shooter trying to appeal to console gamers the way its sequels are. In its large map, you can immerse yourself and implement your own strategy to reach your goal. The maps also have a distinct and good design. To summarize, I did not love Battlefield 2, the way many others do. I know it is often regarded as the best Battlefield game ever made, which is probably not very far from the truth (although I prefer Battlefield 1942) considering how bad the modern Battlefield games are. I do get why the game can be charming for some players, but unfortunately it just did not click for me, as a new player in 2018.. Battlefiled 1942 and 2 were a great games and i enjoyed playing them for a long time some things in battlefield 1942 were just great like both the teams having a aircraft carrier which they could take anywhere around the island map and many other fetures which are yet to be explored in the latest battlefield games. Going to battlefiled 2, well that game is a marvel, a could improve on player freedom but never the less a master piece.. Battlefield 2 is a classic. The vehicles, environments, classes, and weapons were spot-on. The loading themes for the factions are great. Sure there were expansions and booster packs for this game, but Vanilla still needed more maps, besides Kubra Dam and Mashtuur City.. Battlefield 2 is a true evolution from both 1942 and Vietnam. By bringing the Battlefield franchise to the 21st century, and adding heaps of new vehicles, weapons, and other war devices, Battlefield 2 ended up being one of the best multiplayer experiences of 2005. I am sure people are still online, playing this amazing game, and more power to them. However, like the other classic BF games, the graphics are very poor my modern standards, so be prepared for that.. This was one of the worst BF games, I decided to go back and play it again for old time sake and the game has aged poorly, now I noticed how inaccurate the rifles are; how useless the AI is. Capturing enemy outposts is often deadly due to insta-death rocket barrages which you can't dodge, evade or hide from...even if you're in a building apparently.. Honestly, Battlefield 1942 is twice the game this is, even now BF1942 still has good replayability. This game is a stinker, and judging by the reviews - paid reviews was a problem back in 2005.. In ten years, we'll look back on the closure of EA and the landmark events that caused it's inevitable collapse. One of the key extinction events took place in 2005 with the release of Battlefield 2 and EA's handling of the franchise from that moment onward. Battlefield 2 was a landmark event in the history of gaming and often discussed a decade later as ""the best"" of the franchise. Mind you, over a dozen Battlefield games have come out since 2 and yet it's still regarded as top-tier. It's fanbase was so rabid that even after the release of 4, EA continued to offer exclusive deals to the die-hard fans still playing 2 and refusing to ""upgrade"" to 3 or 4. When EA finally took the axe to 2's servers and filed cease orders to those running ""unauthorized"" hub servers for people to continue to play 2, the fanbase went and funded Squad, a spiritual sequel to Project Reality, a BF2 mod that proved to be hugely popular eight years well after launch. Battlefield 2 and the way it was handled by EA went on to make many enemies of both the publisher and the franchise itself, a lot of it's concepts where lifted straight from an earlier game - Planetside. Top-down commander view, orbital strikes, supply drops, drawing on the map and directing combat from a handheld computer all went on to be core aspects of 2. EA took it a step further by making an even more direct rip off of Planetside, Battlefield 2142, shamelessly lifting everything from the hover tank design to the giant walker mechs straight from it, prompting Sony to cut support for Planetside and focus on something EA wouldn't fight them for - Everquest. EA went on to release a million dlc packs for Battlefield 2, creating an uneven and outright difficult multiplayer environment where the servers would boot you if you didn't own things like ""european armored combat 4"" which wasn't available as a digital download, you had to go to the local PC World and buy a boxed copy of it for 30$ so that one tank skin the server was running would load. At the time, EA cited ""bandwith costs"" as the reason behind their refusal to allow for digital DLC, going so far as to buy ""Direct-2-Drive"" and create a borderline spyware application called EA Downloader. After a lawsuit, even this service was shut down and it wouldn't be until the disaster called Origin reared it's ugly head did digital downloads and dlc become accessible. By then, the juggernaut of Steam had risen to the top and sat comfortably atop it's golden gaben throne. When EA pulled it's games off Steam, some argue Battlefield 2 was hit hardest - It still had a healthy, active multiplayer scene, but to recruit your friends to play required them to run EA's junk while you played DRM-free on Steam without them. It was difficult to talk people through the complex patching methods, considering the original game was six disks and the expansions had to be installed after a clean-start of the original game. EA truly shot themselves in the foot and would continue to do so time after time, year after year, until it's final closure and liquidation in 2025.. Gameplay : 8 Graphics : 7 Story : 5 Sound : 8 ********************************************************************************** Overall : 8. A masterpiece. One of my favorite Games in all time. Sadly Dice/EA hasn't kept Offline singleplayer sessions with Bots what i would really appreciate. Still playing this Game in 2016 with in Fanmade multiplayer project.. Was a really nice game, i will miss it, but Battlefield 2142 was better. Still 2 good games!!! I played it a lot. It was really funny and cool, good all times is the best time. Many a good time was had playing this game back in the day. Every match played out differently. Maps were actually designed for 64 players - unlike the claustrophobic corridor shooter BF3 and BF4 maps. Commanders and squad leaders had an important role to play as did the many different classes. Helicopters could barrel roll and had a decent amount of agility. Grab 5 of your friends and spend the night yelling and screaming at each other with joy. Good times.. The best bf game to date fantastic maps,guns vehicles,spawns,team work and bla bla bla bla bla bla 10/10 i miss the old bf2 days soooo muchhhhhhhhhhhh. For me it is the best I've played Battlefield before. The game manages to bring an atmosphere, a very good multiplayer. A great game for that year. .. NOTE: As of July 2014 the Gamespy servers were shut down forever. Use GameRanger to play online. I really tried to enjoy this game while playing it online but I couldn't. In theory it's a very good game, but in practice it was one of the most frustrating game I've ever played. One main problem is the overall balance, opposed to what BF1942 was about BF2 it's an unbalanced mess. The infantry gameplay is terrible, a lot of explosives spam, inaccurate and unbalanced weapons. The land vehicles combat is very good but it's ruined by the overpowered air vehicles. What it does well it's the teamwork aspect, with the introduction of the squad system, the commo-rose and the commander BF2 can offer a lot of good teamwork. Too bad the netcode and the hit registration are terrible (probably the worst in the FPS games). Funny thing is you can have a lot of fun while playing it on LAN.. Battlefield 2. My friends at school all really love one of two series: Battlefield or Call of Duty. What really ticks me off about it is that the popular kids all really like Call of Duty, which I consider terrible, and the unpopular kids really like Battlefield. It just goes to show you that these two franchises are at war with each other, and it has had really dire side effects on the world at large. I however, have chosen not to take a side in this war. I've only played the best games of these two franchises and that was it. I have already reviewed Call of Duty 4, which I thought was one of the worst games I've ever played. Now I'm reviewing the best Battlefield game, Battlefield 2. So, is this series really better than Call of Duty in every way, or do all modern warfare shooters totally **** after all? Let's find out. This game is an absolute blast to play! It is an online shooter with massive battlefields to fight on, and massive armies to fight with. This game really captures what it's like to be a member of the army and fight on huge battlefields. This game has only one gameplay mode, but because every map is so huge, when the game starts to feel old, other maps make it feel new again. This gameplay mode is conquest. In conquest, the two armies must fight to take control of the entire map, by taking over all of the control points. There is also a reinforcement counter, which shows how many more units on an army can spawn on the battlefield. Once one team controls more control points than the other, the other team starts losing reinforcements. The first team to take control of all of the control points, or get rid of all of the opposing team's reinforcements (this can also be done by simply killing the enemy as opposed to taking control points) wins. This game also emphasizes teamwork quite a bit. It is highly recommended that you get in a squad as early as possible. Also, if you are getting bored of going on foot to fight, or you have to take a long walk to an enemy control point, don't worry about it. There are also several vehicles to drive such as buggys, tanks, fighter jets, and even boats. This game also controls like your average shooter, so you don't have much to worry about in the controls department. In fact, this game is so fun, that the only real problem I have with it other than having only one game mode is that the jets and helicopters are really hard to fly. I found it insanely difficult to fly both air vehicles. However, it just goes to show you that this game has a good learning curve. The AI of this game can also be a challenge, which makes the game much more interesting. They do have a few problems here and there, but nothing major such as just sitting there doing nothing. Overall, no matter how you want to play this game, it will be fun no matter what. As for the graphics, while they may not be as good as Half-Life 2, which came out a year before this, they are still great graphics for their time. Everything in this game is very well detailed, looks the way it should, and perfectly replicates this game's modern warfare setting. It has settings in the United States of America, China, and the Middle East. All of these settings look about how you would expect in a modern day setting. The buildings, vehicles, and character models all look quite good. The only real problem that exists with the graphics is that despite how good they look, they might be a bit dated. Overall, the graphics of this game are great, if a bit dated. As for the presentation, it's great too. The menus can be a bit confusing sometimes, and the tutorials can be a bit confusing, but that's about it. Otherwise, this game has all of the modern military forces you would expect. Of course the U.S. Army is in this game, along with the Chinese, European Union, and Mecca armies. This game definitely presents itself as an excellent multiplayer shooter, and it succeeds in that respect. Overall, this game is a fantastic multiplayer shooter. It has everything good you would come to expect from a multiplayer shooter and more. The battles may be long, but that's just how they should be. In the end, I haven't chosen a side in the war between Call of Duty and Battlefield, but if I did, I would definitely choose Battlefield. Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 9/10 Presentation: 8/10 Overall: 9/10. I miss the days before all this modern-aged shooters like Call of Duty:Puppies and Bugfield 4...I am still playing this game with my cousin and a bunch of friends and it is **** you have never play it,give it a shot!. This game is a Masterpiece !!!! Is the best game in the series with great big maps, balance cases and guns with recoil :) This and 1942 are the diamante of DICE.. A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it A really fun game that's it. The Maps are awesome, the weapons are awesome, the Engine for that release year is still good and everything else is awesome! Now you got BF4 and all this new stuff, but if you imagine, how BF2 was like BF4 back then. I prefer BF2 over the other ones, even if i only bought it last year. Still there are active people playing and new people too! Its just sad, that no one plays the Special Forces DLC. Its a good DLC in my opinion, but the people care about the main game and the DLCs, that are build into the game, and not have to be started over the main game. This game is also moddable and has awesome mods like FORGOTTEN HOPE 2 and PROJECT REALITY with servers and players!. Still the war-FPS that all others should be compared to. BF3 and 4 were console ports, and aimed for bad players with the no-recoil and tons of crutch weapons. Those are war arcade shooters. BF2 is a squad based tactical war-FPS. I miss this game, best FPS ever made.. The original massive battle arena. I spent huge amounts of hours in this game and am glad i did. Tons of fun.Online shooters don't come much better than this old gem.. I tried to go back to playing this game recently, and the ballistics is terrible. I'm not complaining because there is no bullet drop, but the bullets simply do not hit where you are aiming most the time. Instead of recoiling your shots just radiate further and further away from your aim point. So I tired using the semi auto fire modes often and even though it is more accurate they still don't always hit where you are aiming which is very frustrating. Otherwise a great game, but the gun play is lackluster.. I don`t know how often I heard the loading screen of the MEC and USA but it never gets ols. Good gameplay and it is a grat game. Bf3 did not have the same feeling as in Bf2 but it is still pretty good.. one of the better fps'. Got really into it when i got it and i still play i from time to time. You can purchase replica airsoft guns from the game here: ****. This is the best of the Battlefield series! In my opinion, the new Battlefield games are inferior to the pre-BF Bad Company games. While old-school BF games focus on the multiplayer, recent BF games add singleplayer campaigns and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't belong in the BF series. If you haven't played the old BF games, you are doing it **** graphics and the gameplay still hold up very well and there are a bunch of fun mods and maps you can install for free! Play BF2!. Many people look at BF2 with rose tinted goggles and remember only the good parts about it and then give it 10/10 Im not gonna do that here i will list some of the big mistakes of the game> Cons........ Class balance You basicly only see assaults & medics Engineers & antitanks weapon **** ass so no one basicly ever used them. Magical repair aura in vehicles when you drive it as engineer This led to camping side by side with 2 tanks & commander dropping supplybox behind them that repaired them aswell. Vehicle balance Helis 1 shotting everything with TV missile once you got the hang of the missile You could basicly dominate entire battlefield with it . Tanks basicly useless if there was any jets helis in the map Dolphin dive & bunny hopping OP weapons over other weapons Pros... Maps Teamwork Big squads & commander No supression Flight mechanics VOIP Destroyable bridges Intense fighting At the time Battlefield 2 was my favorite fps game and amazing for its time. It had major issues with bugs crashes balance but still in end i'd play it again. ""Battlefield 2"" was one of the reasons I had my PC upgraded for (I don't remember exactly)th time :) It took much time for ""Call of Duty"" creators to bring players to the modern action, but EA decided to let us use modern weapons much earlier. First big sequel to the popular series brought us large maps, various class types and tons of fun time. I have to say that in ""Battlefield 2"" I was never a big fan of vehicles. Somehow they seemed I bit sluggish so mostly I enjoyed combat on foot, which allowed me to use at my best my favourite class medic. Defibrillator unit was firstly introduced to the game and significantly changed gameplay. Having a medic nearby would allow more heroic actions than you had previously let yourself to perform. Assault class was my second favourite one, although my friends often gave preference to engineers. Having one right behind your tank would make you almost unstoppable force. Playing as a sniper was difficult for me, because I never understood a sniper rifle that did not kill an enemy with a single shot. A new feature that was introduced but never appreciated, by me at least, was artillery fire, that was often used as bombing of the point at the moment when it was captured by an enemy. To give more balance against heavy vehicles new rocket launchers were introduced, that were statically set at some places and allowed firing missiles. ""Battlefield 2"" also had AI partners that could make you a company. Having AI in opposite team often made playing a nightmare as making headshots with a pistol from unbelievable distance was not a big deal for them. Weapon's kickback was not a big deal to get used to, but somehow I consider it a problem, because this way you can't 'feel' weapons. Anyway, everything that was not appreciated by me doesn't make the game any worse, so at the moment of release, eight long years ago I would recommend it to any player who liked shooters.. I like what the battlefield series is trying to do, but they have some issues. BF2 has way too many exploits. Hit-boxes come unglued when player's run around. Bunny hopping can make you immune to being blasted by an entire clip at point blank range. Often the game involved running this marathon across the game map only to die and start all over again. I did get some real enjoyment out of the game tho. The urban maps were a lot more fun to me.. My favourite game of all time. Forever and always. It has the most content out of all of the Battlefield series and it's definitely the most fun. With over 30 maps with 3 variations each (90 maps, technically) and hundreds of weapons, vehicles, players and mods you really can't find a better pseudo-realistic war game than this one. I think this was the only game I've ever played to really balance realistic and not realistic perfectly, it has a realistic chain of command and getting medals and promotions, as well as slightly realistic physics, but you can also get into a car and drive up an exploding ramp and then jump out the side and parachute to safety. The game definitely feels the best out of all of the Battlefield games. As soon as you boot it up you just feel like you have complete control over everything, and you feel like it's your fault that your dying when you do die because of how good the controls are. As said before, there are loads of vehicles, and most maps have an aircraft carrier for the USMC. The Aircraft Carrier always has helicopters and jets on it, but this isn't like Battlefield 3 where every jet and helicopter are almost exactly the same, these jets have strengths and weaknesses. Say there was a two seater jet that could drop 15 bombs and had 4 miniguns, it would fly very slowly and wouldn't be very agile. Say there was a one seater jet with no bombs and like 2 machine guns, it would fly very quickly and would be extremely agile. Lots of people all around the world still play this game all the time, but sadly, the modding community kinda died out. But, that doesn't mean you can't play these mods, because this ","battlefield 2 is considered an all-time classic, but not for me . i still think this game is boring, unfair and the maps too big . i was really bad at it when i discovered that it was a multiplayer only game ."
251.God of War Collection,"Even games but in HD and with much more fps. I simply loved! It also doesn't have the problems that it had in the PS2 version.. Whoever thought of the bone pillar in the last stage of the first game should be condemned to hell himself.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. At the time of release, this HD collection was a great way for players to prepare for the arrival of GOW III. It doesn't include any new features, but the upscaled treatment for both games is exceptional. If you've never played any of the first two ""God of War"" games, than this is the way to do it. The two games still hold up as great action-adventure titles. Even die-hard fans wouldn't do wrong by double dipping with this re-release. Graphics have been polished up to perfection and framerate issues are virtually non-existent. ""God of War Collection"" would be a great addition to any action fan's collection. I would rate this with a 9.1 out of 10.. Till today I still remember the shock I had when I first went inside that giant temple on Cronos' back. The puzzles were really well designed and I felt actually disappointed that they never did that again in future games. The second installment focused more in the upgrading of combats and boss fights. Both are great games no doubt.. Whoever designed and approved the blade pillars part in the final part of the game, I hope you're dead now for wasting people's time. God of war 1 and 2 are the best ps2 games, extremely fun with good and challenging gameplay.. I'm just writing at least 150 characters because I wanted to save this review in a more convenient way to look back at scores that I had given stuff as a user. I played god of war one for the first time four years ago and finished off god of war two a couple years back. I enjoyed them both a lot. Good story and a really fun combat system. These games are everything people said they were. They are pretty dated now, but still worth playing if you haven’t had a chance yet.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a friend borrowed me this one and i loved it still want it for myself to this day. i dont know if theyre better than the og vers but i prefer this cause well ill probably go to my ps3 more often than my ps2. when it comes to these things i always prefer the most recent versions. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of War: 8/10 God of War II: 9/10 Just buy it, its really good. Graphics are meh cuz they are PS2 games. But its amazing how they done games like GoW and GoWII on PS2. The words are really inadequate when trying to explain these two games.. The collection of two classic PlayStation 2 games; God of War and God of War II. These remastered versions are worth it, with some bizarre errors that didn't improve. It's still a must play.. First off this collection is a great way to play either of these games especially if your like me and never played them on the ps2. And I must say that both of these tiles are fun a bit basic in comparison to similar types of games now a days with its insistent bottom mashing but fun non the less. Out of the two the sequel definitely engaged me more with a lot of the crap that **** from the first game being altered or removed. Along with a more engaging narrative and bosses that felt way more fun to fight the sequel is really where the collection shines although they both have some dumb puzzles.. epic game and one of my favorite games 1. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Game: God of War Collection Genre: Action Developer: Santa Monica Studio Publisher: Sony System: Playstation 3 (PS3) Year of Release: 2009 Length of Playthrough: 21 Hours Total Score: 94/100 Value Score: 9.4/10 • Story: 9/10 • Characters: 9/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 9/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 8/10 • Length: 10/10 • Replay Value: 10/10 • Player Value: 10/10 Pros +Both God of War 1 and 2 Remastered in 720p and 60 FPS +Trophy Support Cons -Game is in 720p rather than 1080p -Controls can be frustrating at times -Cutscenes look dated and not upscaled -Bonus content for God of War 2 not included in-game menu. As I did not play the original games on PS2, this was a great opportunity for me to do it on PS3. I am not a big God of War fan, but I did enjoy them quite much. GoW I and II are two of the best hack 'n' slash ever, regarding both gameplay and the treatment of mythological elements.. This collection contains the first 2 main God of War games, originally released on PS2. Both of them are really great hack n' slash games with great combat, some platforming and puzzles, and an epicness to scale of action and music production. And that Kratos growl, you 'll never forget him LOL. The only annoying thing is the abundance of Quick Time Events while executing enemies. Kratos is one of Sony's mascots, but he is a shallow character, hell bent on revenge against the Greek Gods. Another minor issue of this collection is a peculiar divide in story cut-scenes. Some of them are rendered in real-time and have no issue. Others are ported straight from the PS2 versions and are really low quality and look ugly because they are FMVs with blocky polygons and weren't upscaled for HD. It's a pity that the porting studio didn't fix this. These games run at 60 fps on PS3, unlike the PS2 originals which had trouble running at 60 fps (particularly GoW 2). Graphics are upscaled at 720p and Anti-Aliasing is introduced, but these games haven't aged well in that department. Nevertheless, God of War games are always fun. You won't find another hack n' slash game or series more epic and fun than God of War. And let's hope someday Sony decide to port these games to PS4.. I hope one day there will be a serviceable HD port of one of the finest action games ever made: God of War. But until then, please don't waste your time with this collection. Why? It wasn't Bluepoint's fault, it's because they were given the botched PS2 code instead of the original one. The later botched PS2 version would permanently run like **** after a certain music track starts playing, but the PS3 port doesn't really have this slowdown. The remastered version still inherited one crippling flaw, and one new substantial flaw. The substantial flaw is that the game's widescreen mode is exactly the same as the PS2's, meaning that it just crops a big part of the 4:3 display on the top and bottom to present it in 16:9 widescreen. It's not widescreen, it's zoomscreen. The crippling flaw is this: ****-in-GoW-Haven-t-tried-GoW-II-yet/td-p/24886 The port of God of War II is completely fine other than the CGI cinematics also being cropped to fake 16:9 widescreen in the same fashion as all of GoW 1's gameplay and cutscenes. Oh, and the fact that it's God of War II.. Ok this time i'm going to do something a little different. Usually a review singular games, but this time i want to do my first review of a collection. Normally i examine Story, Presentation and Gameplay, but because that would not be possible because reviewing 2 games in 1 single review with metacritic's bull**** 5000 character limit would just be insane!. What i'm going to do instead is analise what does the collection adds to the games, what games does it have inside, as well as what does it improve over the originals (if you want to know my full opinion of both games, you can check out my reviews of them). With that said let's begin: GAMES: God of War & God of War II. 2 of the greatest hack and slash of the PS2 and some of the best one's i've ever played, they have some problems, but they are very freaking enjoyable (again, see my full reviews if you want an understanding of my opinion). ADDITIONS: The additions that this collections brings to the God of War games are basically giving trophy achievements, which i don't care about and some videos about the creation of both God of War games and that's pretty much it. IMPROVEMENTS: The improvements are very notable side by side. The resolution and framerate have improved immensely, now you can see the models very clearly and the HD treatment is very appreciated, but that's about it. Anyway, that's pretty much all i can say about it, the 2 games inside it are great, but the extra stuff is lackluster and remastering them in HD is nice, but a collection should add more to the experience aside from just some useless trophies. So as a collection i don't feel like it's all that great. I'll give it a 6/10.. Gameplay: 1 (Unplayable) Fun: 1 (You can't Have Fun) Story: 7 (Story is set during Era 5000BC to 500BC) Cast: 7 (Great) Score: 1/10 Overrated By All should got less then 7.8s. Easily the 2 best games on available on PS2 given the HD treatment. I absolutely love these games the story, the mythology the brutality. I've played through both of the multiple times on PS2 and now all these years later, 2015, I've played through them again and they're just as awesome. I simply cannot recommend these games enough. I still cheer and shout at the enemies on the screen before, during and after a battle. 10/10 there is no other way to score them.. i like the god of war series. i played all this series. first of all l love the hitting sense this series. and i like the view of world. god and myth is intersting.. Awesome remakes! Loved every minute of it. Absolutely nothing bad to say. These games are true classics! And even they look dated they are still fun to play! Give them a try!. Two fabulous games in one package. The first may look a little dated graphically even with the upgrade, but the gameplay is still excellent with an engrossing story and set pieces & puzzles which lay down the foundations for the series. The second expands on this even further, and even though I personally prefer the first, many choose the 2nd.. I am not what you'd call an avid fighting game fan. It isn't for a lack of trying them, I just haven't found one that I could get into- other than the God of War series. It's either the cameras ****, the characters are extremely lame, or the move sets are more complicated than I am willing to learn. More often than not it's at least 2 of the 3. This series is the only one I can get into, and I gosh darned love it.. This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of the God of War series! I played these 2 games on the ps2 and here they are remastered in HD! These 2 games are really sic and bad ass. Everything in them is amazing! Both games can be beaten in under 6 hours each. God of War 2 is better in my opinion because it improved on many things. God of War 2 features way more boss battles than God of War 1. The story is great and God of War 2 continues the story right where God of War 1 ended. I also highly recommend checking out God of War 3 and the other God of War games!. BE WARNED: IF YOU LIKE BATMAN GAMES THERE IS A CHANCE YOU WILL NOW LIKE THESE SERIES. I wanted to like this game so bad, but it's not my cup of tea I guess. Especially taking in consideration how visually stunning God of War III is. Freaking beautiful game, so many hours was spent, it's the gameplay that just rubs my gaming boner in the wrong way. if you buy this game used you will only get 3 games. God of War, God of War II and God of War III. I've always had an xbox, so I've missed out on original god of war, but I remember reading reviews praising these games. I bough devil may cry on 360 and got really bored of it in few hours, This game reminds of me Devil May Cry. I've played both Batman games (Asylum and Arkham City) and I loved them. They both deserve score of 10 in my book. And honestly I don't even like Batman as a super hero that much. I've decided since I like Batman games I will enjoy this one as well. I was wrong. I'm going to compare this game to Batman, Batman. Cause I'm Batman! GRAPHICS: Really Good! Awesome Intro. SOUND: Outstanding! KRATOS: He is cool. I like the guy. I don't know why people have beef with him. BOSS BATTLES: IF YOU LIKE BOSS BATTLES BUY THIS COLLECTION!!! These games are one Boss battle after another. I HATE BOSS BATTLES. WHY? because they are boring. Here is an example of typical boss battle: Monster/god dude/wretched creature is slamming its fist to the right side of the platform, OMG what am I going to do? Step to the left out of his way. Now it is doing a sweep with his tail/hand/tentacle so I'm going to jump. Now this monster is being vulnerable, how convenient, I'm going to attack it few times, but not too many because it is going to strikeme back. Rinse and Repeat few times, go to the dude and press 'O: on the controller. Play sequence mini game. Do the whole thing again few times. Boss battles are all about figuring out a pattern. Patterns are boring to me. What is this Dance Dance Revolution? I've only played on normal difficulty, but I bet Boss Battles are less forgiving on higher difficulties. Honestly I don't think I've enjoyed boss battles in batman quite frankly, but they were super easy. ENEMIES: Beating up just regular fellas was so much fun in Batman. it is also a lot of fun in Assassins Creed series(even thought it looks silly when they attack you one at a time lol). But in this game regular small fellas can be defeated just pressing square button. It work every time I tried this technique on different difficulty settings, they have same AI on Titan mode as in God(Normal) just do more damage.. You can just defeat them all with spinning attack. WALKING ON PLANKS: I hate it. After playing Assassins Creed it was so annoying watching him fall. Especially when camera is tilted 45 so I can't just press forward to make him walk straight. Dear Mr Kratos ""the God killer"" please learn from Ezio and stop being such a noob and walk straight on the stupid plank. Please. Pushing same button over and over to open the door? Are you out of your mind? I couldn't even finish third game.. Just a simple hack and slash game that has you running around mowing down everything and everyone in sight. The thing that sets it apart is how well executed the final product is. The combat feels fluent, the puzzles are challenging but not too hard and the retrospective storytelling is quite interesting, having Kratos remember bits and pieces of his past as he progresses towards his goal. Whatever that might be at a given moment.. It took me a few years but I have finally played the first two GoW games. Despite the horrible graphics, the gameplay is really good, and the plot is pretty good too. I like where the series is going and I'm looking forward to GoW3 and Ascension.. Two of the most iconic PS2 games combined into one collection. Remastered in high definition with full trophie support how can it get better than that.. Fantastic set on Greek Mythology. Epic story and awesome gameplay with cool combos and magic abilities. Plus the epic boss fighting you get those cool puzzles that makes you feel smart when you solve them. Really creative puzzles. I enjoyed every minute playing both God Of War 1 & 2. It was fun also playing Challenge of the Gods and Challenge of Titans. I went for Platinum on those to cool titles. This is 9 out of 10.. Epic! Buy it, no question actually it's a good enough reason to get a PS3 so you can play this and the sequel. One of my favorite games of all time, graphics, gameplay, story it's all good!. Excuse me for using caps, but QUICKTIME EVENT HATERS BEWARE!!! In GoW you do almost everything by using quicktime events. And I'm not talking about just any kind of quicktime events, over half of them are ""smash O like crazy or you will fail"" quicktime events.. This collection is certainly good. With HD graphics and 60 fps speeds this is definitely the best way to experience god of war 1 and 2. The down point of the trilogy is the trophy support, most of them can be obtained through one play through. A buy for GOW beginners and veterans. Everything is good but he first god of war story is a little lacking but that about all I have to say about this awesome collection. God of War Collection for the PS3 is God of War 1 and 2 in HD and with trophy support. The games are so rich in atmosphere and have such amazing varied gameplay that they. The two games are amazing, but having already beat them, this wasn't any different than how I remembered them. Awesome games, If you have already played them then you know if you should replay them or not, If you haven't played them then there is a reason that God of War still exists and a new game is coming out.. To put it simply, this is the first 2 God of War games made into HD and put on one disc. Both of these games are very fun games. It's interesting to see where this series came from leading up to God of War 3. These 2 games were both excellent games when they were released. They have their flaws, but it's easy to see how the God of War series grew when you play these games as well. This is a collection that will give you two excellent games, and that's really the bottom line here.. I never got a chance to play the god of war franchise back when the PS2 was still fresh. So i decided to buy it and give it a chance to play on PS3 in hd collection. Turns out it was worth my money before i played God of war 3 completely. Story- God of war 1 is about kratos recieving the powers **** from Ares however that power he had killed his family so he seeks to avenge his family's death by killing Ares which he gets help by the other gods. God of war 2 continues after Kratos triumph over Ares and claims the title of God of war. Kratos tries to prevent the sister of fate from changing his life in the past by killing them. Graphics- Since its remastered in HD it feels a bit clear to see what the levels clearly look like around kratos perspective. Gameplay- God of war is a hack and slash where you'll be fighting many enemies and performing awesome grusome finishing blows on them especially on the boss levels. Uprgrading your weapons and accessories to make it more damaging in killing the enemies much quickier. Evading and parrying enemies attack to reduce your chance of dying. The only problem i had was the puzzles. YES the puzzles it feels so confusing and frustrating that i basically had to search up websites to pass them which i couldn't even handle for at least 3 minutes without understanding on what to do in it. Overall- I recommend that you should buy this game for hack and slash and awesome story thats about greek history and mythology and give it a try. Trust me you will surprised on how good this HD retains itself from the time it came out on PS2 to PS3. Final Score- 9.5. One of the best purchases ever on the Playstation platform. God of War series is a must have for all kinds of action/fighter game fans. Hooking stories, intensive fights, epic boss rounds ... there isn't even a game better than GoW today in the action category, period. Many spinoffs/lookalikes such as Darksiders, Demons/Dark Souls, Kingdoms of Amalur, and Batman etc. are all great games; but compared against this masterpiece, they all look childish. Still need to finish GoW2 on hard though.... Two of the best action games in history enhanced and put together in what is one of the best HD packages ever. God of War Collection is, more than anything else, a great excuse to play the first two GOW games two or three times again. And if you have never played these games, do not miss this opportunity. Both games are incredible; near-perfect gameplay, compelling story, amazing soundtrack and the best boss fights of the past generation. The conversion to high-definition was very well-made, and all environments look amazing. Each and every character model was polished. The only problem of the conversion was with the menus and screen displays, which look stretched and blurred. Following Kratos through his first journeys is as exciting and bloody as ever. None should miss this amazing collection.. This is a total cash in. Keep your ps2 version and play those. Do not buy into this scam Sony has created. This is the same game from 7 years ago. If you keep buying then they will keep scamming.. I've always wanted to play God of War series, but never had the chance. Until now, that my friend has lended me his. It was awesome! The story and the gory gameplay expands the thrill and fun. Replayability is supported by new armor, or New Game+ in GoW II. After playing these two, am really looking forward to GoW III now. Still, AWESOME!!!. One of few games in my collection that I would actually give a full ten. No, this is not overrated, but be prepared for graphics that are not as great as GOW 3. That does not take way from the gameplay. Truly a fantastic series, and this collection makes it more accessible to people who didn't get a chance to play it on PS2.. What an excellent remastered rendition of the series. These are perhaps unforgiving games without remorse, but certainly ones that leave you with a sense of accomplishment once you do get past the challenges they come with - due to the fact that it progresses in such a way that you get better by each attempt. With wonderful art design, hard-hitting music, and more over-the-top button mashing than most games, God of War is one of those series where you truly feel glad it's over when the credits finally scroll down your screen - yet it also somehow manages to leave you wanting more. On the downside, the puzzles were a bit too difficult at times due to poor judgement on camera angles and lack of emphasis on highlighting important items. The weapon load out and upgrade system could use some more refinement as well, and I often found myself not using any of the secondary weapons I picked up because that would mean I would have to upgrade and rely on them throughout - and the whole upgrade system could be more lucid. Furthermore, I wouldn't mind an optional Auto-Save feature and fully re-rendered cutscenes throughout, seeing as this is a 2009 release. I also didn't particularly enjoy having to see a scene over and over again because I didn't hit and time five analog stick quicktime events in a row on the first installment - if you miss one, don't expect an alternate clip that is not your immediate death. Last note, the game shouldn't ask me every time if I want to Retry from Checkpoint, considering I've never once quit a game that way, and I doubt anyone else have either, it seems like removing it altogether would be the more obvious solution.. You get both god of war 1 and god of war 2 here and beleave me it is worth every penny. I like puzzle games and I have always like a good beatem up and this is probably one on the best at giving you both of those elements in a game at the same time. The visuals are great both games but don't think you will be getting gow 3 graphics here remember these are ps2 ports. The controlls work well both games can be frustrating at times but honestly I don't feel it takes away from the package. This is a great collection for the ps3 and a must buy if you don't own the ps2 games or just want to take a shot at finishing them agian worth every penny.. playing the gow games i never played them in order first one i played was the first GOW on the PSP then i played GOW 3 . so curous about how kratos got to where he was and was in such a foul mood i decided to pick up the GOW collection. started with the first GOW and its ok but not alot of boss fights and the game flows kinda slugish . the action is there and what few bosses you do fight are alot of fun. the second one is a improvement the game flows better and alot more bosses to take on . you can pick this up pretty cheap i got mine off amazon for $12 worth pickin up if you are a die hard GOW fan and want them remastered for HD. i feel spoiled by playing the 3rd and like that one the best . so i dont feel the love as much as thoose who have played theese 2 games first back on the PS2.. 9.5/10 = Incredible = A great compilation of 2 of the greatest games of all time. HD graphics look great as well!. i liked this game and the story and monsters matches up with real mythology but it is just so hard to beat and it will turn some people right off. i havnt played these games on the PS2 but i can see i have missed out so i am happy they came to the PS3 but at some points it is just so hard to play ive found myself putting it down for a bit then going back to it after i have watched a walkthrough on youtube. be warned there is nothing telling you where to go in this game so you will be scratching your head trying to figure out what do do at certain points but this game is a must have especially since the series continues in GoW3. In my opinion this can be one of the best collections ever, it has two of the best PS2 games; as an script writter I can tell you that the story is really good, I love it! the gaming its so easy, this is not a challenging game, its a game for enjoy! if you dont have it BUY IT! NOW! Kratos rules!!!!!!. i'm not a very vengeful person my name is DREW EZ BREEZEE ... i did buy ps2 but not god of war... ok recently i found it on sell.. god of war collection .... i said i will try it... its a port of ps2 so i understand the cg cutscenes are crap... but the puzzles and stupidity killed my buzz... f... kratos bad game... let me hack in slash dante inferno better... F... kratos. BE WARNED, if your new to the series. YOU WILL GET PISSED OFF ON THE PUZZLES AND CHALLENGES, EVEN IN NORMAL MODE! But after I look back I remember all the times I dropped the F-Bomb on the game, and know I think the series is awesome. Awesome hack and slash game play, good stories. And got me interested in reading Greek Mythology. Recommended Buy!^_^. A visit back to two of the greatest games of the PS2 era, with upscaled graphics and trophies; what's not to like? The only real reason one has not to try these games, given that they missed them the first time around, is if they have already played and disliked them.. This is two of the best games ever on one disc, awesome story, awesome action and gameplay, and for those who say this game is just a button smasher and takes no skill thats absolutely rubbish, go play this game on hard or hardest level then lets talk again. My favourite of all time. Amazing deal in this bundle. I never got the chance to play either of these games so it was a real treat for me, this up scaling to HD helps deal with the outdated graphics. Both games still shine to this day in both story and gameplay.. First off let me say they did a wonderful job on this collection. There is alot to love on this title. The main characters are cool, the action is brutal and the story is interesting. If this is your type of game then it's definitely worth your buck. However there comes my problem, i am not a fan. It's beautifully polished, full action but utterly boring button masher. I enjoy the mashing but not for long, there is just too little variation to this title no matter how good it looks. Once you figure out what attack works best the real challenge is to keep out of the way and repeat the same action. There are some puzzles but everyone who is not utterly **** can solve those. For me who grew up on the not so great graphics era but often creative gameplay this is too much of a repetition to overlook the flaws and give this an A+.","""God of war collection"" was a great way to prepare for the arrival of GOW III . graphics have been polished up to perfection and framerate issues are virtually non-existent . ""god of war 1 and 2 are the best ps2 games, extremely fun with good and challenging gameplay ."
252.Planescape: Torment,"One of the best RPG's of all time. A quirky world with superb dialogues & fantastic story. What can change the nature of a man.... It's a novel-like game with a very interesting and beautiful world and characters. It's true that I said novel. Because when you finish the game, you really read as much as if you finished a 500 or 1000 page novel. Frankly, this reading at the end of the game made me a little tired. But the story is truly gripping. The game progresses very well until the Trias. After the Trias it becomes a bit linear and only story-oriented. And it gets chaotic. Towards the end of the game, many enemies come at you. But it's not very challenging and it's a bit boring. I like the variety of items, it's not like Baldurs Gate. I finished the game with only 1 axe, it didn't give me any other weapons. The same goes for other items. armor gloves etc. But there is a lot of variety in terms of magic. My favorite part of the game is the dialogues between characters, quests and the world of the game. It almost has a taste of Dune and Fallout.. I'm not going to say anything to keep you curious, I only confirm that this game is in the Top 100 games with the best story/lore and if you are looking for something that will leave you with ""existential void"".... Great.. Simply my all time favourite single player game, although it feels more like reading a book than actually playing. A game where dialogues delve into profound philosophical questions, creating a unique RPG experience. Characters aren't just NPCs, they're vessels of introspection. Gameplay serves as a canvas for thought-provoking narratives.. Replayability is the major issue for me with games. Unfortunately this game does not have a great deal of it and I can't give it a 10, but it's still a very close run thing. Astounding. Unforgettable. Hypnotic. Exhilarating. The amnesiac storyline sounds cliched but this amnesiac storyline is so different, so well told, so deeply described that the game is more than forgiven for it. There are not many joinable NPCs, one of them is hard to find and another does not appear until near the end. But these NPCs have, individually, more personality than shelfloads of games than I could mention, so again, the game is more than forgiven. There are more than a few bugs. But this game is so engrossing that you don't really care. Game absolved again. From the constant thud thud in the Lower Ward to the very inspiring fighting music in Curst, the sounds in this game make it unforgettably atmospheric. This game does not have many areas, does not last very long and has been accused of having an unsatisfactory ending. But no other game has such a plethora of memorable characters, stimulating dialogues, great music, spell visuals and moments of great hilarity in such a short space of time. It just shows what can happen when people's motivation is belief and pride in what they are doing and a love for it too, as opposed to purely making money. The quest to find a certain NPC is probably the most fulfilling quest I've ever done. As far as I know, there are two valid endings which occur about half way towards the accepted ending (and one other a lot closer). I can think of no other game which dares to do that. An exceptionally enduring masterpiece.. Finally played and finished this classic. If you are familiar with the old game books in which ""you are the hero"", then this game will give you a similar feeling. You will read. A lot. The novel based on the computer text is more than 400 pages. Thankfully the writing is very good and will keep you interested until the end. Combat is rudimentary, but is not the main aspect here. Character build is forgiving if you make mistakes. A few fights were challenging, but these were optional.. Best story in a RPG. Ever. Adult, personnal, tragic, evil, good. Most of all an experience like no other, Tell me, what can change the nature of a man?. This game was so good I literally got a tattoo of the symbol of torment on my arm. Worst game ever. The plot will ruin any game you play next. Because it's too beautiful.. It has a great refreshing story, likable characters and the setting is unique. On the negative side the gameplay is not that great, there are some bugs and it is not “The best RPG of all times” or “Baldurs Gate 2 killer” many claimed. To be fair this could be my expectation as I only bought this because of all the praise I heard in all the years. Lets start at the beginning: It is a D&SD game set in the Planescape realm in the city of Sigil. The setting is unique as the realm is a wheel with an infinite spire in the middle where on top of is the city of Sigil. It is the realm of the gods, mythical creatures and beings not or rarely seen in the material realms. Basically here you have all the secrets unveiled that people in the material plane have. For example you know that the afterlife, different worlds / dimensions, gods, demons and devils exist and can even possibly meet them even if it is unlikely for the higher ones. Each aliment has a layer and those are connected. Sigil is a mystery packed in mysteries. Like I said it is set on an infinite spire but it is also called the city of doors as there are portals everywhere. Some are open all the time, some are hidden and some require to know what to do to open them. Sigil is also the one place the gods cant enter and not because of lack of trying as a place with doors to all place is a source of unimaginable power. The ruler is the mysterious Lady of Pain which does not interact and you should not worship as goddess as it will get you killed. An advice for her is don't get involved and run as fast as you could if you can spot her in the distance. The protagonist is called “The Nameless One” as he has amnesia when he awakes in the mortuary. He has some clues tattooed on his skin, a diary and a talking skull as companion. His specialty is that he cant die or better said he stays not dead. Each time he gets killed he reawakens later on. This adds to the mystery. His journey is remarkable and in the story I see why people praise it. It is as refreshing as good. The characters are also fascinating and I like the party with Morte, Dak’kon, Annah, Ignus, Vhalior, Nordom and Fall from Grace. Like I said in the regard of the story, characters and setting it is as good as people say. The gameplay is a different thing. The gameplay mechanics are not as polished and the battles feel clunky for me. It is the kind of “I don't want the battles just continue the story” game for me. Luckily you can avoid many confrontations and the story, characters and setting are a good masquerade for this problem. Sadly I had some minor and a critical buck. Only by luck I was able to continue the story as I was trapped in a situation where my game crashed every time. Because there was another solution I could continue but it was harsh and I had to use guides to find the way out. Also it is sadly not as good overall package as Baldurs Gate 2 which I see as superior game. To be fair again I can see this game surpass it or better said see why others claim this to be better. The graphics were good for its time but aged a bit. Be warned it is a dark and sometimes grim setting that is not for everyone. I say it creates a good atmosphere. The soundtrack helps a lot to enhance it. It is sneakingly good. Overall I say it is a must play game but also not for everyone if this makes sense for you. I can see why people praise the game but I cant fully agree. I give a 7/10 where I subtracted a point for the serious bug mentioned above.. This is considered the best DnD oriented classic RPG game and I doubt about that. Includes a unique story indeed, with good level of humor and great dialogues, but lacks in every other aspect: the mechanics (and the edition plays a significant role about this), graphic design, soundtrack, pacing, bugs. Also I am not sure the story is actually deep or some aspects of it are insufficiently considered consisophisticated .. I can't say I have played every game but I've spent most of my life playing since the age of two using different platforms. I'm 25 now and this is the only game that made me feel good and satisfied in a deeper level through the whole experience. My only complaint about the game is that the story is too linear. I think this game will be remembered in history and studied by future generations. I heard Sigil is from the D&D universe. My second favorite SP game is Mass Effect 1. Mankind can do a lot better than this but I will give it a ten, it's most likely the best single player ever created.. Idk why anyone would hate it, it's not ****, but it's nonetheless very cool open world hacking gamThis game is just hard to forget. Ten years has passed sincee. I mean i would understand someone giving it 6 or 7 for technical problems, but fla. One of the best stories in the game industry, excellent dialogues and characters. Must play masterpiece.. It's an interactive book more than a game, yet it kicks the player straight in da face like a god damn train. Dialogues (tens of thousands pages!), atmosphere (heavy and gloomy like never before and never again), philosophy behind all of this and most of all the best story in the history of video games makes Metacritic scale too small to fully give justice to Planescape Torment. 11/10? 12/10? Does numbers even matter when we face eternity?. Dated, yes perhaps, but what an excellent story telling and game lore it is!. Planescape Torment has no equal. A pinnacle of RPG storytelling, one of the most original RPG worlds ever and one of the most unique and memorable videogame protagonists. While the story itself isn't THAT good, it's told and expressed in a very captivating way. The amount and complexity of dialogues is unparalleled to this day. And it's all written in a literary manner, as if the texts and dialogues were taken out of a book. Astonishing. However, the heavy orientation on story and dialogues makes the game unbalanced, because characters focusing primarily on Intelligence and Wisdom have a significant advantage over other characters focused on, for example, Strength and Constitution. Combat, whilst not bad, is also underdeveloped. Overall Planescape Torment totally deserves it's status as one of the greatest RPGs/videogames ever made.. The perfect ROG ripe with choices and consequences, potential for exploration and finding interesting solutions. Cult classic for a reason.. I love Baldurs Gate 2, Morrowind, Fallout and all the other classic RPGs and dont like the action action ""RPG""s from today...I was very interesting and motivated for PS:T, but I get dissapointed. The combat mechanics and the gameplay mechanics overall are so simple. The level up is boring. So in the core, the most interesting part is reading the dialogues, which are very interesting here, but far too much. Of course this game offer top elements: The setting is amazing, it is sad, that there are not so many studios, that are creating new worlds like PS:T. But overall I quit the game after 2/3 more or less, what happens very rare. This game is like reading a book instead of playing it, the gameplay is not good enough. Therefore BG2 is still my king.. Funny thing, that there can be a game that may have faults, yes, but you do not care, for the core is so strong, the writing so inspired and full of twists, that none of the minuses even matter, because you are completely invested in the story and the characters. This game is a masterpiece of the oddest quality and deserves a place in every rpg top ten lists. At the top. If for some reason you are not interested, please try harder.. My favourite game of all time ( after Witcher 3 ofc). Highly recommended, especially if youre a Baldurs gate fans.. My rating: Sound 9/10 Graphic* 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Replay value 9/10 Story 10/10 Total 10/10** * Graphic rating has to be contextualized for the year of the release. ** Total is a weighted average rounded up where the weight for every element is: Sound 1 Graphic 2 Gameplay 3 Replay Value 1 Story 3. Just why they had to change the combat I'll never understand. Turn based combat may not have been for everyone, but this one is, it's bad, for everyone. And it detracts from experiencing one of the best stories in gaming. I even read the book based on the dialogue. There are even 3 versions of a book based on this. So yeah in it for the story. Just don't expect some life altering, finding Jesus, sort of story. It's simply maybe the best story in the DnD universe.. This is the perfect RPG. I played it first in 2011 and now I love it even more.. This is the most well developped universe and the most beautifull writing I've seen in a video game.. The most intelligent plot video games have ever had, the script is a masterpiece - a combination of Dostoyevsky, Aristotle and Bułhakov - the perfect game, Plot 11/10. Epic game story. One of the best story ever written in gaming. There's no weakness, the combat might get some time to get used but after a hour you'll love it. A must play classic.. One of the best rpgs ever even if the original creators banded up again they couldnt have made a game like this again. If you havent played this and deus ex the original 2000 game then throw your controller break your console,throw your pc out of the window and go fishing. Unless you **** at fishing in which case i pity you foo. Simply my favorite game of all time. Best plot you'll ever find anywhere. Masterpiece characters, masterpiece music, masterpiece world, masterpiece dialogue, masterpiece world descriptions, masterpiece everything. Freedom of character behavior. Extremely involving story. Teardropping endgame. Simply state of the art... art.. Probably the best story in any video game ever, Planescape: Torment is much more than just that. Allowing the player to explore one of the most unique worlds in the history of computer RPGs and interact with some of the most interesting characters ever created, PS:T is also a very solid game underneath it all. Everything you do in this game matters: how you create your character and develop it, how you approach people and what you say to them, what you do and what you decide not to do. Torment will destroy your assumptions about what to expect from a fantasy RPG, as it comes with zero elves, zero dwarves and only two swords in the whole game, and it will also leave you wanting more from every RPG you play afterwards. Obviously it's not perfect (nothing is), with combat especially in need of some improvement, but so far it is as close to perfection as it gets.. My favorite video game of all time. it has a very great story and writing, the combat system is not that good but the game is great. JUST PLAY THE GAME.. The world view of this game is crazy. There is more depth of story than any game I've ever played. It feels like I read a novel book. The battle is really trashy, but except for that, I am proud of immense immersion.. I've gotten everyone I can to play this game by describing it to them as ""The best game you'll ever read or the best book you'll ever play."" Almost two decades later and so far every single one that gave it a try has agreed. I remain confident that fact will never change as long as I live.. This is one of the few games that was exactly as good as everyone told me it would be. Torment is the best RPG ever made, hands down. The strength of this game is in its writing. The quality of writing that Torment has is unparalleled by any game ever made. The story is incredibly well crafted and memorable. Nothing more needs to be said about it. Though combat isn't the focus of the game, with peaceful ways out of most situations, the combat is still great. Simple as far as CRPGs go, making it a great first CRPG for beginners, there are 3 classes you can play as, each with a lot of depth and a unique way of playing. Each experience is fun, to be sure, and it encourages replays of the game, but first time players should definitely play as a Mage with max Int and Wis to get the most out of the game their first time. Graphics and sound hold up fine, even today. They get the job done and they do it well, and they have a certain charm to them that will be memorable for a long time to come. Atmosphere is also top notch. No game, save for Dark Souls, has ever made me feel like I was really in an alien and strange world to this extent before, not even Morrowind. The world is also incredibly well designed, faithfully adapting the incredible Planescape D&D setting to a video game. Although a lot of content was unfortunately cut, particularly in the later areas, there is still a tremendous amount of things to do. This is where the real replay value comes: There are tons, and I do mean TONS, of meaningful choices to make, with consequences often follow you into the late game. There are also no quest markers to hold your hand, and this trust of the player's ability to figure out what to do will be very refreshing for new players and returning players alike. All in all, Planescape is a masterpiece ****, a must play for anyone who likes real RPGs or thinks they might. For new players, once you get past the isometric view and a few cheesy things here and there you will find this game just as enjoyable as it was 20 years ago. Highly recommended, especially as a first CRPG.. Possibly the greatest RPG game ever. Amazing story, great characters, outstanding writing. 17 years later, i'm still playing this game from time to time. Classic.. This game is seriously awesome. It has probably the best story i've ever seen in a game, which is partly due to the fact that the hero isnt your typical make the sun shine and everyone hold hands and sing at the end type of guy. If you're looking for an rpg with some originality, great humor, and one hell of a story, pick this up.. Good: -It still has the best story ever written in the last thirty years -Unbelievable party's characterization -Unforgettable world -Best dialogues ever **** up side quests -Good soundtrack -Long Bad: -Man, those fights ****! -The section between Ravel and Trias is too much umbalanced 9. If you haven't played Planescape: Torment yet, I envy you. It's Alice in Wonderland of video games - a stunning work of art, a journey you'll never forget, and a timeless classic that every intellectual gamer must be familiar with.. Without doubt, the best RPG and most deep, complex and engaging story ever crafter for a video game! Super characters. Captivating setting. Emotional connection to your companions Morte!. A spectacular classic of story telling and proper, immersive single player role playing. Every choice truly matters and every dialogue commands your attention. Although the setting feels very unique it is really the tabletop universe the game is set in that is unique. But because Torment is the only CRPG to date which has been set in this universe it truly is unique in this medium. For a quick intro, the plane of existence known as Sigil floats above a pillar in what is apparently a giant fog. There are no suns, moons or anything at all we would consider normal, but instead portals all over the place to all the other planes of existence. As you can imagine, Sigil is quite the place. And the main character, the Nameless One, is no less strange, being among other things immortal, covered in scars and tattooed messages to himself from his last existence. He is frequently afflicted by post-reanimation amnesia you see, so post-it notes to oneself from past lives is apparently a good idea. Yet he is perfectly humdrum and normal compared to some of the other NPCs he will be recruiting. Morte is a flying skull and the early bodyguard of the main character while Ignus is a pyromaniac wizard who is illuminating and heating a local pub by way of having been turned into a portal to the fiery realms as punishment for his crimes. And there are several more weirdos to recruit as well. With this motley flange of grotesques the protagonist must find a way to discover his past and thereby his true nature. It is just all wonderfully odd and nothing like it has been made before or since. Pros: - Story telling. A 1000 page classic fantasy novel made interactive. - Setting. 100% original in the computer medium. - Graphics and sound. Although dated, both still do an admirable job of setting the tone and creating the appropriate atmosphere. - Character development. All the NPCs in the game are carefully scripted, with virtually endless interactions available for the player. The same conversation will change as your intelligence and charisma increases etc. If there are any holes or inconsistencies in the swarm of dialogue trees in this game, I have not found them. But above all the playable NPCs are astonishingly well written, each with his or her own agenda, abilities and potential. - Interface. Nice and clean, plus less heavy on the AD&D fanaticism. Combat is not the main focus of this game and it shows everywhere. - Role playing. Unlike the other Infinity games produced by Black Isle, Torment is a true role playing game. For the most part you are free to choose whether to fight your way through something, talk your way through something or sneak past it. Only in rare situations are you really forced by the game into one course of action or the other. Instead exploring each location, each dialogue and each object carefully is usually the best way forward. It is almost closer to being a point&click than a CRPG sometimes. Cons: - Combat. The main negative in this game but something that must be mentioned because of just how bad it actually is. If you are expecting the same stuff as in the original Baldur's Gate you will be highly disappointed. Animations are clunky, collision detection is appalling, path finding nonexistent, the actual combat simplistic and enemies very unimaginative, both in design and behavior. On my last playthrough the main character also absolutely refused to properly animate any movement to the right. Instead he would walk backwards every time I moved to the right, and even turn his back to enemies if they were on his right side while hacking at them in the wrong direction. It is all just absolutely horrible, so do not buy this game if you're only interested in exciting combat and crisp character controls. - Limited/weird/useless loot. Not as big of a problem and logical enough considering that Torment is not primarily a combat oriented RPG. But you will find lots and lots of useless trash to fill your inventory and lots and lots of weird things you're not going to know what to do with. Some of the loot is really cool, like the Nameless One being able to equip different eyeballs and Morte (the floating head) different teeth with which to bite the enemies. There are also tattoos, ear rings and of course more normal things like weapons. But it is all fairly perfunctory and very unlikely to excite anybody. - Plenty of reading required. Not a problem for me because I grew up before the internet burned all the books. But for the smartphone troglodytes it might be challenging.. The game play in terms of combat system and the graphics are average at best. Where this game shines though, and hence the high score, is the story line and writing. A highly compelling narrative with genuine options to make.. Let's make things clear: this is the best RPG I have ever played. Yes, other games have improved on its flaws ever since, because it does have flaws (otherwise I would rate it at 10,) but it was the game changer when it was released and, being one of the very few games I replay once in a while, it is still more enjoyable than 90% of whatever has been released since. First, and not foremost, the writing is simply superb. I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons since the 70s (yes, even old farts can enjoy video games,) and if there ever was one universe that left me completely indifferent in AD&D, that was the Planescape universe, which on paper sounded like the epitome of what I would dislike. PS Torment brilliantly showed me an example of what terrific atmosphere I could extract from this very unusual setting. More relevantly, because not based on P&P experience but compared to the computer games of the time, Torment was the first RPG that made it worth playing a wise or charismatic character. Before that, every RPG expected you to play a physical character, i.e., a warrior with high Strength and Endurance. Until then, nobody knew what to do with other traits. Maybe it sounds like I'm saying it was the best RPG and that the rating is dated. Well, there might be some truth in it, and I reply it still is a valid rating on that sole basis, but you know what ? It hasn't changed that much. Take the modern Fallout franchise, pretty good games if you ask me, but all they do is reverse the trend. In Fallout 3 or NV, or (outside of Fallout) Wasteland 2, or whatever, the stat you really want to raise is your Intelligence if you care about numbers and optimising your build. That's nice and all, but if 1 stat is more important than the others, at the end of the day, this is what you had before PS Torment. So yes, even by today's standards, the stats mechanics are seldom matched. I have played Torment as a stupid barbarian, and it still was great fun. Very few games have pushed that envelope since then. Okay, so groundbreaking mechanics, broadened play styles and terrific writing. That should be enough, right ? But don't forget the interface of the IE engine. That interface was one of the best at the time, and still stands the test of time. It is the model that has been built upon. RPGs felt so clunky before. Take the main competition of the day, Fallout and its sequel. True, they are in any way as creative and enthralling as Torment, but what good is it when their interface is so hopelessly bad that playing them becomes a chore ? You do need both to reach greatness, and PS Torment did have both. Still has, seriously. Play it today, it didn't get old. Now let's spend a minute with the real competition, Baldur's Gate, which also aged very well (At least BG2. BG1 isn't bad but is quite boring if you ask me.) BG improved on the companions. It also introduced romances, which are just fluff to me, but important for many players. That's it. Torment has the best story and protagonist by far. Also less cosmetic the choices. Also just plain awesome. I'm being pedantic anyway: if you like any one of the IE engine games, try all of them. Very unusual that I spend so much time on a game's qualities, when flaws are so much easier to point at. All right, here is one, common to all IE games: combat isn't great, and comes in nonsensical quantities. Actually, today's games still do that, which means that someone, either players or devs, expect it. Anyway, few battles are memorable. On the other hand, many tactics are completely valid, even cheesy ones, so there is still a lot of fun to be had there. A groundbreaking masterpiece. And if you don't care about ancient ground breakers, you still have a masterpiece.. What can be written that has not been said a hundred times before me (777 to be precise). The game explores fundamental questions that we as humans oftentimes dare not explore ourselves. Instead, you are sent on a plague-ridden, hardship-sown adventure of finding yourself and your identity. During this journey, you will explore the depths of your own fragility -or in that regard, indestructibility-. Experiences such as I have never faced in my life have happened to me during playing this game. One of them involved falling down from a chair in utter shock; I felt shaken to my core (readers familiar with a certain old man with a staff might know what I am hinting at); absolutely befuddled, and charmed beyond reprieve. As my 10 years younger brother stated once he finished the game: ""Planescape Torment is not a game, it is a literally masterpiece."" I do not disagree... The game faces the fundamental question: ""What can change the nature of a man?"" I have to tell you: I don't know the answer to this question, but one thing I know for sure: Planescape Torment can.. The best story line that was ever created and best RPG all the time, deep, philosophical inducing to thinking and this is my real love, love of my life. Planescape: Torment deserves its place on the top, or very near the top, of every best RPGs list. Black Isle Studios, the titans of Dungeons & Dragons CRPGs, turned convention on its head when they crafted this Planar adventure. There are no more typical fantasy races, morality is not defined, or is at least mutable, and every character attribute is tied to conversations and out of combat actions. It’s a game of philosophy and discovery rather than a monster slaying adventure. “What can change the nature of a man?” is the question at the heart of Planescape: Torment. The Nameless One is an immortal amnesiac, living many lives, doing deeds terrible and great, changing the lives of those around him, often for the worst. Waking up on a mortuary slab, the mystery of his past propels the Nameless One through the Multiverse, one of the most bizarre settings of any RPG, where he deals with Gods, zealotic factions – like the Dustmen, a faction that believes life is a fleeting precursor to the ultimate existence: death - and mazes both mechanical and magical. The ambition of Planescape: Torment would have been for naught were it not for the superb writing that accompanied it. Chris Avellone and Co penned a tale saturated with nuance and memorable characters that, even 14 years on, stands the test of time and has yet to be outdone. It’s the only RPG where you'll find yourself searching through the protagonist’s organs to find an important item, or where you may allow an NPC to kill you so that she could experience what it would be like to murder somebody. And all the while you'll wrestled with philosophical conundrums and questions of identity. If that all sounds a bit grisly and esoteric to you, then fret not, as the Nameless One is also accompanied by a floating, talking skull who is an unrepentant flirt and have a thing for zombies, so it’s not all serious.. Although the combat gets a bit stale and its doesn't look nearly as nice as modern day games there is an incredibly depth to Planescape: Torment that has not been reached by any video game since its release. Now its more than 15 years old but the excellent writing contained in this game still can captivate players today. As the first example I can think of for video games as ""ART"" this game should be played by anyone with even a passing interest in video games as a medium of communication, or just people who want to have an intellectually satisfying time. Get it on Good Old Games, its like 5 bucks and it has more depth than the past 50 Triple-A ""Masterpieces"" that have graced us recently.. There's simply nothing that matches this game in terms of the story and characters. I've spend last 5 days playing this game, what a ride! I'm thinking to give it another play through soon. I'm wishing this game HD remake or something. of course you can play it with mods widescreen bug fixes etc... all good. But this game deserve overhaul. I'm not old school rpg baldur's gate icewind dale fan, and i'm telling you this game is amazing, but if you are, this will probably fit you even more. You deserve to play this game, this game deserve to be played, that is the nature of this game!. any review below 7, is a sign of skyrim players trying to play a real rpg best story of a video game you read more than a book combat is not good, except if you are using a mage. This is one of the best RPGs ever with a unique and very interesting story. However, the controls and battle mechanics are not as polished as, say, in Baldur's Gate 2 from the same developer. I never really finished it, mostly because of the poorly designed quest log (which was im","the amnesiac storyline is so different, so well told, so deeply described . amnesiac is one of the best single player games of all time . the game is in the top 100 games with the best story/lore ."
253.Gears of War 3,"By far the best Gears of War of the original trilogy and improves on almost every way from the previous 2 entries that said this is by far an easier game compared to the previous 2 entries and as such is a more casual game to play. Gears of War 3 is the best in the original trilogy. Introducing horde mode, that brings fans a PVE experience, and capping of the trilogy with a great campaign.. this is a very good brutal game nice campaign interesting heroes the best gears of war game. Franchise peaked right here. I love this game every mode, weapon, animation, story. This is my absolute favorite game of that generation.. A phenomenal end to an absolute banger of a trilogy!. I like the game and the multiplayer is also fun with friends but against other people is hard and the insane difficulty is also challenging and that's why it's fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very much more of the same with the hulking stereotypes blasting away at everything that moves in this third person shooter. Like the previous games, there's little in the way of strategy or variety but it looks nice and has some spectacular set pieces. A decent if rather mindless shoot 'em up.. 7/10 Story: 7 Gameplay: 7 Game mechanics: 7 The story wraps up and ties everything together. Gameplay was better but still the same, same with the mechanics.. Gears 3, just like 1 and 2 are must plays. I've been playing 1-3 again, but on my Series X. It's a steal price, highly recommend.. Enjoyed most of the game nice levels not too long or too short good details. Gears of war 3 is a masterpiece ****. It has a great Campaign and Multiplayer.. Best of the best!!! That's awesome, I really enjoy Gears of War 3 game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best of the original trilogy. What more can be said about Gears 3? The characters are great, the story amazing, and the combat/action is top notch. This game ups it all with amazing set pieces and some really tear jerking moments. What Ana amazing game and end to the first trilogy. Get this game and play it!. Gears of war 3 is all what i am expected the story the gameplay all are awesome. Less darker than the previous instalments in the series, but still violent and badass enough to be a true Gears of War game. While the gameplay is redefined for the better, with a larger arsenal of weapons and tools to experiment with, the campaign seems like a step-back. The multiplayer is the star of the show for sure, and the addition of Beast Mode is what the series really needed. The maps are broader than before and there are many new game-modes to play. Overall it's a great game and an improvement over Gears of War 2 in some ways, but personally I didn't like it as much. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. good plot, great gameplay, perfectly kept the bar just 10 out of 10, thanks for the Russian subs. The story the amazing gameplay the movement it is amazing but not as good a s gears of war 2. Gears of war 3 is the best in the series..great story great ending one of my fav games. Gears 3 gets an amazing ending to a great video game trilogy. The combat is as intense as you can expect, the graphics are beautiful and the story is deep enough. The only flaw is that enemies are not as tough as in gears 1 or 2 but they are a great challenge. A must-play, specially in new hardware.. Gears of War 3 was a great way to end a trilogy. I can still feel his death, and I refuse to say his name because he will live FOREVER! lol. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 1/23/21-1/26/21 100% Story Excellent! The best in the series so far. We've still got Marcus Fenix n' Gang fightin' them Loctusts and Lambents to save the human (?) race. They finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel and uncover some of the mysteries of the war and how it started. There are some surprisingly emotional moments in the story that hit me harder than I expected. The shooting is still Gears brand of cover shooting that so many games have tried to copy, but the further in that I get in the series the more comfortable it gets. New weapons and the ever present active reload makes you feel pretty skilled in each encounter. Also, Silverbacks are a really cool addition to the universe! The thing that keeps me coming back to these games isn't really the shooting so much as the clever and unique ideas that they come up with to build the world. From Brumacs to Locust Boats and Airships, it's really neat to see what the developers are going to think of next.. Pros: (Major pro) - Characters are interesting. Their dialogue creates emotional bonds between characters. (Major pro) - Main storyline makes you want to know what happens next, and plot surprises are unexpected. (Major pro) - Conversations between characters are humorous while maintaining a sense of urgency in completing the objective. (Major pro) - Graphics are amazing. Concentration on detail can be found on objects everywhere, such as armor, environment and characters. Light and shadow effects are implemented beautifully. (Major pro) - The storyline is awesome. Especially Dom's story. (For those who played Gears of War 2) (Moderate pro) - The game presents different situations for the player to use a certain type of weapon in order to be the most effective. The game offers unique and interesting weapons. (Major pro) - Multiplayer gives immense replay value. Cons: (Moderate con) - Some may find the constant gunning down enemies and moving to the next area only to gun down more enemies a repetitive task, but the game tries to mix it up with different scenarios, which keeps it as fresh as possible. (Minor con) - Sometimes you may find your teamates waltzing in and blocking your way while you are shooting an enemy. (Minor con) - Teamates do not come to your aid immediately when you are down and in need of revival. (This may be intentional by the developers in order to make it not too easy.). Great Gears, great trilogy. The story is deeper and even more touching. And the camera shaking is less annoying.. OVERALL - 86% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 9/10 Level/Area Design - 7/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 8/10 A dramatic and emotional ending to a great story with fine tuned online multiplayer.. ---{Graphics}--- ☐ You forget what reality is ☐ Beautiful X Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{Gameplay}--- ☐ Very good X Good ☐ It‘s just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{Audio}--- ☐ Eargasm X Very good ☐ Good ☐ Not too bad ☐ Bad ☐ I'm now deaf ---{Audience}--- ☐ Kids X Teens X Adults ☐ All ---{Difficulity}--- ☐ Just press 'W' ☐ Easy X Significant brain usage ☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master ☐ Difficult ☐ Dark Souls ---{Story}--- ☐ No Story ☐ Some lore ☐ Average X Good ☐ Lovely ☐ It‘ll replace your life ---{Game Time}--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short X Average ☐ Long ☐ To infinity and beyond ---{Price}--- ☐ It’s free!

GREAT GAME WITH A BADASS SLAP CERTIFIED Story: 10 Gameplay: 8 ost: 10 Characters: 10. As someone who loves the previous two games, I was kind of let down with this one. A lot of improvements from the last game but I think the story in this was the weakest out of the original two. There just wasn't enough heart even though this game DOES pull on one major string after that it just feels flat which is a shame. Though the Locust are still around, the new focused baddies are a force not to be messed with. More creepy and more ruthless but I'm not sure why I didn't find them to be all that unlike their counterpart. The missions also felt repetitive, some of them kind of felt as if they didn't serve anything for the game's overall story and were just made to give us a full plate which I can appreciate but eh. Overall, for the conclusion to the original trilogy, this one falls sorta flat for me. Beautiful graphics and grand moments, but with a much weaker story from where Gears of War 2 left off.. Gears of War 3 was a satisfying and fun end to the original trilogy. The ending is one of m favorites in video games.. Gears of War 3 is great, but not as innovative as the previous two. There are new additions and online modes, but the formula is pretty much the same. It lacks the freshness of the first and the refinements of the second. This is a lot like Uncharted 3 and other concluding chapters in that regard. Regardless, it's a fitting end to the trilogy and contains some really great moments. Multiplayer is what really is improved upon, not the campaign. Overall, it's the third best Gears game ever made. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. Great conclusion to the OG Gears Trilogy. Characters are given ample amount of motivation to ""finish the fight"" in what felt like a fitting conclusion.. A legendary game and the pilar for the genre with great graphics for the time and excellent gameplay.. A great game, with a good story and enjoyable combat, but not really a fan of the less dark & atmospheric approach, there are times where it feels like a stereotypical American action movie.. The epic conclusion of Marcus Fenix and the final battle against the Locust and a new enemy, the Lambent. A solid and complete game in every section, with spectacular campaign and one of the best multiplayer so far, with the inclusion of beast mode in which you can be a locust, MUST HAVE.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GREAT.. Gears of War 3 a wonderful conclusion to the great trilogy from Epic Games. GOW3 failed to exceed the 2 part, but it closed the majority of the story holes of the 2 previous parts. On Xbox One X, the game looks amazing, seeing 4K textures in the 2011 game. Azura turned out particularly beautifully in the last chapter. And so GOW3 is not a masterpiece, but a further evolution of one of the best series of games from Microsoft.. That's great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡. Great trilogy ending, multiplayer is awesome to (off line and on line) many option to full fill a must **** etc. There is something about the Gears of War franchise that I’m really enjoying. The games have all aged very well, there is a story here and there are characters that are likable. Gears of War kind of reminds me of PlayStations franchise Uncharted. They’re both third-person shooters, the big difference is Uncharted is much more story and character driven where Gears is much more shooter driven. If that makes sense. With that being said though, this iteration is definitely the most cinematic of the three. The first one didn’t really have any narrative, the second one had its moments that felt cinematic but the third is really where they perfected the nuance of storytelling. Gears of War 3 was an excellent addition to the trilogy. I would really have to sit down and figure out which one is my favorite. I’ll probably do that at some point after I’ve played Judgement and Gears of War 4. But for now, this is an excellent game that has aged very well.. Undoubtedly the best game in the series! Horde Mode, Beast Mode, enticing Campaign, kickass weapons. It's essential for me to hold onto this game, because it is easily my favorite game Microsoft has brought to the table.. Gears of War 3 is one of the greatest games of all GoW, and my score is 10. (?). At this point the games are starting to feel the exact same. There are great parts, it's fun for a while, but it feels like the same game.. development team did a fantastic job adopting the Gears of War series fantactic.. Gears of War 3 is epic. I haven't had this much fun in a game since Bulletstorm, which Epic games helped build as well. The story is pretty good, but Gears 2's was much better. The visuals are also very nice. The multiplayer and horde modes are great too, and extend it's playtime. But the gameplay is where the real fun is with Gears 3.. Gears of War 3 may seem like more of the same, but it's GoW perfected -- and any true fan of the series can attest for this. The presentation and layout of the game happen to be the most impressive package available from a third person shooter perspective. Even the DLC is desirable content that diversifies the game as a whole and makes it more attractive than it already is without any additional modes/maps.. Gears of War 3, in my opinion, is the best Gears of War game of the series. It improves once again on all fronts, making an even better campaign with some truly gut-punching moments and events that feel desperate as ever, a multiplayer that arguably was solid despite issues, a horde mode 2.0 that made the experience rewarding and great and a beast mode that twisted the concept of horde mode and made being a Locust unit feel badass and awesome. Where to even begin... Alot of hardcore Gears fans will tell you this is the worst of the series due to the homogenizing of its multiplayer in favor of a ""COD"" approach with weapon skins and custom classes, but I actually quite liked it. The smooth flow of the combat made it tolerable to play against players despite not adapting a 60fps game for a smoother experience. The different weapons added variety and forced players to behave differently than previous games. It ultimately though was DOA after the first month for the community in that regard, which really is a shame but as they say ""different strokes for different folks"". The campaign still had a few issues, but with the death of Dominic Santiago and great set piece moments like ""Break Neck Sprint, a four player coop that fully utilized the team that the series had in tow for years realized and new enemies and weapons, it just made the game feel far better overall. It ends on a fairly good note, although the Queen boss fight would not be a particularly good fight to end on. The death of the Queen by Marcus stabbing her with Dominic's knife was pretty dam good, and the gravitas of not just his death, but ALL the deaths by the Locust Horde was symbolized through Marcus's rough and gruff demeanor. The horde mode is fantastic. You earn money through killing enemies, can share it with your teammates, have challenges to earn more money and build things to prove helpful in fighting the hordes. It made going through waves easier and adding boss rounds every 10 waves was really great and felt like a mad scramble to beat them. Some maps are better than others to play it on however, as Brumaks clipping through small maps like Checkout and Escalation really makes it hard to win. Overall, a huge improvement for the mode from 2 and was my favorite mode. Beast mode's first time in the fray proved far more successful than Horde in Gears 2, making Locust units increase in type as you killed more and earned more money. Tearing through barricades as a Berzerker was amazing, being an Armoured Kantus was the coolest thing for me as I spike rolled people and used dual machine pistols. Having some more support units would have been preferable, but what was there was really good. There are a couple missteps. In terms of DLC, Microsoft never really sold me on its maps for multiplayer nor side campaigns. In Gears 2, their dlc was more or less a deleted section of gameplay that adds very little to the overall game's campaign, making it effectively overpriced. As for Gears 3's RAAM's shadow, there were good parts in it, but ultimately fail to achieve their goals because they try to overwrite the lore and story of the game's universe and assume people who play it are too dumb to see it. It's also short, but far far longer than the previous dlc. It introduces characters that don't really develop well organically and is more of a fanservice of the lowest minority who care about the Gears universe (such as Barrick who is only in the comics). It was overall mediocre, and unfortunately this mindset would turn the next Gears game into a prequel dream and ruin much of the namesake as a result. Gears of War 3 will always be my favorite of the series. If we graphed the franchise in order, then Gears 3 would be the peak of the franchise for me, regardless if veterans would disagree strongly. A game should always be judged by its entirety and not just its main hook. Even if someone only plays Gears for the multiplayer, I like playing games in their entirety to experience the work (or lack of) put into them by the teams who make them. In the case for 3, it served as my favorite Gears entry and one of the best third-person games of all time.. Loved the first game and the second one was just ok for me I had some big issues with it. The third game has now come out and after beating it I honestly feel like it falls somewhere in the middle. The first being a 9 for me and the second being a 6 or 7 I feel very comfortable with an 8. Didn't reach what I had hoped it would but still a lot of fun. I love the Gears franchise its my. It's a good finale to the original Gears trilogy and plays exactly how you'd expect a Gears game to play. Whether that is good or bad depends on if you liked the past games because this is more of the same.. Recently played the game and it was a HUGE let down. After how amazing Gears of War 1 & 2 were I had high expectations for this, only to be disappointed. The gameplay is boring, level designs are bland, no atmosphere, character designs are lame, only the story is decent. Couldn't even sit thru the campaign. Nowhere near as good as Gears 2.. The third adventure of Marcus Fenix has great moments, one of them took to tears from my eyes (even I was impressed). With a plot as good as the second, Gears of War 3 could be a great weekend journey for good franchise (Could have good 4 now) that made the most of all he had to show up to that point. It was a great game.. Superbly, the graphics are jaw-dropping, and impeccable gameplay, history and well-written characters with **** stay forever in the history of games, Gears is wonderful everything was done with great care and with many details, but rather an game to top it off gold trilogy.. Gears of War 3 is a military science fiction third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft. + Fun Gameplay + Coop + Multiplayer - Bad Story - Stupid Characters - Repetitive. The campaign is a brilliant cinematic adventure and perfectly caps off the trilogy. The ending is predictable, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining or detract from the enjoyment you can get out of the story. Absolutely loved every second of it. Horde 2.0 is absolutely amazing and provides endless fun whether you're playing with mutators solo or a pure match with randoms. The fortification system adds critical replay incentive to keep players coming back for more, and the entire mode just flows perfectly. It's probably the apex predator of wave-based survival game modes. I have yet to see any other game beat Gears 3 Horde in that department. Multiplayer is this game's bread and butter, no doubt about that. While the DLC is worth every penny and greatly expands your map choices, the default maps are just as fun to play on. Map layouts are beautiful and perfectly structured to fit the style of gameplay. As someone who swears off online PvP, I was thrilled that PvE was fully integrated into multiplayer, allowing players to earn XP and progress their commendations in private matches with AI opponents. At the same time, PvP is still there for those who prefer doing things the old fashioned way. There really is something for everyone, and that's something that can't be said for a lot of games today. This game is an absolute masterpiece. That's all I can say.. Gears of War 3 has the best coop-game that I've never seen before. This is the only reason to buy Gears of War 3. Multiplayer has a lot of bug to aim heads and monsters, but is a really easy win.. this game is sensational finished recently, exellent story and co-op in the campaign, addictive online very worth buying and if you did not have the 360 do not be sad because the cause of backward compatibility u can play this game on xbox and one case like the game worth buying the gears 4. Gears of War 3 is a military science fiction third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft + Fun Gameplay + Coop + Multiplayer - Boring Story - Stupid Characters - Repetitive. This game is very overrated, obv not a 0 but sure as hell nothing higher than an 8, i gave it a 0 mainly as a response to all the unnecessary 10's, I bet most of the people who gave it that haven't even played it, stupid fanboys. Was the best, most varied, biggest, and most balanced Gears of the past, and still is the best to this day. Was hoping to see a Remasterered or Ultimate version of this for Xbox one, but the game is already perfect so the devs decided not to defile it in any way. Heres to hoping Gears 4 is more like 3 and nothing like Judgement.. From a true Gears of war fan . This is still my favourite game , I have it on my Xbox One as well and I am still playing the campaign a lot . I am more a single player person but I have to praise the horde mode too as this an amazing addition and even improved form Gears of war 2 . This game completely lost the dark atmosphere that we had in Gears of war 1 and 2 as it focusses a lot more on the war and struggle of humanity . Despite this , the story is well done and the campaing is more fun than both of the 2 already excellent predecessors . The improvements in this installment make it a better game on every level. Never i have not played Gears of War , but before another consequence , the third installment was impressive, everyone 's joy , and this was the best game I've played.. The story is garbage. The characters all chew the scenery. I played the first two, and I was lost as far as where the story was going. It's like I missed out on some world building via some other medium. The graphics are gorgeous. The cover mechanic is great. Attaching to cover can be cumbersome at times, but I got the feel for it after a little while. I'll probably check the fourth installment when it comes out next year.. gears 3 is awesome. great mulitplayer, great amazing single player, and great coop. makes gears 3 a fantasitc experince. if you think mw3 is awesome your wrong becuase mw3 ****.. This perhaps is a rare occasion where the community absolutely ruined the experience of the game for me but I'm gonna save that for later, right now from gears of war 2 you need to know absolutely nothing in terms of story, there's these creatures called lambent that are yellow and blow up and then there's these albino guys called Locust and if you're a gear of war fan then this conclusion doesn't really tie anything up, some questions for me were who was the queen, what are these things, what's Marcus' dad have to do with them, etc. and none of them are resolved. Gameplay is the same as gears of war 2 only a little more fluid and smooth. As for multiplayer it's absolutely the worst and it baffles me how this stays up, there's only team deathmatch and even though there's other game types this is the only one that truly matters, it's incredibly unbalanced with weapons like sawed off that can be a little forgiving since it does have a short range, to weapons like the retro lancer that downs in less than 3 seconds like a shot gun and you can just charge up to someone and either hit them doing major damage and finish them off or ram them for an execution. Had these guns been pick up rather than selected in your load out everything might of been better, but in this case everything is OP and no one will have fun, I've played with the hammer burst and due to my twitchy finger I can shoot it at incredible speed, but guess what show any amount of skill and you'll be bombarded with hate mail with a community of **** I'm not joking it's the worst community out there, I remember one time where in the middle of a match someone messaged me saying ""Nice mod noob ;)"" then I calmly (I'm not joking) at the end of the match turn my mic on and say in the most soft and nice tone possible ""By the way I don't have a mod"" and the guy bragging on the other team who sent me the message screamed ""IM F***ING DONE WITH YOU"" and rage quit despite his team winning. That's the norm in the game. There's also a bunch of bugs that crash the game example (hasn't been patched and never will be) you push a button while spinning some grenades around and it'll somehow either freeze other players' games or lag the match. Other issues are how the host will be the most OP broken person (it's randomly decided) I've been host I've tanked point blank shots and instead instantly kill other's. It's 2015 don't bother with this game, nothing interesting about the plot that someone can just tell you, the multiplayer should just dwindle and die. This game is not bad though it maybe above average if not for some little flaws, but with the flaws (community and all) in mind it's just an average cover based shooter since it is the poster boy for cover based shooting.. This game is so epic it needs it's own rating scale of epicness! There is too much good to say that I would never have the space or time to even ever get to anything else. Trueachievements claims that this takes 200+ hours to complete!?. GoW3's campaign is about as good as the second game's. It's an intense finale with some truly epic moments. New enemies and guns are introduced and eveything is still fun (except the lambents, which I found annoying and a little overused). The multiplayer and co-op are as good, if not better than before and there's also a fourth mode, Beast Mode, where you play as various locusts, form mini ones with little claws to hulking mound of meat with giant melee weapons. With four modes, there's plenty of content in this entry, making it another fine entry in the series. I'd give it an 8.5/10, just like GoW2, but it pulls slightly ahead perhaps because of the extra mode.. This game was just amazing delivering excitement each time i played a new mission and is just great and enjoyed every second of it and it made me 100% the game, muiltplayer also has no flaws. A must own.. The Gears of War series trilogy concludes with this entry and the people from Epic Games bring us another action packed experience. Subtle refinements can be found throughout, However outside of some expansion to the multiplayer element it doesn't do that much new for the series. Still this is one any 360 owner needs to check out. The campaign is exactly what you would expect from a Gears game. The four-player co-op has never been better, but outside of a few new enemy types and some great set-pieces it doesn't really do anything new. However it is hard to complain when the action is this solid. It's still a heck of a lot of fun. The story behind it all is pretty solid as well. However the emotional moments fall flat due to the way these steroid-pumped heroes have always been presented. It concludes the series well though and manages to have some interesting twists on what we all thought was going on. When you're finished with the campaign the massive multiplayer will keep you busy for a very long time. Matches are a blast and the maps are well designed. The co-op modes steal the show however. Horde mode is back and bigger than ever. The beast mode is an interesting twist that puts you in the role of the Locust racing against the time during rounds. Whatever mode you play you are in for hours of fun. However multiplayer has one big issue nowadays; you have to buy all the DLC in oder to play on dedicated servers. Not downloading the DLC means no multiplayer for you. You can download the on free map pack and be able to play on host servers so it's not so bad. However in order to experience the full force of it you better be willing to shell out some cash for the DLC. Something to keep in mind if you are planning to rent this game like I did. Overall despite it's flaws this is a complete package. It's a fitting end to the story of one of the 360's biggest series. With action and content this tight, it would be foolish for any 360 owner to pass this up.. A great way to end the Gears Of War trilogy. Great amounts of gore and fun in this game. Play it, it's pretty cheap now. Verdict: An awesome game that ends the GOW trilogy very well. 9/10. This is one of those rare games that strikes a balance of good single-player and multiplayer components. I found myself a bit uninterested from time to time, but the Gears formula that has earned it countless awards and tens of millions of units sold is here and better than ever.. I haven't played the Multiplayer-aspect of the game, since I am mostly just interested in the story and co-op-experience. Both me and the friend I played it with lost interest quite early the first time we played it, and it took two years before we picked it up again, and finally finished it. I think we both felt that the game didn't really bring anything new to the table, and it just felt too repetitive. Having said that, the game still delivers a really solid experience, and is absolutely on par with the previous games in the franchise.. This is my first game of GoW series. This game is absolutely enjoyable and very good. Especially i laughed a lot for Cole. About story, its not boring and you want to play all day. And the ending i suprised very much. If you got a Xbox 360, you have to play this game. If you don't you will be miss a lot of things.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. How sequels should progress, the level of polish on all the mechanics contained in this game, not to mention DEDICATED SERVERS finally! There are few co-op competitive shooters that are truly Co-op, and gears 3 can certainly boast that.. This is a major improvement over both Gears of War 1 and 2. It's a nice conclusion to a well done franchise. If you're new to this series check out the whole lot. It's non-stop action.. Btw, Carmine lives! A good Saturday-night romp that feels like all those cheesy action movies in game form but in a good way. It's quite laughable how the series tries to act serious even though there's chainsaw guns and orbital death rays. They downgraded many of the guns and ruined the gorgon pistol. They thought most of the weapons were too overpowered for multiplayer so the hammer of dawn has a smaller radius and a meeker beam. The lancer is extremely overpowered though, you can run through multiplayer and easily win the match simply by running and revving the aforementioned chainsaw gun. They talk about balancing even though the mortar (which actually is quite easy to obtain and can actually bomb half the map) mulcher , and Vulcan are easily accessible. You actually have to pay for on-disc, level-locked content as dlc. Most of the maps are pretty awful and so is the audio whenever you chat with headsets. Still, the active reload system is ingenious and so are the boss battles. Too bad that most of the shining stars of the weapon list are rarely accessible in campaign. It actually presses your tear ducts when Dom passes away. I could care less for the new characters.. 9/10 GOW VET! Asides from one OP weapon,(Retro) this is the best in the series, Ignore all the boys who can not beast with out host now! This game STILL has dedicated servers! Horde is loads of fun also!. The best Gears of War game ever! It's formula is near perfect, besides the sawed-off.. which thankfully no one really uses anymore. The only way this game could have gotten any better is if they included a map creator on a second disk. Community created stuff is always the best! Maybe next time","introducing horde mode, that brings fans a PVE experience, and capping of the trilogy with a great campaign . this is a very good brutal game nice campaign interesting heroes the best gears of war game . i love this game every mode, weapon, animation, story ."
254.Killzone 2,"Killzone 2 is a fantastic shooter, that brings gorgeous visuals, a rich universe, and strong gunplay to the PlayStation 3.. every time my king mael radec appears im like Usher in the confessions part 2 music video where he slides on his knees out of the car and hugs the woman thats me with that grown ass man. Great game, I wish they come up with this one again for the next generations.. Excellent FPS that I have played before but bar the part I originally got stuck on I didn't remember and have to say it was excellent. I am shocked Sony hasn't remastered this trilogy. Now looking forward to playing 3 as i never played that one.. Not a bad game but there was a lot of much more better shooters back then, i give a 6 for nostalgic reasons.. Yeah whatever inspirations for 10 26 2018 @D and Nov 9 2022 Games btw nice try tho.. This is one of the worst shooters I've ever played, and I don't mean that lightly. It seems like the reviewers like IGN and Gamespot must have gotten payment from the developers to pad the ratings to make it positive. I expected at least a decent sci-fi campaign but it was much worse than I thought. Get ready to fight basically the same 3 enemies for the whole game except sometimes with different guns. The gunplay intially feels good and quite raw, however get ready to spend most of the game in cover (which I will get to in a moment). Some of the guns here are actually good, such as the shotgun and SMG but the rest feel too inaccurate. After the second level, there is almost no unique mechanics (except for the heavy turret gun) which makes the variety of the levels nearly non-existent. Pretty much every shooter I have played including the bad ones had at least one good level. Killzone 2 has none. Take halo for an example, a game that killzone wanted to compete with. In halo you had a good amount of variety: you had stealth levels, vehicle levels, and levels that introduced new enemy types (flood). Even though halo has it's own problems each level tried to keep things unique so the player wasn't bored with having to fight the same enemies ad infinitum. In killzone 2 you fight the same helghast from beginning to end. I can only think of three moments where this wasn't the case. And even when the game tries to add a new enemy or some variety you get something terrible like the sniper enemies which can kill you in one hit and you have only 3 short seconds to react. Or the rocket launchers, which can kill in one hit and can even kill you in cover (it happened to me twice). While I'm on the topic, the cover system is awful. I would have rather they just went with a prone or crouch feature than having to stick behind cover. And even if you are behind cover the enemies above can kill you anyway! The story is also terrible, which the positive reviewers even admit. I haven't played the first game so I can't compare it to that. The game starts off with an interesting and an emotionally evoking speech from the main leader of the helghast. His dialogue in that scene is also good. However, all of the interesting elements of the story immediately disappear once you meet the cardboard cutouts from the ISA. There is not one good line of dialogue between any of the members of the ISA. This was around the time when game developers were trying to make games cinematic and everything ended up relying on tropes. The story could have been redeemed if they showed more of the helghast side of things. They seemed like the only interesting element of the games world. They could've told an actual story with actual substance playing as a soldier in an elite unit of the helghast army. Instead they wasted it. Although I haven't played all the missions but I made it to the sixth mission which is more than enough to pass judgment. I think it's fair to assume the story and gameplay doesn't get any better since in the six missions I played nothing actually happened storywise that effected the plot. The cutscenes in the levels are very pointless and could've been omitted since the dialogue just consists of getting the next mission objective. The only praise I can honestly give to the game is the sound design and graphics. Whoever was responsible for those good elements should have gotten hired on an actually good game. In conclusion, if you are looking to check this game out I would find something else worth your time and leave killzone 2 forgotten.. Definitely, 1 of THE best FPS ever!! Setting the game trailer debacle aside, this game looks fantastic, even in 2023. The Helghan soldiers being somewhat bullet sponges (head shots knock off helmets & they continue the fight, & their flack jackets absorb major artillery), it's still an adrenaline run throughout the game. If you still have a working PS3, I recommend you scoop the trilogy, as it's very low priced, as I type.. The best Killzone game. It looks and plays great for a PS3 game and also is a great follow up to the original.. One of the best exclusive on PS3 the game itself is so good to play and replay the campain because of his beatiful moments in the game such a masterpiece on PS3 too bad SONY didnt porting on PC or in his other console. The original Killzone on the PS2 was a visually pleasing but very linear FPS with a rather lacklustre storyline. Exactly the same can be said about this sequel in that the graphics are excellent but the story is nothing more than gung ho stereotypes spouting clichés at each other and it feels quite old fashioned and limited in comparison to the likes of Halo and Mass Effect. Well enough executed to still be considered a good, solid old school FPS however.. KILLZONE 2 is one of the best FPS games you should play on PS2. The hype for this game payed off.. One of the best Killzone game's there is. This is not one to miss out on. The graphics, the story (albeit short) and the multiplayer (now botzone and private servers) is excellent. This game was such a fun time back in the day. I recommend it, the impact this had on the games industry was massive and I still think it holds up today. Thank you Geurilla!. In my opinion, the second-best FPS game for the PS3 after the OG Modern Warfare 2. The surprise from the trailer that was notoriously **** fake to releasing and getting some fantastic reviews was SUCH a surprise to me and I love it for a reason.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I hate exclusive games, I so wish Killzone 2 existed for PC! I played on PS3 plus the best experience that an FPS can give and playing with mouse and keyboard. Good game, if not a bit dull. Final boss was pretty annoying but doable. I good looking FPS on the PS3.. Killzone 2 is a great shooter. It's grim and dirty. Heavy and gritty. It's a fun experience for the single player campaign alone. The story is fairly simple and while the characters are nothing to boast about, the plot driving the story is compelling from start to finish. This game feels good and weighty. Guns and melee attacks pack a punch. The cinematics are well done and we'll shot. The levels are well designed and the art direction is somewhat unique. The multiplayer is game changing. The way a single match can have three or so different game modes at once is unique and exciting, resulting in matches that can last up to 30 or so minutes. Overall, Killzone 2 is great! The single player campaign has a good story with a few memorable and entertaining characters, good cinematography, good pacing and fun levels. The multiplayer is like nothing else out there, even to this day.. Killzone 2 is a must have for the PS3, a huge improvement over the first Entry in the series. Even in 2022 the graphics are still impressive, the gun play feels nice, there are even some vehicle section, also the game is overall challenging compared to other FPS of that era. But even Killzone 2 has some bad bits. A lot of Environments have this yellow-bronish filter, there are constant enemy swarms that are plain annoying, some Enemy's are bullet sponges, also while the protagonist of the first game is present in the game, your main character is just a normal soldier with absolute no background. The Story is nothing special, but it's alright. Still would recommend to play it at least once if you are a fan of the genre.. Killzone 2 looks and feels amazing. While the story is a bit mundane, the fun gameplay and fantastic multiplayer make up for it.. proud to be a ps3 owner, fantastic game, visuals gameplay everything!!!!!!!. This is Amazing but Real. This game is better than MW2. Graphics are Excellent, even better than some modern day games All that textures, lighting, character models are top notch. Gameplay is Very, very Great, The Cover system adds a realism and quality to the game that other games don't have. AI Much better than many games. It did a better job than all Call of Duty games. Story is slightly above average. But Lore is Very Nice and Multiplayer is wonderful. However, the biggest problem in the game is that there is very little variety of vehicles, the vehicles we use are only Tank, AA gun, Anti-Aircraft and EXO . Although 4 vehicles seem like enough for you, we use these vehicles for a very short time, which reduces the variety in the game. But that's the only problem with the game, everything else is very Great .Lastly, the game makes good use of the Controller's features, Vibration puts you in a more combat atmosphere, and Motion sensors are well used on C4s or valves. My score is 93. Atmosphere: 9 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 7 Music: 7 Story: 8 Total: 8.17. An excellent sony shooter that is played with great pleasure. On a high difficulty level, there is a finely honed balance that does not allow you to relax, but appreciates the player's skills, in contrast to sitting in shelters (uncharted 1-3). An excellent gameplay-oriented game with excellent visual style (just look at the hellgast) and graphics (which, albeit too dark, showed a decent level for the console, although worse than crysic, which gave many computers tests). It is difficult, painful and the game hits the balls, but after passing through you experience a great sense of ****’s very interesting to go through. Among the shortcomings, the questionable use of the capabilities of the gamepad, excessively dark graphics, the plot of the game will not present interesting stories in the notes, and the fps is sometimes small (but considering the graphics, this is normal). Would bet the game 9 out of 10. To increase the overall rating, I put 10 out of 10.. I have been playing this game for awhile now and the more I play it the more I don't like it. the controls are terrible. There's is so much lag when you turn its almost impossible to kill **** top of that every gun is extremely inaccurate, there's is no point aiming down sights. Multiplayer is descent , the controls are a little better but most of time enemy camps outside your spawn, killing you every time you spawn. They are a lot better because of the unlocked abilities they have and you don't have anything.. The best exclusive shooter on the PS3. It might be overrated by critics, but it's a big improvement over the original. Any fan of Sony's Uncharted series will be impressed. The campaign is a lot of fun and the multiplayer is enjoyable. While Killzone will never be a Halo killer, this is the best of the series. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. One of the most overrated games I've ever played in my life. Can't believe how bought-off some of these critics are. The campaign barely **** 5 HOURS. It wants to be CoD so bad it added ADSing and nearly all the guns it added are carbon copies of modern weaponry (the Bizon, M14, M249, and LAW). The AI is absurdly braindead and will get in your way constantly. Be prepared to bash your teammates to oblivion to try and make enough space to walk past them in the tiny corridors where they nearly always block you. Plus the enemy AI just ignores you half the time. The cover system is so insanely bad I couldn't believe my eyes. When you duck out from cover your crosshair moves making it so that you can't line up shots beforehand. Not that any of the guns aside from the LMG are accurate enough to headshot with anyway. Sometimes you'll just get one-shotted by enemies from full health as well. There are the rocket launchers that do way too much splash damage, but also sometimes enemies will just put a burst into you and you'll die from full health, on normal difficulty. It happened to me about 8 times in my playthrough. Speaking of, the UI is so bad you almost never know where you're getting shot from, especially if you're colorblind like me. The story is also even more basic than the first game, and the characters are even more annoying, constantly screaming at you to hurry up or to revive them, not to mention just being the dumbest people alive, except for one of them who isn't in the game very long. But the worst part of the game is the performance. There are so many loading screens, loading stutters, and loading freezes. The game has to load practically every room you step foot in and every 30 paces you take. Even with all that loading, during firefights you'll be lucky to get more than 15 or 20 FPS, often lower if there's a lot going on and the god-awful framerate makes aiming a chore. Honestly, the only reason to play this game is to use that delicious flamethrower. Seriously, best flamethrower I've seen in a game. This game was such a disappointment. Compared to its contemporaries like Modern Warfare 2 and Halo 3: ODST, this game is an absolute amateurish embarrassment. They had a good foundation going on with the first game and I couldn't wait to see the story, characters, and gameplay refined for a sequel. Instead, they focused solely on graphics and absolutely nothing else, making this truly some of the most insulting tripe the AAA industry has puked out. Do yourself a favor and steer clear.. For me it is an OK **** has nice graphics,but sometimes they felt bit to **** voice acting sync sometimes was off it was not good at **** controls felt very sluggish,even i set the sensitivity on the highest level.. Killing space **** has never felt so good. Guerilla games has produced an excellent sequel which distills the core gameplay down to a satisfying loop.. This games has incredible graphics, a very good gameplay and an emotional storyline.. Very good game. Even for today. Beautiful graphics. If you're a FPS fan then you should play this game by any means. I don't know if the servers are still working or are down but i spent hours and hours playing the online mode back since it's so fun and addictive i ranked first for so many times and i was in the top players of the week i got my platinum already the hard mode in the single player is a real challenge especially for the last mission and the controls are different than the other fps games but that's what makes this game so unique i had no problem using R3 button for zooming or L3 to sprint this is a must play ps3 game. 7/10 big improvement from the first installment, though what to expect after half a decade? Nice guns, nice gameplay, weird ass controls though, very strange, bare in mind this came out the same year as MW2, and the controls on MW2 are smooth as butter. Story was good. Howevery, the reason as to why this won't get a 10/10 is because I can't turn off motion sensor like I could in KZ3. I play with a 3rd party controller, since I broke my DS3 back in 2015 I believe and original DS3 controllers are going around for 100+ € and I cannot afford that for one dumbass controller, so I will sadly never be able to play this game again.. Sure, the PlayStation 3 had many great fps games. But then there was Killzone 2! This game is more action packed than a Bruce Willis blockbuster movie. Combined with a cool story, superb controls and graphics, that can still keep up today. Just WOW!. Grim and entertaining FPS that actually cares about its worldbuilding and that makes for a good tale of war.. This is an old masterpiece But it hasn't aged well at all. The game was a chore to play and the enemies were bullet sponges. Killzone is a a rare series where the sequel is the best in the series , among-st borderlands and banjo kazooie. killzone2 rose from the mild dumpster fire that was killzone 1 to forge an identity for it self and make a huge splash despite the advertisement debacle. Story: you play as sev an isa soldier who is part of a small what seems to be spec ops division of the isa. the story is probably the weakest part of this game , and characters are kinda boring . rico returns from killzone 1 but he was much more over the top in killzone one , here he is still a rough tough angry and violent man but he cares about his friends and squad mates . Sev being the player character is mostly silent and when he dose show emotion it dose feel awkward and unwarranted , like when one of the characters dose die ( wont tell you who) he gets angry and him and Rico start fighting and that felt out of place to me. besides little awkward moments the story flowed really well and had excellent pacing Story: 8/10 World building: killzone's best aspect to it is 100% its world building and killzone 2 builds on the first killzones lore in big ways . and this really just feels like one event in a bigger story, to the way every thing looks to the helgan planet to even the helgans ideologies vs the ideology of the isa every little bit of lore is in service to either the game play or the story. i like the world war 2 feel to the lore but with a sci fi spin on things makes for a truly great world World building: 10/10 Graphics: killzone 2 looks great , animations are very dynamic alot of thought was put into the reload animations , mostly because they are well made fictional guns . lighting is well done and the colour pallet is dark and neonish witch over all helps set the gritty cinematic tone for the game. for the ps3 this game looks great and even holds up today in 2019 graphics 9/10 Gameplay: first person shooters are a dime a dozen these days but killzone 2 manages to set it self apart in terms of game play in little ways. like how most guns are actually inaccurate and shooting for center mass is a legitimate strategy in this game where in other games id be aiming for head shots. the cover system in this game is innovative taking cues from 3rd person cover shooters but done in a first person view it makes it so much more immersive. the games difficulty is just right and a solid game direction makes for a great cinematic game a huge step up from killzone 1 gameplay: 8/10 sound design: for killzone 1 sound design was poor even having no battle music, BUT killzone 2 said none of that this time , all the music is cinematic and has an industrial feel to it witch goes along with the lore and story , and voice acting has greatly improved as well , lines are well spoken and not super cheesy ( maybe a little cheesy but not super ) all the guns sound cool and makes them a joy to shoot . sound design:8/10 8+10+9+8+8=43 43/5= 8.6 killzone 2 is a triumph over its predecessor and breaks the mold to become one of gameings greats. KILLZONE 2 IS STILL ONE OF MY BEST FPS EVER Well i am a fan of killzone saga and am writing this in 2019 i love all killzones and all of them are rock especialy killzone 2 man its owsome game its very cool killzone 2 its one of my best 3d shooter game i love the story , the action, the sounds, the adventure the story. just buy this game you will love it but one important thing, me as a realistic the maps are all like the same and ugly its the helghans planet all places looks same not so diffrent then other maps. and the trailer of E3 2005 its not like the game that was a fake, but for me the game is alot better then the es 2005 trailer, the AI is perfect, their is alot o soldiers type, and i will never forget when i faced the rocket launcher with the knife he was reloading,man he was afraid when he saw me getting close, this game is awsome, i enjoyed the online more then any others game, sad that we have to move on with other games whil time is passed. killzone 3 was kickass but 2 is better for me. ok guys i hope my review help you to decide to buy this game have a good game and enjoy online, my user is R-SOUB. ""Killzone 2"" is definitely a major step up from ""Killzone 1"". The graphics are really good, and the enemy AI provides one heck of a challenge. So why is my rating so low? Well, unfortunately, the ally AI is so terrible that it made the last boss fight ridiculously unfair. I watched in horror as the final boss riddled Rico with bullets repeatedly, while Rico just stood there facing the opposite direction. Did he run? Did he return fire? No, he stood there, apparently so entranced by the palace architecture that he barely noticed the blood spewing from himself. This happened so often during the course of the game that the only reason I continued playing was I'm OCD and a glutton for punishment. Also, the dialog was terrible, the voice acting was terrible, and the plot had so many points that lacked common sense it was difficult to suspend disbelief. Further, why would you ever put someone as dumb and as wholly worthless as Rico in charge of a squad? Further, the enemy, the Helghast, were far more interesting--well, actually interesting--than the people on your own side. Nothing irritates me more about a video game than when it starts off amazing and slides down the garbage chute the further in you go. It was wholly frustrating and rage-inducing to watch.. A really good game, there are lots of cool things about it and it is a lot of fun to play.. After playing the first game and was astounded by how tedious and bland the game was, Killzone 2 blew me away. The gameplay itself was exponentially better, so much more fluid and challenging. The graphics were gorgeous and have aged so well, made it hard to believe that this game is 8+ years old. The characters were expanded on from the first game as they had really no depth at all in the first game, and you play as a character separate from the four main characters which allows you to care about the main protagonist (inherently) and also the supporting characters since you've played as them before. Like a beautiful combination of Battlefield's gameplay and Halo's futurism with a score straight out of Hans Zimmer's career, Killzone 2 shines bright and stands out as one of gaming's best shooters.. My first game of Killzone that I played. The campaign is brutal and the graphics are so realistic. The multiplayer has 32 players in a match with a lot of game modes and a variety of class like Battlefield. One headshot with any weapon = one kill. Is simply perfect.. Really good shooter with awesome bullet impact and shooting mechanics and intriguing storyline. an awesome story, gameplay, graphics and multiplayer!, but it lacks of enemy variety. When i give an 8, is because a game is mediocer. Killzone is a bad gray and red-ish colour pallete with just one gameplay purpose, go to a cover and shoot in everything that pops on the screen. The game is good just on the last level when going to the palace. I don't understand how the critics and players loves this game. it is completely inferior to Resistance series.. This game looks awesome! I would say it's up to par with Gears 1 and 2. But the gameplay could be worked on a bit. It feels like you are moving in slow motion. The whole aiming scheme is just horrible it feels like you can't hit anything. When you jump it doesn't even feel like you are jumping, or when you run it feels so slow and awkward. But the cheesiest feel is when you. Not fan of fps games but this one has great art direction with top quality graphics. Another PlayStation 3 tech demo like Uncharted but i enjoye much more. Dirty metal future war with **** like Helghast was great experience.. this game is sick, i was loving it when i first played this, graphics were kool, gameplay and online aswell, .. This is my first game review... I'm playing KZ2 while my PS4 downloads an update for another game. This game is okay, but I'm not fond of the controls. X/Y sensitivity is sluggish, you cannot turn quickly while sprinting... and I prefer using O to crouch, but that's not an option in this game. The cover system is terrible, as is attempting to melee an enemy. Grenades are slow to toss, the pistol is slow to fire. Only being able to carry 1 heavy weapon kinda ****. Story-wise, I haven't been paying it much attention, I wouldn't call it captivating. Graphics were great. Enemies all sound the same. NPC allies are generally useless. I haven't beaten it yet, actually haven't played it in quite some time, as other games had captured my attention. I'd call it a disappointingly average game, so I'll give it a score that reflects my opinion. 5/10.. The game is amazing the bosses really difficult to passing through! I like the game highly recommend so far this game is the best of Killzone's out there! Maybe in the future I will update this review if they come up with something better than Killzone 2. Killzone 2 is still one of the best FPS ever made. It makes most of the other shooting games on the PS3, PS4, and Xbox look like wii games in comparison. Even almost 7 years later I still repaly it once a year since the controls and mechanics are just so solid. Graphically, the game is a masterpiece - so much so that you can just stand there taking in your surroundings, unable to believe that developers could make such a visual feast. And of course the game itself is pure FPS with great gunplay, awesome enemy AI and killer envrionments to unleash your carnage. The characters are great too and the single player campaign is a nice, lengthy affair. The multiplayer is still active as of late 2015 and is also a lot of fun to play. Plus, it's a well known fact that KZ2 on hard is the most challenging game to beat on the PS3, so if you accomplish that you'll get some pretty good street cred as well. If you haven't played this yet you're really missing out, especially now that you can get a copy pretty cheap. 10/10.. A tougher, more complex follow-up to a very popular Playstation exclusive game line. Animation, graphics have improved. Different controls make a little confusing if going right from the original ""Killzone"" to 2 but not bad. A fun, violent sci-fi combat game exclusive for the PS.. Played in 2015, my first shooter for the PS3. Review for the single player: Visuals: Still great graphics and the realistic tone really adds to the immersion. Great futuristic **** setting and art design. Music: It's very good and dramatic. Fits (and creates) the atmosphere. Story: The weakest aspect of the single player. It's a grand battle with cool enemies but there isn't much interesting about the story. It's weak, but it's not the focus of the game. Gameplay: Here is where K2 shines. Very addictive and fun shooting mechanics, once you're hooked you don't want to stop. NOTE: the controls aren't responsive enough at first, making it barely playable. Tweak the settings and download the update to go from barely playable to awesome controls :) 8.7/10. this game is awesome back in the day for ps3 gamers, and its still good today! if you have a ps3 buy this game or buy the orignal killzone for ps2. its awesome mulitplayer makes it better than ever!. The game is interesting, but more suitable for hardcore fans of shooters. The game is somewhat similar to Quake 2 in style. In my opinion, the game has some serious flaws: not a good storyline, bad settings of aiming, too hardcore walkthrough. Sometimes you just cant pass the level. The final battle with Radek became the talk of the town.. Could have cared less about the story, I did not feel a connection to any of the characters. Some of the missions are very long and tedious. The shooting itself is fun though so I'm guessing that's what matters.. Probably the best FPS game I have played of all time. Pretty decent campaign mode and even better multiplayer. There's plenty of action with 32 player online battles in huge map environments. The maps in Killzone 2 seem much bigger than they are in Killzone 3. The ability to mix abilities with different classes is especially fun. You don't know what the other team is brining to the table because you can change your class and badge during a respawn. As a tactician, you can control the battlefield by putting down spawn grenades in strategic locations. The game is always changing and you have to adapt or to it or suffer the consequences. I think I have more hours played in this game than any other PS3 title. Killzone 3 was ok, and Killzone SF was junk.. I like this one. Ai is some of the best ive seen on a console. My buddy doesn't like the weapons. He say hard to aim. I say go back to ur duty head least they're closer to realism. I say lets see u run around with a gatling gun like ur holding a glock9. Dont ask me about multiplayer dat stuff just isnt 4 me.. A really great FPS! The story is only OK but the graphics are great! It's set at a pretty fast pace, so there isn't always time to really get a chance to see some of the finer details that are there. This one takes place on Helghast and is absolutely better than the original Killzone, which in my opinion simply hasn't age well, but that's understandable given the big difference between the capabilities of the PS2 & PS3 systems. The voice acting is so bad it's great & the Helghast got to keep their over-the-top 80s arcade-game voices which I found so hilarious in Killzone. If you enjoy blowing off steam by playing FPSs then ignore the haters and make some time for this game. Some pretty nice new mechanics and weapons (he Helghan Electric Gun is personal favorite of mine). Killzone 2 and 3 are my favourite shooters for the ps3.Awesome gameplay,op weapons,really good story and very beatifull graphics.Also the multi is pretty nice and will have a lot of hours playing. One of the first if not the first game for PS3. In the beginning of the ""new generation"" this was the first FPS and the hype was very high. Sadly we were and we are disappointed. The graphic is not so good and there are a lot of ""loading"" moment, where the screen freeze for a couple of second. They are in some strategic point, so there is no real problem during combat, but they are still annoying. Also you can see a many freeze (for less than a second). The music and the sound effects are also poor. The plot is very thin and there are too many things left out, nothing is explained about the first episode just some hints... And the end game? Ahhh... It's better not to speak about it!. If you like blowing stuff up (space **** in particular) then this'll be right up your street. I'm not much of an FPS man generally but occassionaly I get the hankering to play one and this was such a time. This featured the most immersive gameplay I've ever experienced in an FPS, the controls are slick, the sound effects great, and although the graphics are starting to show their age a little they're still more than adequate. Where it falls down a little is on the story front for me, I didn't feel the characters were that great (a little too stereotyped for my liking). The ISA (the team you play as) didn't have much going for it to make you really like them and the story was all pretty simplistic. I did like the Darth-Vader inspired bad guy Radec and his clearly **** inspired chronies however, their red faces contrasting to the general greyness of the game looked really bad-ass. That's another topic worth mentioning, the game is very grey, a little more variation in the levels would have been nice. Overall this was a hell of a lot of fun, with amazing gameplay but falls short of being great because of the simplistic unengaging story and generally forgettable 'good guy' characters.. First, I'd like to say that the graphics of this game are just phenomenal. Even though released","killzone 2 is a fantastic shooter, that brings gorgeous visuals, a rich universe, and strong gunplay to the PlayStation 3 . i am shocked Sony hasn't remastered this trilogy, i give a 6 for nostalgic reasons . i expected at least a decent sci-fi campaign but it was much worse than i thought ."
255.Neverwinter Nights,"The OC is pretty meh. I'm giving 10/10 for Valine's A Dance with Rogues module.. This game is pure soul Also the user modules are great and interface is modern to say the least. This hasn't aged well. The 3D graphics are really dated. The gameplay mechanics are really bad. I spent a lot of the in-game time bashing open chests and containers. You basically obtain all the equipment you need for your character in the first chapter. After that, loot is pretty much worthless. The in-game economy is completely unbalanced. I acquired a dragon's hoard of hundreds of thousands of gold coins by the third chapter. Most fights are completely trivial. The story is OK, but it's slow going. I gave up before the end of the 3rd chapter. I know this game is supposed to be huge, but there are so many better games out there.. favorite game of my childhood. how many times have I passed it? 20? 30? with all the dlc and workshop =3 Yes, unfortunately it hasn’t stood the test of time. But in those days it was a masterpiece and the best thing to do after school.. An step behind the BG saga. The game has good mechanics with innovative 3D graphics for a cRPG, an update to D&D 3 and a solid history, but the absence of group management, with only one companion and no direct control, is a scourge that affect all game. The scenery editor and community support is an important plus for the game.. Ultimately a fun dnd romp with a lot of build freedom and interesting stories to engage in. Held back by formulaic dungeon design, forgettable characters and main story, and dreary art style and stone. Blueprint for bioware games to come. I hear the real strength is the custom content but I never engaged with it so can't consider it.. One of the best RPGs ever. A must for every fan of D&D including even the most demanding.... I couldn't play this game now, but back in 2002 it consumed me and for that, it get its rating as a way of thanks.. My whole journey with CRPGs started with this game. Even now I sometimes play it.. It is not a third Baldurs Gate game even when there were later abandoned plans to import your character from there. Instead of a full party of adventures you play as single character with one companion (and of cause a familiar or animal companion if your class has one). The game uses the third edition rules of Dungeons & Dragons with some adaptations. It is set in the Forgotten Realms on the continent Faerun. The story starts in Neverwinter where an unseen before plague called the Walling Death is devastating the city. Your player character is a recruited adventurer to help find a cure. As the story progresses the Walling Death is just the beginning as a very old and forgotten menace could shaken the foundations of the world while other factions will use this for their own agendas and goals. The story is solid with good moments and twist. To be fair even while I enjoyed it some twist are a bit foreseeable. The characters are enjoyable and well written. Be it your recruitable companions (Multiple are available but only one at any given time can be in your party), Lady Aribeth, Aarin Gend or the antagonists. It created an interesting setting, lore and a world where I was invested in. Gameplay is solid. You chose your character, gender, race and class at the start. You do not roll dice but have a pool to use. Extreme Min / Maxing has some disadvantages here. You can multiclass but be aware of penalties. Plan a bit ahead. There are of cause sub quests, side activities and hidden / unique items. I think I give some tips. Later on you can created special weapons / items. Some ingredients are not found in that chapter (or I missed them). Store some of the seemingly worthless items in your inventory as you will need them (Or read a guide). There will be dragons (plural). Your companions have unique quest that advance (chapter based and level up needed to continue if I remember correctly). Chose the responding class as helper as the item you get improves and is really helpful in boosting your stats. Explore the world as there are many good items (Should be a no brainer). Back to the review. The graphic was amazing for its time and many praised it. However I was shocked returning to this game after a few years. It did not age well while also not being truly awful. Soundtrack holds up for me. A main appeal was the Aurora tool-set. You can use it to create your own content. I did not use it but there was a lot of good user created content. For others this made it a 10/10 game and I will not disagree with their opinion. For me it was not important. Overall this was a good D&D game but not as good as Baldurs Gate 2, Icewind Dale 2 and others. I enjoyed it but it just missed to be a masterpiece for me while having fond memories of it.. Shorter and smaller than Baldur's Gate II but with an incredibly focused story, and great characters. Play it, and enjoy this gem.. This review is based on my experience when I first played the game, more than a decade ago, and no experience of D&D at all. Magic system is absurd, but I liked it so much.. Maybe it's nostalgia, but Neverwinter Nights is the most fun I've ever had playing a PC RPG. I actually played this game around 2002-2003 when it released. I was in high school at the time but NWN was the first PC RPG that really blew me away. Before this game I had tried games like Baldur's Gate 2, which put me onto Bioware. I've read reviews recently and the single player campaign gets trashed mercilessly, however my review is based on the single player campaign only (I'm not into multiplayer or being a DM). I thought this game was fantastic in terms of story and characters. Honestly, I don't remember the story 100% but I remember it was very compelling. I still remember aspects of characters such as Aribeth, Fenthick, and Aaron Gend to this day. Aribeth in particular is involved in one of the most memorable plot twists in a PC RPG, IMO. I think one of the biggest factors that makes NWN a legendary game is the atmosphere. I'm refering to things like the the lighting in the cell that you start the game in, the purple-ish hue of the city of Neverwinter when you're exploring, and the foginess of the docks. Adding to this is the fantastic music by Jeremy Soule. The score and sound effects are my favorite in a PC RPG. NWN absolutely nailed its atmosphere. The game was also a joy to play from a controls and technical standpoint. First off, I think NWN has one of the best user interfaces of any PC RPG I've played. It's relatively simple and the hot keys worked great. I loved how you can rotate the camera angle in this game and I don't understand why you can't rotate the camera angle in all games. I loved the implementation of the D+D 3rd edition rules in this game, with access to 'feats' such as weapon finesse that you didn't have in Baldur's Gate 2. It made my dexterity based, short sword dual-wielding ranger so much more fun to play than in BG2. I also didn't mind that this game is basically a single-player game. Party based games are great but I didn't mind only having 1 character and henchman. In fact, it actually makes the game more enjoyable to some degree without having to micromanage 6 characters. Too bad I don't fully remember all of the aspects that made this game my favorite PC RPG, but I definitely wanted to contribute a review that points out a few things from the game that might be helpful to newcomers in 2019 who are thinking about trying it. Cheers.. I tried at least 3 times to give this game a chance. Somehow didn't **** me in to its world, which is a shame. Especially that this game has a very good scores in all reviews.. One of the great games created by Bioware (Pre-2013) when the Doctors were in charge of the Studio. This is an example of the fantastic work they did in bringing Dungeon & Dragons Forgotten realms to the PC.. Just a MASTERPIECE. Best online RPG game ever made, so powerful toolset and so big community it has (still has a few hundred players 17 years later). But his sequel, NWN2 was a big disappointment.. Worst game Bioware before they buy EA. Gameplay and plot are boring and secondary. This game was released only for the sake of the editor, in which the players themselves had to create stories. Those who are not interested in the editor were forced to play in the boring and secondary single.. Good times when BioWare wasn't making **** for EA. Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 8/10 Audio: 10/10 Visual: as for 2002 I would say 9/10. I don't even remember the single player, but I played countless hours on multiplayer servers, either stories or persistent custom worlds. So good!. I played this game more than 10 years after it's release. I played the original campaign and both official expansions (Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark). I hear that the multiplayer component of this game is great and that there are many great mods out there, but I didn't try multiplayer, nor did I install any mods. This review is only of the single-player experience (without mods). So alas, here is my opinion of the main campaign and both official expansion! The Good: The character creation system is amazing with lots of depth! The game uses D&D 3.5 rules, and there are sooo many options when creating a character - race, class, attributes, skills, feats, etc. But that is where the fun ends... The Bad: Unlike most D&D video games, you do not have a full party. Instead, you control only one character and can bring only one companion with you (but in the 2nd expansion, Hordes of the Underdark, you can bring two companions with you). And you cannot even control your companions - companions fight on their own. Also, in the original campaign you couldn't even equip your companions with weapons and armor (their weapons and armor automatically upgraded as they leveled-up), but in both the expansions you can actually equip your companions. Because of the lack of the party dynamic, I found the combat to be DREADFULLY boring. If the game had a good story, maybe you could tolerate the dull combat to advance the story, but alas, the story is also pretty boring (except for the story of the final expansion, Hordes of the Underdark, which was somewhat entertaining and held my interest for the most part). With the dull gameplay and boring story, it was a real chore to push myself to complete this game and both expansions (though I did manage to do so through sheer willpower/OCD - I wanted to be able to say I had completed Neverwinter Nights and both its expansions). Besides the great character creation system mentioned above, there is one other redeeming quality about the game - a companion character named Deekin Scalesinger, a kobold bard, who is available in both expansions. He is absolutely hilarious!!! But besides the character creation system and Deekin Scalesinger, I can say very few good things about this game... So to sum up, character creation has great depth and is a lot of fun. But after character creation, it's all downhill from there - you don't control a party like most D&D games, boring combat, boring story, and boring characters (except for your loyal kobold bard companion, Deekin Scalesinger, who is totally awesome!!!). I give this game a 5. I do recognize that this game has a cult following of diehard fans, but I believe that is due to 2 things: 1.) it is very easy to create mods for this game, so the modding community loves this game, and 2.) many people love the multiplayer component of the game. But since I didn't install any mods, nor did I try multiplayer, I can only judge the single player experience, which was very, very boring (in my humble opinion).. The best D&D game I played until Divinity Original Sin 2. NWN was such a good game I had a hard time playing RPGs after 2007 because I was ""spoiled"" by it's story, charm, gameplay and character development, dropping many newer fantasy RPGs just after a few hours. It took like a full decade to surpass this masterpiece and to this day I recommend it to anyone that likes RPGs and hasn't tried it yet.. The magic of the Neverwinter Nights role-playing game is its Aurora toolset that strikes the perfect balance between flexibility, power and Ease-of-Use. World-builders, writers, coders and artists alike have long since hit the jackpot with Aurora. It's why we players have access to some of the finest role-playing campaigns out there. Masterpieces like those found in the Hall of Fame, for example, many of which can contend with commercial RPG offerings in terms of depth, breadth and polish.. Graphics are dated but the game holds up. It can be buggy at times but rarely gamebreakingly so be sure to quick save often and this is never an issue. i have been wanting to get back into D&D for awhile, this was a good temporary fix until i can get some friends together.. The Infinity Engine gets a serious downgrade. The solo campaign is, all things considered, a waste of time, with too little fun to care. And I don't care for coop things: when I want a group, I play table RPGs with friends in the flesh. I don't blame too much the setting and the rules system. D&D is what it is, its rules get worse with each newer edition, for reasons I won't discuss here, yet the video game version has to run with that. Using kitchen sink Faerun, the worst campaign setting ever designed for D&D, wasn't mandatory, but I understand it is commercially successful, since it feels more like contemporary USA than exotic ancient times. Don't worry if you don't get my meaning, it's not an important point. Now, also with the times, the game goes 3D, losing the past appeal of the IE games, and looking seriously dull as a result. I can now play in 3rd person perspective. But I'd rather not, thank you very much. Time to mention some serious flaws. The biggest possibly concerns the companions. They are gone. Now you have mercenaries, all waiting for you in orderly fashion at the same inn. No interesting introductions, no unlocking, no nothing. You can pay and pick one to come with you. Yes, one. And you don't control it and don't access his inventory. With half the fun gone with each of these restrictions, there's about 6% of fun left. I decided to play solo and never looked back. As usual, I built a rogue. I could pickpocket, but it never, absolutely ever, brought me anything of worth. And 99% of the time, nothing at all. I'm serious. And for some **** reason, there's a bloody cooldown constraint between 2 attempts. That one seriously grated my nerves. Even for a rogue, the quantity of locks and traps found on anything, even a barrel, constitutes an abuse. The fact that what a trap is supposed to protect is often worth less than the trap itself speaks volumes of the design effort. Also, thanks to insane randomisation, you can find riches in a street barrel and junk in a treasure chamber. Setting traps happened to be another waste of time; better sell them, if you can find the only merchant who will buy them (just another nonsensical constraint.) Sneaking works good though, I have to say; I've never had the need for magical invisibility. Sneaking is surely the most powerful tactical tool in the game. Merchants also got downgraded. Their inventory, just like yours, is a mess. You have to peruse each object one by one just to see if one of them is anything special. You also buy and sell items 1 by 1. Want to buy a potion or magical item ? Description tells you what spell it emulates, not what it actually does, and that's it. Better yet, 2/3rds in the game, I realised that even merchant prices are random ! And with a huge interval of randomness. Yet another time waster of a save/load routine. Let's speed up some more inanities: You can't find or even buy low levels spells after a while. At this point, leveling to Wizard 2 would cost you millions of XP anyway, because multiclassing is seriously flawed. Your equipment is much more important and powerful than your skills. Many skills do nothing but bring or save you money, therefore they are completely useless (as usual, you carry millions of weightless gold pieces in your front pocket.) cosmetic dialogues galore, no quick load shortcut, broken path finding, dreadful voice acting, useless consumables… Sorry, can't be exhaustive in less than 500 pages. What good is left then ?, you ask. The variety of builds, i.e., a rich character creation system. UI-wise, a good toolbar. And combat is dynamic, still varied, if never really challenging once you bought the protection belts. I can't tell you what non-undead bosses can do because they don't have a chance to do anything against an assassin. I almost forgot: if they decide to talk when nearly dead, just go out and have a 7 courses dinner to give the assassin's paralysis enough time to wear off.. Ah.. Neverwinter Nights.. I love this game i have since I first played it in 2005. It was the first game I tried Multiplayer with at that time and it was amazing I had a blast then. I never tried the new Communuty made multiplayer but oh well. I'm sure its fine. I loved the Single Player in this game, the main story was great, while the secondary quests still had importance, it helps a lot in this game to do as many secondary objectives as possible, it doesnt hurt too bad as not doing them in a game like Dragon Age because it has a huge skill cap compared to this. But it still helps out in the long run. Yes I do understand this game starts out slow, but it gets more enjoyable to play the more you are leveled. My favourite build style is Dex heavy Rouge/(low)Fighter/Weapon Master, i know it sounds like an odd combination but when you get to the 20+ levels and you built it right, you are nearly unstoppable unless you fdace something thats immune to Criticals or Sneak attacks. I like using Rapier for the special with thr halfling race. I start out with fighter till about level 3-4 which ever gives a feat, then I pump like 5-7 levels into Rogue untill i get the Weapon Master class unlocked (You need to focus a lot of talents into this early) and I prefer to start into that till 7 then just level rogue. Once you unlock Weapon Master the feat choices dont matter too much. This build starts out horribly slow but it gets good when you get closer to level 10 which is a long time i know. Also to the people who say the graphics are ""Laughable"" @ Zoso this is a 2002 game. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? GTA 5 or Witcher 3 graphics in those days? Now thats laughable. One of my favourite parts of this is the toolset, its a lot of fun making your own stories and inventing new weapons/armours. Sneaky tip, load a plain toolset and create a mildy to amazingly powerful piece of armour or weapon and place it on the ground, and maybe a bunch of gold, and then enter that with a new character you hope to level in the campaign and use the item(s) and then save the character then go into the campaign. It makes it a lot easier if your messing around with new things. I don't consider it a cheat as you can't do that with online games, unless the host allows that I believe. And your using it for your own benifit in the single olayer campaign.. The main campaign really ****. Each chapter, the main quests are always: find 4 items located at the four corners of the map. The quests are nonsensical. You cannot change the plot, there is no choices and consequences, you can only do what you are told to.. Outstanding game. For me this is the game that made my fall in love with rpgs. I have played the single player a dozen times and playing it in 2015 it still feels good. The wealth of classes is the strong point giving the game a lot of replayability. Masterpiece.. This toolset wrapped around a game is possibly one of the best, most enduring games ever made. While the subsequent expansions improved on the game immeasurably, it remains a classic. One that I still play to this day. The wealth of quality user created content for it is breathtaking. It is a RPG that we need more of. Jimbo Rating: 10/10. After the Masterpiece Baldur's Gate most players were shocked by the empty single player campaign but then it showed his true purpose: being a unique game! This is the only RPG in history that can be played online in Persistent Worlds; each world can be made with the powerful Aurora Toolset by simple users and hosting in their own PC; players creates accounts in the servers where they will store their Characters so they can return at any time to continue their progress, all of this with the possibility that real Dungeon Masters guide your adventures behind scenes. In other words: the closest that a computer could be to a pen & paper RPG.. One of the best games ever made. Incredible options for character customization - beyond anything most players have likely seen before in a game. Genuinely interesting NPCs and quests. Online multiplayer. In short, it has everything. The graphics are quite dated, sure, but in terms of gameplay, it is arguably the best RPG ever made.. This is one of the best applications of the D&D 3.5e ruleset in video games. I have been playing this game since 2004, and I'm still not done with it. It is such a great game that I ended up getting a Win7 and up optimized version from GOG (since I had the original release copy and couldn't get it to work on Win7), it doesn't have the diversity of feats and spells that it's successor does, and the fact that it's only semi-turn-based (it's turn-based, but the turn get run so quickly that counterspelling, something that I do a lot in table top D&D, almost impossible. But as I said it is one of the best applications of the 3.5e rules out there, so for those of you who are avid players of 3.5e D&D, you would love this game, hell anyone who likes a good RPG would love this game. Now the campaign itself gets boring after a while (sure I have played it over 20 times), but with the addition of premium modules you can and your own modules you can make, it keeps single player fun. The multiplayer features, in my opinion are unparalleled across the Strategic RPG Genre. The diversity of the various servers (almost all of which are player made), and the amount of dedication by the owners to keep playing on the server fun is amazing. In conclusion, one of the best games I have ever played, an amazing adaptation of the 3.5e rules, and it keeps pulling you back to it.. This was an unpleasant shock for most fans when they had to go from the ultimate masterpiece that was Baldur's Gate with it's beautiful hand-drawn isometric visuals to this ugly 3D mess, the beginning is also very slow, the story doesn't seem all that special, instead of full party you got only 1 character plus some stupid henchmen you can hire, but can't even customize and on top of that you're constantly going through hundreds of chests that doesn't even seem to contain anything interesting. Fortunately as you go forth, it's getting better and better. You're getting used to the engine and starting to realize that this is a huge game, where each chapter would be enough to fill the entire content of some other games. Second chapter being much much higher quality, leaving the city and finally experiencing adventures in nature you were used to from Baldur's. Some of the quests are starting to get really good and in the end the result is actually very positive. Also, definitely worth mentioning is the music by always amazing Jeremy Soule that created a huge part of of the atmosphere in this game. Seen in retrospect, Neverwinter Nights is a great RPG, that took me about 100 hours to finish, not as good as Baldur's Gate series, but what is. 8/10. any new players to the game, quit now before you put your time in. I put 6 months into the game and lost everything. game full of glitches and hackers, you can lose astral and equipment for no reason, you can try to contact customer support or ""GM HELP"" but they will most likely not respond and you will not get anything back.. I just loved every minut of Neverwinter ****'s great game and a true succesor to baldur's gate.I loved all exp **** like this genre should give it a try.. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 6 out of 10, Fun: 7 out of 10, Controls: 7 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 7 out of 10, Length: 9 out of 10, Re-play: 2 out of 10, Value: 7 out of 10. This game was a massive disappointment from start to finish. This proves that the game isn't the best RPG ever made by far. What a massive shame that it couldn't be better.. One of Bioware's finest hours. This game made me feel so bad for my actions and characters, I couldn't stop thinking about it on school and on my way home: How I could I have saved her... but she deserved it... there was no other way... please...I am sorry... I will set things right... I'll do anything! Here in the Philippines, saving enough money to buy an original game back in 2003 was hard as hell. I am proud I went through all that getting hungry part at school to buy this. Bioware, give me back the good old days!. Neverwinter Nights was a mixed bag. The game had a very solid rule system and character development based on Dungeons and Dragons. This was great. It also comes with the toolkit that allows players to make their own adventures. This was amazing but is history now as the servers were permanently closed this year. Sad but inevitable in a quickly evolving industry. However the engine itself is not that great. Visually it is bland and I doubt anyone can seriously claim that it is better than what was already established with the Infinity Engine and Baldur's Gate. However sad to say the actual adventure of Neverwinter Nights is pretty bloody dull! It takes forever to level your character, to explore the city and make sense of the plot lines. The final result is kind of a long winded mediocrity. As an old **** for Dungeons and Dragons I actually enjoyed it a lot in the day, but doubt that this could be considered appealing now to any but the most hard core RPGers. The GOG platinum version (when on sale) is the best buy!. I deliberately looked this game up after years of playing. Literally, I have been playing this game ever since it was released in 2002. I spent two hours configuring my 64-bit Windows 7 so that it could run this game. Neverwinter Nights is one of the very few games I've played in the past 15 years of gaming that genuinely deserves a 10/10. This game does everything right, but most importantly, the story, the story, the story. The massive amount of pure freedom when it comes to character creation is something that doesn't come very often. I know that this game is massively outdated, but I would still highly recommend finding a copy somewhere, somehow, and letting the magic take you for a ride. Don't spend 60$ for the new crap coming out of Bioware these days, spend nothing and buy Neverwinter Nights.. NWN is one of my all time favourite games... the single player was fantastic the multiplayer on the 3-4 persistant worlds i played on was fantastic although heavy after market scripting was needed to make them work so great, NWN2 was heavily buggy and very disapointing.......... NWN1 is the paramount PC dungeons and dragons game. What a disappointement, especially considering the high expectations at that time... only Dragon Age II has managed to disappoint me so thoroughly. The graphics are laughable at best (wireframes? seroiusly?), and to call the story paper-thin would be a wild exaggeration.. What makes Neverwinter Nights interesing? There are many toolkits to create your own RPG games, but Neverwinter Nights also supported live DM, it also supported online play, ability to use multiple servers, and run persistent worlds. Some Neverwinter Nights persistent worlds were like small MMO games, and it was among the first possibility to create ""fan made MMOs"". With multiple expansion packs, including a community made free expansion pack (CEP). It is a long term classic. Some would say: ""But we didn't like some of the official story"". But that story was mostly there to show us what is possible, and they certainly had more entertainment value than any other examples you would offer to would be developers. So in this genre where you create your adventures the story was considered good, but not as good as a stand alone store focused RPG.. With the large world map and long story line it's a game that fits perfectly in my game collection. And in my opinion the best game of Bioware. The only problem for me was that at the beginning of this game it's really hard to find a way to level. Most of the quests are to difficult to do. But with the great online game play and great story line it's a perfect game.. Get this: when you play Neverwinter Nights, everything you do in combat is simulated by way of virtual dice rolls according to Dungeons & Dragons rules, and the game shows you every one of those numbers. RPG gaming doesn't get any better than that. This is one of the apex games of the genre, and some of the most fun I've had in front of a PC since the 1980s. Highly, highly recommended.. The best RPG game out there, after ten after release i have finally stopped playing it, the multiplayer part of the title is the classic of classics, anyone who hasnt set foot on a roleplaying persistent world on NeverWinter Nights, cant call himself a RPG gamer.. This is the 2nd game i will never ever get bored of playing.. A true masterpiece in RPG , stunning plot,quests,hours of gameplay,perfect D&D elements... The best RPG game ever, after 10 years of NWN there are servers up with nice games like Higher Grounds, its really amazing action adventures that you can play with your friends and level up custom classes, races up to lvl 60.. Very good game despite being single PC with 0 full-control NPCs (1-2 partial control NPCs). Awesome customizability and moddiblity. Excellent story in the single player campaign. Character customization is unparalleled and with the aid of some modpacks even some x-rated mods that caused a tightening down in NWN2 (but at least they dindn't go as far as Civ5 and StarCraft 2 where the game company tyrannically controls your game and your mods to control both piracy and lawsuits).. The most authentic online D&D game to date. The experiences in role-play on multiplayer servers are perhaps the most unique and genuinely interesting stories online because you are helping create them. The builder is excellent, the only thing better for people without code savvy is NWN2! Neverwinter has aged well, despite issues needing major patches in the beginning, it now allows for low-spec online gaming great for laptops. I honestly never got further then 20 hours or so in the story line simply because PLAYER MADE SERVERS RULE. Multiple DMs catering to your ever Rped whim (for good or ill) makes for the best plots. For example, I once played a dark skinned half-elf & was involved in multiple Dwarven hate-crimes, hunted down for sport as Drow. After a week of struggle, there was a political uproar.. I would log on and have bodyguards come come to my aid, spies search for the perpetrators so as to bear witness in the player made court system, and we hunted them as criminals. NO other online game can even attempt to offer this quality of story & it was all player made impromptu RP. If you want real D&D experiences with realistic RP, short of a few MUDs, you will be hard pressed to find it in any other graphical RPGs. As a DM it is endlessly fun to design new campaigns; it's so accurate that one can beta test P&P games in NWN as a simulator. Neverwinter Nights is truly one of the greatest games ever made because they let their players create campaigns with wonderful world building and DM tools. Even with almost 100 people, DMing is smooth, made easier then p&p because the dice rolls and tabulation are automated, plus access to all conversation logs etc. so that the DM can foreshadow and plan for any event. Neverwinter Nights is revolutionary, so far ahead of it's time th","the lack of group management, with only one companion and no direct control, is a scourge . the story is OK, but it's slow going. I gave up before the end of the 3rd chapter . a must for every fan of dnd including even the most demanding ."
256.No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way,"When I was young this game was amazing. Going back to play in 2024 the game has aged so poorly I'm genuinely shocked. The humor and voice acting are fine. Don't care about old graphics either. The combat is pretty bad by today's standards. How times have changed.. Great game. It was so much fun. Even after all these years I can still remember how much I enjoyed playing it.. One of the best games I have ever played, very well done in many aspects tho. Big Daddy in 2002, more trash, more fun, better at all except for ****. Gameplay: combat mechanics [bad scripts, AFPS in campaign] 8/10 stealth [bad scripts] 8/10 atmosphere: sjw-absurd Gameplay as RPG & ****: 6/10 Story 6/10 Graphics 10/10 Sounds & music 8/10 . The sequel is so good you don't need the original, but there are a lot more locations in the original. most funny game I ever played very funny game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. What can I write here a very original game, a lot of sneaking mechanics similar to thief 1, 2 plus golden eye. In the first game the missions were very different and funny. In addition I liked the 60s design. Now in the 2nd game such things are gone: the missions are all the same and there is no humour. The game is more focused on action and in my view it lacks variety. The story is not so interesting any more, in the 1st game the dialogues were more realistic. The graphics is great, even today. If you have problems with the mouse acceleration, install mouse drivers and lower dpi. It is a bug with the engine, that is great beside of that.. This is one of my favorite old school single player shooters of all time. Great graphics for it's time that hold up surprisingly well even today. Funny characters. Upgradable/customizable main character. I never laughed so much in a PC game. Loved the stealth mechanic and the crossbow! I keep looking back to see if someone will update the graphics and re-release this one. Hope so! If you haven't played it look for a bargain bin deal somewhere and pick it up. Every shooter fan should play this!. One of my favourite FPS games on PC. Its better than most of the James Bond games. The story is a perfect blend of Bond and the Austin Powers series. I love the fact, that the creators decided to go for tongue in cheek approach. The gameplay itself is very enjoyable, allowing the player to be creative. The game is an engaging, adrenaline filled experience with some puzzles along the way.. It baffles me to this day why this game is lauded so immensely , I'm on my second play-through and all I can say is it's a bitter disappointment, especially after the flawlessness of the first one. That one was a charming caper that had all the elements of a 60's spy movie: it had international intrigue, unforgettable characters, and witty humor. Elements that could have rivaled any Bond movie of it's day, albeit with a slightly feminine touch. The second iteration just doesn't have the same feel, Cate is virtually unrecognizable and the script is lacking. There is hardly any attempt at the dry-wit comedy of the first one (Remember the criminal convos - especially the self psycho-analysis by one of the henchmen as to why he's a criminal , lol) and it quite literally never picks **** falls flat on it's face without even 'hitting it's target'. Cate has lost all her charm and 'street smarts', and can hardly put a sentence together. It's like the developers decided to dumb down the character for reasons I can only guess at (maybe to appeal to a younger audience?) and instead of the spy diva that enchanted our CRT monitors , and was just so memorable and engaging, we are instead left with a bimbo with a no nonsense attitude and a desire to get the job done ....a one-trick pony. The same goes for Bruno, Mr.Jones and Armstrong....either the scriptwriters got lazy, or they decided to focus on different aspects of the game.... The game itself looks great , even to this day, especially with the widescreen patch. Textures are hi res and I'm really surprised at how well it's held up. The level design is somewhat lackluster though, with levels feeling confined and not as open-world as the first iteration. Santa's workshop has been plucked out completely, so you don't get to test the nifty gadgets before embarking on a mission. You also don't get to customize your weapon arsenal before loading a mission , but design choices have always been perplexing to me. Lastly, I'll quote another review that kind of hit the nail on the head: No one lives forever ""expanded the narrative capacity of the medium, the sequel is just a game"". The first script would have given Ian Fleming a run for his money... unfortunately NOLF 2 was a step in the wrong direction, it failed to live up to the high lofty standards set by the first and will forever go down in my personal recollection as one of the worst sequels in the history of PC gaming.. TomAto: I`ll tell you what rotting our youth minds: the fuc*ing oversexualized society, multiculturalism, systematic destruction of our freedom and democracy, high society **** and fanatics who telling us how we are wrong. I tell something. There is no power as powerful as power of the light side of the force! this game is one product of that power!! the creation. our dreams our souls. our culture is our soul. who stand against that? This game lose nothing of quality and specific charm after years. It`s very depended on age trends but is still original. And these two things make game so great, special and still like blockbuster experience.. Maybe the most underrated game of all time. Absolutely sublime from start to finish. Funny while remaining serious. Think I'll reinstall. One of the greatest examples of all time of substance over style. And its got more style and surprises than a supermodel's birthday cake. Whatever that meant, if you are even moderately interested in action/stealth and love games that push beyond the routine, buy this now.. One of the funniest game ever played... But there is too many bugs in gameplay and graphics is too poor let's hope there will be NOLF 3 in future with good graphics and gameplay. Why don't they make first person shooters with this much personality anymore? It's ten years after it's release and I enjoy this more than any shooter from the last few years. I tend to ignore most FPS games now, expecting them to be shallow, repetitive and lacking any real character, but not NOLF2. It's got more personality and more of an enjoyment factor than all of the CoD (or whatever other FPS games are popular nowadays) wrapped into one.. A truly masterpiece! Better than the first game. Play it!. I still recall this as one of the best FPS I've ever played. I would love to see this IP revisited with a new game. Great storyline, stealth modes and spy gadgets. It was as close as you can get to being in a 60's spy movie.",when i was young this game was amazing. going back to play in 2024 the game has aged so poorly I'm shocked . the humor and voice acting are fine. Don't care about old graphics either. the combat is pretty bad by today's standards.
257.Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow,"Probably the best of the three GBA Castlevania games, Aria of Sorrow makes itself stand out from other titles by being set in the future. Though the story is pretty basic, it does just enough to stand out amongst other Castlevania games. I think I liked the map in this game a bit more than the previous GBA entries. Also, this game removes the usual sub weapons and replaces them with ""Tactical Souls"". Upon defeating an enemy, there is a chance it will drop its soul. This soul can later be ""equipped"" to perform an attack or action associated with the enemy. This can allow for quite a variety of gameplay styles. There isn't much this game gets wrong. I didn't attempt to collect all the souls but I can imagine it being tedious with the enemy farming. Also the English writing is pretty awful... but this didn't impact my enjoyment other than slight amusement as to what the characters were saying. All in all an excellent entry!. This game is incredible! From the design, aesthetic, game play, story, and music you won't be disappointed. It's a great time for people looking to get into Castlevania or looking to try out the metroidvania genre. The games difficulty admittedly was on the easier side of things for this genre, but it can still provide a challenge as you progress. The game has many amazing tracks, and I can't stop listening to the OST because of it. Combat is smooth and fun and works very well with the mechanics introduced in this title. Even though I am giving a lot of praise the game still has some issues I noticed but none so big it took away from the experience as a whole. Some of the things I noted was that the requirement to unlock the true ending involves killing 2 enemies with low drop chances for to get the required stuff. Also, while I love a lot of characters, I felt some weren't given enough time to shine and there was one I forgot about until near the end of the game. There were 1 or 2 smaller issues like with some of Soma's animations with weapons outside of the whip sword looking kinda weird to me but, those more personal things and not really issues with the game itself. That being said this game is very very good and has become one of my favorites in the Metroidvania genre.. Truely one of the all-time greatest when it comes to the Metroidvania genre, the soul system with over 100 different souls still impresses me even after 2 decades of playing this game. One ""con"" for this game that stops it from being a ""10/10"" for me is that some of the souls have a ridiculously low drop rate sometimes requiring you to kill/farm an enemy hundreds of times if you don't get lucky right away. However if you are looking for an action-packed high adrenaline gaming adventure then look no further than this game. I highly recommend you pick up the Castlevania Advanced Collection available on all modern consoles and PC it comes with this game and the two other wonderful Game Boy Advance Castlevania games you won't be disappointed.. It does a lot of what Symphony of the Night does, but worse. The story, characters, music, atmosphere, combat, and enemy variety are inferior to Symphony of the Night on many levels. However, it did do some things differently and some things better. The boss and balancing are better, and the way you get skills by farming for souls is unique. I appreciate the difference, but I didn't like it that much. They implemented something similar to Zelda games, switching gears (souls) to get to an area, which made it kind of tedious since it wasn't implemented well in the game. The way you use your souls to traverse is so minimalistic that it makes me question the point of it; it didn't add anything that makes your experience better. I know it's unfair to compare it to Symphony of the Night, especially since this is a GBA game and Symphony of the Night is a PS1 game. Hence, I gave it an 8. It's still pretty fun and solid.. Not as good as previous installments in terms of story or gameplay. The new gameplay mechanic of using enemies techniques is interesting, music and visuals still appealing.. This ARPG provides great combat and exploration experience merged wonderfully.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good platform game with a lots of options: weapons and powers. A bit buggy. I had so much fun with this game and the souls system is really fun to use and the replayability is really fun too. You can experiment with souls and weapons, the only negative with this game is some of the bosses **** like the bat boss and the last boss in underwhelming. But overall really really good. Another of the classic ""Metroidvania"" titles and one of the few essential purchases on the GBA.. Yeah, yeah, it's and old game, and with the limitations of the GBA... BUT, it's an excellent game. The character progression feels good, it's addictive, the characters are interesting, and in many ways is as good as Symphony of The Night. Give it a try, really.. Posiblemente sea el Castlevania más fresco de Advance. No copia tanto a Symphony of the Night como Harmony of Dissonance ni es tan retorcido como Circle of the Moon. Buena curva de dificultad.. Soma cruz is the son of alucard and he is the reincarnation of alucard each belmont is a reincarnation of the previous one and tepes the castlevania games need to be more rpg like. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a fantastic Castlevania game and one of the best classic Metroidvanias which truly stands the test of time. The gameplay is great, challenging at first but not too difficult once you get the handle of it. The RPG elements are well implemented and the souls system makes for some great customization and replay value. The story isn't anything revolutionary for the genre, but it gets the job done and sets the stage for your adventure. Even in 2022 I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Metroidvania genre.. In my opinion this is probably the best Castlevania game not just on Game Boy but on any system.. I'm so happy to play this game efter play the other castlevania games on a Gameboy finally a game with good level design again. And want a doesn't look like s*** like castlevania harmony of dissonance. The soul system is awesome gathering monster souls get new abilities and I will say this is my second favorite castlevania game I have played it is the third if you take blood stain as a castlevania game. I can say that I like it more than SOTN. Level design, items, gaining abilities when killing enemies,balance of difficulty, boss fights, dialogues between characters, the value of the money we collect. In many ways I liked it better than SOTN. The playing time was pretty good too. Not as long as SOTN. I was bored at the reverse castle in SOTN. But I was not bored in Aria. The soundtracks and voiceovers were very good at SOTN. And SOTN was the forerunner of metroidvania. Aria has been a beautiful metroidvania thanks to SOTN.. So I rate Aria and SOTN equally. By the way, you have a way to hell Medusa head!!. The Best Of Castlevania,is Aria Of Sorrow, This Game Is Awasome,it has a brilliant Gameplay and a great map. I simply can repeat The best of castlevania!. It doesn't get any better than this on a portable console. A masterfully made game. Graphics - 10 Presentation - 9.5 Gameplay - 10 Sound - 9.5 Lasting Appeal - 10. Fantastic game with start to finish. I loved how it contains so much equipment and unique Soul Set that I found interesting. Controls are more improved than previous title. Soma is strongest character that can even go against Belmonts. There is many area to explore. My rate for this game: 9.0 ............................................... With All its items, features and souls, a great story, rpg elements, its fantastic Soma Cruz as the main character and of course its delicious and fantastic music, this could be easily not only my favorite Castlevania in the series (even over the masterpiece SOTN) but also my favorite GBA game of all times even better than true jewels such as Metroid Fusion or Megaman Zero.. My favorite video game of all time. The movement is incredibly responsive, music is amazing, the system is intuitive. Overall the flow of the game is so good that I've played this game at least 20 times in total yet still goes back to revisit it from time to time.. My favorite Castlevania and GBA game ever made. The soul system gives good replay value and the castle layout is very good. Very well made game.. While Circle of the Moon was too dark to see, and Harmony of Dissonance was a bit too vibrant, Aria of Sorrow is perfect. Konami hit it out of the park with this 3rd GBA entry. I couldn't put this game down until I had 100% completed it. The story/characters might be a bit shallow, but the gameplay is flawless.. Gameplay: - Normal Story: - Very Bad Visual: - Normal Music and sound: - Good Average time: -6 H Score: - 6. I love Aria of Sorrow. The game is so much fun to go through that it's almost impossible to get everything in just one single run of the game. Great music, great gameplay, great boss fights. The game is practically flawless.. Far, far superior to Symphony of the Night. This game nails down every aspect of good design, from the great design of the castle to the unparalleled soul collection system that keeps the game perpetually fresh and damn fun.. Another underrated gem I see here. MetroidVania is probably the style that I like the most out of all three (RetroVania, MetroidVania and Lords of Shadow of the Colossus of God of WarVania if you know what I'm sayin') and this game is perfect proof. I was young and all I knew about CastleVania was this one game and I loved it, everything made sense, backtracking wasn't a chore because you needed exp. and money and the story was so far from beaing a ""pure, traditional and classic CastleVania"" but the style was there. I renember some stages entirely and I would be able to beat this game in less than 10 hours because I looked for all the secret and spent so much time on it. The game also made an impacto on me. By seraching I found out ""CastleVania Symphony of the Night"" and I was like: MetroidVania on PS2 with Richter Belmont and Alucard? GOTTA GO PLAY DAT ****. The storyline, the sprites, the music; everything is amazing about this game. Just like SotN, it's basically a Metroidvania. There is so many things to discover, so many things to loot. The music in this game is great. The art style of characters are unique. The overall world is looking brilliant. Even if you beat the game for a few times, you still want to play it more. The levels are designed well, and when you beat the game, you get rewarded by having more playability. If you've never played this game and you liked any of Castlevania games, you should play this.. Really good game for GBA. Really good tight controls. Really stupid story. Really nice and fleshed out animated style. Really overkilling on the amounts of weapons and spells. Always fun to carry this one around.. Best Castlevania I've personally played since SOTN. The soul system is really fun and creative. Graphics and music were ok...couple of catchy tracks, nothing like SOTN but this was made for gameboy so meh Story was hella cheesy though, although major twist at the end if you ""equip the right souls.. Aria of Sorrow offers players gameplay that will never go stale. It's honestly just a fun game. The only downside is story but when has Castlevania ever been about story? The bosses are fun and the soul collection was a nice addition to the series. It's very friendly for newcomers to the series as its a pretty easy game. New Game+ offer more hours of fun and keeps replayability pretty high.. After having played more than a dozen of Castlevania titles, I think Aria of Sorrow is still my favourite. The game takes place in the year 2035, many years after Dracula's defeat, but now Dracula's power is about to be reborn in a new dark lord candidate. You play as Soma Cruz, a student who found himself in the castle and realises that he has the ability to steal the souls of the monsters after defeating them. With this soul system the player gets access to an enormous variety of secondary attacks as well as permanent buffs. Just like with Symphony of the Night, the player is not limited to only one weapon, but can use a lot of different weapons he/she finds throughout the game, ranging from swords, to hammers, to spears, and even to guns. Also just like SOTN, and the other GBA Castlevania games, this is a Metroid style Castlevania, meaning the whole game is like a one huge map, where certain parts can only be reached later in the game after acquiring a certain ability or an item. Aria of Sorrow, despite having rather simple GBA graphics is a very beautiful and stunning looking game. The level design is fantastic, and the soundtrack is just as beautiful, complementing perfectly with visual beauty of the game. The controls are easy, making it convenient to control your character, and the game has just about a perfect level of difficulty, without it seeming too easy or too frustrating. There is literally nothing bad I can say about Aria of Sorrrow. The only thing I think SOTN has over it are the graphics.. Castlevania was a great franchise and it still a great one!The GBA got so far the best Castlevania games EVER!Aria of Sorrow is a action-side scrolling game where you control Soma Cruz(the **** graphics are not very colorful, but they are very realistic for the GBA!The tunes aren't bad either!The gameplay is great, you discover a lot of good things, you unlock endings, is just one of the best Castlevania games EVER!If you don't like this game, that means you don't like video games!Well, this game is not perfect, but very enjoyable!MUST BUY!","the story is pretty basic, but it does just enough to stand out amongst other Castlevania games . the game removes the usual sub weapons and replaces them with ""tactical souls"" combat is smooth and fun and works very well with the mechanics introduced in this title ."
258.Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,"One of the best games of that era. The lore, the atmosphere, the characters, the story. I tried, i love the lore and story of this game, the characters, how the bosses looks, the music is amazing, love what they try to do with the gameplay and combat BUT this game is borderline unplayable. The framerate, controls and camera are atrocious. The camera & controls prevent me from have any fun with this game. **** exist that NEEDS a remake is this.. Game unlike nothing on PS1. I've played it as an adult and had an amazing experience. Collapsing gothic architecture mixed with Giger style creatures is a great combo. Would've love to see a modern remake of this classic.. Good god this game changed my thinking of what an original game should be, seeing the world change omg I was looking for everything such an awesome piece of history and **** nobody's bothered to revisit this game and bring it upto date for 2023 also I noticed there is no Sega Dreamcast version I would have rated that aswell but it's not registered on here because there is a Dreamcast version aswell I played it on emulators and looks heaps better than ps1 version. The opening scene with the betrayal + the ending scene with the philosophy on fate = 10/10. Timeless The game holds up really well even today, the presentation is flawless with an amazing art direction and a sublime voice acting that delivers some of the most memorable character writing in history, the gameplay loop is satisfying, the combat system is simple but thoughtful, the puzzles are enganging and creative and the OST is nothing short of spectacular. The only minor issues are the unskippable cutscenes and overall poor replay value but it's still a must-play for anyone. You won't be disappointed.. Imo Soul reaver is the best Ps1 and even the best Dreamcast game ever you really need to look at it from the perspective of the time it was released ,3D gaming was at its infancy ,it has a phenomenal writing with top tier dialogues ,worldbuilding ,raziel and kain being some of the best written characters in gaming history and phenomenal story that is complimented with some of the best voice acting the industry has to offer ,the game has a very well designed world that you need to explore and Similar to metroidvania you need to memorize some of the areas and do some backtracking to unlock certain areas that you can go to after you unlock a new ability , some great and well designed puzzles ,the combat may not put DMC out of business but again like I said earlier 3D was at its infancy but the combat is still great ,you can interact with the areas by either grabbing a weapon or throwing enemies at fire or spikey walls and water ,soul reaver also has dimension travel which at the time was simply mind blowing ,it was used to get past certain locations or find secret areas and the atmosphere is simply jaw dropping some of the best in any game. Soul reaver is simply a generation defining masterpiece a beautiful diamond that will only look better the more you look at it.. Best at 2010.. but too much dialogue that cannot skipped.. Soul Reaver 2 is much better. Brilliant game , wonderful character writing . on of the most memorable games of that time. OVERALL - 85% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 8/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 7/10 Atmosphere - 9/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Another game that needs a new generational update!. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - this is the best game ever made! Perfect story, great characters, most interested game world. Great vampire and spirit world saga.. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. Played again at the end of 2019 after a long time having not played this. Played this on release when i thought it was a masterpiece and one of the greatest games ever made. it is still a masterpiece and one of the greatest (if not the greatest) games ever made.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Still great after all this years. The story is great, the writing is amazing, the music is fantastic and ominous, the bosses are terrifying and cool to fight, the abilities you can get are funny to use and diverse, and you will want to explore everything. It's just a classic game, one of the best.. This is my favorite game of all time. The story was amazing, no other game back then had a deep story other than metal gear solid. The graphics are amazing, the best on the Playstation fully detailed models and textures. This has the best voice acting ever, The characters never sound bored and the vocabulary is amazing. And the music fits the area you are in and has the best main theme I have ever heard. So the gameplay, I love adventure games which this does. I also love action and puzzle which this also has. It is so much fun to explorer the secrets of Nosgoth and kill your brothers in their dungeons. And If you like something new with good story and adventure, go buy it. It is the most underrated game and franchise in the world in my Opinion. And does it hold up Today. I played this in 2014. Fifteen years when it came out and I say yes it holds up.. Game of my childhood. Interesting puzzles, nice gameplay and awesome voice characters. One of the few games where you need to think. True hardcore, true oldschool.. I played this game about 10 years ago. I remember it was fantastic, and now I bought it on steam sale. So much memories :) a must have! Even bought a ps2 just to play it on a console, as I don't really like the master race ^^. The best game ever. Scenario like nothing before, plot, game play, combat, all combined to a perfect action - puzzle game. Old game, but this is how games should be done.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Outstanding game! -Very good, deep and interesting story with amazing plot twists that will make you go : What!? This really happened!? OMG I didn't expect this, so cool! -Very clever puzzles (repetitive at times, but you won't notice). -Amazing world! Nosgoth will grab you by the pair and won't let go. Nice textures for it's time and totally memorable places with great atmosphere. -Godlike character designs which are so memorable! -The concept is so creative that it's mind blowing, going in and out of the physical and spectral realm doing stuff you can't do in the other realm but you can do in the other one. -Very good voice acting -Very comfortable and nice platforming. This game does not hold you by the hand, you will have to use your brain quite often. I totally recommend this game to anyone who knows what a good game is. 10/10. Amazing game for it's time. Great environments and plays well even today. Raziel is one of the coolest characters of that era. Only downside is the unsatisfying ending.. This is the best game of the Legacy of **** Graphics are amazing,the soundtrack is very good and the gameplay is Awesome and is one of the best games of the PS1 generation.. Fantastic game. A must own for ps1/ps2/ps3/psp/ps vita owners who love action adventure games. Epic combat, smooth controls and exploration make this game a blast. Sometimes its a bit too non-linear and gothic for my tastes, but the game was just a blast to play. My only problem is the soul reaver weapon. It takes away all the fun of using the environment to your advantage and destroying vampires with fire, sunlight, water or weapons. The soul reaver also looks incredibly ugly around raziels arm.. As with many PSone titles it struggles to hold up today but even at the time I found this a difficult game to get into. It had it moments but I seemed to spend most of the time unable to work out where to go.. This is the best game for long, winter evenings. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for intense gameplay, stunning in-game world and nice storyline.. great game, could've been even more if the dudes had enough money. But that's alot to ask for in those times. Even now makes a mockery out of Darksiders. Amazing game, Hands down the only series I will happily say I am now a fanboy of. The story is deep and will keep you playing though the (lets face it) tedious combat (but then again you are armed with the SOUL REAVER!), The platforming is just purely amazing and the ability to switch between realms just adds to the story and the gameplay. Puzzles are challenging but rewarding. overall one of the best games of the year....... But could of shined even more. I want to see a HD remake.. Stunning scenarios, epic soundtrack, the best voice acting possible(Tony Jay), addicting game play, anti heroes, gothic theme... the perfect recipe. just...play it!","the framerate, controls and camera are atrocious . the only minor issues are the unskippable cutscenes and overall poor replay value . the presentation is flawless with an amazing art direction and a sublime voice acting ."
259.Golden Sun,"Best dedicated handheld JRPG, ever. The difficulty is spot on, I beat the boss of the game with literally my last attack after running out of ""summons"", magic, healing items and well.... A basic attack doing 100 damage fell the boss with 100,000hp+.. Golden sun is definitely my favourite game of all time, nothing encapsulated me the same way this game did when I first played it. The environment, the mechanics, the graphics every aspect was such a wonderful experience, this is coming from someone who doesnt even favour rpgs especially. Considering this game is about 25 hours on a gameboy always blows my mind, the content is extensive and entertaining. Would reccomend to any gamer.. I’ve played a lot of video games on many console for many years now but I’ve never come across a game that was this good. I’ve always come back to this game because of how good it was. I can’t believe it was for gameboy advance. Music is masterpiece too. I was gonna say this game is the most basic run of the mill RPG there is… than I stopped playing it half way though to play Final Fantasy 1… the basic **** that FF1 does that Golden Sun doesn’t is astonishing. Why is there no minimap? Why is there no buff and debuff spells? Why is the menu button the same as the interact button? This game is bad. With obscure story checkpoints that are to the likes of Zelda 2, and a massive world that is easy to get lost in, I haven’t been frustrated by a game this much in a long time.. A groundbreaking example of fantasy RPGs. Clever design, bold graphics, enticing battle system, characters with character, it's all there.. +Unique Battle System +SNES like quality on a handheld +Challenging Puzzles ~Soundtrack is hit or miss / Repeative ~Made as **** - Story is generic. Without all of the publicity it received, Golden Sun may well have easily slipped into obscurity. It would have become a hidden gem that people would only play in the days of rediscovering great retro games because Golden Sun has the look and feel of every other classic game that got added to the Game Boy Advance library. It plays like a traditional Super Nintendo RPG with its turn-based combat system, but adds to it in a lot of ways. It’s a classic that should not be overlooked.. Golden Sun + Golden Sun: The Lost Age are probably my favorite games of all-time, and I love a 'lot' of games... There is so much content packed in this journey throughout the 2-game joint story. There's a lot of dialogue with an interesting story. It's not Final Fantasy or maybe Dragon Quest length, but not short either if you do a lot of optional things. The battles are quick-paced with little-to-no wasted time at the beginning or ends of them which is nice compared to some other RPGs, and also has some definite strategy involved for optional super bosses. The weapons, equipment, unleashes, psynergy, summons, Djinn, puzzles are all quite cool aspects of the game. The great puzzles & psynergy used outside of battles are fun & varied too! The sprites & visuals are phenomenal for the Game Boy Advance, a standout game for the graphical capabilities of the system. Also, the OST is a particular highlight; the person who made the music put their soul into the game, developing the different tracks. All the tracks are very nostalgic for me & quite good, like Final Fantasy IX's OST. Check out Coaltergeist's YouTube channel for remastered Golden Sun tracks if you want a taste. This game is definitely up there with some of the bests from the GBA system for sure(if not besting them all in my humble opinion)... great games such as: Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Advance, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, Advance Wars, Metroid, Castlevania, Final Fantasy, and Fire Emblem. If you like JRPGs, lots of extra content, & want to play one of the absolute best to grace the GBA, definitely check out both Golden Sun & Golden Sun: The Lost Age. Thanks for reading, and have a great day!. In the top 20 games of all time for me, the story, game mechanics, and visuals seemed unbelievable. Something I had never experienced before. I hope this franchise gets a reboot.. + Gorgeous art style and graphics for the GBA + Enthralling combat system + Epic and evocative soundtrack + Memorable world, story and villains + Puzzle-laden dungeon design. The best JRPG I have ever played. I just love the world of Weyard and its characters, the fact that it is a flat world, the fact that the game is based on our real world in term of geography and you can find references to various places and cultures. Saturos and Menardi are such imposing and charismatic villains, the pacing is great, the animations are GORGEOUS for a GBA game and the puzzles while pretty simple in the first game can still feel very rewarding to complete on your first playthrough Just perfect 10/10. People need to check their nostalgia goggles. This game is terrible. Every second i try playing it i get incredibly pissed off and thats not even if im at a difficukt part. Something about this game just rubs me the wrong way. I dont think ive ever disliked an rpg this much. Doubt ill even finish it and i cant stand not finishing games.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Fun start. Towards the end, the main story had unnecessary subplots (ship, insivible man), and the last dungeon had too many puzzles, it felt unnecessarily stretched out.. Fantasy RPG that's very much in the evin of the Final Fantasy series with nice colourful graphics and magic powers and emojis to mark it out from the crowd. Not exactly groundbreaking but an absorbing little interactive tale to while away a few hours.. Still UNDERRATED! Probably Golden Sun 1 (and 2) are the best RPG ever made in my opinion, and I played much. Lovely story, thrilling, and interesting graphics for GBA, the best Soundtrack I ever heard in a game (you should check orchestral remakes on youtube), atmospheric, great controls and. Well, the best game I ever played and I played probably a thousand games, well it's very subjective and I also could find things I could cry about if I would but the story and the game altogether are just satisfying.. One of the best games I’ve played in my life. The story, the characters, their skills, the game mechanics, turn based battles, the mystery, finding out all the secrets and hidden functions/contents by yourself, the soundtrack, the atmosphere, etc. For me the combination of all these aspects was so good that it made me searching for a similar combo or similar games all the time. The game is very good and I love it so much.. Puzzles, visuals and soundtrack are all great. The combat and plot are good, but standard RPG-fare. If this and Lost Ages had been packaged as a single game allowing you to roam the entire world map without restriction, it would’ve been 10/10 imo.. Golden Sun was a awesome experience! Now i bought it for like 100$, WAY too expencive. The prices for these older games needs to drop, its stupid. However, it was such a fun time. The story is simple, but it pulled me in right of the bat. There are few games i have played recently that has done just that. I cared about the characters and wanted them to succeed. The world is so wonderful to explore, made even better by the fantastic graphics and magical music. Combat system is engaging, with tons of options and i actually found it fun to grind! I also love how expressive the characters are, they found fun ways to express them. And this was like 20 years ago! Man, it makes me realise randomly how behind everyone the Pokèmon games are, sheesh, Anyway, Its only the first part of the whole story, but it does`nt feel incomplete. Ill be getting TLA soon enough. A few gripes i have, includes random encounters. Seriosly this needs to go away NOW. When the game is over, you can`t leave the final area to continue exploring. So save your game in the final dungeon and create an extra save file in case you want that. Golden Sun clicked with me, few games are able to do that for me nowdays. I am looking foward to playing the TLA, perhaps also Dark Dawn AND i am already eager to play this game again one day. For these reasons, Golden Sun gets a 10 from me!!!. I think it was the first J-RPG i've played, only good memories of it. A true enjoyment.. A masterpiece for its time, combining successful elements from both Zelda and prior JRPGs, complete with fantastic music and graphics. A must-play for any JRPG fan.. Perfect in all sense. This game which was release around 20 years ago can beat a lot of games from the actual era. Great history, great graphics, long game with a great environment that will make you feel it wasn't long. That makes this game magic.. Simply the best RPG, the story, the characters, the soundtrack, everything is perfect!. My top 3 game of all time! The visuals are astonishing for GBA, story is good and soundtrack is amazing! Golden Sun still remains after three years my favorites, I love it!. Golden sun 1 and Golden Sun TLA are hands down not only my favorite GBA games of all time, but also one of my favorite stories as well (which was unfortunately ruined by GS3 Dark Dawn)... I love the graphics, I love the RPG way of battles, solving puzzles, the tension of the story, the plot, the four elements, djinnis, summons, rare items, extremely likable main characters, antagonists, final bosses and most of all - the MUSIC!. Alot of great ideas, but alot of frustrating things hold it back greatly. Having characters defend instead of attacking a new enemy when the one they target dies is insanely juvenile design. Every time you try to walk up to a pot to see what's inside it you automatically start turning **** path forward often leads you to need a guide. Making me go through an entire area just to tell me to turn around isn't fun! It's juvenile and cruel.. I remember this game for the mindblowing battle animations for the time and especially for a handheld console. Best rpg by turns in the game boy. Nothing else to say. Just play it. 100% Recommended.. Phenomenal game! This is my childhood memories, my safe and happy place. Still worth playing even in 2020.. The passion was there. Nintendo's Gameboy advance always delivered amazing titles.. The most outstanding turn-based RPG game, no one. The combination of the gameplay mechanism, the design of world outlook and maze, the combat and collecting system was absolutely amazing. All of the game content attracted me so so much. In that period, Golden Sun is a fantasy world that really existed, and also a game of dream for me to become a real alchemist or magician, and write my own story.. This game is full of nostalgia for me, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it is an amazing game and probably my favorite RPG. It got me to put down the poke balls and start hunting for Djinni, refining my alchemy, and climbing elemental towers. I've played through it two or three times after the first, and it is still magical.. Golden Sun is one of the best handheld RPGs of all time. With a special combat system that is matched with catchy music, interesting characters and mechanics that were pioneering future RPGs at its time, it's very impressive to see how a game of this caliber could be put on such a small handheld game system. You can find very little to fault the game such as overuse of dialogue, lack of new enemies that are color-swap palettes instead and some issues with direction and progression, but the experience is very unique for its time. Considering the extreme limitations handheld gaming devices had during its time, Golden Sun shines above them all by having a rich and rewarding adventure .. There's just something so special about this game. Something mystical, something about the atmosphere. It might be the graphics, it might be the music, it might even be the text sound. But there's a magic aura surrounding this game. The true masterpiece is Golden Sun 2 thought.. A Little masterpiece for Game Boy Advance and one of my favorites rpg ever, also one of my first contacts with this amazing genre, the music, the graphics, the story and the gameplay, are make a perfect combo. I remember this game so well. I had so much fun with it. Reminds me a lot of the Final Fantasy games. If you loved them and you want something along those lines but don't really like how games today are, then definitely look for this game or at least see if they have it on an emulator. Wonderful game. I just bought this game again at a secondhand game store to relive, and man is it not as wonderful as I remember 15 years ago! Seriously, one of the best RPGs I've ever played.. and it's on the Gameboy Advance. The beautiful quest is probably the richest, most intricate RPG ever... ... this game is amazing .... all RPG fan should play this game ! :D Easily the best portable RPG ever, and arguably one of the best RPGs even in 2015 he is in my top RPG games :D. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a handheld RPG, it works fairly well. The story is interesting, memorable characters and great fight mechanics. I would say it's one of the top ten GBA games. If you are a fan of RPGs, definitely try this out. 10/10. one of the most underestimated games and also one of the most perfect games i've ever played. great characters, great story, alot of smart puzzles, awesome fights, music that u can't forget, a masterpiece. no matter how many games i've played since 2001, it's still my all time favorite. One of best RPG i´ve ever played, great story, graphic, soundtrack and combat system. I would like to see this game so much as manga adaptation. 10/10. Unmissable, the best GBA RPG by far. Used to stay overnight with my friends to play this game when it first came out, last month we did it again to remember ""ye goode olde days"" and it was awesome. Love this game!. This was the first Japanese RPG to really catch my interest. I got it on the recommendation from a friend. I almost wish I had kept it. When I returned it to him, he had told me he sold it. I was devastated. This game really shines in it's well-written story, interesting psynergy system, djinn system, and great music. I can never forget the opening scene to the game, and I loved the expansiveness of the world. In fact, 9 times out of 10, I was completely lost. I just jumped from location to location, doing each little side quest until I happened upon the main quest. There are a lot of side quests, so I was lost for a long time. That might be my only issue with the game. I'm all for a great big open world, but I also prefer to have a better bearing of what I'm doing. Nevertheless, it's an excellent game and one that is very memorable.. When I was around eight years old or so, my brother introduced me to the joy of Golden Sun: The Lost Age. Although I was young, and, not completely understanding of the plot because I missed out on the first game, I fell in love. It has almost been ten years since then, me finally just in recent times able to experience my first playthrough of the original Golden Sun. And without a doubt, I can say I fell in love all over again. Let me start with the graphics and art choices. As an artist, I can say that I am completely blown away by the quality of the scenery that this game presented. I found myself looking forward to each new area that I visited; being thrown into a battle and getting to see the background scenery gives me a complete new feel on how to perceive where I am. The character designs are also fantastic, and very fitting to character. The art style is progressive and solid. Psynergy, summons, and special moves from artifacts are gorgeously rendered. (Though i'm sure we can all agree on the silliness that is the quake attacks). The music is nostalgic, soothing, but tense when the situation calls for it. I enjoyed it thoroughly. As for the story, I am easily swept into it. Though sometimes I find myself laughing at little cliché moments sprinkled here and there, it takes nothing away from the entire plot. Sometimes I find that there are parts in which I would like a bit more elaborate detail, I also realize that I have not played the sequel in ages and am planning on going through it again very soon, and, even so, one must consider that this is a Gameboy game and cannot possibly have everything that a person would expect to be in more recent-day games because there was simply not enough space to contain such depth like there is now. Also, /too/ much description could become monotonous. The characters are lovable and close to heart. Something that I missed out in The Lost Age was Isaac and co's friendship. It's sweet and satisfying to see how they all work together for the common goal and how their bonds grow as you go on. The only thing I would find a bit lacking is a bit of Mia's backstory, as it seemed slightly rushed so that she could join your team. Other than that, I am very happy with what their differentiating personalities bring to the game. Finally, we have the battle system. It is lovely an non-stressful, with an assortment of attacks always keeping the fight interesting. Djinn also add a giant play to this, with the more you collect enhancing your skills and if you so wish you can even assort them so that your classes change, depending on your battle style. New introductions of monsters constantly keep you on your toes, you only feeling satisfied with yourself when the characters have gotten strong enough to take them out with not much difficulty. Battles are never easy nor too impossible to handle when you take the time to train correctly. You never have to grind for too long unless you're short on money, so you aren't ever too slowed up during the playthrough. All in all, Golden Sun is a definite recommendation for any RPG lovers. Exciting, close to the heart, and memorable, it will blow players away with the cohesive details that work so well together. You'll have difficult time forgetting a game like this one.. Note: Very small spoiler concerning Djinn One of the greatest and all-time best rpg games I have ever played. The graphics are great for it's time and are still great to this day in my opinion. The story is great and the characters are written very well. It's one of those games that you cant put down after you start it, you want to keep playing and see where the story goes. Gameplay wise it's simple yet wide ranged at the same time. When it comes to leveling up it's like standard rpg game-get stronger, gain new abilities-but at the same time it isnt like standard rpgs. This is a job-based rpg when it comes to the characters but it's interesting how you change your job. There are creatures in the game called Djinn that you find in the world along your travels, some you have to look for, and you equip them to your characters and by setting them to your characters they gain stat bonuses and job changes. There are 7 Djinn for each of the 4 elements, meaning there is a wide variety when it comes to picking what goes to who. Like other rpg games you collect pieces of equipment such as armor, helm, weapon, ect. Golden Sun has a large variety of different equipment of different types. One of the best parts of the game I would have to say is the music. The music is amazing and sounds incredible for a 32 bit system such as the GameBoy Advanced. When you play the game you can tell the developers put much time and attention into making the music great. Overall, Golden Sun is an amazing rpg with great gameplay, music, story, and characters. For any lover of rpg games this is a top-notch pick to add to your collection of favorites.. This game doesn't have to hide itself in front of other RPG giants like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger. A great story, interesting characters, amazing music and presentation in general and the fighting system is very clever and strategy driven. You can choose not to grind...Which will result in a VERY hard game. I don't get how remakes are allowed here, that's kind of **** IMO. btt. Great Game, the only flaw I have is it is an RPG. If you forget what the hell you were doing then you can pretty much start all over again.. Simply put... this game is amazing. The story, the characters, the emotion involved all stand out in this RPG. I first played this game as a child many years ago. I'm now a college graduate and I still enjoy the game to this day. The thing that I love the most about the Golden Sun series is the story involved. As you play the game, the lives of these characters unravel before your eyes. Emotion can also be involved while playing. Heartbreak from a character's loss of family to determination in hopes of a better future of the world; it's all woven within this game. Aside from the story, the gameplay is actually great! As usual with any RPG, you get random battles in dungeons and on the world maps and you progress more and more in levels and skills until you are strong enough to take on your foes without fail. There are a large amount of items and gear in the game to keep players occupied with upgrading. There is a collection aspect to the game involving these creatures called Djinns. These creatures boost the abilities and power of the characters in which they are attached to. They can be swapped between characters to allow for further combinations of abilities. As characters use the Djinns in battle, powerful summons can be used to take out foes once a certain number of Djinns have been used in combat. These summons are learned or found throughout the game. The graphics in this game are fantastic for a gameboy advance title. Everything from the environments to the battles to the summoning cutscenes are all great to look at while playing. I remember when this game was first released. I was in awe at some of the graphical effects in this game. The music in the game is some of the best I have ever heard in a portable title. I find myself just sitting in a particular battle or environment just to listen to the music and themes that play. There is a special mode that allows you to listen to all of the music in the game when you enter the arena mode at the title screen (look it up to find out how to find it). The point is that you may love the music so much that you will want to just listen to it at times. Overall, this game is a classic in my opinion. The quality of this game is obvious. I can only hope for a remake of this title one day with modern-style graphics. It could possibly become more appealing to those who don't like Golden Sun in its current state.... One of greates RPG's ever made. Misterious, Alternative and just great. I can't describe this game in words... It's just a MUST PLAY Game! Everyone should have played this game. Great Graphics too. They only **** up Golden Sun DS .. I have played the Tales of the World series, the Final Fantasy series and Dragon's Quest series, but none of them came close to comparison with the Golden Sun series. A memorable storyline and cast alongside impressive soundtracks for the period of release and a story crafted with pure perfection makes this one of the greatest Game Boy Advance games to exist. The same goes for its sequel.. One of the most original games I've played for the gba and the best Rpg to come out in the year 2002. (it came out in 2002 in the uk , 2001 in the us.) Go to ebay and buy it! Ps i'm new to metacritic and i'm just reviewing some of my favourite games7. this game was amazing.. Greatest series ever created! So much fun playing and replaying this game, from the story to the music, it is magical. This game is completely flawless.. Awww yeah. Beat it again for the 6th time. Greatest GBA RPG ever. From the story to the spells to the environments it's great. The puzzles are kinda easy. They start getting annoying when you're trying to solve something and you run into a monster battle, but that's just being picky. When you beat the game you can use your saved data with Lost Age, so that's cool too. Be warned though, make sure you finish everything in the game (Crossbone Isle) before beating the final boss otherwise you won't be able to go back and finish them.. If there was ever a game more bland and lifeless than Golden Sun... Let's go back to the beginning. I saw some GS ads in a magazine or something, and thought it looked great. Mainly, I was impressed with the graphics, but I just assumed the rest of the game would have the same quality. Then I got the game. Now, it starts off with some cliche garbage I can't even remember because it was so uninspired. I went on for a while, going through some generic dungeons with generic ""puzzles"", oh and I did all this while fighting random, generic enemies. Now the battle? This is the worst part. It's much like Dragon Quest, without any of those ""features"" or ""abilities"". All you do is pick a spell out of maybe 5 that are practically identical anyway, repeat 5-20 times and you win. I've played a few mindless RPGs before, but this one just pushes the limits of boredom to their maximum. If you absolutely hate having fun with a burning passion, get this game.","golden sun is definitely my favourite game of all time, nothing encapsulated me the same way when i first played it . Considering this game is about 25 hours on a gameboy always blows my mind, the content is extensive and entertaining . without all of the publicity it received, Golden Sun may well have easily slipped into obscurity ."
26.Elden Ring,"Brilliant game. Top 10 game for me. On another play through and over 350 hours in game. Hated Dark Souls Remastered, but adore this game! It takes all the frustrating elements of earlier dark souls games, and makes them better. You are no longer stuck behind a linear pathing/story because of a poor build and can’t progress unless you first die 500 times to a boss. Beautiful game, compelling story, and still the difficult/challenging yet rewarding gameplay that makes these games so fun. You have the ability to make it as hard or as easy as you want as there are elements in the game that make it much easier. Some will say that isn’t the“true” way to play the game, but I say, play it how you want to and have fun!. Simply the best game I have played in a very long time. It has captivated me and kept me glued to my chair day after day until I finished the game.. 11/10 game, takes everything that Dark souls and Bloodborne did good and took it to the next level. Took the quality of Zelda BOTW and others top tier games and made the best open world I ever played Story and music are amazing and it's hard to stop playing.. It's the real goat this is the only game make me want to do everything the side quests and ithas a more than great story a great boss. Great game for people wanting to start playing this genre of game, if it gets too hard at the start you can explore the areas around you and come back to where you were stuck after leveling up and exploring and find it easier.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Do NOT buy Shadow of the Erdtree... The base game is all you will need. Less is more. Trust me. This game is just absolute peak. There are no words to describe whow good this game is.. That Pretty great! Get my Trophy! love Bloodborne.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Love it, everything about it. It changed my perspective in video games in general. It is truly a masterpiece.. Just relentlessly punishing until you hit level 40 or so. Seems to pride itself on not explaining basic things, like, what the icons mean or how to avoid being poisoned. It discourages you from continuing playing, and rewards you for accepting the abuse. You won't ""get good"" at the game, the game literally just gets easier. It especially gets easier if you just google how to do things. For example, the first boss can be beaten handily if you find a specific NPC, talk to them, then press a secret button on the ground summoning them to help you. How would you know this was even possible without googling it? The story, if you can call it that, is very immature and hackneyed. I would review it but there's not really one. Find the shards of the triforce I MEAN the Runes of the **** Elden Ring. Why do you want to get the ring back together? No idea. Why do you want to be ""Elden Lord?"" Don't WORRY about THAT, OKAY. The graphics are terrible. Everything looks the same. You will get lost because this section of the cave or castle looks exactly like the section you were just in, and you're not sure if you've been here already. Two of the bosses look exactly the same, and they are called like Morgoth and Mirgott or something. No, this is not Bowser, this is Bow-zere, his eviler french cousin. The game is kind of poorly assembled. * There will be a big thing that pops up that says YOU DIED like.. three seconds after you die. You will be wondering whether you died or not and still desperately pressing buttons because sometimes there's a smidgen of life left in you. * If you go to a shop and buy armor, you have no idea if the stats are better than the armor you're wearing. Final Fantasy figured this out in like 1998. * I can't imagine what the game is like if you use spells a lot, because the guys who teach you spells are just randomly sprinkled on the map, and sometimes they leave their spot. * There's no in-game way to keep track of the quests you're doing (unless you google everything). I guess it would strain credulity for your character to use a pen and notebook, yet summoning a transparent dragon's head to breathe ice flames is believable. * XP is the same currency as money, which, it never felt like telling me? I'm like level 80 now and I have no idea if I upgraded the right stats. * Yet another open world game that starts with a character creator and face editor for someone who will never show their face because it's either behind a helmet or you're perpetually staring at their back. It asks you to choose a voice, but your character will never say anything except grunts and wails. And be sure to choose a player class, knowing nothing about how the game works at this point. * The game itself teaches you how to play it wrong. It shows you the moves at the beginning and then puts you on a horse and sends you out into an open world. If you're like me, you wander the open world not knowing where to go and you learn to fight on the horse. Then when you get to the castle you're supposed to go to, aaand they take away the horse. And now you ****. There is an immense level of detail and a lot of fun exploring to do, and the game actually becomes genuinely fun after a while. At that same point, it starts actually telling you where to go, going so far as to MARK ON YOUR MAP with a BIG RED SPOT where to go next. Why it didn't just do this at the beginning is beyond me. If someone gave this to you as a gift, sure, play it. Don't believe the hype. If you bought it and got stuck with it, kill some guy named Darrell and get his 'bloodhound's fang' and sneak around places you're not supposed to go to upgrade it all the way. This is the closest thing to easy mode.. This is the greatest video game ever made and I can't think of a close second. Anyone who says otherwise is either too young to understand or a philistine. 10/10.. Good graphics but a very stupid storyline and a very stressful gameplay.. it cant be called a game because it takes the fun out of gaming. loads of better things to do and games to play with great combat system and srpg stories. Great game, but just was not for me. I just don't understandwhy someone would do this much work and make it so hard to discover it.. Bad game hard and devs don’t care about it and only thing it has is combat which gets super boring after a while. I can't understand those who say 2022 god of war was right. God of war is never a bad game but it is very faithful to its essence. Elden ring is a game that feels both innovative and great.. The first souls game ever that I had the nerves and energy to finish. It's not bad, that's for sure. But like all the souls games it is insanely overhyped in my opinion. For a 10/10 open world game there are too many things missing. There might be a story, but after 60 hours of play time I have pretty much no idea of what was happening other than me becoming the ""Elden Lord"" after slaying about 40 bosses with the same jump attack strategy. Also I don't think it's an indicator **** single player game when I have to read ten guides online and watch multiple youtube videos in order to understand the builds or basically how almost anything in this game even works on a basic level. Would give this a 7/10 but will give it a 6 to counteract the crazy fanboyism and overhype from so many people here.. Phenomenal, the world is so big and there are so much to explore and endure, but the reward is always (like every soulslike) the biggest satisfaction.. Graphics gameplay story all are great and i got the game for cheap and it's worth more.. Got this game to play with friends, but the multiplayer allowed players to invade into your multiplayer and attack you. If I wanted a pvp game would have gotten one specially for that. As a single player its a good game but for multiplayer it total trash.. Masterpiece game, bad FPS on PS5. Unplayable if you played it on PC and are used to a certain FPS quality smoothness.. Masterpiece! Easily one of the most enjoyable games to be created In the past decade fore sure!. One of the best games, if not the best, in the Souls genre. Captivating and enigmatic story, by far an adventure that will remain with me. Varieties of incredible builds and bosses. The best.. This is the most disgustingly overrated game I've played in 25 years of gaming. It's a janky, dated, uninspired dark souls rip off - there are 10,000,000 games identical to this. The only reason anyone likes this is because Elon Musk told them to. It's a pointless, boring, poorly made, the graphics looks straight out of 2012 and the combat feels like **** compared to other dark souls rip offs like Wu Kong.. Elden Ring carries the ""Souls"" legacy into a visually-appealing open world that practically begs to be explored. The inclusion of the same tedious combat mechanics and clunky interface from earlier games is disappointing, but if you've never played one of FROM's artificially difficult hack-and-slash action titles, then ER is probably the most inviting entry point. Ignore the incoherent ""story"" and lack of helpful information in-game, crack open a wiki, and prepare to die many deaths before you find a playstyle that works for you. There is fun to be found in Elden Ring, but digging it up can take some serious effort, a varied approach, and all too many hours of repetitive game loops.. TLDR: Yes the game is amazing, with epic fights, a larger scale to its story and with really tough endgame bosses!This game is everything fans loved about the series but brought to the open world. The combat feels as good as ever, with quick responses to your inputs and nice flow and feeling of weight overall. With a variety of classes to choose from, and playstyles that suit every player this game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. From summons to spirit NPC ashes, you can choose whether to fight solo or with an ally. There is one bossfight where I definitely recommend using summons and that's the Godskin Duo. Now on the story side of ****'S MINDBLOWNLINGLY EPIC! Overall it makes you feel like you're rising up to the top becoming stronger and stronger, culminating in an epic final **** the negatives now...Some classes and builds are way better than others, making fights hilariously easy but again that's up to the player. I didn't involve myself in the PVP so no comments on that. A lot of assets are re-used but I kind of expected that in a game as massive as this. Lastly, a lot of the bosses in the late game are really hard, not allowing the player with a window of opportunity for a counter attack and with endgame damage stats, the fights become really hard and are a matter of patience. But overall I don't have anything major to say in regard to the bad aspects of the ****: The music in certain bossfights just gives me chills(Mohg, Lord of Blood cough cough). Um... I ate my words. I previously really talked **** and disliked this game. But it gets really good, like really fun. Just a couple of problems. This game is NOT beginner friendly at all. I had to use guides to mostly play the game which sort of ruined the fun a bit for me, but it wasn't a super bad thing nonetheless. Good game, but improvements can be made.. You will spend 8 hours trying to leave the starting area and never get anywhere. I can honestly say this is the worst game I've ever spent money on and I can't say enough bad things about it.. I really wanted to like this game, but just 5 hours in all I can say is that I regret buying it (although I got it on sale, it still stings). - Story feels non-existent - Atmosphere is depressing - No music while you play - Progression is super slow - Graphics look old - Loot drops are 99% garbage - Controls and inventory management are poor - Crafting is pointless - Armour and Weapon upgrades don’t matter - Combat is slow and clunky - Open world feels empty - Game feels hard on purpose to mask that it’s not a fun game - Boss fights are fun, but that’s about it All you do is go around killing things to save up “Runes” (XP) to cash in for levelling up, and you never actually feel any stronger. I have 5 hours into it, watched a few hours of videos to see if I was “missing something” or “not playing it properly”, and can quite confidently say this game isn’t for me, and I can’t understand why it won GOTY and gets such high review scores. I guess games journalists just don’t represent me any more, given the last few years.. There's too much input delay. You'd expect the character to jump exactly when you press the jump button, but unlike any other game, they only start to jump after the button is released. Too bad!. Elden ring has good world design, tons of content, great customization, but really poor boss fights and mini dungeons that weigh it down for a solo player. If you enjoyed previous fromsoft games you’ll likely enjoy most of what Elden ring has to offer, especially early on. The World is just enormous compared to previous titles in terms of space and easily on par in terms of zones. The combat is very similar with new special moves added to allow for greater variety and speed. The zones are generally fun to explore (albeit the size makes the main open world zones tedious). The legacy dungeons are fun and interesting with branching and puzzles. Bosses are largely just not fun to fight. They are far too aggressive unless you use multiplayer/summons which tend to make them easier than you would like. This leads to you either spending time waiting out combos to look for a tiny opening window where you don’t have time to use most interesting skills or to hit them while their attention is on someone else. The latter doesn’t give much satisfaction to many players. Mini dungeons have the same problem as chalice dungeons from blood borne. They all feel samey and boring with a few exceptions. NPC quest lines are enjoyable, but difficult to find and follow in the open world. Overall there’s a lot to enjoy, but I personally feel like the game drags really badly the later you get with boss fights getting more frequent. Each successive one just wears rather than brings joy. I’ve not gotten this feeling from any other fromsoft title, nor many of the more popular Derivative titles. In the end you’ll get your money’s worth of fun and playtime, but may end up with a bitter feeling about it.. MASTERPIECE. This is FromSoftwares best game and it’s not even close. Elden Ring offers a huge world all for you to explore, when you explore you may find one of the 414 weapons in the game or one of the 141 different **** Elden Ring there are over 300 bosses and also the most difficult and best designed bosses in fromsoftware history.. This game isn’t a master piece like everyone says. It has a few BIG problems. For example your character moves like in demon souls, yet the bosses move like it’s sekiro. (Which by the way sekiro is objectively THE best fromsoft game. It has a focused and rewarding system (the parry system) along with a new element, the grapple. If I took every fromsoft game and stripped the color from them and put them side by side you would not be able to tell the difference. Except sekiro. now the next problem is the game doesn’t actually improve at all? It seems they spent three years just making the map? Lmao. I was expecting something as unique and as fun as sekiro OR something as refined as lies of p. LoP is also the second best fromsoft game, that’s not made by fromsoft. The only really negative reviews on the game are just saying it’s more of a “refinement not an improvement” or that “they copied fromsoft” and fromsoft copied ninja gaiden. What’s your point? that’s exactly what it is, and it does it extremely well. Lies of p takes Essentially the best thing from every from soft game and puts it in one game. Along with a more understandable story and its own unique theme and gameplay/ combat systems. I was expecting far more out of Elden ring yet it falls short unfortunately. I tried playing the game so many times and I really just tried to like it, but it’s simply a literal copy and paste of DS3. That goes for pretty much most fromsoft games. If you have played one fromsoft game, you basically played them all. And unfortunately they are the most toxic players in video games if you try to tell them that they’re buying the same game every year like COD, they will gang up and you and start **** on each other lol. Proof of this is the success of lies of p. round8 studio made a game far better than pretty much anything put out by fromsoft and the only people hating were fromsoft ****. We all know if from soft put out lies of P they would be praising and **** it off lol. They buy the same game every year. Then turn around and make fun of Ubisoft and Activision….. The irony lol. In Elden ring especially Malenia. she has a certain move set called the waterfall dance or something like that. She and a few others are a perfect example of poorly made game decisions and boss moveset. That certain movement is CLEARLY A copy out of sekiro and meant to be parryied, yet it’s not parryable. They essentially copied boss moves from sekiro, giving bosses, sekiro boss like movement and patterns. while giving the actual player dark souls 1 movement you see similar problems in one of the most recent call of duty games, And why copying things from other games doesn’t always work. In the newest Mw3 2023 they took over a decade old maps that is designed with positioning and slow movement in mind from the OG mw2 and ported it in a game where you get across the map in literally 4 seconds….. essentially destroying any actually positioning or strongholds on the map. That would be the main fight locations for players. And this goes for every map. Was really excited, expecting something NEW from fromsoftware like sekiro. Unfortunately this is what we got. Not to mention game looks like a early ps4 game or late ps3 game. The game also plays in 60fps on ps5, but for some reason the game looks like it moves in a choppy 40. Like it’s having microstutters or something. It’s probably their engine as it feels they have been using the same ps3 engine the whole time or something. Overall it’s not a bad game, but realistically it’s a 7-8/10. They say nothing is perfect, well Elden Ring is pretty darn close. This is the greatest game ever made. Not for the weak, only the strong will survive. A beautiful haunting adventure awaits you.. A less fun version of Breath of the Wild. World was fun to explore, but the map becomes cluttered really fast. After a couple quests, this game just feels like a chore, with really unbalanced enemies. Sad to put this down, because everyone else seemed to like it.. After 550 hours i can say its the best videogame ever made. ️️️️️ So many ways to play it.. Deserved GOTY for 2022 for sure. It is definitely the best game so far this decade. The hidden story, the addicting gameplay and overall just the mechanics are so good. I love how this game is like Dark Souls but also more adventure-y. The exploring part is my favorite part of this game, if you choose to just explore that one random part of the cave, you might just find an interesting piece of lore about the world of Elden Ring, or if you choose to explore the dungeons that are the catacombs, you will find other interesting pieces about the world. Overall, this game is the best of this decade, next to God of War: Ragnarok. Definitely an 11/10 in my books.. You are now experiencing one of things created in mankind, excellence so high that it ascends its niche. Elden Ring holy s tier.. DEFINITELY deserved GOTY 2022, and is also one of the best games ever made. FromSoftware for sure knows how to cook. If there was a Game of the decade award, then Elden Ring would probably win it.. Absolute Peak game, absolutely deserved 2022 game of the year and has hundreds of hours of gameplay.. this game is good and i would give it atleast a 6.5 cause of the beauty of this game the lore aswell the cool diffrent weapons if it hadnt this much propaganda this game is not even close to a masterpiece and this game literally is the definition of propaganda from streamers.Most overrated game of all time. eldenring is by far the best videogame I've played in a very long time and I feel the best from software game ever. The game is most definitely worth your money and the dlc even though it is hard is very fun too.. i initially got elden ring from my friend back in january, and like most people i got mad and quit after 1 session. when i redownloaded the game 10 months later, i gave it a real shot, and i just recently 100% beat the game on steam. this games lore is phenomenal, some of fromsoft's best. i loved my first playthrough so much, i did it 4 more times, and im on ng+5 with the same character with 111 hours of playtime. every ending was great (lord of frenzied flame included) and the questlines to get the individual ones were amazing. my only complaint is you dont get a great sense of direction through the game, with no quest bar or something to indicate where you need to go or who you need to meet. some could argue it adds intrigue to the game, but for me it just made it a bit more confusing. nevertheless, i had a wonderful time with elden ring and if its on sale or you're looking for a challenge, i implore you to buy it. Elden ringwas the missing piece in my puzzle while I had played FromSoftware games before I just couldnt bring myself to like them. Until this masterpiece released it had everything exploration,lore,variety and amazing level and character design. Of course by being an open world game it means that the Tarnished can explore almost every bit of the map making any boss easier by finding just the right gear. Truly my favourite game of all time with a masterful DLC to go with it. Recommend everyone to play it and experience the masterpiece that is Elden Ring. I waited long before buying the game and the DLC, I always thoughtit was overrated, and with too much hype around it. I was so incredibly wrong, that's by far the best game I have ever played, insane world build, amazing and challenging enemies, incredible weapons, armours, spells, and NPCs' interactions. 10/10. Elden Ring is a beautiful game that is well designed and filled a refined level of polish and care, there are many aspects of this game that the average developer would never even consider in terms of creating an open world of this scale and filling it with this many meaningful interactions, exploratory rewards and overall gameplay feel, however where they fell through was with the lack of idle animations. The player character (Tarnished) has no idle animation for when people walk away from the their controller although the game istelf is filled with a number of animations for the tarnished to be able to complete at the press of a button a lack of idle waiting animation to help characterize the tarnished or at least as a small flourish for the player is abysmal especially considering the fact that this game is filled with a number of small things that many would overlook in such a large game. WIth people going out of their way to design a mod for idle animations. Quite disappointed. Masterful. This is a mix of all souls games until toda, and undoubtedly works. Wonderful world and attractive game. You can’t simply just leave the world of elden ring until you finish the game 2 times at least (generally I am the type of gamer who’s not really fan of playing the same game again). This game is different from all previous fromsoftware games: even if you’re not a hardcore darksouls player, you can manage to level up your character and make your own journey in the lands between.. Early game review, will probably change it later I’ve never been a fan of soulslike games, even after playing ds1 and demon’s souls, and I’m having open world fatigue thanks to Genshin Impact. With that being said, this game is amazing. The overworld exploration feels clean, smooth and definitely not empty. The combat system looks complex at first glance, but after some practice you start to understand all the mechanics needed, and even though I died a lot of times by now I still think the game itself is not as hard as other games, and getting used to it is pretty easy. Definitely recommend.. It is, in my opinion, the best game available. I admit that I put off playing it for a considerable amount of time until my friend persuaded me to give it a try. Before I knew it, I had devoted more than 100 hours to the game. In my opinion, it is the best game ever created.. theres nothing to say really, its a goated game. Not many games comes close to this.. As someone new to the world of Souls games and returning to console gaming after years, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up Elden Ring. To say I was blown away would be an understatement! This game completely immersed me from the moment I started. Its breathtaking design, expansive open world, and rich storytelling captivated me, while the intricate lore added a depth I didn’t anticipate. The challenging boss battles and harsh obstacles, though often frustrating, were equally rewarding and kept me coming back for more. Elden Ring is a masterpiece that I absolutely adored, and it has reignited my love for gaming. Excited to explore more Souls games in the future.. One of the most average games I’ve ever played. Fight mechanics are just dodge dodge dodge hit. Overhyped by community, fromsoft fans can’t take any criticism.. When I first tried this game it was just a normal game for me, but that was only because I had only explored Necrolimbo, but then, I returned after some months and I started exploring all the game. I'm fascinated with this game, it's incredible, the boss fights make you feel like a warrior and when you finally kill the boss you have been fighting for hours or even days, that's a unique feeling.. Elden ring is good but not really all that great. In a lot of ways it feels like an extended version of dark souls 2, not saying that dark souls 2 is bad, but that it overstays its welcome. Art direction is hit or miss, sometimes when you stand in edges of hills and mountains you can see a beatiful world, but when you are actually going trough it there is so many problems, not just that it can seem sameish, but that it has a lot of unecesary things such as chromatic aberration, bad upscaler (ps5), motion blur, film grain (or its the upscaler); all of this things also make other bad effects, such as ghosting, and it has 1000 problems with illumination, halo effects on many cirmustances, progresive shadow generation seen in Fallout 4 on the console versions, weird lighting issue where on the center of the screen there is more detail/correct detail whereas left or right there is less. The drawing distances also are laughable and really breaks the inmersion, specially so on liurna and limgrave. Art is there and its good but its shadowed by many decisions, issues, technical problems and player guidance Gameplay wise, its the same thing as in dark souls but with a few things that i dislike. Shields shouldnt have the counter attack thing only when blocked, it makes many battles trivial, i would have preffered that you can just normally attack back, simple but nice. A lot of the cool spells are actually bad and a lot of the boring ones, such as throwing a big rock are infinitely more useful than transforming into a 3 headed dragon that unleashes a breath of fire everywhere. Jumping in combat is way too inconsitstent, sometimes you can jump the attacks, other times you cant. Exploration wise, i miss the more unorthodox ways of parkouring seen in dark souls 1, here there is a couple but they arent nearly as good and creative as other games seen in fromsoftware. The open world fails to guide most players truly properly and some places are way bigger than they should be, making them confusing and neverending, especially a problem if you are a guy which likes to explore everything for loot, but you are met with like 15 ways to go each going into 4 ways, making me stressed about losing something. Personally i did not have issues with difficulty, if anything it felt on the easier side of general games with very few exceptions (such as malenia), many people say about a difficulty spike, which i probably did not experience because of my kind of completionist playthrougs, but can be an issue if you dont have the eye or patience or time. Bosses and general enemies are the most dissapointing thing honestly, they have good variety and all, some designs are good but the choreography which i really loved in souls saga, here it doesnt make any sense, most attacks are completly useless to do in real life, why would you expose yourself for like 5 seconds before attacking, you want to be knocked down?, this happened in the souls saga but not nearly as much as here, it wasnt the norm but it is here now, its artifially difficult. Weapon variety is nice, only issue is that there should be an easier way to compare lower level weapons to higher level ones, more ways to test it without sacrificing 70 thousand materials just to see if its better or not Lore is good, story itself kinda ****, its poorly told to the player and you have to make more of an effort to understand, in DS3 each piece of clothing and every weapon had a good enough description to tell a lot of whats happening, here most weapons descriptions are: swords, used by the guy you just killed. Some npcs where actually interesting, most where kinda lame and you never really know anyone intentions, nor whats trully happening in the world nor who is good or bad, it doesnt help that english translation was bad enough to make a good character seem like a genocidical creature. Overall its not bad, if you loved souls you will like this, it isnt necesarily hard, and if you **** a lot in games, you can use all the help you can get which is actually the point of the game.. One in a million years game,have 900+ hours,wish i could play for the first time again and feel like a kid .. Everything was spectacular from Art, Music, cutscenes,million weapons every class playable compare to previous ds game where knights are way to go ,from mechanics like giving flask back rewording exploration,not run back to bosses across whole map,simple phenomenal game. Elden Ring is a open world game based on the gameplay of Souls games. Playing as a custom character, you'll be thrown inside an huge world full of mysteries and dangerous enemies.With an action gameplay and using mostly white weapons and magic, you'll have to explore the map, upgrade your character, survive and find and kill all bosses, all with little to no guidance from the game.Every fight and every enemy could be quite challenging, and dying and repeating over and over the same fight or dungeon is something that's supposed to happen pretty often. Anyway, any death is usually caused by some recognizable mistake and repetition after repetition the player will understand how to avoid them and succeed. The difficult can be annoying and frustating for some player, but at the same time, it's also what makes the game very satisfying. There is no difficulty setting, but the game gives to the player several tools that make the game easier, like evocations, buffs etc. and learning how to use them will make the game easier for non-hardcore **** open world is probably the most amazing feature of the game, it's huge and full of things to do, of places to explore and of secrets to uncover. The curiosity to see what's in the next area will probably never abandon you, since the world is very varied and interesting. Personally, after exploring the first area and the first legacy dungeon, I was really excited to explore the rest of the game and see what was there, and I must say I was not disappointed (except maybe for the last region).Does this game also have flaws? Yes, absolutely: the gameplay is repetitive, just explore the dungeons and kill enemies. The plot is obscure and can be understood only b",the best game i've played in a very long time . i'm a huge fan of dark souls remastered . i'm a huge fan of the music and music in the game .
260.Animal Well,"Confusing mechanics, lack of direction, and unengaging gameplay make this indie title a frustrating experience.. This is the most fun I've had with a game since Elden Ring came out. I treasured every second of this game. Incredibly unique and fun!. One of the best games i've played in my entire life. It just feels great—don't read the reviews, go and get your copy.. The graphics are very unique and charming. The atmosphere is weird but in a good way. The gameplay is full of interesting puzzles and very creative. The game let's you discover what you need to do. It doesn't explain anything, you have to figure out what everything does by playing bg it and trying out everything. It is a very fun game! I really liked playing it!. Pretty good game. Wasn't sure how to rate it, but I guess an 8 out of 10 seems reasonable for it. Had a lot of fun playing it.. Bought this game because of the high scores. What this guys were thinking when they gave so much praise to it? This is the worst game I played this year. I absolute love Metroidvania games, but I couldn't stand this one. Dark and boring art style, no music and it doesn't give any kind of hint or information to help the player. If you love being lost for hours and not knowing what to do, this is for you!! Also, there's not a single line of any kind of plot, no apparent purpose or objetive. It's a world that just exist and that's it. Simply hard to get involved with Animal Well.. an incredibly tightly designed game world so carefully crafted with breathtaking visuals and incredible puzzles, animal well is a love letter to mysterious retro games that take up your every thought between play sessions.. A beautiful soundboard compliments the dark and peaceful visuals. Its world is a delight to get lost in and explore. You’re rewarded for your time spent exploring and experimenting. Game is a decent little Metroidvania, but it commits too many sins of ""not telling the players crucial information to progress"". It's cute enough and fun to explore but the lack of story and music really dragged the whole experience down for me.. what a masterpiece! I never thought that the game could be like **** imagine, you try, you succeed.. This game is EPIC! The atmosphere, the characters, the lack of story told to your face, its great!. A must play gaming experience for every taste, a breath of fresh air in a stagnant game design industry. Don't miss this. One of the best game out this year, neat little metroidvania that doesn't try to make a deep story or lore, and with some of the best puzzle design in the history of videogames.also, just so you know, this game is MUCH MORE than a ""simple"" metroidvania. Try and dive into its mechanics, the 100% is **** a 40 Mo game, I shouldn't have put 30 hours into the game, but it's such a wonderfully thought out game, with its own game engine. Its good looking, with a unique artistic direction, and its really simple in practice but you'll have to think a lot for some of the puzzles. Cool game, won't be for everybody tho.. visual 8/10, creativity 10/10, story 5/10, gameplay 8/10, music 7/10, performance 8/10, value 8/10, i gave up midway because when you die you return to checkpoint and there is few checkpoint and also because it is hard to figure out what you are supposed to do and where to go so you will get stuck multiple time.... The controls are so unresponsive somehow. Andat the first part, the game is mainly platformer, I did not get to the point that the story got interesting.. I can't say that I was ever bored, but I didn't really like the aesthetic especially with scan lines (I know you can turn them off but it looks even worse). The game does have a certain charm to it though. The game doesn't really have any combat or bosses, but it has a focus on exploration and puzzle solving. The items are cool and useful. Sometimes the backtracking was a real chore but not too time consuming as traversal is rather quick. The game design was well done with interesting puzzles and platforming involved. Almost the entire game has no music at all; not sure if this is a good thing but I would have preferred some sort of ambient BGM. I liked the dark, creepy atmosphere. The developers were probably trying to be innovative, but I still think the game would have been more interesting with some combat, bosses and music. My play through was 10.5 hours so it's not a big game but that's perfectly fine. There were a few times where I was truly lost and wasted so much time scouring the map looking for a new way to go, but had to resort to looking up guides in order to progress. The map can be hard to interpret and is just an eye sore.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Platforming is so boring and one of the worst I have ever seen! Combat is non-exsistent… a really bad game!. Animal well is hauntingly beautiful. There's nothing quite like it. You are a pink blob against an ecosystem with rules and behaviours you must understand to progress. The simple joy of understanding these rules through playful experimentation and arriving at that ""YES"" moment is what makes Animal Well truly special. 9/10 would jump down this well again. Yeah, you can make an excellent metroidvania without combat, with some decent platforming and with brilliant puzzles. After Prince of Persia (a masterpiece, imho) I didn't expect to enjoy such a game so soon. I'm probably at more than 80% and I'm taking a break after a hell of a puzzle-chase. I totally recommend it. 10/10. Solid mysterious metroidvania with some unusual interesting skills to solve problems. I played the main game without getting every egg and it was cool. No real plot or worldbuilding though.. Some of the most inventive and unified metroidvania to be released in years. There are secrets and new ideas and spaces literally behind almost every corner.. Genuinely one of the most interesting and engaging games I have ever played.. Genuinely my favorite game oat. Great puzzles great art so many secrets so much to explore. This might be my only 10/10 game. Bias of dunkey aside this game is soooo good art is some of the best pixel art I've seen in awhile all animal designs are fun cute and have fun puzzles behind them I'm not going to pretend I understand the narrative but its fun to get through if you play this game don't end after credits roll the first time make sure to find all eggs trust me don't look up anything about this game try and go in completely blind. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Appearance of depth is sometimes conflated with complexity, or more aptly, conflated with quality, since the longevity of a product is often on the line in terms of relevancy and shares some of that longevity with overall sales. So its easy to make the argument that, ""As long as people are talking about it- its probably gonna sell."" This doesn't work for every product on the market, but for Videogames (in particular no-name publishers or creators or small-time Indie studios) this word-of-mouth advertising is absolutely integral to their products success. Which brings us to: ""Animal Well."" Animal well is a small indie game made by a small team about a seemingly small world with a moderate amount of platforming mixed with an absolutely absurd amount of puzzles, some so cryptic that its not surprising if you never even knew they existed (a point I will come back to). Though often thrown into the ""metroid-vania"" vein, I would disagree with that genre label entirely, this is more ""Fantasy World Dizzy"" meets the ""Kings Quest"" series, even down to the main sprite consisting of a small bean running on tiny little feet. Adorable as this may be, it is a perplexing design given every other NPC or creature you run into is an actual animal (done with sprite work of course). Unfortunately (or fortunately) Metroid never had any instances of failing a tiny jump or a series of switches meant to hit in a specific order in a specific series or with specific progression items only to outright respawn you at your local Telephone save game room. So I safely say that just because its ""2D"" and has a large interconnected map or a warp room, doesn't make it a Metroid clone of any kind. I would in fact like to draw players to the fact that maybe.. just maybe- Animal Well is actually its own thing. For once, I would imagine people would agree, especially if they were just as confounded by some of the post-game surprises as I was. Not only does Animal Well feature two (three?) Credit roll fake-outs, but it is also has some of the most esoteric, mysterious and downright ""how-could-anyone-have-figured-this-out"" secrets in a Videogame in recent memory. There are clues on walls, behind walls, in rooms, in the shape of rooms, only accessible with items, most are literal easter eggs to collect, some are animals to set loose, some are animals so spook, some are bosses, some aren't, then you have actual secrets buried behind those secrets that took a team of people over 2 weeks to find and even then.. they still haven't actually found everything. So absolutely flabberghasted by the rate at which people found secrets, Billy Basso (one of the creators) was ostensibly in shock, so much so that he actually had hidden a recording of himself for players who found some of his most hidden work in the game itself. Of course, all of this aside, I don't think Animal Well quite deserves a lot of its (at times) ridiculous and overzealous praise. For one, many of the puzzles are extremely rudimentary ""trial-and-error"" escape room challenges. The other massive issue I had is that after solving many of these challenges, you are forced (if you want to see more content) to traipse back through.. every room. This can sometimes involve re-doing puzzle challenges, even if you've unlocked portions of rooms that were already solved or warp areas to go back to, you are still reduced to going back through every nook and cranny just to find things you missed. Billy, I don't care how many secrets you have in your game, I should not have to solve a complex algorithm of numbers and memorize movement patterns just to gain the ability to move around everywhere without having to toggle through 12 different items just to get around a room I've been to twenty separate times. That's ridiculous. The item swapping is asinine and tends to take up more of your time then necessary when most games have already solved having multiple abilities with item wheels or simplified mapping to various buttons. Your basic jumping arc is difficult to gauge maybe, and I'm being generous, here 40% of the time. Which makes it unreliable and finicky, as you often seem to be close enough to what you're jumping to, but won't always quite make it. I also felt like the movement was rather slippery and imprecise. Frisbee riding multiple times is totally possible- its just an absolute pain. I also tore my actual hair out trying to properly play the flute, since I found it weirdly picky about what was being input from 8-directions whenever I used it for some puzzles. All the amazing, mind-blowing stuff is buried beneath layers of what ""could"" have been a very good, tight three to four hour action plat-former with some cool puzzles sprinkled in. However, the excessive mind-numbing, bizarre and very impractical advanced puzzle solutions would challenge Bill Gates, much less a team of Bill Gates clones working around the clock. As clever as it is, its wasting your time in the end.. Some really gave 0 for a game not his type go to Fortnite kids this game is uniqu. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is $25! Is this a joke? It's just a mediocre puzzle game with pixel graphics, much like the 3425 other indie games released this year. Just buy Crow Country instead. Not only is it cheaper, but it also offers a unique experience unlike other generic indie games. I wish i can turn back time and take my money **** so dark my eyes hurt worst game , blurry graphics like a 80s game,after i took my eyes of the screen i saw so many lines,curse yall the high score troll user and sites. This game isn't as good as Xenoblade Chronicles. It has no character development. No good music. No good monsters. Nothing. The gameplay of animal well is not as good as animal well. Xenoblade lets shuck see into the future during combat so he can avoid death. Animal Well lacks this level of creativity. Technically, it works well. The platforming is precise. Everything else is poor. Blurry graphics, an even blurrier map, too much backtracking, weak level design, the whole game world looks the same. It’s a shame, so many poor indie game developers can’t sell their games and this happens to be the critical darling. I don’t get it.. It's now one of my favorite games like, ever. the puzzles are so goddamn clever, it had so much stuff thought out, and it's 33 MEGABYTES, it's truly amazing how ONE person did the gorgeous art, the puzzles that really stick out from different games, the amazing sound design and music, the WHOLE GAME ENGINE. after finishing everything from this game i was left amazed and already kinda sad that all of it ended, but if you were like me and starving for content i did find tunic and fez after it which give kinda the same itch.also i just want to talk about the **** reviews i found, one of them talked about ""outdated"" backtracking being ass, My brother in christ you're playing a metroidvania, also the puzzles can get a bit extreme at times, but they're still doable to some degree (except some), also **** (which is official) states that no, we did not find everything, which is interesting to say the least. tldr: i LOVE this game. Animal Well is a Metroidvania mixed with puzzles. It's very unique, beautiful and challenging. The soundtrack, effects, pixeled art and puzzles, make it a masterpiece. It is simple and well done.. I was having lots of fun till I got to the cat/wolf boss. That was either bugged or just very poorly planned and after around 20 attemptsI just gave up on the game. If it’s ever patched out to be playable, I’ll amend my review, otherwise, 20$ down the drain.. Pretty good stuff overall, I demands you pay attention to every nook and cranny as the creator of this game, singular, manages to create a world and gameplay experience that is fun and encourages you to explore long after the credits roll. My only critique was the abrupt ending which I was surprised the game finished after defeating a boss that felt more mid level than anything else.. PROOF OF GAMING REVIEW MARKETING No really, I am sick of it. I saw that this game had a 9/10 rating because that Dunkey guy was behind it or whatever and I knew right away it had inflated reviews. ... and what do you know? I played it for like 10 miinutesand was bored to tears. I came back a second time and gave it another 15 minutes and now I am pretty sure this is just an extremely mid platformer. Im sick of the review marketing around games.. What a completely pleasant surprise. Thr first thing that captures your attention are the amazing pixel graphics mixed with modern fog and transparencies. The next thing that hooks you is the gameplay. So many different and unique tools. The next thing that hooks you are all the secrets and mysteries. So, so many deep unique puzzles. It very much reminded me of Tunic in that way. A game which I also adore. If you consider yourself a true gamer this game is for you! It's truly legendary!. It's Breath of the Wild meets The Legend of Zelda: item progression meets near-boundless freedom. This is what Zelda would be if Aonuma ever had any good ideas. But for now, we have Animal Well. And it's near perfect.. Unparalleled level design and an incredible gameplay experience.When you get an item and you won't be able to fully master it for at least five hours, you'll be surprised when you realize how vividly the item interacts with the map. Well made exploration puzzle platformer. While it did have some clever vibes reminiscent of older games like Solomon's Key and Adventures of Lolo, the lack of an overall narrative or purpose beyond just solving the puzzles didn't hold my attention for longer than the first couple of hours. It feels like an expensive tech demo/pet project at the $25 asking price. I'd only consider picking it up when it's below $10 on sale.. A fantastic platformer, immediately at the top of the genre with other powerhouses like Celeste, Katana Zero, and more. A bit short, but there is a whole lot of creativity in the game mechanics, and it is an absolute treat for platformer fans. Seriously, some of the most precise and best feeling controls I have felt in a long time. People who are disliking this game probably are not playing it with a D-Pad.. If you think backtracking (excessively) is an outdated game design, then you can safely ignore this title. Also, community Puzzles / ARG are kind of ew.. Animal Well is a short game to ""beat"". It took me about 7 hours to get to the ""end"", though there are still many secrets to find. If you are only looking to roll credits you'll have a fun time, but you'll probably finish it in 2-3 sittings so keep that in mind before purchasing. As for me, I'm more than happy with that. Animal Well is the type of game that begs you to achieve 100% completion. Secrets and puzzles are perfectly laid out, always rewarding your curiosity in any direction you go. The strange creatures you cross paths with on your adventure give the world such a unique feel, always getting you to wonder just what led this place to be the way it is. Because of its atmosphere and dense map, Animal Well shines in a way few games do. Also I like the silly abilities. This may be a slight spoiler but: The game does not end after rolling credits, there is a VERY extensive post game. my rating is 88/100 Pros; + Great feeling of exploration + Unique ways of exploring in a MetroidVania + Some good puzzles + Very good feeling of eeriness. Cons; - Some secrets are downright impossible to find without the internet, it gives a Feeling Of Missing Out"" - Even finding the fast travel is extremely hard to figure out. Some of the fast travel (or travel) ways have no clue at all. It is a very good game, but I do not like relying on internet to figure out puzzles.. By far the best metroidvania I've ever played, better than SOTN, Hollow Knight ,and Super metroid to name a few. The pure sense of exploration, puzzle solving and uneasiness give the game an atmosphere that blows a majority of games I have played out of the water. The way the items and world weave together and the plentiful secrets make this game a mile wide and a mile deep. My only complaint was that the game took only 13 hours unguided to complete gathering all eggs and all major items. Although that might be for the better since the game does a good job of being a complete package and I don't know how they could have continued it past the other deeper secrets in the game.. Animal Well is a competent metroidvania that overstays its welcome and relies too heavily on cryptic puzzles for my taste, especially in the ""end game"". The game starts out as a pretty standard metroidvania. You wander around, find items that make it possible to explore more areas, rinse and repeat. This section is genuinely quite fun. The items are quite novel, and there were many interesting combinations of uses to find. During this phase of the game you will find a number of secret ""eggs"", which are the games main collectible. In true metroidvania fashion, many of these eggs will not be possible to get until you unlock more movement items, requiring you to backtrack to the item. This backtracking is par for the course for metroidvania fans, but it is more annoying than usual in this game for a couple of reasons. First, the movement of your character and the environment is very slow, even fully upgraded, making backtracking a sludge. Second, some items are locked behind finishing the game the first time, making for a lot of frustrating moments, where I couldn't understand how to get some item, only to look it up out of frustration, realizing that I needed to finish the game first. This is contrary to usual metroidvania logic, where you are compelled to finish whatever you want to before entering the final area, so it would've been nice if this change was communicated more clearly. After the first ending is when the game gets decidedly more annoying. The new items you get from beating the game require you to effectively go through every single room in the game again to find all of the ""eggs"". I personally found many of these to be very hard to find, and often come down to missing one tile on the screen or, very often, using the flute in the room. You _could_ certainly do all of this without looking up a guide, but be prepared to go into every room and use every item in it in every conceivable location, because otherwise you almost certainly will miss things. This section was annoying and I lost my enjoyment of the game at this stage. I think that all in all the first part of the game, with maybe half as many eggs would've been about the right length for me. Once you've finished the egg collectathon, strap in, because now there's a whole other tier of secrets to find. ""Bunnies"". This is where the game goes from puzzles that are frustrating and boring to ones that are so cryptic they are essentially only possible with help from the internet. I don't like these sorts of things in games because they drive artificial hype from people finding things out on the internet and sharing ideas, but actually solving the puzzle doesn't feel very rewarding, since for almost all of them you aren't actually able to solve it yourself. Now, this wouldn't be so bad on its own, but those super puzzles bleed into the rest of the game so that I ended up spending a lot of time trying to solve these cryptic super puzzles, only to realize that they were not really meant to be solvable and weren't for the eggs I was now in the business of collecting. So, on a whole, there is a decent metroidvania here, but I would recommend just putting it down after the first set of credits, as everything that comes after that is just too frustrating and tedious to enjoy.. Absolutely masterfully crafted mysterious puzzle metroidvania. Surprise hit if the year and the best game so far. What a treat for Metroidvania fans!. If you're some miserable basic gamer who only enjoys playing CoD then this game will not be for you. There was a lot of hype for this game based on Dunkey promoting it with videos so inevitably, people who don't enjoy this kind of game are going to buy it not knowing what they're getting into. The game is great, it's a fun metroid-vania-like game with lots of puzzles but it's not a hand-holding game so it you don't have the brain or patience to figure things out for yourself then this will likely just frustrate you enough to leave a bad review. There are multiply layers to this game - the first level which gets you to the first ending will take 5-7 hours, the second level could take considerably longer depending on how much you try to solve yourself. The third layer is/was a community effort and would not have been solvable on your own, just lending to the amount of secrets and hidden things in this game. I wouldn't call this a 10/10 game, likely the people who are were involved in the initial solving of the third level and those kind of experiences can't really be replicated once they're found. The game has nice ambient music, classic/retro feel with 8-bit graphics and well-thought out puzzles. The number of times I tried to exploit some of the mechanics of the items you have only to find that the developer had accounted for that made me laugh. It's obvious that this was a labor of love. That being said, there's no combat like one would expect in a classic metroid-vania and while it did not need it to be a fun and engaging game, it's hard not to compare it to games like Hollow Knight or Classic Metroid and Castlevania titles. Still, not even considering that the entire game was developed by one man, it still stands up as a great entry. I would have preferred that he add some harder to get prestige achievements though as you can full achievement/trophy this game by the second ending.. Awesome couple of first hours. But after that, it turns into a mess, where you do from place to place unsure what to do. Made me look up a solution couple of times (i really hate that) and the solution was sometimes utterly stupid. I am not sure I will be able nor want to finish the game.. Beautiful game with an amazing atmosphere and some decent puzzles. However, as the difficulty ramps up near the end, the game goes from clever and fun to being overly fiddly and extremely frustrating. By the time I finished the first ending I basically had enough. Also a bug where an item was picked up during the credits but did not end up in my inventory essentially stopped me from playing the game any further. If you like metroidvania's and games where you die over and over to complete a difficult objective (think Elden Ring) then you will love this game, otherwise I would be wary.. This is a glorified screensaver. There is no objective, too many places to go from the start and there is nothing happening in any of those room aside from some minor puzzles. The controllers are horrible and imprecise. Eventually I learned it's from a youtuber and now it makes sense the brainless supporters giving this a good score.. Nice Art and Gameplay, with Mood holding all together, just a fun nice treat to play, short and sweet. I finish it by accident because I was lost in it.. A game full of secrets and with a unique style. I usually don't like Metroidvanias but this one got me hooked. Only criticism is the sometimes annoying backtracking, but if you mark stuff on the Map its not bad at all. Can't wait for the Developers next game!. Best game since Cubivore for the gamecube. Even has a Capybara on it... God damn.. I'm not a fan of Metroidvania. Never have been and I thought I never would be. Before the review, I will say that although I am a huge Dunkey fan, I am eliminating every shred of bias I can from this review, and the score. As far as graphics go, there are few 2D Pixel games like this. Every enemy just pops out of the screen and is so visible. The beautiful environments with beautiful lighting, all in 2D pixels btw, are so mesmerizing and never get old throughout the game. There is a decent variety of different environments, all with their own tile sets, lighting, and atmosphere. The enemies and animals you find always seem to match where you are. There are a good amount of secrets in the game, but you will probably need a guide if you want to find some of them (the medals, and what to do with them as an example). Now a game could have great graphics and a large amount of bonus content and still be ass. This isn't that. Each puzzle feels fresh, and the more tools you get, the more ways you can solve it. Some tools feel like outright cheating at certain points. As many have pointed out, there is no combat, at all. The tools you get are solely utility. However, the boss fights still feel pretty organic and are fun (even though some are short). Everything in this game was fostered with a creativity that 99% of triple-A studios can't get right. Animal Well is a short game. I beat it in one day, after completely exploring every panel on the map. It keeps itself in check and doesn't drag out tedious puzzles longer than they have to be. It's also not oversaturated to the point you get bored. In my opinion, it's the perfect length for a game like this. Overall, it's like Halo 2 meets Halo 3.. First: Forget the low reviews. So..Animal Well is something between Celeste and Hollow Knight in an simpler way. U can explore cozy like Metroidvania world. The puzzles difficulty is balanced and the secrets (+Endgame content) is insanely smart. If u like an short Metroidvania with fascinating atmosphere, beautiful puzzles and a really good endgame u can play it. In animal well. (trust my.I'm not only here cause of dunkey. I love this game really for the ideas it has). What a refreshing title. While the graphics are simplistic they still are capable of bringing a sense of wonder while you explore this animalistic fever dream. The puzzles are fun, and finding little hidden things in the background make each screen fun to look at! The controls are tight and that's all that needs to be said. I feel like this is a must play.. There truly are animals in the well ...It not only succeeds at being a really good puzzle metroidvania, but also at being a secret filled experience like tunic and such. The well goes deeper and deeper.. Wastes your time. Why do you need to collect fireworks and if that’s the case maybe make them respawn so that I don’t have to waste my limited gaming time. Why does the game not auto save? It’s 2024. Why do I need to start 5km away from where I was if I died…. Why does the game have a pause button, but when you look at the map the game doesn’t pause? It makes a certain cat puzzle nearly impossible to beat unless you memorize the map. Did this game receive any actual testing or was it just dunkey? All of these issues would have been pointed out by any QA team. This game is like Halo 2 meets Halo 3. It has a little something for everybody. I am not a gamer. I have been a fan of Dunkey for so long that I bought that game mostly to give him some credit. Hearing him talking **** about other games, and his ""compilations"" of bugs and glitches, and his appraisel for this game, I was looking forward to play it. I never play games. Played some League, some AOE2, but mostly chess. This game is such a disappointment. I do not see what every body is excited about. Honestly. I play this game on keyboard, and it is abysmal. Not beeing able to adjust the settings yourself, is such a weak slip up. I would have guessed that Dunkey would be the first one to point it out. So I jump with space, use arrow keys for controlls. Have x,c,v,z and 1, 3 for adjusting stuff, and as I have not an english keyboard, I use y for z. It ****. It really does. The puzzles are incredibly easy. The art style is beautiful, but I feel everybody is like ""It is 8-bit graphics, so it must be a work of art"". Like come on, besides some nice graphics (the fireworks for example) this game does not even look THAT good. Everything looks the same. And everything in this game takes so god damn long. Again, listening to dunkey **** on games for so long, I thought that this must be the greatest game ever made or something like that. Everything is easy, to a point where it feels like making it hard is just resetting you a bunch of times so you have to do it again. Then there are people that claim that this game is full of secrets. It is not. It does not feel like it. I have watched others playing it, and I do not make anything different. I am almost 4 hours in, and I have lost complete interest. Most of the time I pick this game up,I am 20 minutes later either bored, or annoyed by the game. I also agree that 25 bucks is not justified. Sorry dunkey, you blew it. :(. A puzzle game disguised as a Metroidvania. I'm sure most people are attracted to this game because they think it will be the latest indie hit in the Metroidvania genre, but it's not. It's just a mediocre puzzle game that includes backtracking to make the game longer than it actually is. This game isn't worth $25 at all. I recommend waiting for its price to drop below $10 if you're into puzzle games.. Beautiful artstyle, clever puzzle design, immersive sound design and packed with secrets in every corner. A true masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A genuine masterpiece. I’ve always longed for a Metroidvania like this, where the tools are flexible and have multiple, varied uses—and",a beautiful soundboard compliments the dark and peaceful visuals . the lack of story and music really dragged the whole experience down for me . it's cute enough and fun to explore but the lack of story and music really dragged the whole experience down .
261.Disco Elysium,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As good as gaming gets. Strange, beautiful, engaging and painful. Does an amazing job of bringing you into its world.. Disco Elysium is more than a game Disco Elysium is a unique detective game where you live the life of an amnesiac alcoholic, investigate a murder and make moral choices that determine everything. The game is like a book, where every day is a new chapter, and the characters come to life thanks to their vivid characters and unforgettable dialogues. The world is filled with details: from key items and weapons to the little things that affect the development of the plot. You are given complete freedom to be whoever you want to be, make decisions and build your character. This game is suitable for those who want to feel the atmosphere of a real detective, dive into a deep story and feel responsibility for every choice.. Hardcore, hardcore to the mega! This is the closest we got to Planescape: Torment in decades. Fantastic world building, story, art and music. It’s a click & read type game, no fluid gameplay and even years after release, there are still many technical glitches, so it’s definitely not for everyone, but if you give it a shot it will reward you with extremely unique experience and atmosphere that you won’t forget. 9/10. This is easily the best Story-driven RPG so far (2014). + Story is a political and psychological masterpiece + Fantastic Soundtrack and Atmosphere + Good Art-Design + Impactful Decisions - Minor way-finding errors on PC. no Coop. meh, overrated Reddit TM game, just your regular modern day slop, nothing innovative and boring gameplay. SMH. If reading a nihilistic ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" linear story (only one ending) written by self-described communists wherein you play as a godless alcoholic who has no self-control is your idea of fun... go ahead.. Almost 50 hours of playtime, in which 90% (or potentially more) of gameplay is basically just dialogue. If it sounds boring or you just don't like reading (though there is voice acting) i'd still strongly suggest giving it a shot. The writing in this game is beyond impressive. Close to perfection. A masterpiece which is best to explore as blindly as possible. If you are planning to play it anyway, dont look up anything,experience it yourself. Its baffling to me how captivating the story is and how the ""gameplay"" just flows. Multiple times during the first playthrough i found myself sitting there for hours basically just talking to people. An entire dialogue can take up to 20-30 minutes even and at the end of each conversation it leaves you with clue or an idea which you wanna find out more about. If you're up for an epic, incredibly humorous, adventure in this detective role playing game with incredible storytelling, characters, worldbuilding, soundtrack and art direction i beg you, at the very least, give it a try.. I hate to rate anything a ten, but this is a ten. I don't even think this game is for everyone, but it is near perfection for the people who get to fall in love with it. Pretty much, if you're a big weird book nerd, you're going to have an experience you've never gotten anywhere else and may never again (thanks to some very East European corporate skullduggery that mirrors the games plot). Give it a shot. It will either hook you or throw you back.. this is one of my favourite games and I've never played a game with better writing. I have however played many many games with better gameplay. I'd like to rate this higher but I can't pretend it's not a slog. i had to use online guides to progress the story. maybe im dumb idk. other than that its great.. If you're the type who likes to read to a lot of text heavy dialogue and listen to voice narratives, then this game is right up your alley. Be forewarned that Disco Elysium is not for everyone. It's a story-driven and text-heavy game that's filled with ultra-left and ultra-right wing socialist philosophies and political jargon. But regardless of your ideologies, you should have a fun time deciding where your character leans on the spectrum. Each day in the game runs on real-world time depending on the tasks you do. You'll often find yourself reading a lot of ncp dialogue and then choosing the best responses. Different aspects of your character's mind and personality will also intervene and converse with you. The dialogue choices you make will largely impact the pacing, progression, and future consequences, in the game. Some of the dialogue will require skill checks (e.g., logic, persuasion, strength). And passing those checks will give you an edge in your detective work. The more upgrade points you put into a specific skill, the better your chances at each dice roll. Again, this game is a hit or miss. Although I personally enjoy story-driven narratives where I get to read a lot and choose the responses that fit my moral compass, there was just TOO MUCH to read and not much to explore. Talking to npcs felt like reading a chapter of a textbook. I often found myself skipping some of the socio-political, economic, and racial dialogue that was presented. Some of the terms, concepts, and ideas were simply too complicated to understand for someone with no background in far-right and far-left socio-economic ideas. Though I enjoyed reading about this fictional world, I skipped many dialogue passages that seemed like they were taken straight out of a Marxist textbook. You read a lot about these places and people, but you never really go there. The game tries to build the world around you through text and voice narrative. And that can seem boring if you're only limited to exploring one small area within that world. So you never get to really reinforce that information in your head. Overall, I think the game deserves merit for its compelling story and in-depth world building.. This is not a game. It's a text simulator filled with pseudo intellectual trash that doesn't make sense. It reads like a college freshman in a sociology class' essay. I suppose if you are into that you can play this and feel ""smart"". Seriously. You click around and read text that's poorly written. That's it.. Absolute masterpiece. Unique setting, memorable characters, awesome voice acting, story that is full of twists and turns. Be who you want to be. Super cop or Sorry Cop?. First of all, it's not an rpg. Second, it's not a good game as a quest either. There are no interesting characters or plot. Literally none of the choices are thought-provoking. The only good thing about this game is its interesting original visual style. But even it's basically just a recolor from a bunch of other similar quests. Unpredictable. This experience will never have again. Epic adventure with its music, story and small details.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Oh I love RPGs with a lot of text! - I thought and sat down to play this game. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Lots of text, zero meaning. Brain gum for pseudo-intellectuals. Moreover, this is not an RPG. This is one long drawn out quest. Like one from Skyrim where you have to track down a maniac in Windhelm, you know =) And there is absolutely no RPG component here. You can't create a character. And even the characteristics don’t affect anything (otherwise why are the “stupid” character’s lines NOT different from the other 2 branches? You can’t choose normal options in dialogues, because they simply don’t exist, and those that exist don’t affect anything (try not to wake up in the first dialogue, for example). But there will be a bunch of texts about what to do with material things. WHAT IS THIS, A TEXT SIMS??? The characters are worthless, there is literally no empathy for anyone, because they are just only cardboards - decorations for the riots and tomfoolery of the main character. By the way, the humor here is also bad. The level of marginal drunks. The setting is certainly unusual, but damn, even in The Wolf Among Us there are more plot RPG elements. The only thing I can praise Disco for is that it’s interesting an original avant-garde visual. This is where its merits end. truly incredible. just play it. Woke commie propaganda. There is a lot of potential hidden deep within this text-based game, but you'll have to figure it all out yourself, as there is no hand holding. You'll make decisions based on RNG which can severely handicap your runs, and you can just simply die at times due to poor decision making. Not really my cup of tea, but I understand why it's so highly rated.. An absolutely unforgettable story. Perfect game for me, no bugs. The multitude of choices is phenomenal.. Disco Elysium reminds us the beauty of good and classic RPG, the nearest example of a video game trying to offering the same experience of a board game. The most exciting thing about the work of ZA/UM is the continuous sense that every our action or choice will influence the world around us. The objects to interact with, the characters to talk to, the place to explore are overwhelming, maybe, sometimes, in a little tiresome way. Despite this, Disco Elysium remains a unique experience, entirely based on what you are, as a person and as real human being, because, in front of this story of despairing hope, all of us react in a different manner.. I played the game and it was definitely one of the worst and boring games I've ever seen and I deleted it. It's not a game, it's more like an e-book. First of all, this is not an open world game. I have no idea how it can be marketed like this, have the makers ever seen an open world game? The NPCs do nothing but sleep at night and the world is a small and frankly empty map. It's static and dead and never changes. It's not even a world, let alone an open world. It's not a real RPG either. Yes, you have stats and inventory and dice rolls, but that's it. Also, these are just game mechanics, there's a skill tree and inventory like in a lot of games, but they don't make a game an RPG game, and there's no real choice, because the whole difference is tied to dialog options, which you'll click on anyway, further destroying the role-playing part, and for a lot of things, choosing to do something will actually be a dice roll, and the mechanics of retrying the roll are overly complicated and too overwhelming to take the time. No matter what you do, you'll be dragged towards a single ending, which makes sense since it's a murder mystery, but as a player you have no choice, the only real choice is at the character creation screen, and from that point on it's pretty much set how you're going to play the next 30-40 hours of the game, which is filled with dialog just to drag it out. Yes, you can click on options in dialog windows, but the game will decide for you whether that happens or not, and it will mostly depend on your character's stats and some modifiers. Yes, again, it's an RPG mechanic, but as a player, you don't really get to choose anything or do anything. An example **** where your choices really matter would be Detroit Become Human. Or even Witcher 3. Disco Elysium is nowhere near that level, Detroit is already not an RPG game, Witcher 3 is not a pure RPG, but supposedly Disco Elysium was marketed as open world and a pure RPG, but it's not even half as successful as those games. In short, Disco Elysium is not a game to be played even if it's free. I never understood what they liked about this game. It is one of the most overrated games of recent years.. True rpg. Real masterpiece and best game of the all time. Everyone just must play it.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Unique Vibe I have never see. Unforgetable experience. But not A game. The ending is binded beforehand. U can decide nothing. and Still have many bug in 2022.. Disco Elysium captivated me from the moment it started. it's a very deep game in how it play and the options it gives you. I like the fact that while you have options to do things that would seem ""objectively"" good they're still warped by the twisted perspective of reality your character has. it's a masterclass way of telling a story and specifically the story of this character. The voice-acting is amazing. every feeling, every thought is voiced and has its own personality. it's amazingly done. the music accompanies you with beautiful and haunting melodies throughout and it is etched in my mind alongside some of the voices I heard during my playthrough. This game stirred some questions and reflections in me like no other. I absolutely love this game and think it's one of the best RP games to have been made. Highly recommend it.. Best game ever made. That's painfull that we wont ever get second chapter. End of discussion.. I enjoyed every second of Disco Elysium. Unlike everything Ive ever played, a better description of this would be an interactive novel. The writing is clearly the star of the show, the vivid imagery and attention to detail make you feel like youre in war-torn Revachol. Every last character has depth and plays an important role in the story. I felt like a kid in a candy store watching the brilliant story unfold and tie in events that I once thought insignificant. No matter where you go or who you talk to in Revachol, whether it be the fishing village, the harbor, or the whirl-in-rags, you can feel the tension and the toll the revolution has taken. The pacing is also amazing; despite the game taking place on a relatively small map, new sections or characters are introduced at just the right times. I also loved how the dialogue checks were based on probability, so no matter what you decided to put your skill points in to you always had a chance of succeeding. Overall, this is a very special game and I will be replaying it multiple times over the course of my lifetime.. One of the best games with beautiful atmosphere and characters. Just fascinating.. Among my favorite games ever. The writing is incredible, on another level completely. It's witty and funny and emotional, the characters are so well-realized. Revachol is so well realized and so well presented that it feels almost real. The weight of its history hangs heavy over the story and characters. The Streets skill is mandatory IMO. Upgrade and ""level up"" system is revolutionary for RPGs, the way it changes what information is presented to you, and how it can even midguide you, is brilliant. Soundtrack and art design out of this world.. The game i'd choose to play last time before i die. Masterpiece of art. Treasure.. Best game ever, loved it. All it's character are so deep and we'll written.. I enjoyed this game a lot. You can tell the devs were inspired by Planescape: Torment. Disco Elysium has no combat, though, so it looks like a CRPG but plays more like a point and click adventure.. A crpg with a couple books worth of incredibly well written dialogue, narration, and description. The game isn't a book though, it uses the decisions you make and the way you engage with the world in a way that actually fits with games. It's a game that feels extremely real and reactive. Every time I start I play it for a couple hours and reignite my love and passion for staying alive, and I go to bed satisfied. The emotional impact of this game is unparalleled.. easiest 10 of my life. the voice acting itself is a 12 and it's based too? awesome.. it's masterpiece disguised as a video game. different decision different outcomes.. Dear me, some people haven't done their research before buying again. Obviously it isn't for everyone. I got it cheap in the sales and I have to say if I'd have paid full price my score would be 8 not 9 because the game is rather short. There is some replayabilty but not a great deal. I found it hypnotic, engrossing and very funny in parts. The writing is first class and the art eye-catching. The skills that you can acquire are intriguing and fresh and the story is very well told. Most of the politics can be avoided if you wish and save scumming is definitely not required to enjoy the game. I have minor gripes about the plot and the GUI needs some polish but overall a great experience.. The only explanation for reviewers giving this game 9/10 or more, is that they never played the classic text-based adventure games from the previous decades, and they thought this game is incredibly original. Admittedly, for a indie game developer came out of nowhere, this game is an impressive achievement, so it still deserves a positive review and might be greatly enjoyed by many. Some of the characters and quests are memorable, and the amount of fed-ex subplots is not quite zero (i.e. go to check those traps again...) but luckily still it is minimal. This said however, I find that the game has a number of crucial flaws. 1) As other reviews have pointed out, the wall of text is always pretentious and unnecessary, a good 2/3 could have been cut out; 2) The skill check system, which has been designed to make the story flow, often obtains the opposite outcome and forces you to save constantly; 3) The dialogue workflow, although quite clever overall, is far from perfect and sometimes doesn't fit with what you have progressed in the story so it makes you wonder why some reviews scored this as a 10 as it's objectively not perfectly done; 4) The clothes system to increase stats is very time wasting and boring. Although I have fulfilled most of the plots, the majority of my skills had still 0 points assigned, which forces you to constantly swap the clothes and scroll several lines of them at some point - unless you memorize their associations with the skills which sounded quite stretched to me so not really that obvious. 5) The controls are a little clunky - again not a huge problem and not too different from the majority of these kind of games, but still not the masterpiece many claim this game is. Finally, a personal subjective comment, I was not a fan of the political tone of the whole game, which will only appeal to a leftist - a radical one even, but this is not an objective issue with the game. Admittedly, it does fit quite well with the general feel of the game, but still it seems to regularly take hits at people who think free market and law have a place in society, and also made the plot development to me at least quite predictable.. My favorite RPG of all time. The game has an enthralling atmosphere with a very distinct visual style. The narrative is written as perfectly as it could be, with a whole authentic setting behind it (not too important for the gameplay itself but still something nice). The game could be described as an isometric point-and-click detective game where you run around doing stuff where neither you nor your character will know how it will end up. Also has a very satisfying exploration.. This game is amazing with top notch writing, characters and voice acting. I like that characters have plenty of good unique dialogue as I have played an RPG where you wasted time talking to anyone and everyone to find quests and alot of the NPC's would have some repetitive useless remark, small talk or comment that was the same as the other person. This game is amazing that there is so much unique, good dialogue. I mostly enjoyed playing it , but there were times I felt it dribbled on and bored me especially the political stuff as I dislike political stuff and have no idea about any of it so just select an answer even though I am not sure what it is, so at times Iam as confused and feel as lost as the main character. I have also made a few choices I wasn't happy with and found out I missed out on some things but didn't reload as I feel that is just being authentic and showing that me and the main character(I wont say his name as I don't wish to spoil anything for others)aren't perfect and are your typical flawed human that makes mistakes and life is never perfect so I will choose to reflect that. The game did sometimes crash for me so it's imperative to have multiple saves and to quick save often. Even so I consider this game a must play for those who love RPG's, adventure games and a good story.. One of the best RPGs of all time. Fun to play, gorgeous to look at, mesmerizing to hear. A true work of art.. This game is incredibly tiring, I deleted her after 3 hours of playing. There was no strength to endure the endless stream of meaningless text.. Fantastic Game! A detective novel with a lot of role-playing elements. Amazing dialogs, voice acting and amazing plot.. This game is highly overrated... yes there is a great atmosphere, dialogs are interesting and most caracters are complex, but overall the game is boring because burden with tons of text to read, too many inconsistencies in puzzles. There is a deep sense of being highly constrained in this game and unbearable loading times. A very niche game. Unless you are a hardcore rpg player don't buy this game. Many SF/dystopic books provide a similar but greater experience. an outstanding mashup of rpgs and visual novels, with a genius-level writing but with a lot of luck involved, that may be kind of annoying, as it hides part of the content of the game from you. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. More an adventure than a RPG. More a book than a game. Good game but highly overrated. Check it before buying/playing. Be ready to read a lot. What is advertised garbage? I expected an RPG with the possibility of choices and consequences, karma and so on. Not only is the plot here very average, but here it turns out that the game is just a visual novel and point and click. Terrible.. Have you ever been in trouble because of the voices in your head? The biggest mystery in this bizarre adventure will not be the man who murdered; it will be your identity crysis. In Disco Elysium, even tho our protagonist finds himself in a macabre and perplexing tale; you will guide him to discover himself. While chasing the truth in this unique world, you will find yourself in the middle of the loneliness and despair of modern times.. Absolutely great game. Brilliantly written, this is just pure poetry. Brilliantly designed world. The quintessence of an RPG game. You can create your character however you like, you can be whoever you want. There are no bad builds in this game. Great story and characters, dialogues are godlike. Very good and engaging main story and many optional things to do. This is one of the best games in recent years.. This is a good game. If you like the read books you will enjoy too much in this game. You can choose too many things in this game and it effects everything.. Battleless, extreme conversation-oriented game There are a lot of words that are hard to write in conversation I often don't understand what you mean because of the worldview of the developer's creation But I like it. Outstanding example of storytelling, one of the best since Planescape: Torment.. To me this is the perfect game. A narrative that matters and choices that have an effect on the plot. It's what I want most out of gaming. Some of the circumstances are unforgettable. In what other game can you pretend to accept a racial supremacy ideology to trick a nationalist bodyguard into sneaking past him to swindle his mafia union organizer boss?. Awesome. The great game standing with games like Fallout - cRPGs. It treats the player like a reader. Someone can dislike it. However I *love* this. It is not a cinema kind of games. Your сhoices clearly defnies you as a player, and a *human*. “People in Jackets Killed Disco” I hope we will never see the sequel of the game without the main ideologues. Life-changing. i'm sad to hear about ZA/UM essentially losing the game's lead creators, the author of the book in which the world was inspired is filing a lawsuit, and just about everything else. Even if the small chance of a Disco Elysium 2 being real, I do hope it holds up to this one. So we have to appreciate the game as it is right now. Which is good. Veeery good. The RPG elements are a bit BS at times, and I wish the dialogue was a bit more ""closed"" so the character of Harry could be more consistent throughout the game. There were times other characters pointed traits about my character that I wasn't even aiming for, which disconnect me for a bit. But it was very rare. The world is beautiful. With the sheer amount of characters and dialogue, you would expect to forget some and get bored at some point. And i never did. Everyone stands out and complements each other at the same time. It's amazing writing, and thought provoking. Def one of my favorites of all time. HARDCORE TO THE MEGA!. amazing rpg amazing driven story atmosphere and narrative just brilliant 10/10. Cool developers, and a pretty cool game to boot. It's a real shame that ZA/UM was basically hijacked and sabotaged from the inside, I do not think I would feel comfortable giving whoever controls the company any more money now. I oppose imperialist capitalist conquests that hurt the developer.. It's just a wonderful game, especially for people who prefer the RPG genre. If you start playing Disco Elysium, then, first of all, what you will feel will be incredibly exciting thanks to the dialogues and great voice acting, and the rich visual design will add, and the style will add its exoticism. But the more you play, the more you will feel attached to the main character and his partner, as well as to the rest of the characters. And the most important thing is that you will feel this similarity with your character in almost everything. The story is created so that you create your character literally from scratch, complementing his human qualities in parts, and the more you do this, the more you create yourself, especially during the first passage of the game. It's just great! But, as in any game, Disco Elysium has its drawbacks. For people who find it difficult to perceive such a large amount of text, and the game consists of text and voice acting, it will be very difficult for such people to play and have to pause, and a very measured and slow gameplay is not suitable for everyone. In addition, despite the apparent variability and the RPG prefix, you can lose this fine line by playing similar games of this genre. You always have preferences, and even if you want to play the game honestly, sooner or later you will use the game download at the right moments, because the dice are not always on your side, and you always want to know what will happen next. But if you are ready to put up with the listed problems, then this is exactly what you need!. Played only 30 min and stopped. All the hype got me buying this from sale for 10 bucks. I'd like to have my money back. So boring. Everybody calls this a masterpiece but i don't see it. At all. Got nothing good to say about this.. It is one of the most unique games I ever played, one of the best too. If you like videogames and enjoy reading or listening to books this is *the* game for you. The story is great, the setting is amazing, characters are well written, the gameplay made me forget who I am. I wish more people knew about this game.. For someone not known for finishing games, and who often doesn't have the patience for deep and involved story arcs, this game came as a real surprise to me. Not sure what made me take the plunge, perhaps it was the gritty but strangely beautiful art style? Perhaps a gripping trailer? I can't recall. But I'm glad I did. I was hooked from beginning to end. The writing and characters are deep and memorable, the setting and world absolutely captivating. A story full of twists, turns, while running the full gamut of emotion. This is one of those games that leaves a real mark on you. Coming across this type of experience is a rare and beautiful thing. I can imagine that the weirdness might not be for everyone. It's truly off the wall. But my experience was so incredibly positive with this game I can't help but gush when unconditionally recommending it to anyone that will listen. Do yourself a favor. Dive in.. You can't explain what is Disco Elysium in 500 characters. The game takes place in a rather small place, yet the conversations expand the world so much you know, there is a whole world arround you without stepping in on it. Voice actors are good, the story is so mundane (In the best possible way), and every character is carefully crafted. I fell in love with this strange love and madness, what disco elysium is. Buy it!. Poetry in motion. There are no other games like that one, because it replicates an actual tabletop RPG experience.. Disco Elysium is a unique game with the attention it gives to even the smallest details. A game that deserves to be played with the dice mechanics that desktop RPG players know, and with really interesting and lovable characters. Fantastic, surpassing everything I expected. It's well-written, with beautiful and intricate art assets, and a deep and interesting setting. I suspect it has at least two or three replays worth of content. An amazing return to isometric RPGs, too... and there's not really an actual combat system. I just forgot it 'needed' one along the way, that caught up into it. The soundtrack is spectacular, forlorn and beautiful. The music sells the eerie, depressing bleak but beautiful setting. The voice acting is great, and even the sound design is pretty great, all in all a delight to ear. The story and content narrows as the game nears the end, I'm sure I had interacted with most everyone in Revachol by the 4th day, and most of the content by the 5th. Maybe one more unlockable section, and some more to do would have helped, for me anyway. It becomes quite linear, too. I understand it isn't a big studio, and you have to wrap up a story (especially one which can adapt to successes and failures). This might be the first game that I consider to be 'art', whatever that means today. Also, if they adapt it right, it might also be the only video game to transcend the impossible video game movie* barrier, without being incredibly campy/tongue in cheek or a guilty pleasure. *(Yes, I know the adaptation is going to be a 'TV show', but movies have lost the mandate of heaven for years now, unfortunately.). Don't look at any score. Numbers can't describe how unique this game is. Someone will love, someone won't understand. Someone will hate. For me this one will stay as one of the best games i've ever played.. Masterpiece 10/10. It has the best plot and dialogues of all videogame history probably. A truly gem nowadays where the characters has real CHARISMA, and you end loving them. Not like the modern games that only have graphics but the story and characters are soulless. I hope they release more and more games based on Disco Elysium universe! Good job devs!!. getting 100 from every critic is a big sus. no way this game is 1st game of all time. There are enough excellent sentences written in Disco Elysium script, no need to add anything to it. Stop reading this review and go play this gem!. Probably best written game I had the pleasure to play, for that alone I give it 9.. I created an account just to express my most transparent opinion about this game. So here goes. This game and it’s farcical review campaign are one of the biggest scams I’ve seen in gaming. This is one of — if not the most — boring, slow, convoluted, meaningless adventure games I have ever spent 20+ hours playing. Uninspired choices, dull plot lines, literally the worst in my 40 years of adventure game experience. And frankly, after reviewing so very many hyper-positive reviews about this game, I am convinced that a moderately large-scale review campaign was conducted by the developers to whitewash this stinker to glory. Particularly when nearly all of those reviews read in the most generic of nomenclature. Which is the biggest tell of all. I very much resent that I was duped into putting down my forty dollars for it, but, I’v","disco elysium is a detective game where you live the life of an amnesiac alcoholic . 90% of gameplay is basically just dialogue . the game is suitable for those who want to feel the atmosphere of a real detective . it's a click & read type game, no fluid gameplay and years after release, there are still many technical glitches ."
263.The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,"This game walked so open world Zelda could run. Although I still prefer this over what open world Zelda became.. This games gimmick are really clever, the dungeons are amazing and the music slaps. My favs are The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Relax Gaming slot Ancient Tumble and The Aviator slot, that's because I follow DiceGirl Egle, she helps a lot with slot games, I also love to play Pokemon go! I feel like Ash Ketchum with my pokemons haha. Great game with cool new ideas for the time! This is a must play if you own a 3DS!. The first two hours are slow and couldn' catch my interest but after that I had so Much fun.. I don't know why this isn't higher, this game is GREAT. The mechanics are fun, and I really liked the dark mirror of Hyrule, that being Lorule. The story was fun, and being like the predecessor, A Link To The Past, it had all of the classics bosses in 3D, which I think was pretty good, and the puzzles had bit of a challenge, like the one where you had to blow up a few boulders with the Big Bomb Flower. This might be one of the best Legend Of Zelda games I have played, and it was definitely better than the original game on the SNES. This game is better than the original (it's an improved remake of A Link to the Past). Here the main idea of the game is to change into paint to solve puzzles and advance in the plot. Hyrule and Lorule are both fun to explore.. This Game Is A Fun Romp, Surpisingly good story, Nothing Super Special Though. Best bird perspective Zelda game made for sure a big, big recommendation for this one. I love my reviews, so simple.. this is my fverit mmy litl pony game and hear is random leters djkshfhbfchjsgv. Best ""2D"" zelda game and 2nd best Zelda game of all time. Very entertaining from start to finish. Merge, equipment renting and world shifting are amazing ideas. Tackling the dungeons in your preferred order further enhances its sandbox gameplay. Also it has the best dungeons in the series. Only minor complain that the game is very easy and gets even easier as you progress. 10/10. It brings a new breeze to the Zelda series. Inheriting the best of ALttP including the music.. A Link Between Worlds is easily one of the best sequels to a Zelda game since Majora's Mask. Not only did it add more character, charm, world building, and personality, but gave us a system that we never really had in a Zelda game before, the ability to choose which weapons and dungeons we want to tackle first. With such an inventive mechanic of renting items, and later being able to purchase them gives the player the freedom to go where they want first as well as provides a challenge in the punishment that is a game over. You have a lot more at risk than just progress if you die in a dungeon, and it can lend itself pretty well into some pretty intense moments. Add this factor to the other new inventive mechanic that is wall clinging, and you have such a wide range of movement for yourself that it feels like movement is only a hindrance by your imagination. There are a few problems that arise with Link Between Worlds however, as with the ability to choose any dungeon usually meant that each dungeon tended to get scaled down a lot compared to the older games, and there never seemed to any real arise in difficulty. Still Link Between Worlds manages to surpass it's predecessor by simply proving a better experience, and one that meets with a pleasant twist at the end.. One of the best 2D Zelda's ever made. Has some of the best puzzles and ideas from the series in it.. Finally a newer Zelda game that didnt disappoint, this game did a great job bringing back the magic of the old school Zelda games like A Link to the Past. One of the best in my opinion.. It's pretty great, a good portable zelda game and a really fun sequel to one of the best games in the series.. Mid at best. Art style is undoubtedly great, but its just another top down Zelda game that has one new gimmick. Forgettable, simplistic story and ""puzzles"" that are tedious than entertaining. If you want to know how engaging this is, try to stop playing it for a while then come back. You won't want to continue and won't remember a thing about it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awesome game, worth every penny I spent. I love the ability to choose which dungeons you want to tackle first with the item renting service and the short but sweet story. edit: just a couple hours after initially making this review, I've decided to change it from 9 to 10. I love the puzzles with their infinitely creative solutions and beautiful designs and themes. I love how the game looks, sounds and feels, with amazing atmosphere and the classic Zelda experience, with a more modern twist.. My favorite game franchise of all time, more a fan of the 3d ones but this one and a Link to the Past really please me. Love the wall merge painting mechanics and soundtrack is perfect (like every Zelda game).. Basically a remake version to link to the past. Combat is great with lots of news items such as the fire and ice staff. The dungeons are also great, my favourite dungeon is either the thieves hideout dungeon or the shadow dungeon (the dark one). The open world is also great especially exploring the differences between the light and dark world. The arena on the mountain was also really fun as well. All boss fights were great and I love how you can upgrade the master sword with special ores. Overall an amazing game that got all the basics right.. In my top 5 games ever played. A golden standard for all Zelda games to strive for. A beautiful return to 2.5D gameplay with a perfect execution of exploration, dungeon design, and progression.. A Link between words, the mentally successor of ""A link to the past"", is a masterpiece of a Zelda game. The dungeons are very different and the game reintroduce some of the greatest Zelda ideas, like the Escort-Dungeons in Wind Waker and it has many nostalgic moments and allusions of older games. At the same time, the game has so many unique and new ideas and mechanics. Wonderful And the game has for me more a ""golden thread"" as the mentally predecessor. 9/10 - 2D Zelda in excellence. A very well-made retelling of an original legend, A Link Between Worlds is the best modern 2D Zelda game. It's simple but effective - the dungeons are intelligently and distinctly designed, the plot and concept are straightforward yet engaging, and the overall pacing makes the game very enjoyable. my first Zelda game and has been in my top three Zeldas ever since. I really loved this game. Great graphics, storyline and controls. I really liked that you could choose in which order you wanted to complete the dungeons and you could exchange your things as you wanted and you didn't need to collect arrows etc.. This game is an greatly sufficient way to play A Link to the Past. The story is different and there are some new mechanics and all dungeons are different but the map is the same. So I believe it's a better version that isn't aged and with way more content and newly added mechanics, as well as the 3D aspect. In general, it has great dungeons, an amazing map to explore and smart dungeons and puzzles to solve. Also, the artstyle and the soundtrack are just great. Must play for the Nintendo 3DS.. an amazing game with the footprint of a link to the past but with its unique differences a wonderful game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Zelda hand-held title that not only piggy-backs off the setting of “A Link to the Past”, but builds on it with enough new twists that make it its own. It’s still the tried and starting-to-get-tiresome top-down Zelda experience.. A Link Between Worlds is a fantastic entry in the Zelda handheld series. What began life as a remake of the greatest Zelda game ever made, A Link to the Past, turned into a full fledged sequel. Because of this it does utilize basically the same map as its predecessor, which does diminish some of its exploration; however, the brilliant wall merging puzzles and some truly excellent dungeon designs more than make up for it.. To be honest it is quite good game but in my opinion very overrated... Gameplay is getting more interesting after the half of the game and the ending is satisfying. But one new mechanic is not enough to keep game fresh after few years. It is just simple not a game for more than 7... Nowhere near to 10.... I have been going through many of the zelda games that I missed and this one was super fun to play through. The graphics, music and gameplay are all great for a 3ds game and the story was good.. What initially looked like a game leaning on the aging crutches of A Link to the Past has turned out to be a thoroughly poignant, vivid and immensely satisfying game worthy of standing on its own two feet. Set in the world of A Link to the Past, Link Between Worlds makes the se. Plays great, my first 2D Zelda game and while it hasn't had me dashing back to try more yet it certainly delivered on my expectations.. My Score: (8) - Very Good! -------------------------------------------------------------------------. An absolutely amazing game from start to finish. this is the best link 2d game to date. Awesome game link snes remake for 3ds game is perfect in my opinion very good game recomended. Even though it is essentially a dumbed down version of ""A Link to the Past"" I still found some enjoyment playing this game. The game offers nothing new except the wall-walking mechanic. I can't hate too much on it but it is one of the less good Zelda games.. Absolutely fantastic game, its a zelda game, but really really fun, this game is the definition of fun, and it still manages to be a really good game in terms of design.. €40 probably, or less, Digital. So long ago, I lost track. The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds was overhyped at the time. I finished the first dungeon, got flat, got to the ""shadow world"", and totally lost where to go next, one of the famous dead points in rpgs, where you simply let it go. Never to go back again. 3 points for the stained glass graphics, but gameplay-wise absolutely nothing like OoT.. Taking place in the classic world of a Link to the past, this game adds new bosses, characters, and mechanics in an amazing way. The story and graphics are improved significantly, and all while running at 60fps. A Must-play, and the pinnacle of 2D Zelda.. You always think you know what to expect when it comes to a Zelda game. This game is fantastic. It had great puzzles, great combat, and an awesome story to fold it up into a neat little package. The mechanics worked great as well. I removed a star because it was a *tiny* bit cheesy, but that only added to the charm in the end.. Poignant story with great characters like Rovi and Hilda. The world exploration is made possible with equipment renting system. Great game. The overall story is amazing. The dungeons are easy and u can complete them in any order thats what i really like about this game.. It's an awesome game with a breath taken sound track ( like any other Zelda game ) it worth every Second of these short adventure ( 14 h ) some mechanics are totally New and are welcome to the serie. Very fun, graphics are good, combat is decent, good story, puzzles are a good difficulty and satisfying. By far my favourite 2D style Zelda game. There is not a dull moment, and the story is surprisingly good. Extremely fun dungeons as well. I prefer this game over Ocarina of Time and Majora's mask. I'd probably give it 9.5-9.8/10 but I'll round up.. Warning: This game is hard to put down. This game takes what makes top-down Zelda gameplay and absolutely knocks it out of the park. A love letter to A Link to the Past, A Link Between Worlds even builds upon that untouchable game and excels beyond it, in my opinion. The open world nature of the game makes the player feel like they are truly living in the world and acting on their own decisions. The storyline is also a remarkable experience built on top of an already solid game. The art style is also incredibly pleasant to experience, and viewing in 3D only makes it even better. I plan to be completing a hero's quest (master quest? I forget what this game calls that unlocked version) in the relatively near future.. A perfect game in my eyes, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, introduces so many new and refreshing ideas to the Zelda franchise. The wall merging mechanic is done so well with puzzles and the game is smartly designed around this mechanic. While the dungeons are easy in this game compared to other games, it does allow this game to be loved by all age groups. The controls are perfect and the game uses often useless buttons like the d-pad in smart ways for bonus camera capabilities. It is easily the best handheld Zelda, and one of the greatest games ever made.. My third favorite Zelda. If you played Zelda on the snes, you will love this!. One of the best Zelda games and one of the best 3DS games. Such great memories with this one. It doesn't give me link to the past vibes at all!! yea it's a nice game and all, But it is a very bad sequel and when i play it i feel something is off or missing. I didn't have that much fun that i usually get from Zelda Games.. Pros: • Wall mechanics is cool • Retro-style • Runs smoothly Cons: • Too short • Few enemies types • Small world • Few NPC's, villages/cities • Battle is dull • No musical instruments. This is a really fun Zelda game with unique mechanics similar to minish cap and a pretty basic Zelda storyline that echoes LTTP.. I am more of a Mario player than playing as Link. But have to say, this game proves me wrong! This game is amazing! The idea of merging into walls to have a slight side scrolling aspect freshens up the game play. The mechanics, the dudgeon's, the gameplay.. it's next level anything I have ever played. This is for me THE best top down 'Zelda' or 'Zelda-like' game i have ever played (yes I'm a minority and think its better than link to the past) due to the modernisation. The game is not perfect though, I would of found it more rewarding if you discover your items than buying, but that is nit-pic really. If you could buy only one game on the 3DS, this would be the one to get as it's my fav I have ever played on the system. first Zelda title I ever finished. Found it a little easy but it was still an awesome game with great mechanics. Don't expect dungeons as difficult as in other titles. Perfect for new-comers. Absolutely amazing. Just enough changes from the original. Nostalgic yet refreshing, even if played for the first time today (like I did lol). Seriously, play. This. Game.. A link between worlds is a prime example of how to make people nostalgic and at the same time make an awesome game. The dungeons: awesome. Great puzzles interesting items and mechanics. The story: nothing to write home about but still a good story that keeps you engaged. The combat: fluent and diverse. This is probably the most fun you will ever have playing a Zelda game.. A must have, but first, play the first one, i mean the Snes Zelda (probably my favorite game on the snes), because this is a direct sequel and it uses the same map, and i LOVE that, because they added one thing, ONE power that totally remakes how you move in the map, is like playing a totaly different game and also playing the original game at the same time, i do not know if they can make a better sequel, i wouldnt even try it, this and the snes one are imo the best ones in the series.. The best Zelda for 3ds. It’s more complet and interesting. A clasical Zelda.. link between world's is by far my favorite 2D Zelda game. if you're a Zelda fan and you haven't played this, go buy a 3DS and a copy of this game.. Near perfect sequel to A Link to the Past. I loved the quality of life changes the most. Being able to rent all items and choose almost any dungeon I wanted to do is a great design choice. Merging with walls was also am excellent design choice. It added new gameplay elements such as exploration and hidden items, and complimented the dungeon designs well. A Link Between Worlds was pretty easy compared to others. I died only one time, and it was my own fault. Dungeon puzzles were also pretty simple for the most part. I was only stumped temporarily in ice cave and turtle rock. Yugo was a great final boss fight, with an added level of difficulty sorely lacking on all the previous fights. Granted, I'm sure it helped having the upgraded master sword, tunics, and shield. Graphics and gameplay top notch. The new soundtrack took me down nostalgia road, and the new tunes were pretty good as well. Definitely got my money's worth, like I do all Zelda games, and now I am eager to dive into Majora's Mask 3D, Breath of the Wild, and Skyward Sword remaster when it comes out. The idiot who gave it a 1 and said a link to the past is his third favorite game of all time, is clearly a complete moron, and in the extremely small minority! This game is superb. Another must-play title for the 3DS/2DS, Fun and challenging, well-designed world and adequate puzzles difficulty. A very good THE LEGEND OF ZELDA entry. This game proves top down Zelda can be as much fun as their 3D counterparts. I want more of these!. This game is amazing and, like Link to the Past, kept me smiling the whole way through except for a certain Moldorm. This game is a lot easier than Link to the Past and, in my opinion at least, has a better story than that game. Link between worlds is better in some aspects such as the story but worse in aspects such as the dungeon items. In Link Between Worlds you have to buy them or rent them from Ravio whereas in Link to the Past you just collect them in the dungeons or in the overworld which seems more classic Zelda than Link Between Worlds. It is a must play for all Zelda and puzzle game fans though so I’d definitely recommend it. You must play this game! The Legend of Zelda hasn't looked so good on 3DS since Ocarina 3D! Nintendo achieves amazing gimmicks once again with Link's new wall merging powers! The puzzles can get repetitive, but the developers thought of every detail when hiding secrets and sights! It's a Nintendo Selects game, only $20! It's worth all of it!. THIS is how you bring back a classic! Leaving grezzo in charge is never a good idea. My first top down Zelda game. It is fantastic and I love it to death! Recommend everyone play this game.. Without a doubt, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is currently the greatest game you can experience on the 3DS. Much like the legendary Master Sword that features throughout the series, this game is beautifully crafted and offers a superbly streamlined and timeless gameplay experience. Through Link’s new transformation ability Nintendo has instilled a magical amount of innovation into the dungeons, boss battles and even the wider exploration of both Hyrule and Lorule; it’s a small feature which makes a world of difference and continuously wows you throughout the entirety of your playthrough. In other areas, Nintendo has made all the right changes to the gameplay formula, resulting in a game that is always incredibly good fun to play. Long-time fans will certainly get a kick out of its nostalgic presentation, while all players will appreciate its impeccable design and superb usage of the 3DS's touch screen. Eiji Aonuma and his team at Nintendo set themselves the unenviable challenge of creating the perfect Legend of Zelda game; with A Link Between Worlds, they may well have achieved just that.. The legend of zelda a link between worlds is a great and fun 2D zelda game, with great puzzle, great music and a great plot twist in the final boss, taking of boss, the boss here are great. In Conclusion, The legend of zelda a link between worlds is a game that you need to buy :D. For some reason, I forgot to leave a review for this game after I beat it a few years ago. I never played ""a link to the past"" when I was younger, so this was completely fresh experience for me. And I really liked it. Particularly great that you can complete any dungeoun in any desired order, plus you can get most of the useful items right away, you can ""borrow"" them that is. But thankfully, you can purchase them on a permanent basis later, which is fairly easy considering how plentiful rupees are in this game. the world is also mostly open at the beginning of the game, so you can explore pretty much at your own pace. There are several intersting vistas, so exploring is fun. I also liked the sidequests, being a completionist isn't a problem when it's that much fun.. My favorite Zelda game so far. While the world map seems a bit small at first, theres so much to discover like the many mini dungeons or mini games. Fighting the various different enemies spread around the region and in the dungeons is fun and you can really master how you fight them. The mini games are a lot of fun and very challenging. The graphics of this game is really lovely and atmospheric, including some places for a nice 3D effect. The graphics get supported by a really good and variable soundtrack, which manages to create a lot of different moods. Also, the sidequests are rewarding and dont get frustrating. Finally, the story is very creative and original ( since I didnt play A Link to the Past yet, i dont know how similar the storylines are). All in all this is my favorite 3DS game until this point since i dont have any point of negative critique and i would definately recommend playing it.. What could have been an easy sequel that traded on past glories is instead a compelling argument for digging up the foundations of Zelda and seeing what happens - rather like Wind Waker did 10 years ago. A Link Between Words is not a total revolution, but it may very well be the start of one. I haven’t been so challenged by a Zelda since Ocarina of Time, and rarely have I been so consistently surprised by one. Between Worlds recaptures the spirit of adventure that gave the early games Zelda their potency, and lays out a vision for Zelda games still to come. It invites them - and us, the long-term fans - to let go of conventions that may have been comforting, but were ultimately holding us back. It’s at once intensely nostalgic and powerfully novel, unpatronising and cerebral. As a Zelda fan, I couldn’t wish for much more.. This game is frickin’ amazing! This may be my favorite handheld Zelda title. Never thought I would say this, but I actually prefer this to A Link to the Past, mainly because the graphics, gameplay, story, and especially dungeons are way better. Only off-putting thing is the weapon-rental system, which really isn’t that big of a deal, because later in the game you can buy them and it’s very easy to come by rupees in this title. One of my favorite things about this was the more-challenging Hero Mode, which actually made the game want you to get all heart pieces/armor/sword upgrades to have a fighting chance. A big gripe I’ve had about recent Zelda games is they have been waaay too easy, and Hero Mode fixed that on this game. Awesome dungeons and boss battles - this game never has a dull moment. This game is reason enough to own a 3ds for sure!. There is nothing bad about this game. The puzzles are fun and manageable. The weapons are varied and fun and the story is light but captivating. An absolute gem ****!. I played this game after ALTTP and it certainly didn't disappoint. The combat, music, graphics, dungeons, and story are both reminiscent of ALTTP while still staying fresh and new. The only slight gripe I have with the game is that it is a tad too easy, however, that was sorted by turning on hero mode which made the game approximately 4 times harder, however, you do need to beat the game once in order to unlock it. Overall a great game that both harkens back to the past while improving the formula that the series has set over the years.. Simply the BEST game for 3DS, and one of the best games for its generation.. Absolutely loved this game; the soundtrack, art style, and gameplay are all fantastic. I really prefer the top down perspective style gameplay as opposed to ocarina of time for example. The amount of abilties and items at your disposal is very fun to play around with. My favorite component of this game is the freedom with which the player can choose to explore the world and choose which temples to beat whenever the player wants to.. Can I just say that this is the best 2D Zelda game ever? Because it is. Unlike everyone else, I haven't played A Link to the Past, but from what I've seen of that game, this one is better in just about ever department. The characters are done better. The music (especially Yuga's battle theme) is on par with the likes of Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey. The story, while nothing special, is quite good. And the dungeon design is honestly better than even Ocarina of Time, which I (for a while) though had the best dungeons of any Zelda game. I HIGHLY recommend A Link Between Worlds. Oh, and Moldorm isn't a pest anymore. That too.. Hands down, the best 2d Zelda ever made! The only problems are that it's a bit easy and short (which is fixed if you play it on Hero Mode), and the dungeons, while pretty solid, don't have any standouts that rank among the series best (like how OoT has the Forest Temple and MM has Stone Tower Temple). Otherwise it's an immaculate and completely satisfying experience from start to finish.. In my opinion this game is the best one in all the Legend of Zelda game series. The music is wonderful and the storyline is simply perfect. The characters are great. There is nothing wrong in this game, nothing you can complain about. The difficulty is just as it should be, the gameplay is perfect there are lots of dungeons and mini games. The so called dark word is amazing. I was literally playing this game nonstop for 2 weeks and dare I say I have never enjoyed any game more in my life. It is simple and and difficult at the same time. This is the only game in the series where I played all the mini games and enjoyed every single one of them. I did not want this game to end so I tried to extend it every way possible. This is a perfect game for people who want to acknowledge the series. Many people think that because of the setting and graphics this Zelda game was made for kids. I assure you it is not true. I was 18 or 19 when I played this game and I enjoyed it a lot. So do not hesitate and go and play it.. This is a really solid Zelda game. The entire game is a nice throwback to LttP, while going by its own plot. The Soundtrack is great, especially the final dungeon. There are some nice new mechanics thrown in, i.e. merging into walls, which is super fun, and renting items, which kinds ruins the good feeling of getting a cool new item in every dungeon. Much like OoT 3D, there is a ""Master Mode"" but it does nothing to change the game other then make the enemies do more damage and make the game frustrating. I also noticed the game is immensely short, seeing how it can be beaten in about 6 hours, but it is still a nice game overall.. A somewhat spiritual follow up to the classic ""a link to the past"", it keeps its style and feel but adds a lot, both in story and in new ways to trasverse its world that are unlike any previous Zelda game.. A Link to the Past but except it kept me wanting to continue adventuring. Pros: + Gameplay: The gameplay is like every other 2D Zelda, most notably ALttP, but except with a gimmick. + The Gimmick: By far my second favorite gimmick of the franchise (#1 goes to the Masks from MM), however I felt like it was done A LOT better in Odyssey. + Exploration: Not once did I feel bored exploring the world of Hyrule in this game. It was a joy running around as Link in this game. + Soundtrack: Pretty neat, it's just upscaled versions of ALttP songs and MAYBE one or two new songs. + Combat: Simple, but fun. Cons: - Story: Not bad, but like ALttP's, it wasn't that great either. Overall, A Link Between Worlds is one of my favorite Zelda games of all time and warrants a 9.3/10 from me.. This game brings so much nostalgia back with unique game mechanics that keep this classic drop down viewed Zelda game fresh and entertaining.. Great in just about every way. It’s basically A Link to the Past with a new story and some new mechanics. I would argue that it’s even better than ALttP in all ways except difficulty. The movement is fluid, the graphics are pleasant and the soundtrack is very impressive for a handheld installment with many memorable tracks.. A Link Between Worlds was very good! I beat it on the normal difficulty first, and then I 100% completed it on the harder 'hero mode' difficulty. Pros: - It was a nicely crafted game - The puzzles weren't too challenging but were fun and rewarding - The dungeons each had their own unique atmosphere - The game's map was fun to explore - Finding all the extra hidden items was rewarding - The enemies and bosses were fun and challenging (especially on hero mode) Con: - This game left me with mostly positive feedback. However, once you get all your items and armor completely upgraded, the game ends extremely fast. I think there should be at least three full dungeons you can explore with max gear. Conclusion: An awesome Zelda game that's worth any fan's time!. I have to say that this is a great zelda game, but it isn't really the masterpiece that many people claim it to be. The legend of Zelda a Link Between Worlds, at first glance, feels like a run-of-the-mill 2D zelda, you play as Link and your main weapon is the sword while there are other items to use like bombs, bow and arrows and the fire rod. There are also a lot of dungeons, huge labyrinths filled with monsters and puzzles for you to tackle. In this game there is a wizard called Yuga that is trying to capture some people into pictures because these people, known as sages, are needed in order to resurrect the lord of darkness, Ganon, and it is up to Link to stop the wizard. Now lets talk about the major twist in this game, it is basically completely nonlinear, that is right, differently from past entries in the series, Link is able to tackle almost every dungeon in any order the player wants. To me this is a great thing because it increases replayability a lot and really encourages exploration, which is a very important element in the zelda series, something that the series was slowly losing as games were released, reaching an unfortunate low in Skyward Sword. But this freedom creates some problems such as a lack of difficulty, the fact that most dungeons could be your first dungeon forced Nintendo to design them with basically the same easy difficulty which makes the later dungeons you explore a lot easier compared to the first ones, making the game a lot less challenging than A Link to the Past. It is important to remember that the possibility of exploring most of the world right from the get go is only possible thanks to the new rental system, which you can rent every mandatory item in the game by paying with the currency item from the game, the Ruppees. I kinda like this system because it makes the ruppees actually valuable in this game, so every time you get them from a treasure chest or an enemy, it feels really rewarding, and the fact that you lose all the rented items upon dying makes death meaningful in this game, not just an annoyance. But I feel that such system fell flat in some way because there isn't really any struggle to get any item such as beating a strong opponent, finding a secret or going through a hard puzzle to get the item, the only thing you need is a bit of grinding and that is it, which feels rather lazy and as a result the fact that you got a new item doesn't feel as fullfilling as it should have. Link can also use a new ability called the merge ability, which allows it to become a painting in a wall which allows him to get to some ","the first two hours are slow and couldn't catch my interest but after that I had so much fun . the mechanics are fun, and the dark mirror of Hyrule, that being Lorule, was fun . this might be one of the best Legend Of Zelda games i have played ."
264.NieR: Automata - Game of the YoRHa Edition,"This game is a remarkable experience from start to some 2/3 of the game. Music, animation, storyline, combat, it goes on and on. *Spoilers about game lenght* Even what people would expect to be worse part of the game execution I enjoyed a lot, even more than the first part of the game. I won't delve too much into it because spoilers. What I felt is towards the later part of the game, it fell apart somewhat, preventing this from being a resounding 10. Yoko Taro seems to mention a time crunch in interviews and I think it shows. At this point one is probably 25-30h into the game. I feel it would have been better to not stick to wanting a 35h+ game, as there would have been times the game could have ended well and passed on to a sequel. So there was some amount of ""one more thing"" and with lack of time the execution suffered. I hope this particular stage of the game is remade some time later, so we can enjoy what the creator intended for this remarkable game. As someone wisely said on a review, I wish I could forget this just to play it again.. A timeless masterpiece. Sound, music, mechanics, story and the very definition of what gameplay is are elevated to an overall height which makes this piece of art completely outstanding. Why 9? It would have deserved a next gen update for ps5.. Not a horror game, but on my 3rd run, I was all goosebumps and shivering like crazy.. The game is basically intersting in first 5 hours. After that, repaeting gameplay and enemies only make the game more boring . The design of multiple endings give me a good experience in story telling. However, the gameplay is so awlful that i have to endure such torment to push the story forwards. Not recommend. This is more than just a game. The story and narrative it tells is so moving, and so deep that it really makes you think. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days after I finished playing. 10/10 highly recommend. More than a video game Nier Automata is an heartfelt work of art. Masterpiece 20/10. Not a horror game, but on my 3rd run, I was all goosebumps and shivering like crazy.. A special game with good character design and very very good story and enjoyable side quests. NieR:Automata is a game I absolutely love. The story is captivating, and the music is beautiful, adding a lot to the overall experience. I also really like the character design, which is unique and well-crafted. This was my first game disc for the PS4, and it left a lasting impression on me. The combination of story, music, and design makes it a truly memorable game.. If i could give decimal point scores NieR:Automata would be a 9.5 so i am just going to round it to 10 . The reason its not a 10 is cause of the gameplay, its really bland but NieR isn't meant to wow you with stellar gameplay thats just how Yoko Taro makes his games which you can see in drakengard and the original nier. Although its fun and flashy and extremely satisfying to dodge,everybody whos played knows that its repetitive and the weapons do the same animations depending on the type. Other than that little inconvenience which is easily looked over everything else is a high 9 and 10. The story is phenomenal,an easy 10, the amount of detail and quality writing in this game is something to really appreciate. The music is heavenly, NieR has easily the top 3 best soundtracks oat. The characters are great and their development is done really well. The open world is decent but not really big, but it is really interesting. Graphics aren't the greatest but this game was made in 2017 for the last generation of consoles and PCs, they're good enough but if they remaster this game with modern final fantasy level graphics it would easily be goty nominee. The amount of subtle differences in every new playthrough that really emphasise the references to philosophy is done perfectly. The ending is one the greatest endings ive ever witnessed. And the amount of nostalgia from the previous NieR in this one is just really nice. Overall this game is a must play,most will never even touch this game because of how different it is to the typical AAA title but thats what makes this game a masterpiece.. Yoko Taro delivered an creative masterpiece here, no doubt about it.2B and 9S are also great charackters and iconic videogame charackters for sure. But the graphic and gameplay alone is for 2024 not really great tbh. You also have to be in the right mood to play this game because of its really depressing and melancholic theme.. I love the characters and the world building. The story is fantastic and emotional too and has a deeper meaning behind it. Combat system is fun. The only problem I have is the fact I have to play it 3 times fo get the real ending of the game and 2 times the exact same thingfrom the sight of 2B and then of 9S. There are some tiny differences like the hacking thing but it's the same story and kinda is annoying to have to go through it again. It gets a bot better by the fact that this story is playable in around 12 hours. But I would have liked a longer main story in one playthrough instead!. good music, act, story, character design, art, stunning true ending, some may cry a little.. This is my favorite game of all time. Writing is amazing and deep, graphics are still great, and the gameplay is second to none. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Truly a great game. There are one or two parts of this game that when I think about them, my heart THROBS in pain. This is how much this game naisl being emotional with success. This could have been a 10/10 but I remove 1 point for the robot protag to be dressed as a robot maid. Why? This is truly unfait to the character,a thirst trap that removes from the rest of the game. I also remove another 1 point for having to chain the game content so many time. It's genius in most part, except when you just need to redo entire parts of the game you already did with no change at all. This parts were boring. Story is good. Characters, revelations, plot reveals, these are great. Then you finish the game, and it propose to you an interesting New Game+. With some original content. This is nice. Then you finish again, and this time you have another New Game+ with only original content that is incredibly painful in an emotional way. God this game made cry. Why does the robot protag of an heart-wrenching master-piece is dressed as a slutty maid? This shouldn't have been!. This is one of the greatest - if not the best - games ever created. The story is intriguing and immersive; the combat is incredibly smooth and challenging to an accurate level of the difficulties; the characters and world is terrifically developed and I have replayed it many times (which is a must), but also come back to it at numerous occasions. In addition to this, the soundtrack is, in my opinion, the best video game soundtrack of all time.. The combat is a bit finnicky and unsatisfying, with even worse writing & voice acting. The design choice of the main character is also questionable, and it seems like this was one of the selling points, which is definitely not a good thing.. The story is very original, interesting and captivating, and the various endings make it even better. The graphics are ok without surprising, while the OST does surprise due to its excellence. The gameplay offers alternatives, it might not be the most memorable but at least the characters add various strategies. The great downside comes with the game not autosaving, nor offering the possibility to save in a whole mission. Add that to the possibility of crash (happened 3 times and had to restart, playing in 2023) and you have the killer combo to waste your time. And it wasn't necessary for this game. A true pity. It really needs to be fixed.. I love everything about this game! Also, the soundtrack is god-tier!. Nier: Automata has sort of a messy narrative style, comparable to that of Quentin Tarantino. On my first play through, I felt like I had a vague understanding of the plot but nothing more. It isn’t until you play through the final route of the game that the tangled web of plot points start to connect in quite a profound way and you realize the message was right under your nose the whole time. This game draws influence from real-life existential philosophy, and this might fly under the radar if most of the characters weren’t directly named after the famous philosophers who proposed those questions. It is the type of game that relies on the immersive and interactive nature of its medium to properly convey its message. In other words, if Nier: Automata were a film, book, or tv show instead ****, the story’s impact would be lost. I encourage everyone to play this game and go in completely blind like I did.. The story of this game was pretty confusing at first, but nonetheless I had a lot of fun. The combat was pretty great, and the character designs are really awesome. The highlight of this game was definitely the music. There are many different endings, and I thought each of them were really great.. Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods Become As Gods. Nier Automata was one of 2017's best action games. Developed by Platinum (Bayonetta, Vanquish), it's a blend of hack 'n slash and bullet hell gameplay. Featuring an involving story, a desolate world and evocative music, it's comparable to Shadow of the Colossus. You play as 2B, an android warrior tasked with neutralizing rebellious machines. If there was ever a Final Fantasy game directed by Hideo Kojima, then it be like this. The Game of the Yorha Edition includes extra skins, avatars, a theme and DLC. ""Automata"" has plenty of action, but isn't perfect. It has stuttering issues, only a few tutorials and unhelpful map. To finish the story, you need beat the game three times!. Overall, this is a terrific game. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. Best game I've ever played. Has the best soundtrack and story I've ever seen in a game. Combat is fantastic as well.. Game is amazing, love the 2D parts, 2B is a robot killing machine and i love the combat animations, story is good.. + astonishing 3D level design and camera angles + nice voice actors in original japanese audio + feels like playing an anime, especially combat + cool retro style arcade shooting parts + interesting mixture of different genres and fighting systems (3D vs 2D) + impressivly deep story with lots of philosophic backround + no bugs or graphic errors + amazing very long fighting sequences + outstandingly creative ideas and gimmicks (like in menu, settings, the joke endings, Ending E) + great art style and animations in most moments - sexist design of 2B and A2 in contrast to their well written strong female characters - combat often reduces to dodging and button smashing, learning the moveset of enemies is mostly not necessary as well as choosing a particular move of your character, the moveset of enemies is too repetative and easy to foresee - the music is nice but too intense after a while - sometimes lazy or bad animations like water surface or climbing stairs - route B is a bit too much like a boss rush of the same bosses you fought just a few hours before (when not doing sidequests) Overall a very unique gaming experience with lots of love for little details. A real must play!. Deeply affecting story, world building and musical score…. however the gameplay can get a little stale.. Simply put, it’s great. Very fun with an unique and great story + great visuals. Highly recommend!. One of the best games i have ever played. After achieving all endings, i couldn't pick up another game for weeks.. I absolutely love NIER: AUTOMATA. It's gameplay is replayable and satisfying, there's a lot of side content. Only bad thing I can think of is that the story is essentially a carbon copy of the original Nier.. What a let down. Kept expecting the game to get better after hearing so many people say how great it is.. Nier Automata it's a great, intriguing story filled with great music (it's literally one of the best game soundtracks I've heard), but not in the best shell. The art design is pretty good, but the technical part is pretty badly executed. This is due to the small development budget. If you are ready to put up with and turn a blind eye to certain roughness of technical performance, then this video game will definitely give you emotions and make you think about some things. Many thanks to Yoko Taro and his entire team.. The music was literally the only reason I finished the game, as the story in route C (which was supposed to be ""godlike"") turned out to ****. The philosophy was supposed to be ""out of this world"", in truth the philosophical motives discussed during the game were high-school level, aside from the fact that they were investigated into at a very superficial level. Is this game mostly played by kids who are only now being introduced to the thoughts and works of Nietzsche and the like? Because it sure as hell looks like it. The game may give you a feeling of emptiness and depression after beating it, but that’s about it. I was hoping for a “transcendental journey” and “deep reflection on the condition of modern humanity”, but I didn’t get to experience anything which would even remotely resemble the ubiquitous praise and high esteem perpetuated by a number of players. Pushing yourself to finish the game if you don’t feel like playing it is a mistake. Believing players that you should force yourself to finish route B, which has some major faults in game design, only to proceed with the story, is a mistake. Don’t get me started on combat mechanics, graphics, etc., as the game falls short in this department as well. In my particular case, it’s over 20 hours down the drain.. A game greater than the sum of its parts, the longer you play the better it gets.. this game provides a new open world game experience, combat against bosses is very good and also with music being served against bosses it becomes very epic, and the graphics in this game are very good. This game is a must play for anyone who loves a meaningful, thought provoking, and emotional story in a video game with great gameplay. Nier: Automata deconstructs existentialism and nihilism in more effective ways than even the Blade Runner films. Not only do you constantly learn more vital information to the story’s themes throughout the playthrough of endings A-E, but the emotional impact of this information only grows stronger. The more you play the happier the lighter moments are and the sadder the heavy moments are, as nothing grows stale throughout its long playtime (around 30 hours to complete endings A-E). Even the side quests add so much meaning that I’m surprised some aren’t mandatory. The design of each element of the game feels purposeful, like the upgrade chips you install into your android protagonists, the legitimacy of fast travel using new bodies, and the different types of gameplay that ranges from third person hack-and-slash to retro shoot ‘em up. On top of all this, the game's soundtrack is without a doubt the best I’ve ever heard. Even if you don’t like the gameplay for whatever reason or the heavily philosophical story doesn’t resonate with you, the soundtrack is one you’ll want to listen to on repeat. This game jumped into my top 10 favorite games of all time and I have no doubt in that decision.. Not a decent action/ARPG game. Demo has about 75% action content of the entire game.. Wow! I am blown away by this game.. It's epic story, music and characters reminds me of the glory days of Final Fantasy but it is also backed up fast, fun and engaging fighting that never gets boring. I did not expect this game to be as creative, magical and just so damn good.. But it really is! 10/10. This is a fantastic game, I’ve never played anything quite like it. It’s predominantly a hack & slash but it changes into a 2.5D shooter, 2D fighter, twin-stick shooter and a couple variations of bullet hell shmup. The gameplay is tight and lots of fun for all of the genres that it becomes. That tight gameplay comes with RPG elements (upgrades) as it progresses. The music is outstanding and some of the best I’ve heard in a game. All of these elements are wrapped in an outstanding, deep story. I’ve never come across a game that incorporates these styles of gameplay with strong story-driven elements. In fact, I’ve never played a game with a story like this. While this game isn’t for everyone (nothing ever is); nobody can deny that this is a standout title. The graphics aren’t the best but they’re not bad. There is some texture pop-in at times and the world is barren. But the barren world is fitting to the plot as well as the vibe of the game. I can’t recommend this game enough. Now for the negative about the DLC (Game of the Yorha Edition): The first issue is that the DLC doesn’t come in the actual game. It comes with a download code that you must then register and download the DLC for free. The second issue is that I’m not sure how to unlock the extra outfits. However you do that in the game, I haven’t figured it out yet. So unfortunately, this edition is crap.. It’s a masterpiece, on the JRPG genre no one is better than this game. An unique experience, a pure pleasure to play. It’s definitely one of the best games of all times in a handful.. Awesome! Beat it 3 times to get the full story! 2nd time is from a diff perspective and 3rd is new content!. You haven't seen such a thing since the days of Xenogears or Xenosaga, fantastic the best jrpg ever. Long story short, I might have missed what most people seem to really love in that game. The music is fantastic (the one in the desert or in the parc are demented). The atmosphere is really breathtaking. Narration is very complex and brings tons of different angles as the story unfolds. Combats are really dynamic and generally fun. The gameplay changes several times during the game and really add to the fun. There also are some great easter eggs I loved finding. And, that's it to me. The game suffers a lot of really serious issues to me that kind of ruin the fun and don't really compel me to come back to it. Some of them would be * Really boring, fedex side quests. Most of the side quests are just ""go fetch that on the other side of the map and come back to me"". Although they have a strong narrative content as well, the actual quest is just roaming through the map, again and again and again. * That map. Let's talk about it. It's huge and really impractical. There are tons of roadblocks, complicated paths to take. I can't even guess how many hours I spent just trying to run from point A to point B on that map. * The UI is generally bad. Although there are some brilliant features to the UI when you - as a machine - are in a dire state, when you are playing normally, the mini-map is absolutely unreadable. The points of interest and quests are very hard to find. You can't turn on and off the quest locations. The games feels very old in that way. * Combat. I know I said it was fun and dynamic. But at the end of the day, I've done most of the game using the same weapon, pod, build and special. I would have loved to have the game incentivize the variety of playstyles, with foes resisting a type of weapon or ... i don't know, prizes ? Finally I would have to say that the story itself it kind of unsettling. I know that's part of what Square Enix did. And they did it fantastically well, which is a strong suit of the game. But man do I like feeling that bad as I discover more of the story ? Not sure.. The BEST OST of all time. I am still listening to its music a year since beating the game. Did I mention the story is a master piece too?. Nice game I played some time ago, enjoyed it pretty much. Nothing much else to say.. This game is absolutely insane. The all in all package is even more great. I can’t write a full review without going into too much detail and wasting everyone’s time. All I can say is, I can’t recommend this game enough.. This game is awesome. Beautiful music, great story, excellent character. Taro Yoko is the man and genius.. Best game i ever played, the gun goes boom, the android goes blast blast, unique gameplayyy. Nier: Automata is an interesting game that I would highly recommend to anyone that wants to experience the full potential of what the video game medium has to offer. It's difficult to explain exactly what I mean by that sentence without ruining the experience, so if you have the chance to try the game out, I strongly suggest you do so. If you go in with an open mind, you may come away from Nier: Automata with a new and interesting perspective on things. But even if this game doesn't move you, I think you'll still have a good time.. This is a sprawling open world game, packed with places to explore and secrets of the past to unravel. The story is stark, and compelling enough (though not as 'deep' as some reviews here would lead you believe) to make you want to see the game to its conclusion. The score is also fantastic for the most part, which helps draw your attention from the bleak settings. However, therein lies the main problem. To get to the 'true' ending, you have to play this game 3 times from different character perspectives. What's different between these characters? Not a whole lot, to be honest. This would be more forgiving if the areas you have to trawl through repeatedly aren't so bland and devoid of life - literally. In this apocalyptic setting, you fight robot organisms with very little in the way of variety. Bosses are standout moments from a design point, but typically devolve into an odd combination of bullet hell, and bullet sponge. If you are a completionist, expect to spend a lot of time farming the same roomful of enemies ad infinitum for the hopes rare materials will drop for upgrades. This game would have benefited greatly from more unique story paths, or greater variation in play styles of the characters. Instead, expect to feel burn out around the halfway mark from the sheer repetition and the question; while the future may be bleak, must it be so boring?. Such a unique gaming experience. The game is a mish-mash of various genres in terms of gameplay, which works faily ok, but the beauty in this lies with the story and the atmosphere. It''s a Sci-fi story with multiple layers of complexity. The soundtrack is absolutely stella and a major selling point here too. Highly recommend for gamers looking for a deeper experience in terms of storytelling. The gameplay and open world is decent but not perfect.. Great gameplay, combat system is fantastic, wonderful story, incredible soundtrack. A must play for sure, should rank higher on the best PS4 games list. Another game that will leave a sense of emptiness once completed - you will miss the characters, the music... Wont be easy to find something else to fill this void.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a very good and surprise game the story , game play and sound track are amazing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is probably the most underrated games of all times. I have enjoyed every single second spent in this unbelievable Universe which is a brilliant mix of Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clark, The Holy Bible. You MUST complete at least the first 3 parts of the game in order to reveal all the secrets and deep philosophy of this unbelievable world. THE BEST GAME EVER.. A game like no other. The story is deep and engaging, the gameplay is fast and stylish, the music is out of this world, and the semi-open world is breathtaking. This game also features a lot of unconventional design choices that are very surprising and like nothing I've ever seen before, but they are sure welcoming surprises.. One of the most wonderful games around. Deserves so much more attention than it gets. Wonderful music, profound story & incredible gameplay. If you're reading this. Buy this game.. Firstly, a 2017 release - graphically does not hold that great in 2020, however the gameplay mechanics still do and are astonishing, i was pleasantly surprised and impressed many times over, the entire system is seamless, the boss battles are some of the best I've ever experienced, so many layers, so much depth..... so many phases! There is so much replay value if that's your thing, it's a game that actually encourages you to in order to see the other endings. The music/soundtrack compliments the action so well, I personally didn't understand the story... nor did i really care for it, I've only done one playthrough and I won't be doing another. I do feel this game is overhyped though.. Normally I would put a pros and cons in my review but honestly I loved everything about this game so I am only going to list my one singular con. Con:I absolutely hate the map in the game. This game is set in the far flung future and even now we have better mapping technology than they tried to put in this game. For the love of all that is holy fix the mapping functionality in the next game.. Fantastic story, fun engaging gameplay and a beautiful world, some bad side quests that are optional. Unique game that will stick with you!. Damn, this game is awesome. This is an art I think. Beautiful music, great story, excellent character design. The first time I did not understand this game. But the second time I couldn’t tear myself away from her. By the way, I was expelled from the university because of her xD I love this game. Yoko Taro - you fn genius). most people would take a look at the cover, think it was a generic, run of the mill, overly sexual rpg. but boy oh boy would they be wrong. you take good, fun and fast-paced hack and slash game-play; a great, minimalist graphic design; an amazing sound track; a somewhat cliche but good story and one of the best sound tracks in a video game, and you have a masterpiece. i physically cannot be bothered to take an hour to write a review about how much this game does right, but just look on youtube for a review or try the game yourself. it may not be for everyone but if you have a decent taste in games it will not disappoint. Let's get the first thing out of the way - it is a complete con to sell a new version **** with the additional content on a voucher and not the disc, especially when this additional content is paltry at best. This game is unique and will forever be etched into my mind, however I think there were a few missteps where they tried too hard. The combat is generally good, however when multiple enemies are on the screen at once it gets very chaotic and I found it hard to dodge due to there being so much going on. It makes for a wonderful visual display but isn't always practical. The story is a highlight of the game which needs to be played to be properly enjoyed. There's nothing as memorable as robots having existential crises and identity issues. However the whole multiple endings concept wasn't very well executed and became tedious towards the (fifth?) ending. They tried to be a bit too meta here. On your first playthrough there is enough mystery to pique curiosity but after another few attempt it gets a bit muddled. I'd say I found the ending fairly unsatisfying really. The soundtrack is very memorable and haunting; definitely a highlight that I'd want to download to listen again later. The graphics are also something to behold simply due to the framerate. I've not seen many games on the PS4 achieve such a high framerate that is consistent. It causes my PS4Pro to sound like a jet engine at times but this didn't concern me. Overall, this game is well worth it. I actually didn't enjoy this when I first played it but reading up on it showed me just how much I missed out on. One further criticism I'd have is that I had to read up on a bit too much for this game, from story analysis to consequences of choices offered in game. I found this more annoying than interesting. Still well worth the price tag these days.. * TLDR and my suggestion: Nier Automata is a decent game that left me with mixed feelings. It's unique. But it also has its frustrating moments. If you are out of good games then give this one a go. I suggest you don't touch the side-quests and just progress the main story. You'll have a way better time. * I originally had written a much longer review of this game but to MetaCritic's 5K letter limit I had to cut in half and forgo the positives. There are many of those reviews out there. * What keeps this game from being a masterpiece? As great as Nier Automata is, it has it's annoying moments. And unless these moments are addressed with fair and constructive critisicm, they will be included Yoko Taro's next games or any aspiring developer who wants to learn from this game. That's the main reason I am writing thise piece, and that's why I am surprised as to how many reviews, even those who sporadically mention these flaws, ingnore them in their ratings. - Flawed pacing: The pacing of Nier Automata reminded me of MGS5. When a quest becomes available, I, the cosumer, take it as a sign that the game wants me to do it. However these side-quests have almost nothing to do with your main quest and doing them actually hurts the pacing of the game. So basically, no story development while you are doing unrelated side-missions and when a story development does happen you know that a snooze-fest is awaiting you further ahead until the next development happens. Keep in mind, these side-missions are designed to be a part of the game; if you delete them, you're omitting a big chunk of the game. - Sinful side-quests: These side-quests are not only causing pacing issues for the main mission but they themselves are to put it mildly 'unispired'. All the old sins of the 90s are here. 'Fetch quests' are the best you can hope for. 'Escorting helpless NPCs' are here as well. And the one side-mission where you 'walk aimlessly in a huge barren desert, hoping to chance upon hidden items' just takes the cake. They're the prime examples of 'filler content'. The 'existential crisis' these quest convey isn't due to the story but your IRL time-waste. - Main story momentum killers: For some reason, the cool moments in the game are immediately followed by some event that intentionally kills the flow. It's like the cow that produces a lot of milk but as the bucket starts to fill, poops a hard dung in it and spoils it all. For example, after a cool event, you are forced to stumble for about 4-5 minutes across the map unable to use any abilities. You also can't jump. This clearly intends to frustrate the player. But why? I'd calmly put down the controller and play another game. - Unnecessary multiple playthroughs: The multiple playthroughs turned out to be more of a marketing strategy. [PARAGRAPH BELOW TALKS ABOUT NUMBER OF PLAYTHROUGHS. SKIP IF YOU CONSIDER IT A SPOILER] The game has 5 meaningful endings. To get those endings you have to play '3 routes'. However the 2nd route 80% matches your 1st playthrough, and the rest are bits of new info sprinkled in. The 3rd playthrough is basically a new segment of the story locked behind those 2. Keep this in mind as we go on. [END OF DISCUSSION ABOUT NUMBER OF PLAYTHROUGHS] Here's the problem. Halfway through your first playthrough, you unlock the fast-travel. However, when you start your 2nd route this fast-travel mechanic is taken away until you unlock it again in the middle of your current playthrough. So you have to do all the boring trekking once more, doing the same missions again. I personally find it this decision very hard to swallow. So, given how much new content exists in these multiple playthroughs, you are basically dealing with a single normal-length campagn which is stretched through muliple playthoughs to artificially inflate its length and value. I don't know whether this was an exec","the game is a remarkable experience from start to some 2/3 of the game . i felt towards the later part of the game, it fell apart somewhat, preventing this from being a resounding 10 . i hope this particular stage of the game is remade some time later ."
265.Castlevania: Circle of the Moon,"This is a very solid title especially for being a launch title for the gba. This game does a lot well like great music, the DSS system is good but could do with some improvements. The game is rather difficult compared to other entries around this time, but it isn't insanely difficult except for in the final boss which is a real beast. The bosses were cool and memorable with plenty of spectacle, but they were very hit or miss for me. The game controls stiff and that's one of my bigger issues with this title especially since movement has normally been very good in this franchise. Overall solid title but I have my issues, and I can't go to deep into them without it containing spoilers. I do understand why some adore this title since it has a ton to love about it.. Circle of the Moon offers good music but suffers as a game—decent as a metroidvania (for lack of a better term) but weighed down by its flaws. The card system, or DSS, feels clunky and uninspired; while combining two decks for different effects like damage boosts, weapon changes, spells, or passive bonuses sounds good in theory, it’s let down by a cumbersome menu system and lackluster combos. A better approach might’ve been to allow three active combos at once: a passive buff, a magic attack, and a weapon, which would have added more flexibility. Combat is challenging, with a scarcity of healing items making the trek to bosses frustrating, especially given save points are only close-ish to boss fights. I used save states freely, as I play IGA Castlevanias for exploration and RPG elements over difficulty—this title, however, feels closer to the old-school Castlevanias in its unforgiving approach. Overall, Circle of the Moon is an okay experience, but I wouldn’t revisit it or strongly recommend it unless you’re really craving more of this genre and have already exhausted better options.. This game is just annoying the movement is slow,the enemies are annoying,the bosses are **** card dss system is a good idea but it is executed poorly the droprates and the amount of enemies that drop cards are so few. Because of this you need to grind to get the best cards.Alot of the fun cards are obtained from annoying to kill enemies with 1% drop chance.I donnot want to grind for hours to get items in a metroidvania. This game has like the same enemies with different colour and more health every new **** is annoying to go around the castle even the starting areas feel slow to traverse. It takes so much time to go around the castle every enemy is designed to be as annoying as possible. All the areas in this game just blend together in my mind. Although the cards are annoying to get they are cool to play with all the different combinations are interesting and makes this game unique.. Solide **** very Hard first time to play it. too many card combinations. but few a useful. certains ennemies are OP. Finally, there is way to much elements, weeknesses, (fire, ice, holy, dark, poison....)The castle is big ennough to get lost. sometimes you go way to far juste for secret **** in général an excellente expierience with average visuals (annimation is not good ennough) but a geat music. a perfect castelvania game in my opinion. A very hard to complete game, glitches are required. Bosses have far too much health, Nathan deals far too little damage, the Castle is designed in many parts to trick you into thinking you're progressing only to drop you into a pit far back from where you were.. Solid game, visuals are pretty nice and soundtracks have some charm and vibe. The thing is that game's difficulty is really harsh, its a little bit grindy which i like, but most of the boss fights are weirdly designed, for me boss fight should be challenging and when you fail you feel that it is yours fault, but here some boss fights are so straight forward that with intended gear you would win without any effort, on the other hand there are bosses that have attack patterns that are close to impossible to consistently dodge without cheesing and you can't win because you are good! in those scenarios you just need better equipment. Game was quite fun and it is solid title in the series, just not for the starting point, because there are better ways to start with Castlevania! :). Alright, ""Castlevania: Circle of the Moon,"" a classic entry in the iconic series, and it's time to see if it's as legendary as its predecessors or if it falls victim to the curse of mediocrity. Graphically, for a GBA game, it's pretty damn impressive. The dark, atmospheric visuals and detailed sprite work bring the haunted castle to life. It's like a gothic painting that you can carry in your pocket, capturing the essence of the Castlevania aesthetic. Gameplay: Gameplay-wise, it's classic Castlevania. Whip-wielding action, platforming challenges, and those classic sub-weapons – it's like a familiar song with a few new riffs. The DSS (Dual Set-up System) adds a layer of strategy, allowing players to combine cards for unique effects. It's like adding a few unexpected chords to a well-known melody. Soundtrack: Now, let's talk tunes. The music, composed by Sotaro Tojima, is atmospheric and haunting. It complements the gothic atmosphere perfectly, and the memorable melodies stay with you long after you've put the GBA down. It's like a symphony of darkness that enhances the overall experience. Story: And the narrative – well, it's Castlevania. Dracula is causing trouble, and it's up to the Belmont clan to whip him back into submission. It's not breaking any new ground, but it's like a classic horror movie that you enjoy for the familiar tropes. Now, for the critique. The biggest flaw is the infamous ""DSS card drop"" system. Some essential abilities are locked behind random card drops, which can lead to a frustrating grind. In conclusion, ""Castlevania: Circle of the Moon"" is a solid addition to the series, capturing the essence of what makes Castlevania great. The challenging gameplay, atmospheric visuals, and haunting soundtrack make it a must-play for fans of the genre. The random card drop system may leave a bitter taste, but it doesn't overshadow the overall experience.. Always a risk playing older games with modern eyes. I enjoyed my first step in to the world of Castlevania with Circle of the Moon. The DSS card system is just great, really fun and unique. Fantastic atmosphere and music. Hunting for new equipment and cards is very fun and addicting. The game is not without its faults though. No auto run and limited shortcuts make map traversal become tedious. Summoning button combos are cumbersome, and also make later bosses quite trivial. Many items are rare drops from specific enemies, requiring a guide if you want to try out everything.. What it lacks in creative and challenging bosses, Circle of the Moon makes up for in pure exploration, nostalgic music, and interesting ways to replay the game. While I can't recommend this over most of the Castlevania games I played, it still as the addictiveness of any castlevania game, and that should be a good enough sale for anyone.. For a casual run-through, this is a great game. Each area of the map feels unique, and slowly opening up the map and conquering each area feels rewarding. The soundtrack is pretty good and each song fits the area well. The DSS is the highlight, allowing you to give your character a wide variety of buffs in the form of collectible cards which prevents the gameplay from becoming too stale. The main drawback: this game is awful to try to 100% complete. Though I love the DSS, the means of getting some of the cards boils down to farming a certain type of enemy till they drop the desired card. This **** any sense of immersion as the game basically invites you to exploit the enemy spawning system. Some enemies are even hidden away in one room on the entire map. It's a shame as the system adds so much to the gameplay, but it might as well not be here if half the power ups are not accessible without a guide. Nonetheless, this is a great GBA title. The fact that I tried so hard to get as many of the cards as I could, despite the mundaneness of the tasks, is a testament to how good the core gameplay is.. The GBA is where Castlevania progressed from its linear platform roots and incorporated elements of Super Metroid to create the ""Metroidvania"" sub-genre (which seems a bit unfair on the creators of Metroid!). A big step forward in the series as far as depth of gameplay goes, but the Metroid games are still better.. Pros Good boss battle Good Soundtrack Decent storytelling Good Gameplay Cons Bad Animation Unbalanced difficulty Inferior graphics( it is inferior to other castlevania games from GBA) Few diverse weapons. Castlevania circle of moon was an amazing game but it definitely needs to be more like devil may cry, hellsing, god of war bayonetta charmed and van helsing. The battle arena ruins the entire game. I wouldn't be bothered by it if it was skippable, but you're actually forced to go through it to get a couple of cards, so there's no avoiding it for a completionist such as myself. To sum it up, they're expecting you to survive through 17 rooms filled with enemies constantly moving around while spamming attacks and homing projectiles at you from all directions. Everything you touch hurts you, which is something the enemies abuse by running, flying and jumping right into you. They don't stop next to you to attack you in a normal manner; they're literally trying to stand in the exact same place you are to hurt you through touching, because the developers decided that programming them in such a cheap and unfair way would be fun. Add to this the fact that your special skills (DSS) are deactivated, there are no healing items inbetween rooms, and you need to complete the entire arena in one go (because otherwise you'll have to do it all over again). To top it off, you also need to be lucky enough for the two cards to actually drop from the enemies, or else you have to start over from room 1 and try again. To call this bad game design would be an insult to bad games; this is atrocious beyond words and quite possibly the worst gaming experience of my life.. The problem with the game is that it is kind of mediocre and it is come after Symphony of the Night .the only thing I could think of while playing it was comparing it to Symphony of the Night is harsh. I mean it's one of the best games of all time and one of my **** compared to other metroidvania games it doesn't stand out in March of any way if you grow up with the game I completely understand this that you like it, but for me. I kind of slowly fell asleep. Best Castlevania game I played and PASSED as a kid back in 2005. The spell system is the most creative system I've ever experienced and always wished the proceeding Catlevania games would include. To count how many spells you can do by the combination of spell cards would be 100. This alone puts most games to shame. The enemies are difficult but awesome for gamers who love challenges and have patience to figure out the patterns of the enemies. The bosses are great and most likely you will die before figuring out how to beat them. The cards were a grind but didn't take too long to get. The arena map was great and challenging and rewarding. The map is pretty good and the soundtracks are better then their variants on other castlevania games. I played this game again and decided to review it after passing it and it still remains as the best Castlevania even though it isn't canon due to the hater producer not being involved in this installment. It was quick work with the strategy guide I wish I had back then but nonetheless I enjoyed it alot and gave me awesome nostalgia.. I wish this game was better, I really do. The DSS system is an amazing innovation and it's still another Castlevania and those are almost always good. However, this game has some massive problems. For one, the difficulty is absolutely absurd. Not in a fair but difficult way like Hollow Knight mind you, but a NES-brutal bullcrap kind of way. Enemies do absurd damage even with the best equipment, healing potions are rare to non existent, save points are incredibly rare and sometimes even hard to find, enemy attacks are very difficult to dodge, every hit has insane knockback, and many more things make this a brutal and frustrating experience basically requiring save states or some sort of rewind ability. Along with that, the controls are very hard to work with unlike all future Castlevania games in this style, with running being tied to double tapping the direction keys. The only time this is actually possible consistently is when playing on a PC with a keyboard, but then it's hard to access L and R for special moves and exploration. This is made worse by the base walking speed being NES slow, making the incredibly fast paced and brutal combat encounters of this game even more difficult, not to mention you don't even have the iconic backdash in this game! Along with that, unlike other Metroidvanias, every area feels the same with many areas bleeding into each other and not feel distinct enough, not helped by the same songs playing in multiple areas making exploration difficult. Enemies also scale to progression, so late game you'll find early game areas filled to the brim with OP enemies that can kill you in like 4 hits and it's just unfair. There is also no shop to restock on items or get better gear. Everything is based on enemy drops, making progression even tougher, especially if you're unlucky and/or don't want to grind. Sub weapons, supposted to be a major mechanic, are nearly useless as nearly every one has been nerfed compared to previous games like Super Castlevania 4, Rondo of Blood, and Symphony of the Night, the only one being even slightly useful being the incredibly rare cross sub weapon, which is only really good when you run out of MP and need an alternative to your magic infused whip. (because normal whip is weak AF) Also, in game there is no bestiary for finding out what enemies drop what and where they can be found, basically requiring a guide to actually allow you to survive. Another major feature of the game besides DSS is the class system. Unfortunately, new classes are locked behind beating the game multiple times, and since this game is brutally hard in the most unfair of ways, good luck with that. You start with the hunter class, who is the base class who can do everything but excels at nothing. Beating the game with the Hunter unlocks the Fighter, who cannot use magic at all but their STR and DEF are buffed by 500%. I'm not joking. Beating Fighter Mode unlocks Wizard Mode, who has weak STR and DEF (the most important stats) but high INT (the most useless stat) and has access to all DSS cards from the beginning, which is useless because you can already access nearly every DSS card from the beginning due to an infamous glitch. Worst mode by far. If you are somehow able to beat wizard mode you unlock Thief Mode, who has incredibly low stats (even lower than wizard) but has 9999 luck, guaranteeing drops for every enemy. So basically only play Fighter once you unlock him and don't bother with the other modes, and play Hunter if it's your first time or you want to use magic. So yeah, while having some really good ideas, Circle of the Moon flops in nearly every other category. 4/10. Do not play. Even Harmony of Dissonance was better than this.. I had a hard time. It was probably the hardest castlevania game I've ever played. Even C3 wasn't that hard. The map of the game tired me a lot. Level design is not very good. Teleport rooms are too far away. Enemies are very difficult, there are enemies that constantly poison and freeze. The bosses were the hardest game bosses I've ever seen in my life. For some reason, our health does not regenerate after bosses. My damage to Bosses is very low, but I take more damage. I don't like the card system, you have to farm it all the time. That's why I was able to collect half of it. You have to farm hearts too. Potions are hard to collect. I wish the game had a shop system. At least I would get potions, I wouldn't spend that much time on bosses. The variety of items was also very less. Game controls weren't good either. Really mediocre compared to Aria and Dawn of **** tell the truth. It pushed me so hard. I died hundreds of times, but I finished the game. Still, master players knows how to enjoy this game. And not bad for the year.. My rate for this game: 8.5 ............................................... .. this game and konami can **** my **** how konami allowed this piece of sh1et being released? it's hard and unbalanced vertical castle map? wtf save points and teleport devices are terribly positioned not to mention the goddamn drop rate, you can barely collect healing itens from monster, you have to camp save points all the time, EVERYTHING good in this game has to be droped, and it has a fuccing low drop rate and don't come here and tell me i don't know how to play this ****, bcs i beat this crap and i'm based enough to say all of this and saying again, fucc konami. This game isn't awful, but it certainly isn't very good. The general exploration and gameplay mechanics work just fine, the spell and card system is actually pretty neat and allows you to customize some of your abilities to suit your playstyle and/or the situation. However, outside of that, the game is mediocre at best. The controls are very stiff, and I had notable issues with some of my inputs not registering. Honestly, the movement in this game just doesn't feel good, everything seems sluggish, stiff, and sometimes feels unresponsive. The difficulty outside of bosses is actually fine for the most part, with only a few very annoying enemies that aren't any fun to deal with. The bosses, though, the bosses are just BAD. The first third or so of the game seems fine, but once you get to about the halfway point in the game, the bosses turn into giant, slow to fight, masochistic damage sponges. This game is far from unplayable, but when the bosses make you want to quit playing the game every time you try and fight them until the game is over, the game isn't very good.. Castlevania Circle Of The Moon is a Fantastic game and my favorite metroidvania,The graphics and soundtrack are amazing,one of The best castlevania games. At first, I was somewhat doubtful but when I played the first hour I was playing with a smile and having a lot of fun. If you have played Metroid or another 2D Castlevania you know the drill, unlock abilities, backtrack, unlock abilities and then backtrack some more, this formula still works great in this title. The challenge is good for the most part and the music is on par. I really liked some characters and some moments that feel truly iconic, like Camila that feeling that Hugh (your rival character) gives to you that you're racing each other, that being said I have some issues that go in the way for this to be a 9 or 9.5. The first one is that at times, some bosses feel more annoying than challenging, and that goes for the final boss. I didn't need to make any grind till that point because my damage was ridiculous. My second issue comes from the item and card system, I'm not that fan of getting your powerups in easy mode but I also don't like to make like 2 hours of mindless grinding and be luck dependant, it robs the all the fun and transforms the game into a chore. Putting my complaints aside I really enjoyed Circle of the Moon, maybe is not as iconic as Symphony of the Night but I don't think they're that far from each other.. This game is overrated at 8.5. I started off this review with a score of 7 because I enjoyed the exploration initially but disliked the controls. Ultimately, I reduced it to a 5 for ""hit or miss"". This game suffers for the same reason that made Super Castlevania IV bad: masochistically hard bosses. Circle of the Moon recycles the clunky controls of the Simon Belmont era of Castlevania games, and reincorporates inconveniences like bidirectional whip, no potions, and horrendously slow movement if you don't constantly run. There is no mention on how to use weapon items (which, apart from the Boomerang, all **** for that matter), or what the significance of the DSS system is (and how grindy it is to get anything decent to use it with). Because there are basically no potions, some areas can be annoying to traverse due to enemies that are hard to get past and constantly whittle down your health. Bosses are randomly spread across the map, which means you can get lost figuring out where to go next and are expected to blindly search around. Halfway into the game, you will encounter two bosses with insane health pools that will always beat you through attrition. They're not downright impossible, but they're certainly frustrating and would need several hundred tries to even get close to beating them (if you don't get physically exhausted first). If you're the kind of gamer who likes to play blind and doesn't like grinding for hours, preserve your sanity and just move onto the next game. Overall, the boss difficulty and clunky controls heavily weighed on my rating and interest in this game. If you can tolerate poor balancing and mindless grinding, it's a semi-decent Metroidvania to try if you spoil yourself and use to a guide to tell you exactly everything to collect to make your life easier. Otherwise, I struggle to see how this game deserves any more than at best a 6. If you were to look online yourself, everyone unanimously agrees that those two bosses are the hardest in the game, even more so than the final boss. That's just ridiculous.. One of my favorite GBA games. The card system is very fun to play with and the whole game works and has aged well. I've completed it like 5 times already and surely will do it again in the future.. An absolute fantastic game. With great graphics, the genius double card system, five unique playthroughs each changing the way you do combat, and the fantastic story. This is a must have GBA game that you should definitely play. One of my all time favorite Gameboy Advance games, and by far my favorite 2D Castlevania game. What's amazing is how well the game has aged, it's still an absolute blast to play thanks to the varied Card system which makes for a great gameplay, and it's absolutely beautiful to look at thanks to the great art direction. Playing it on a modern smartphone through emulation really does the game justice and allows you appreciate how beautiful the game is. A true masterpiece.. This game is the best castlevania to date! It's got tight controls, and great challenge. It also does a great job with the sub weapons, they are super useful. The story isn't really there but somehow still does the job. Its a masterpiece.. An amazing portable Castlevania that takes place outside the main story of the older games. It has beautifull 2d graphics, one of the best music for a GBA game and tons of unlockable modes. With clever design that encourages exploration and backtracking, rewarding difficulty and some of the coolest boss fights this is a masterpiece surely you don't want to miss.. Definitely not as good as Aria of Sorrow, or even Harmony of Dissonance for that matter, in my opinion. The game is quite nice in itself. The graphics are all right, the music is really great (lots of great remixes of classic Castlevania tracks too), and the gameplay is fun, even though the controls are a bit of a pain. The main issue I have with this title is that the difficulty is way too high. Now maybe that's a good thing if you want a challenge. However with RPG-style games such as this, it just becomes annoying to be forced to spend hours on level grinding just so you can at least survive against the next boss. It dramatically breaks the pace of the game and as a result you even forget the story and what was happening all along. You just circle between half a dozen rooms, killing enemies over and over and over. Other than that it's a fun game, so if you don't mind spending tonnes of time on levelling up, you should enjoy it. Otherwise I'd suggest for you to try Harmony of Dissonance or yet better Aria of Sorrow. In fact try those anyway if you like this style of games.. Well, Aria of Sorrow was a must-play game, but Circle of Moon is not bad either , but is just a shame that the Belmonts are missing and the game is not that **** game got realistic graphics, amazing tunes and decent **** same thing to the NES Castlevania **** this game is I don't know too HARD!!!!This game don't got an 9, I am really sorry..............","the game controls stiff and that's one of my bigger issues with this title especially since movement has normally been very good in this franchise . the card system, or DSS, feels clunky and uninspired . combat is challenging, with a scarcity of healing items making the trek to boss fights frustrating ."
266.Caves of Qud,"Caves of Qud is a masterpiece of procedural storytelling and emergent gameplay, delivering one of the most unique and immersive experiences in the roguelike genre. The game offers a rich, strange world filled with lore, mutant powers, and countless possibilities for creative problem-solving.. The best roguelike ever, and if played like an RPG, probably the best open world RPG ever too. Features astounding depth and freedom in gameplay, but it's the incredibly unique setting and evocative writing that makes this a world begging to be unraveled layer by layer. Almost 300 hours in and every time I boot it up, I'm surprised and awed by something new guaranteed.. It is simply the best traditional roguelike in existance. Fantastical in both it's writing and setting this sci-fyi adventure achieves it's vision after over a decade of consistant development. Bravo.. Prose and poetry are divided by an artifice long since eroded in the rust caves. Qud is not a powerhouse in the sense of slamming pistons and burning engine-fires. It is a tectonic shift on the scale of ages, subtle but unstoppable. To give oneself over to the contemplation of eons proves a tall barrier of entry to some, but those that crest the lip of the mesa see a new vista on all-worlds spill out before them. Chance the climb. Plumb the depths. Seek the Spindle that pierces the insensate world of screaming men. Learn anew to listen and to speak.. This is the best game of the year, and my 2nd-favorite RPG behind Disco Elysium. The graphics, harsh RNG-based difficulty, and lack of memorable characters might be a turn-off for some. But the mechanics and world-building are simply incredible, and it is astonishing that a game so large is still just as fun as NetHack or Brogue. What an achievement.","caves of qud is a masterpiece of procedural storytelling and emergent gameplay . the game offers a rich, strange world filled with lore, mutant powers, and countless possibilities . if played like an RPG, probably the best open world RPG ever too ."
267.Resident Evil 2,"this game is just perfect leon and claire are really great characters this game is capcom's masterpiece. I am in love with this game, except for the puzzle part (which is %90 of the game). The graphics are amazing, the music is amazing, and the story is absolutely top-notch. You really feel for the characters. The storytelling is better than any movie or TV show. A masterpiece that I want to experience over and over again.. Great comeback! Capcom really nailed it with this remake. Great mixture from the past and the present.. This is like if you made the best handheld game ever and put it to the maximum potential you usually joke about, its so simple but so impressive. fluid fluid fluid fluid fluid.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don't even know where to start, excellent graphics, the soundtrack is amazing and the tension I felt throughout the game has a special place in my heart, a game worth a minimum of 10.. The best in the series. I really enjoyed the beginning of this one especially when the story began perfectly understandable during the game.. The best horror shooter on the market period. Super replayable. Finely developed. Its spooky. It's got good progression. Player decision is top priority it's up to you to make tough decisions in order to survive, but the secret is no matter what you do you'll still progress the game. Sure, it's a Resident Evil game so it is a little campy but that's just its charm. It's a great shooter and an even better horror game. Play it.. Resident evil 2 remake is the perfect exemple of what a modern horror game should be, he mixed fight, horror and enigme perfectly. We can reproch him to be a little short even if this a part of this licence. This is also a very good example of a remake for video games, he has enough new things for justify the remake while remaining faithfull of the original material.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great puzzles, map size, acceptable amount of backtracking, strong zombies (several bullets, even headshots before they go down), immersive sound design, I can go on. I've been waiting 20 years for a legit RE game and this delivers... and not fake delivers like RE7+8. RE2 is an uncompromised classic RE experience.. What a hell of a remake, is one of the best games ive have ever played, mainly because the story is great, the gameplay is really good, the caracthershave really great models and personalities, and of course the boss fights and Mr X as a whole are near perfection, the game is even better than the original, great work by capcom.. I don't like the olds resident evil games but the remake of the 2 makes it much better. This is the only game that i finished many times but don't bore me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredibly fun! There are not many games I Immediately fall in love with, but this was one of them. This game is the opposite of Resident Evil 4 Remake. The combat isn't as good or fleshed out, but the puzzles and item management elements completely make up for it.. Well this still feels like an really old, outdated game with good graphics. I think it only suits those old school fans who played the original games. As someone who started (console) gaming around 2018 this felt way too clunky compared to basically any other games.. Resident evil 2. Best story out of the games imo, but those blind crawlers are horrible. Incredible game! (Masterpiece) | Resident Evil 2 Remake | 100 Points (5 Stars) | Story 10P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 10P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. A very solid survival horror. Story is solid, not too long nor with a lot of depth but its characters are very iconic, memorable and fun and the plot and sequences inmerses you and keeps you interested and curious. Depending on who you choose you get another story and both of them are really worth to experience for that reason alone. Its good, not a masterpiece sure but for what its worth its really nice. Enviroments are incredible. Everything is well designed and feels just right. Traversing the RCPD, The underground and labs is a rollercoaster of emotions fear, tense, cautivating, surprising, and very atmospheric. Backtracking is fun unlike in a lot of games, puzzles could be a tad better but they work and makes you think. It rewards exploration very nicely and you have to make a lot of decisions all the time. Gameplay is very solid you have a wide enough selection of weapons that changes depending on who you choose. enemy variety is good enough altough there could have been more non human zombie enemies to be careful but its a solid choice. You are making decisions constantly killing or not killing is a thing to think about; Should i kill them? the area would be clear and i can traverse it easier, plus maybe they drop something like a knife, but more could respawn and you can end up wasting a lot of bullets, crippling them is very safe, you barely waste bullets on an area that you can avoid going back and the ammount you use is consistent but passing trough a crippled one is still risky always, and maybe you need to return more than you tought, plus you could get a crit while headshotting to barely waste bullets and ensure a zombie doesnt come back. Mr X is incredible too, tall, menacing and scary with imponent footsteps and can show up on unexpected places he isnt too prominent but when he is there, you wish he wasnt. Incredible price of 10$ on sale, good replayability and reaches a big enough audience, wether you like casual and short, Hardcore searching for a perfect score and time. Side note: This has more action than it has horror, it can be scary at times and very rarely relies on jumpscares to scare you, so if you go searching to get scared this at best will barely scratch your itch. ""A remarkable game with incredible graphics, considered some of the best in the gaming world. The story is thrilling, and the gameplay is enjoyable. I enjoyed playing Claire's part more than Leon's. Playing as Sherry in the Hide and Seek segment was really fun. The story is fantastic, especially its connection with Resident Evil 0. I was deeply moved by Annette and her husband. The appearance of Ada Wong was amazing.From my perspective, the negatives were Mr. X's ending, the similarity between Leon and Claire's scenarios, and let's not forget the poor sewer section."". This is what most remasters/remakes should be, this game remakes what made the game good while expanding on it at the same time just adding on to the eerie feeling of the police station and what lurks in the darkness of it.. They just grabbed what made the original so acclaimed and then improved what was already loved.. This remake is a masterpiece. It's just as great as ""Resident Evil 7"" and the GameCube's ""Resident Evil"". The RE Engine is utilized wonderfully. You'll be amazed at the visuals. While the original RE 2 is a longer game, this version adds many new twists. The action is terrific, but the horror is what makes this version so good. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.3 out of 10.. Shockingly good remake. Drips with tension, doesn't skimp on the gore. The controls are perfectly balanced for the kind of game this wants to be. The environments are spooky. The puzzles are fun. Every enemy encounter is terrifying and could end in disaster. Succeeds on nearly every level and is a must-play for fans of horror and the titular series.. The game was really wonderful, an excellent remake, I really experienced the feeling of fear and stress in this game and I enjoyed it. Thank you Capcom for its unique games.. Story =1.75 Narrative of the story =2 Characterizations =1.75 Gameplay =1.75 Graphic =1.75 Result => 9/10. I dont know why everyone liked this game so much, i really think that its overrated. Really dissapointing game.. Amazing game I had never played the classic 2 but I believe this game got the message across Excellent gameplay and graphics, very well optimized game Capcom is to be congratulated l. Leon’s first adventure is fantastic; I absolutely loved it. I’m a huge fan of the Resident Evil franchise, especially since one of the games in the series is my favorite. I could never have played it in the old format, so for me, this game is excellent and provides an amazing experience.. 7-8 headshots to kill a zombie?! What's the point of shooting? I've known the game since the late 90s, and it always seems strange to me that you can't melee : / - instead we got a useless knife! why do you have to dodge poor zombies like each one of them is nemesis, instead of kicking them in the head or something! And enough with the healing herbs, the police station is full of them in case of a zombie attack right?! Mr. X! What the hell is this guy’s story - he is walking around freely and nothing can be done about him! I just started the game, a few left turns, a few right turns, 25 percent of the game is complete, why should I play from jill’s point of view for the same lame experience! Bottom line - a nostalgic game, nice idea, mediocre execution. This is a very good survival horror game. You take on the role of either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop, or Claire Redfield, the sister of special forces agent Chris Redfield from the first Resident evil (and RE5, RE6 and Village), as they try to survive a zombie apocalypse. As of writing this review I have only played the Leon campaign and started on the Claire campaign. The atmosphere is great in this game. The dim lighting, the sounds from the zombies, the design of the zombies all fit together perfectly. But there are some aspects that drag this game down. While it's really cool to try to avoid zombies and survive, what I don't appreciate are the puzzles. I know that is a thing from the original game, and it does scream 90s video game, but it didn't really click with me. I appreciate a good puzzle, but the way it's done in this game sometimes just seems illogical and out of place. The police station that the majority of the game plays out in is a really cool place, but why are there so many weird puzzles? They try to explain it as the station being a refurbished museum, but when have you ever seen a museum with escape room level puzzles? It takes me out of the game a bit, because it doesn't seem fitting. Some puzzles absolutely do fit, but it usually just involves you running to a safe room, getting the stuff you already picked up for the puzzle, then running through to get to the puzzle or find the item and then run to the puzzle. Due to the way you solve most puzzles, the tension from the survival horror atmosphere diminishes in my opinion. I think puzzles where you have to use clues and solve something is better than puzzles where you just have to find the corresponding item because it's quite obvious what you need to solve it. What is absolutely worst in this game is the follower mechanic. Minor spoilers ahead. In the game, there is this giant of a man who appears in front of you at one point. He's invincible, can only be staggered if you're willing to waste your scarce amount of ammunition on him and he follows you. If you manage to outrun him, he will search for you everywhere. This sounds like a decent idea for a survival horror game on paper, but considering the gameplay loop of finding an item get back to a puzzle, solve the puzzle where the item and the puzzle are usually on wildly different parts of the map, this becomes less of a scary system and more of an annoyance that's just hindering your progress. It's just not that interesting. I like the game, it has really good atmosphere and the inventory management, the story and the characters are really well done. It just has some annoying parts to it.. Resident Evil 2 offers a major enhancement from its predecessor through the RE Engine. This shouldn't be a surprise per say when looking at a game more than twenty years part, but it still adds to realistic character models, such as Claire and Leon looking like they are able to step out of the screen , alongside some eerily photorealistic environments. The only thing which is a slight shame about the RE2's visuals is that it doesn't really feel like a major visual improvement from Resident Evil 7 (2017), despite nearly two years difference in graphics. Although noticeably a little more action-packed than its 1998 counterpart, there are certainly going to be more than a few moments in this game where you'll get more than the odd terrifying jumpscare ( alongside its terrific audio). Still, much like its older predecessor, Resident Evil 2 embraces the stakes to make it feel more like a test of survival than purely guns blazing combat. In between limited resources, puzzles and thinking more about strategy around each corner, the game's addition of rotated camera angles modernises survival horror for a new generation. ( Ada and Sherry's gameplay being classic examples, alongside your encounters with Mr.X.) The Racoon City Police Department is up there with the Spenser Mansion in terms of design. In between its eery corridors, the uncertainty of new areas and the odd calmness of the main hall, the game really goes above and beyond to deliver a terrifying setting. The game also offers in-game rewards for completing challenges or attaining ranks on difficulty levels, allowing players to unlock unique weapons or additional modes such as Ghost Survivors, "" alternate"" scenarios, with unique perspectives ( Hunk and Katherine's being particularly good fun) which is equally challenging (if not slightly more) than the main game. However, much like the original, the remake does offer players an opportunity to play as two characters; Leon S.Kennedy or Claire Redfield, with the "" A"" storyline being the first unlockable, closely followed by the unlockable ""B"" storyline. While there are some issues with the coherency between both routes ( which will be covered in cons), Leon and Claire's storylines are equally as interesting as one another. ( With the return of some familiar faces.)The game also offers the return of classic difficulty levels. ( Be warned that it may be better even for experienced players to start on normal, as hardcore offers very limited saves and resources.) One major weakness of the game has to come through the coherency between its storylines. Simply put there is a lot which just doesn't add up between Leon and Claire's routes. In the original, this was fixed slightly by Claire B and Leon A working together to build up the narrative. In the remake, the same can't be said including the lack of interactions between both characters. The other issue is that while there are some subtle differences ( such as encounters) between Claire and Leon's routes, a lot of it just mimics the other's storyline meaning there isn't a lot of variation or decent pacing between them. ( As well as becoming slightly more tedious in replays.) The voice-acting is admittedly a bit of a mixed bag here, with some decent deliveries at times, as well as some more questionable dialogue. The only other slight gripe which occurs with the remake is the odd glitching which can occur with backdrop settings taking a bit load, or alternatively zombies twitching or moving after being downed. It doesn't affect gameplay a lot, but it does sometimes take a bit from the moment. Overall thoughts; Overall, Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a classic reimagining of an original title in the series, brought to life for a new generation and console. Its visuals are pretty impressive and it brings to life old-school horror in a way which feels modernized and equally terrifying. Mr.X's improved AI is a brilliant enhancement to gameplay, while the zombies noticebly can move a lot quicker than their predecessors. While the game does struggle with its writing and glitching, it does make up for it slightly in environment and gameplay.. this game is absolutely amazing, I love it and Ienjoyed it from the beginning until the end. As someone who has never played OG Resident Evil 2 but watched some videos and read articles, this remake is very well made and almost close to perfection and a very well remake of the 1998 masterpiece. The atmosphere, graphics, the vibes, its own essence, enemies, map design, story, sound design is a one in a million. The lickers and Mr. X scared the out of me a few times at the point that it made me scream lmao. The feeling of oppression and hopeless in the air of a decaying police station and Raccoon City is something that I barely experienced in a videogame. Puzzles are really well made and makes you think just a little bit but are very nice to do.Nevertheless, I gotta say that the 2nd run, in my case was with Claire and some aspects didn't make any kind of sense. For example, how Claire (in my case) needs to do the same puzzles that Leon does in the 1st run. I understand that is obviously a game design thing but cmon. How do you fight the same William Birkin?Zombies... bullet sponges, that's it. Even if you shoot them 7 times in the face, there they are, still livin'. No more to say.Despite all of its flaws, I clearly understand why people call this ""The best remake of all time"". I thought: ""Is this game THAT good?"". After I tried it, yes it is. If you want probably the best zombies experience in a game, go and buy this game, even if you don't want a zombie experience but a good game, go, what are you waiting for.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After only playing the first-person Resident Evil games, going back and playing the remakes of 2 & 3 to experience the classic formula was an absolute delight. Beginning the journey with Resident Evil 2, I quickly became charmed with the puzzle-progression formula that paired perfectly with the survival horror elements. Being trapped in a police station and trying to escape, getting excited every time I find a new key or another piece to a puzzle, these feelings reminded me of everything I love about Metroid games but with a twist. I was always terrified when the Tyrant would chase after me, but the satisfaction of escaping him brought me relief equal to the joy of solving the puzzles. The story beats always kept me engaged, and I loved both Leon and Claire equally both as protagonists and in terms of their stories. Leon’s witty comebacks and Claire being an absolute badass made both equally fun to play, and gave me two journeys worth experiencing. I had no idea when I started this game how I would feel about a puzzle-adventure, but the result ended up being a unique experience I am happy I had.. Another greatest remake of all **** have everything that make this game great. It do have some cut content and both scenarios are mainly same but it do at little bit of something. I wish it have some more similarities with original but overall it is the greatest remake of all time.. An absolutely terrifying experience that ended up overstaying its welcome and being boring by the end. At the sewer section and beyond the intriguing narrative and atmosphere created during the first half of the game gives way to campy plot and much more boring linear game design. Theres still fun to be had but its all the more frustrating when it comes right after the masterpiece that is the opening.. An almost perfect remake to a perfect game. The redesign RPD station looks fantastic, they added bathrooms which apparently was a missing component from the original. The only downside would be the removal of puzzles from the original and the overthe shoulder camera angle is less horrifying than the classic fixed camera angles that made it feel like a true horror movie.. One of the best re of all time .. Resident Evil 2 is a polished, respectful remake of a survival horror classic that probably would have benefited from a slightly more daring approach. Hints of a braver revamp are sprinkled throughout, but it doesn’t take the risks necessary to join the canon of truly great video game remakes. Make no mistake though, if you loved the original Resident Evil 2, you’ll likely love the remake, and new players who can tolerate a few old-school quirks ought to have gruesome good time as well.. This is a great puzzle game, I like this game, special when you play with claire the game will be more beautiful, because I really like her. Both stories are really great and how perfectly they complement each other, and I wish there would be a romantic relationship between Lion and Claire, they would be a good couple, maybe it will happen in the new Resident Evils (the one score I reduced has nothing to do with this). Compared to whether Claire is chosen or Lion in the police station, there are significant changes in the type of solving puzzles, while there is no difference in the next stages, which I don't think is very interesting and should be considered in other stages like the police station. Changes were made to the selected character and another point is that only the sound of opening the locked doors is played from the speaker controller, which in my opinion was possible to play more sounds from the speaker controller and increased the consumption of the speaker controller. Overall I really enjoyed this game and i like this game.. Probably the best survival horror game I’ve played so far. Not that I’ve played many - The Evil Within, RE7, Outlast 2, and that’s about it because I’ve never been a fan of the genre. Fortunately, the game isn’t long enough to become tedious, and just as I started scratching my head, the end credits rolled, so that’s cool. I was a bit wary of the classic, genre-typical immortal adversary (because I’m more of a ‘beat everything that jumps out’ fan rather than a ‘hide/run’ fan), but luckily, there’s not too much of that here, so it didn’t bother me in the end. I completed the game as Leon, clocking in at 8.5 hours. I don’t really feel like doing a second playthrough, especially since I’m planning to play Dead Space and RE3 in Xbox Game Pass. Overall, I give it a thumbs up and move on.. A classic masterpiece remade it! We hope for a res 1 with shoulder cam release for ps5. Arguably the real start to the series modern renaissance, breathtaking graphics, stellar voice acting, grotesque enemy design and an enthralling environment prove once again why Resident Evil reached such heights in it's prime, and why it can do so again.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pretty good modernization, main gripes are just the music (for the most part) being no where near as good as the original and cut content.. Amazing horrifying remake!!! Made me fall in love with RE all over again!!!!. This was my first experience with the RE games and boy oh boy, it did not disappoint.. the game made me scared to leave the safe room I thought it was a great atmosphere the zombies were really cool the laboratory phase scared me a lot because of the platans men excellent game. Best Resident evil Game in recent years IT Still holds Up being the best good Job Capcom. This is a must play game, I had such a fun time playing this remake and really got me in to playing RE games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Resident evil Game so Far Hope capcom makes more Games Like this maybe Code Veronica or 1 in the Style Like 2. Resident evil 4 wasnt that great sadly not a true Resident evil Game thats why i didnt bought IT you can do it again Capcom. Terrific remake, very realistic creactions and guns pawer damage. The graphics look amazing for being a PS4 original game.. While good for the initial play throughs, the game kinda losses a lot after rpd, and when I did Replays of the game for the plat it just feel like a chore, good game terrible replay value. No mods no fun. CAPCOM is as evil as umbralla. Tried over 30 mods, none of them worked. This is too far.. UA: Це була перша моя гра з серії, в яку я грав. Геймплейно - це безумовний шедевр і я розумію, чому в свій час ця серія ігор стала такою революційною та задала вектор розвитку survival-горрорам. Візуально ремастер виглядає також максимально круто. Але весь сюжет та персонажі виглядають, як іронія та висміювання, хоча певно на той момент це просто було нормою. Наприклад одна з головних героїнь їбошить пів гри в ночнушці по каналізації, параллельно вбиваючи десятки зомбі, що виглядає дуже мемним. Головний персонаж - чел з синдромом ""хорошого хлопця"", який теж видає велику кількість крінджу. Всі репліки та сюжетні повороти - суцільний ****: This was the first game in the series I ever played. Gameplay-wise, it's an absolute masterpiece and I understand why this series of games was so revolutionary in its time and set the vector for the development of survival horror. Visually, the remaster also looks as cool as possible. But the whole plot and characters looked like irony and ridicule, although it was probably just the norm at the time. For example, one of the main characters spends half of the game in a nightie in the sewers, killing dozens of zombies at the same time, which looks very memorable. The main character is a guy with a ""good guy"" syndrome, who also gives off a lot of cringle. All the lines and plot twists are a solid meme.. Great game, really bad dialogue, from writing and from delivery, CAPCOM really seems greedy just firing VA's because they are unionized. Beautiful graphics. Only this. The characters are too slow, cannot melee attack or push the zombies. Very frustrating gameplay. Resident Evil 2 Remake brilliantly revitalizes a survival horror classic, immersing players in the hauntingly atmospheric Raccoon City. The game excels in its cinematic presentation, with stunning graphics and revamped controls that enhance the overall experience. The dynamic storytelling, coupled with intense survival elements, keeps players engaged throughout. While some criticize occasional awkward character movements and simplistic puzzles, these minor issues are overshadowed by the game's overall achievement in seamlessly blending nostalgia with modern gameplay. Resident Evil 2 Remake sets a high standard for remakes, offering a gripping and visually impressive journey through the horrors of the iconic police station and beyond.. Nice looking remaster. Old school gameplay feels old. Instead of a tense shooter or startling horror game, this game mostly felt like a sedate puzzler. The fault may be mine. I’ve played so many games that I can see the boss levels coming, know the need to hoard materials, and have pre-built strategies for dealing with enemy pathfinding. Where the game shines is in the presentation. The game engine looks good. Fire, water, and exploding heads are all well done. The game also equips the player with fun weapons. The story is alright for a 1990s game. This was before games like “The Last of Us” upped the stakes for storytelling. The game does not shine in its Metroidvania backtracking and forcing players to manage inventory with key items and ammo. I tell you, 8 grenades takes up more space than one car key. Solving little puzzles is fun. Running through the same rooms over and over, looking for the clue you missed, is not fun. I understand the difficulty of game makers in making these environments in the 1990s and the difficulty of a PlayStation of that ear in handling any area larger than a few rooms. In some ways, this game is like a museum piece, and I do appreciate the fidelity to the original gameplay. All-in-all, this is a decent game. The game as a product has a lot of extra material included different story paths for each play though. I just did not find myself engaged with this game to the point that I did not want to play anything else. I unfortunately found this game to be too much of a chore.. Best game of the past 4 years. A true remake unlike RE3R. Anyone that doesn't like this game just doesn't like Survival Horror. I can understand complaints of cut content, especially between the two scenarios. But it's still not enough to hate the game. Puzzle solving, backtracking, item management, sandbox environments...that's always been apart of true Survival Horror. The newbies think Evil Within and RE4 are Survival Horror, and they're not. RE4 and RE4R are classics, but they're more action than horror.. Finally a good resi. Is enyone else scared of the game and the zombies ? I am scared and i still die all the time. -7/10 story -10/10 gameplay -10/10 environments -7/10 characters -7/10 music. The best remake out of the remake’s not counting 2002 remake. It has the scary feeling that some of us that played the og remember for the first time. The environment even add to the horror theme in my option the perfect resident remake.. Definitely my top favourite zombie game, getting to play as both characters and solve puzzles while killing zombies I loved it definitely recommend playing. Good game, better than X-Men 2, better than even X-Men 1, but worse than Devil May Cry X. One of the best remakes out there. True definition of survival horror. A masterpiece.. Complete game perfect gameplay, charismatic characters and a game that has almost no defects in its great proposal from beginning to end.. I loved the first couple hours but it stalled out midway through and felt like a slog to finish. Especially, when it dawned on me that the location really wasn't going to change much and I would do a ton of fetching items, stupid puzzle solving, and backtracking--lots of backtracking. How is this considered a great remake? Critics really need to get the nostalgia glasses off and be more professional. Some reviews read like fanboy fluff pieces. Yeah, we know you rented the original from Blockbuster when you were twelve years old.. I completed both Leon (easy difficulty) and Claire's (normal difficulty) stories and I can say that I'm satisfied with my exprience. It's obvious that we have a high-budget AAA game that is a great exemple about how remakes should be done. I played on PS5 with Ray Tracing activated and wow ! The graphics are super great ! The game is really immersive, especially if you play with a good headset. I must admit that I didn't had a lot of experience with the survival horror genre before and I have the tendency to use a lot of items in games. So, that was not the best mix for my first playthrough with Leon. I even reached a point where I had just one save file and I became stucked with almost no ammo and items. I had to switch to easy difficulty at this time ! I still enjoyed the rest of the playthrough. I found funny that I had a best time with Claire's campaign when I got back in this game almost 6 months after having completed Leon's story. I completely understand the fact that this game is viewed as a masterpiece but I guess that my lack of experience with this genre of game undermined my first playthrough. I'm giving it a strong 8 ! Here are other positive notes: 1. The puzzles are really well built 2. The cutscenes are great ! 3. The PS5 version is well optimized. Some people may find the game a bit slow but I think it's designed this way (I mean that the characters must walk carefully and not« speedrunning » the area.. It's a complete headache... the controls are terrible... the camera rotation made me dizzy and I deleted the game immediately... I'm sorry but this game is a complete flop for me.... Very good remake. The graphics are at a high level and the gameplay itself has improved. I haven't played the 98 version, but even people who played then consider the remake to be a better version.. One of the best games ever made. I grow up on this series and Resident Evil 2 and 4 were some of my favorite games of all time. Both this remake and RE2 remake are now the best RE games ever made!. I awesome game and horror andpick one up Halloween and good story and good day. This game does many things differently than the original, yet it still retain","i am in love with this game, except for the puzzle part (%90 of the game) the graphics are amazing, the music is amazing, and the story is absolutely top-notch . this is like if you made the best handheld game ever and put it to the maximum potential ."
268.Satisfactory,"Satisfactory is a wonderful factory game with enough challenges to last a while. In addition to having a great factory, the story is great and funny. Once you give Satisfactory a try, I can assure you'll grow to love the story and factory aspects.. An absolute masterpiece, the game is amazing; the mechanics are on high level, the playtime limit is limitless and also we can say this game is an upgraded 3d version of Factorio.. It does a 3D first person factory builder to perfection. Runs smooth, zero issues and the atmosphere is great.. I have sunk many hours into this game. Through the alpha, beta, and all that early development stuff. Coffee Stain has been a great studio to experience early access with. They've been doing their best to work with the community, provide updates and listen to feedback. It's not hard to tell that this is a passion project, one which years have been invested into. It feels like there's more passion in this game then any AAA title in the recent years. The exploring is fun. The building is fun. Every time you automate something, put hours into a factory, all of it is just so satisisfying. A game that never gets boring, never stagnates. You can pour hours into this game without even noticing. I deducted one point because there are still some bugs and crashes. However, these are very rare and (except for the crashes) don't impact the gameplay. It's definitely not a buggy mess though, the bugs are very minor. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves exploring, base building and automation.. Gets a bit too grindy later one for my taste. I know that this is the point, but beware, if you are already in a complex job on daytime this game might be too much for you.. This game is glitchy and crashes at random. It can't be played even after 1.0 release.. With over 400 hours I can say this is my “game of the year”. Once I delivered my final payload I was full of excitement followed by a sense of despair that the game was over… this is in my top 5 of all time favorite games for sure.. The game might not be completely bug free, but instead of making the game worse, they make the game more fun, because some players use these bugs to create new things in the game and show it on social platforms. Also the developers listen to the ideas and critics of the community, so that the game is more fun for everybody, without having a large setback because negative reviews.. this game to have bought it before 1.0 it has been a perfect factory and automation game. However if you do not like grinding then this game is not for you and if you take a while before playing it again it can be hard to continue with a past save. If you like these type of games then I would recommend it and the best part is that there are no in game purchases right now and the dev listen to us they even added the ability to flush the toilet because people wanted it.. Satisfactory has its name well chosen because it is about building automated factories while being very satisfying once you see the result. The game starts pretty small with a decent introduction on how to do stuff. The basics are easily learned. It then quickly starts to expand and provides a lot of things to explore and try out while never forcing you to rush anything. If you enjoy the creation of bigger and bigger production chains with various tools to additionally add buildings or transport goods from one place to another you'll likely have a good time here. It's like a puzzle game where you also use math to fit the pieces together and make it produce the desired numbers products. There is one map that you can explore and exploit to your hearts content which has 4 different spawn points that will affect difficulty somewhat. There are a number of collectibles which are all related to and useful for your production chains. It's not just for some silly achievement. Exploring actually provides something of value even though I'll also admit that times it can become somewhat tedious due to the sheer amount of things you can find and collect. It is also important to mention that Satisfactory does not come with any additional cost. When you buy the game you get all of it. There are no Microtransactions which is always a big plus. The game is designed with Co-op in mind meaning the core aspects somewhat are intended to be used with multiple people playing together. Still you can enjoy it solo as well. But even while playing solo the game somewhat behaves like an online server (you can't really pause the game through the game menu). Satisfactory has some flaws though. As mentioned above some aspects in exploration as well as the construction can become somewhat tedious. Especially if you decide to start over on a new map having to search for a lot of the same things again to unlock specific recipes can become more of a nuisance than an exciting adventure. And the less exploration you do (especially early on) the more time you spent creating factories as the standard recipes especially for later products can be very resource and construction intense where you suddenly are supposed to build over a hundred production facilities with respective connections to get everything you need together. You can use blueprints to optimize that process somewhat but the size for these blueprints is limited and their usability often cumbersome. It's enough to build basic modules but very difficult to prepare entire factories. So the construction of factories can become a time consuming process - especially if you misjudge or misplace sections of your factory and have to start over or do extensive adjustments. Still once you complete a project and you see exactly the number you expect to get (meaning your production chain runs optimal) then it is very satisfying to see. One more aspect that I see somewhat critical are road vehicles. By default none of the maps have any roads. They are undeveloped worlds afterall. You can construct a number of vehicles to use in your playthroughs. All have different strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are intentionally designed to automatically transport goods around the world. The problem though is that without roads that becomes a bit of a tricky operation (the AI seems to have problems with path finding). So you may want to build roads. But the construction of roads is a pain to deal with as there are no good tools available for that. You'd have to create blueprints to cover that but even with blueprints creating roads with corners, ups and downs is very time consuming and annoying. The game has trains in it and building train tracks seems to be pretty good (which is why trains are the preferred transport option in later parts of the game). it doesn't have something like that for roads though. So there is no 2-way lane road pathing out of the box which is why are required to create your own modules and fiddle around with those. It's unfortunate and makes road vehicles limited in their usage but at least there is an option. And if necessary you can always create conveyer belt spaghetti instead... Anyway the game is fun to play even with its flaws. For the first playthrough it is recommended to do it without guides and explore it on your own. it's massive and will easily provide you with over a hundred hours of playtime without reaching the end of the game. I'm not sure on the replayability though because of some of the negative aspects brought up above. In the end it's a sandbox. So if you like playing with sand and build castles then go and have fun.. That's one of the best games I've played so far. You have so many things to do and you will never get bored. It makes even more fun with friends and you can let your imagination run wild. You will spend too much time on this game - believe me haha!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think it is one of the best released games in the last years. Very addicting, endless fun. Happy for the developers that made such an awesome game!. Satisfactory is a diverse game that has had me hooked on it since update 6 and have played over 150 hours of it either on my own or with friends. With 1.0 just releasing they have added several beneficial additions with lag. Overall if you like ""Satisfying"" games this is for you. PS: If you don't like grinding this game probably isn't for you but then again what building game doesn't require grinding.. It's one of my favorite games in recent years. Building huge factories, troubleshooting, decorating, and optimizing them is deeply satisfying. However, 1.0 is a bit of a disappointment; the added story feels cheap as it just doubled down on the already high amount of sarcasm . To summarize, there is ""Ada,"" a super-intelligent AI who makes sarcastic jokes, such as you exploiting the planet or how Ficsit doesn't care about the safety of pioneers. This could have been written by any generic large language model. At the same time, she has philosophy lessons with an alien being, which is most of the time just pseudo-smart gibberish. Feels like it tries so hard to put perceived real life issues in a game where this has no outcome in a joking way only to insult the gamer spent time and intelligence. TL;DR: I'd rather not have a story than a bad one. The rest of the game is truly amazing.. Satisfactory has turned into one of my favorite games of all time. I can’t wait to see what they will be adding in the future.. The game itself is really fun, but it was much better 2 years ago when it was released, mostly because it was much less buggy. It seems that all this time adding content caused game to be so unstable that it crashes every 5-60 minutes at random. It is really hard to enjoy any game this way. I cannot recommend this game with clear conscience before developers get it fixed properly.. Personal note: I am 56 years old and have been gaming continually since 1980-ish on my Atari and then my Commodore 64. I have put out a review only a few times in my life, and this game deserves it. Very few games have kept my attention more than Satisfactory. There have been several times when I had to shut the game down because it was now 8 AM and I had to start work. 2000 plus hours so far and expect to double that before I am done. (I can't see me ever being done with this game actually.) This game. Wow. I have been playing Satisfactory since I ran into it in early access on Steam, where they had a decent promo video that was refreshingly fun, for lack of a better word. I gave it a try and played for an hour or so, got a bit confused, and put it aside. Then I kept seeing all these reviews and a quick tutorial that cleared up all my confusion and gave it another try. I haven't stopped playing. You start out landing on a planet with no idea why you are there. All you know is you have to make parts for...something. Once you get over the very minor learning curve you keep building and building, It get more and more complex, but by the time it gets crazy complicated you have learned how it all works. and you are ready for the next challenge. During early access, there was no story line, only a few rumors about it. The full release adds that story line in a way that is unintrusive. It just flows into the game as you find more things by the regular commentary from ADA, you AI helper. ADA brings back the feeling you had from Glados in Portal. I am not even close to finishing the final release (I finished the EA stuff though), but ADA adds commentary as you unlock more and more items/skills/tools in the game, and you start to get an idea of what is going on, but still makes you think what you are doing may be a bad thing. So, as you you collect/exploit resources (you can play by being thoughtful of the environment, or you can cover the whole place in concrete. It is up to you), the game seamlessly compels you to explore, looking for more. As you collect items they allow you to unlock more stuff and better ways to make parts. The UI is genius. It all works so well. Even in EA it was very simple to figure out the basics. After EA any minor UI issues I had were corrected by the devs. The graphics are at AAA standards. The way items you build are applies are awesome. Wait till you see the space elevator get places. It is beautiful. The environment is beautiful as well. There are multiple biomes that have been hand built. Moving across the map ai amazing as you change areas. While traveling through a desert it slowly changes to another biome. Before you know it that desert is now a swampland, or a grassy plain, or a old growth forest, and several more. It is something you have to see to believe. I am ending it here since I want everyone to see it for themselves. Watch a few youtube vids to see for yourself. This is SO much more than a simple building game. I would have easily paid $60-$70 for this game (and I usually wait until price drops) It is currently on sale for $36 on steam and worth much more than that IMO. Do not miss out on this game. It is worth every penny. It was worth it halfway through EA and is now a bargain for what you get. PS. I forgot to mention the Devs. These folks are so awesome and are devoted to the success of this game. They are regularly online and are down to earth and have a fun snarky attitude. Some of the best devs I have ever seen. I am not kidding. Also, the players are super cool and more than happy to help. There are very good youtubers like Bitz and TotalXclipse and Kibbitz and many others that have awesome vids for build ideas and help/tutorials. Also, the support on Reddit (r/SatisfactoryGame) that are more than happy to help and no one is rude.. Playing this gem **** since alpha. A beautiful work showcasing how to develop awesome games by listening to your community and taking time.. Best game I ever played! Already got 200h and still want to play it. Wet dream for every enginer!. One of the best factory games ever. I now have over 300 hours played and still don’t get boring.. Best game ever you cam sink thousands of hours and it’s a great example of a not rushed alpha that actually put the work in and did not release a half baked product great job to the people over at coffee stain studios keep it up. This is close to a perfect PC game. It's atmospheric, addictive, beautiful, and engaging. It's basically open ended, you can play it at whatever speed you like while still being a challenge if you want to 'finish' it. It's got massive replayability, and every playthrough teaches you something you swear you'll do better next time. I've mentioned the graphics, but the sound design is fantastic too. As a final cherry on top, it supports multiplayer and community modding, so just when you're getting bored of the built in stuff, you can mod it into a whole new experience. It really is that good - spend £30 on Steam now, and kiss a thousand hours goodbye.. I have 300+ hours in game also I play this master piece since update 5 (1/01/2022) and I can say ""FACTORY MUST GROW"". Another wonderful example of how to do an Early Access game correctly. Game evolved with a great communication with the community into a true masterpiece in the factory building genre.. Fully Satisfactory. Without a doubt a classic in the making. 10/10 brb need to optimize production line.. Played hundreds of hours since update 2 early access. Game was great and got even better. Developer does really care for the community.. It's perfect. The Co op, the gameplay loop, the vibe, it's just a treat and one of the best factory games of all time.. Satisfactory is a playable masterpiece that features the ultimate construction and management simulation.. I started to play 3 years ago and the game is still fun to play with a very active community.. Have been playing for almost two years, and it has been interesting to see the development. Very fun but can also by quite challenging at times.. i got satisfactory just after update 3 came out, played it with a friend for a week, then quit. coming back now, i wish i played it the whole time. beautiful game, got me addicted. The best game to come out of an early access development period in the history of the practise. Satisfactory is absolutely incredible and well worth your time and money.. This product deserves the Goty nomination! These developers are the Gods of Olympus of management video games! Sincere CONGRATULATIONS!!! :D. This game is the absolute satisfaction of games I know. I could call it a masterpiece.. What a Game! It's been a long jurney till now, but what we endet with is an absolut Banger. Wonderful game with enough entertainment for all kinds of gamers. Want to build factories and be creative? They got your back. Want to fight beasts and explore, the map is big and enemies are plenty!. Amazing game it s my favorite of all time ️ graphic and everythingin the game is wow. Thanks Jace ! Thanks Snutt ! Helps A lot . best community managers I ever watched ! Best game ever <3. Probably the best factiry game I ever play, very well balance and almost infinite lifetime. My most played title on steam ever, and with the release of 1.0 everything is super polished and super clean. Even if puzzle, logistics, or factory games aren't your jive this game deserves a look. It's a masterclass in game design, and a testament to what devs should use time in early access to accomplish. This game is very nearly a perfect work of art. It will grab you in a way few other games every will in a lifetime.. I play satisfactory since the update 5 of early access and it kept getting better across updates. And now that the 1.0, my overview of the gameplay, the graphics, the progression in it is just amazing !. This by far is my favourite game I've ever played. I've played many games of varying quality and genes but this is the game I always come back to, no matter what. I've accrued over 1,180 hrs in the game since it came to Steam so to say its an amazing game would be under selling it imo :p. One of the best games I’ve played in 45+ years of playing games. Everything about this game just works so well. Each aspect (crafting, building, exploration) is nearly perfect and the sum total makes for an unbelievably fun time.. I saw the steam reviews for this years ago at like 97% and I'm like there is no way. Gave it a shot and 150 hours flew by. Holy cow this game is so expansive yet super easy to pick up.. One of the best things that you can find in steam. Trust me bro............. As someone typically uninterested in factory-building games, Satisfactory caught me off guard. This game masterfully blends relaxation with intricate industrialization, set against a breathtaking alien backdrop. Key points: * Visually stunning world begging to be explored * Deeply satisfying progression from small outposts to massive complexes * Packed with nuances and secrets that continually surprise * Clever humor adds charm to the industrial grind The attention to detail is impressive, from unique machine sounds to the mesmerizing flow of resources. Beyond factory building, you'll explore crash sites and face alien wildlife, adding variety to the gameplay. Satisfactory has earned a top spot in my gaming library, proving that great design can win over even skeptical players. Whether you're a genre fan or a newcomer, this game offers an addictive blend of optimization, exploration, and alien world-building that's hard to put down. Been playing this for over 4 years and it's even better after 1.0. One of my favorite games ever. Incredible community and developer and gameplay and you can change it to be exactly the way you want it to be between game settings and mods. It's very good game I love it very much and I advise everyone to play this very beautiful game.. The developers have succeeded in creating a very good factory simulation game. In which you can have a lot of fun creating factories and exploring the wonderful, hand-crafted map. The game never gives you the feeling that you are under time pressure to finally start production. You can take all the time you want to plan or expand your production or explore the map in the meantime. A base defense mode has also been omitted so that the player can fully concentrate on expanding his factory and does not have to worry about building up a defense and maintaining it. Which, in my opinion, is not necessary for a game that simply wants to be a factory simulation in which it is about building factories and optimizing the processing **** developers give you the freedom to build the way you want. The limitations are reduced to a minimum. If you don't care that conveyor belts go through the ground or other buildings then you can do it in this game. There is only a hint that there will be optical collisions. This freedom allows you to develop freely in the design of your factories. Even after more than 1500 hours (in the Early Access version) I like to come back to this game to expand and optimize my factories or to start a new savegame to implement new ideas or designs without tearing down the previous savegame. The story in Satisfactory is rather secondary and is not necessary for progress and can be completely deactivated if you want. During the Early Access phase of the game, the developers were in close contact with the community and always explained their changes and listened to the needs of the community. Even if features requested by the community were not implemented in the game, there was an explanation as to why it was not done. Be it that it doesn't fit the narrative of the game or there are technical reasons that prevented it from being implemented in the game. But even in these rare cases, the developers at Coffee Satin communicated openly with the community and looked for solutions that worked for everyone. All in all, the developers have shown how Early Access should work.. Been playing since early access and it has been one of the best games i've ever played, with really wonderful dev team that keeps us updated at all points.. Satisfactory, the name say it all. What a great, simpel and att the same complex and never ending game.","""satisfactory"" is a fantastic factory game with enough challenges to last a while . the game is an absolute masterpiece, the mechanics are on high level . it runs smooth, zero issues and the atmosphere is great ."
269.Dark Souls II,"It was actually good, not bad as people used to say about it. Just some players find it difficult after moving from DS1. Amazing game but the level design can be a bit tricky and feel weird sometimes. Tried new things after DS1 and did amazing on some and not so much on others. Clearly a milestone toward making DS3 an amazing game. A Lackluster Experience....This game feels more like a missed opportunity than a cohesive experience. While its core gameplay revolves around defeating enemies, there’s little to no narrative to provide context or purpose. The lack of a compelling story leaves the experience feeling hollow, as if the sole objective is to overcome increasingly difficult challenges without any meaningful **** difficulty itself is more frustrating than rewarding, often relying on cheap mechanics rather than skill-based progression. Coupled with uninspired level design and repetitive encounters, it fails to capture the player’s interest or offer a memorable **** the end, this title struggles to find an identity, leaving it as a forgettable entry in its genre. It’s hard to recommend to anyone seeking depth or style in their gaming experience.. Please, don't hate at this game! It's the regular version, not Scholar of the First Sin (Yes, roast them).. My friend BACONPANCAKE09. Decided not to get on Dbd. So this is getting a negative review for being one of his favorite games. Dark souls 2 is one of my favourite games ever. the game has a special place in my heart , everything is great in this game , the onlyreason that make people hate on it is some glithes and the hitboxprobleme, that can be fixed by levling the ADP. but overall, such a great game.. I cannot believe this game is generally positive on here. Please do not be fooled, this is a matter of sampling. This game is widely considered the worst Soulsborne, and with good reason. A drastic step back from the original in nearly every way but graphics, I don't care to belabor any of the numerous points that have been made, but please, dear reader, if you are fresh off the heels of the original and loved it, just convince yourself they decided to call the sequel Dark Souls III and save yourself from a game that will disappoint you in many, many ways.. Dark Souls 2 holds a special place in my heart because it was the game that got me into the Souls series. I remember going into it with high expectations of how difficult it was going to be, and boy was I bad at first. I made good use of that mechanic which makes enemies despawn after a certain amount of deaths to get through Forest of The Fallen Giants. Then, on Heide's Tower of Flame it took me several hours practicing against the stone knights to learn how to play properly. World/Story/Atmosphere: 10/10This is one of those areas where FromSoft never really misses. They always do an amazing job coming up with a story that is exciting to experience both for a casual player and for someone who watches all the YouTube videos deepdiving into the story, or even combs through the story yourself. Aldia is probably my favorite character in the Dark Souls trilogy. Build Variety/Balance: 10/10Now we're talking, this is the area where even people who hate Dark Souls 2 will praise it. Dark Souls 2 gave us powerstancing, and the amount of build variety added is truly amazing. Up until Elden Ring FINALLY did what I wanted for years, Dark Souls II was the only game where you could play a viable bare fists build. On top of this, magic is by far the most fun in Dark Souls 2 compared to the other games. Hex builds are an amazing addition and I will never understand why they aren't implemented the same way in future games. Int/Faith builds are just left in an awkward spot in every game afterwards. There's just a ton of unique options and ways to play Dark Souls II, and that's a big part of what makes Dark Souls II so replayable even when compared to the rest of the trilogy. Combat Mechanics: 5/10Alright, I wish I could sit here and keep praising Dark Souls II but I had to get here eventually. You don't have to do a deep dive into Dark Souls II combat to understand the issue. If you go from Dark Souls I to II, you will notice a strange lack of weight to your attacks. On top of that, adaptability as a stat is poorly communicated and leads to dodging feeling broken at the beginning of the game, and ridiculously slow healing. Yes, I know it's possible to beat Fume Knight at SL1 with 6 adaptability, no parrying, no shield, no rolling, and naked while playing Bohemian Rhapsody with your feet. However, having low adaptability just feels bad. On top of this, adaptability just makes the game laughably easy if you can get enough of it. I don't really love the healing system either, but it's not offensively bad, lifegems do give you the ability to trivialize the game if you want to so do with that what you will. I think when you fully understand the combat in Dark Souls II, it's better, but regardless it just doesn't feel right. It's still Souls Combat at the end of the day, so I'll give it an average rating. But this is easily the worst of the games for combat mechanics.Level Design: 5/10So the level design in Dark Souls II is pretty mixed. The quality is definitely not up to par with Dark Souls 1 with most of the areas. There are some amazing areas such as Heide's Tower of Flame, The Gutter, Shrine of Amana, Dragon Aerie, and Shulva Sanctum city. But the really terrible areas were saved for the DLC. They're mostly optional areas, but I still wish they were better. The saving grace of the horrible areas is the mechanic where if you kill an enemy enough times it despawns. It's nice to know that there's a guaranteed end to the suffering eventually. Most of the areas, though, are really just average. There are just a lot of areas in Dark Souls II that I can't remember without looking up ""Dark Souls II areas"" despite it being the FromSoft game I played through the most. There's a focus on gank fights in Dark Souls II, which I actually don't mind too much. Gank fights do fit in with a slower combat system. There's still way too many enemies in some areas. Boss runs are suffering.Bosses: 7/10I don't think the bosses in Dark Souls II are all that bad. Yes there's a lot of mediocre bosses, but it also has more bosses than any other game in the series aside from Elden Ring. There are bosses that are as good as the best of Dark Souls 1 such as Darklurker, Fume Knight, Elana, and Sir Allone. It's much the same as Dark Souls 1 in the sense that I think ""Wow, good thing this game got a DLC because otherwise this boss roster is mid."" At least there's no boss that's as offensively bad as Bed of Chaos. I am not including boss runs, that was considered in the level design portion. I am including an extra for fun category for SL1 runs, this doesn't affect the overall ranking, but I decided it would be interesting to compare the quality of an SL1 run to the normal game. SL1 Run: 3/10The issues in a normal run become much worse in an SL1 run, the good bosses are really fun on SL1 but aside from that it's just a bad experience. Don't do it.. The sequel to Dark Souls, another flawed masterwork. As good as the first with some major improvements in equal proportion to the missteps. This is truly another unique experience, one that any fan of Demon's Souls or Dark Souls must play for themselves. It's Demon Souls 3! Or, if you prefer, ""Dark Souls Too"". This is a fraternal twin, closely mirroring the first in many regards while managing to carve out its own identity. A strong entry that has an impeccable art direction, a higher difficulty ceiling and distinct features that any Souls fan will enjoy discovering.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Clunky and boring a billion different reskinned enemies endings are basic and kinda boring really not comparable to other games in the series. This game isnt bad but its kept back by its clunky gameplay, adp and the leveldesign. I would give it a 6/10. I gotta give it a 1 however, since the fans of dark souls 2 are absolutely nuts, and genuinly psycopathic. In total the game is the worst out of the three, still good, but the online fanbase of it is so terrible i will give it zero stars.. A decent sequel that suffers from the lack of the creator of the original Dark Souls. The narrative and settings deviate from those of the first game, showing respect for the author, without delving into anything that had already been previously mentioned. There are drops in the quality of the level design but at the same time a substantial increase in the quantity and variety of weapons and items. An important combat design innovation called ""power stance"" is also introduced, capable of exponentially multiplying the variety of builds and approaches to enemies. However, everything is ruined by a terrible design of the bosses which makes them unreadable and frustrating on many occasions and by a terrible movement system that uses realistic motion capture animations that do not suit the arcade nature of the genre. In summary, it is a title that is not necessary for the purposes of the narrative and the evolution of the franchise, but among its problems it guarantees a good amount of hours of entertainment and some ideas that in the future could be reworked into much more ambitious projects.. The fact that this broken mess of a flop scored higher than Dark Souls 1, DS3 & Sekiro is beyond BS!! There was nothing great about this game!! Areas was poorly designed and made, boss fights weren’t even admirable or memorable, enemies were terrible and the fact this game is broken on every aspect. The only positive I give this game is a couple good designed areas and a cool looking hub but other than that, the game was awful so my overall score is a 2/10 and thats being too generous. Probably de best Soul. Very replayable, it adds countless improvements compared to Dark Souls 1, such as being able to reset stats, being able to use a weapon in each hand, etc.. This game is alright, but I never played it on a PlayStation. So therefore, perfect 10. This game is so overrated and it **** **** Old ass mechanics and boring start to finish … just some nerds overrating a shiit game. Terrible and archaic and SLOOOOW gameplay with stunning visuals and environments, made useless by the unresponsive and clunky combat system. I tried to like this game but there is really nothing that makes me understand why it is so loved. Fighting minions is boring, they are slow and too easy to kill, every boss has a weakness and you just have to find it and if you don't you die, which means that you have to waste time fighting useless minions again and again, because checkpoints are useless, right? How they managed to make a game of this kind boring is beyond me, but this is by far the worst souls game I've played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Some of the levels are too annoying for its own good. The graphics are bad, even for its era. But still, fun to play, even today.. This is one souls game that catches a ton of flack from fans and joeshmos alike. but the magic in this game was one of my absolute favorite gaming experiences. Don't knock it till you try it, it's worth a play for sure.. You lose some of your health bar everytime You die, there are so many enemies that they will wipe out your health bar before you can hit them, you have to level adaptability to get invincibility frames for every roll, you start with 8 invincibility frames at the beginning so you can't dodge ****, all the bosses in it are ****'t play, this game is **** ass. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While it has some flaws that make it a weaker entry in the series, compared to Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3, it still is a great game with awesome atmosphere and great weapon design (especially some movesets). One of the best Souls Like games I've ever played in my life................ Before I start, I enjoyed it, but, there's one reason it's not a higher score. All these years I thoughy Souls-like games were hard because of AI, level design and thoughtful planning. If I'd known it was just **** input responses I'd have tried these years ago. **** is designed to punish you for dying wouldn't you want the controls to be as responsive as possible? Press Circle to roll, it may work, or maybe it won't, press it again though and you'll undoubtedly roll off a **** cliff. Want to lock onto that enemy that is clear as day from a ranged position, not a hope, but get close and you'll click on and off 5 times before firing your spell over his stupid head as he plants his sword in your kidney. Want to block, that's sometimes R1, but not all the time, what about heal, press Square, but, it won't actually begin the drink flask animation until you've pressed Square again repeatedly and, of course, only after the enemy has begun it's ridiculous wind up attack to knock your chin out of the park in one shot. It's seriously telling that I can't remember one boss fight without edges to fall from, not because their wasn't any, it's because they were unmemorable and over quickly. Not hard. Just frustrating. RIP controller number 2.. Dark Souls 2 has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it has a lot going against it, too. No other Dark Souls game, in my opinion, has better level layouts. The concept behind the way the levels look is really special. However, the game is marred by poor combat and bad animations. The tediousness in this game is unnecessary and disfigures what should have been a great game. It isn’t the best game in the series and people need to stop saying that and defending it. Dark Souls 2 is riddles with problems that you cannot overlook.. Dark Souls 2 was built to be unfairly difficult. The developers added in too many traps and too many ambushes. They removed ""i-frames"" during long animations such as ripostes, backstabs, pulling levers, and entering fog doors. The movement speed and recovery speed is too slow. Compared to the other games, there is less emphasis on having fun in Dark Souls II. The best compliment I can give this game is that Majula (the main hub) has great scenery and music, but that high artistic quality is quickly forgotten once you come across another frustrating encounter or trap.. Soulsborne is known for being a series of immaculate polish, combat and world building. Titles such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring effectively set new standards for upcoming video games, and since then a lot of developers have tried to cash in on this unique style of gameplay, but they very often fail to imitate FromSoftware's design theory & polish. Dark Souls II feels like it was made by those same developers, as the usual ""hard but fair"" type of game design that these games proudly wear is suddenly ripped off and thrown into an industrial crusher. Instead, this title decides to incorporate some new features which are clearly intended to piss the player off as much as humanly possible: Dodge frames are reduced and need to be upgraded through a new stat, your max health gets permanently reduced by 5% for every death until you are half health, prompting the use of a rare-ish item to go back to 100%, enemies track you for ages and will follow you everywhere, even being able to hit you through & during fog, some areas are pretty much designed solely to frustrate the player and offer little to no counterplay, making you either slog through the area, hoping not to die, or repeatedly kill the enemies until they permanently despawn at 15 deaths (this also applies to boss runs, funnily). These are not small issues, and they force the player to repeat a lot of chunks of the game, which kills motivation to play, as you'll be forced to slog through the same 20 enemies who track you to the ends of the earth to get to a boss, all while being hp capped. The bosses are uninteresting in most cases (except for a few amazing ones), most areas straight up **** and some of them make you want to destroy your controller (good luck playing this on KBM). This game is a major disappointment and a huge departure from DS1, who's first half is so well crafted and executed, in comparison to this title which seems to offer little to no respite, subjecting you to one horrible game mechanic after another, with the majority of main game bosses posing 0 threat (until the DLC where some of them become the worst bosses in the series). Don't get me wrong: underneath all the garbage, there is a game that has retained some of fromsoft's signature identity, with a huge variety of builds, some gorgeous areas, amazing bosses and stark, well defined worldbuilding & ambiance. But all of these positives are horribly overshadowed by the negatives which seem to take center stage most of the time. I would still recommend a playthrough, but actually finishing this game is another story.. worst game in the souls series easily how can a sequel be this much worse than the original. I just LOVE this game so much. Must play, casual ds, totally balanced, more funny than others ds, first ds that is made for premades, nobody cares about difficulty, if u care just take a shower calm down and then play. Some key deviances from the first game, namely the lack of cohesion compared to that of the first games map keep this from being every bit as good as its predecessor— still a tremendous experience in and of itself.. Underrated masterpiece. Some questionable design choices make this an... interesting game. Most bosses feel lacking, the world design is weird, it is WAY more bs than it's predecessor and so on. I would've wanted to enjoy this game more, but it just felt llke an inferior Dark Souls 1 in every way. Being inferior to a masterpiece still makes it good, but doesn't make it less disappointing.. Keeps up with atmospheric aspect of the game, that's a big yes. But adaptability stat and mechanics ****'s just baldly stupid. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A lot of players hate it, but I think it still offers loads of fun. Sure, the mechanics feel very different from those that were made by Miyazaki, but still, it's pretty good. And of course, you don't suffer less. This game is alright but it's probably my least favourite of the souls games I have played. Health supplies are basically never seen and every time you die you loose 5% of health making the part you got stuck on even harder the next time. It really doesn't make sense to have a mechanic like this in a game. How do you expect players to overcome something by making it worse. You get a stone that makes you human again but these are like hen's teeth. You get character creation but you'll just spend most of the game looking like Frankenstein. The graphics aren't amazing even for PS3 but I think from software wasn't huge at this point so fair enough. This game is clearly more for the die hard fans of the souls games otherwise you mite aswell just skip over it and play the newer better ones.. 91 out of 100 unbelievable, this game is nothing but a copy of the previous version, it is much worse, lol, the design has completely regressed, a forgettable experience, fake souls fans, you keep buying the same game again and again, on the contrary, dark souls 1 was great. With a different director at the helm, Dark Souls II isn't quite as expertly crafted as its predecessor, though it is still a deep, challenging action RPG in its own right. It's bigger, longer, messier, and at times more frustrating than fun; opting for quantity over quality with the most bosses in a FromSoft game, as well as the most generic. There are also times when it mistakes throwing as many enemies at you at once as it can for ""difficulty."". This game is not bad. It has its own pros and cons. But this is by no means worthy of such a high score. Higher than DS1 and DS3? Come on, critics. You guys are **** and just spoiled it. Now no one will pay any attention to what you flirt with.. While often criticized for its departure from Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 is one of the most brilliantly conceived sequels in ages. Rather than try to mimic the first entry, or create excess lore where none existed (or was needed), Dark Souls 2 looks at the actual universe it resides in and thoughtfully creates a unique space. In the world of Dark Souls there are endless cycles, civilizations rising and falling, each cycle likely thousands of years (if not more). Rather than try to “follow up” directly from the end of the first entry, Dark Souls 2 launches many cycles into the future, and tells a more personal story of King Vendrick, the land of Drangleic, Lady Nashandra and an ill considered war with the Giants (not too mention Vendrick’s mad brother Aldia, though he is more elaborated upon in the Scholar update). While traversing the world, unraveling the story of this dying land and your place in it, bits of the existing universe are expanded upon, making it both a fresh new story, and exciting for those looking for more answers from the first game. Mechanically, DS2 changed quite a few things, they created a new parry/riposte, updated multiplayer and the requisite new stats and balancing. In addition to minor adjustments, they also added the brilliant new Bonfire Ascetic mechanic, effectively allowing you to put certain areas of the game into a forced “New Game Plus” for extra challenge, as well as hidden benefits. The “New Game Plus” also received extra love, and is not just “more difficult with some stronger versions of old rings” like the first entry. There are real changes to the world that I won’t spoil here. The game is also massive. Even without the DLC, Dark Souls 2 is large in scope and well worth price of admission, but adding on the 3 huge DLCs just makes this one of the best gaming packages ever. Also to note, the Scholar of the First Sin and the original Dark Souls 2 have completely different item/enemy layouts, that create different pacing and routing. Most prefer the Scholar version (which also has the DLC packed in) so that should be the obvious choice, however for those who can’t get enough, playing through both versions makes for a fascinating replay that will keep you on your toes. All in all, Dark Souls 2 has often been on the receiving end of a lot of hate (criticism, fair enough, but also hate, absurdly). Many joked it was the “B” team (despite most of the original development team working on it), which is an insult to the talent at From Software. Ever since, it seems they’ve been scared to release a game that didn’t say “Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki” for fear of undue backlash. If you read the credits, however, their subsequent games always actually list multiple directors. And since Miyazaki is the president of the company, I would hazard a guess that he mainly oversees most games, while others “direct” them (much like he did here). It’s unfortunate that not having his name on Dark Souls 2, front & center, seemed to set so many people off, considering how From Software has proven as a whole to be an utterly formidable talent, and a groundbreaking game developer. All told, if you’ve been curious about this entry, but have been turned off by tales of it being “garbage” and not a real “Souls” game, I would kindly insist you reconsider. There are groups of people who aren’t fans surely, but there are many, many of us who unabashedly call it an utter masterpiece.. One of the best Games known to mankind. From Software is a safe heaven for the Gaming community. Especially in times where big Developers dissapiont us with theyr fraudulent intent. Praise the sun!. Escaping the ""god fighting"" system, Dark Souls II brings a more human experience, with a vast word and even surpassing the original game.. Pretty good, although way too hard and easy in several areas. It's got a pretty good story and it's got some pretty cool concepts within the areas, so I feel like 8/10 is a good score for the game.. I must admit I was a little edgy at first about the feel of the new engine that was made for this game when I first played it back in 2014 but I think that may have been a good thing. It meant that I had to rethink everything I knew about how Dark Souls generally felt when I played it i.e. a new challenge for me, which kept things from going stale by averting my expectations. Also the game's Three Crowns of Kings dlc's are pretty good with the amount of content they each offer.. This game is a Dark Souls game, yes. But keep in mind that its from Studio B, A different studio that From Soft, the developers of the original series. I suppose they pawned this game to a different studio so they could work on the seminal masterpiece which is Dark Souls III. The experience coming from Dark souls I to II seems foreign. The colour palate is more bright and vibrant, overall its a lighter experience visually. The combat system and summoning system is the main flaw of this game. It greatly disappointed me, yet I persisted, because well - its Dark Souls! It has to be good. And that it was - in its own unique way. I think the game was meant to appeal to the more casual audience. The world is HUGE, I mean huge, especially with the DLC. There is an incredible amount of content in the game. I don't think the story is very interesting. I don't think the sound is on par to the other souls series games. With all that said, I'd would still recommend. Its a good game and for what you pay you have a fun and rewarding experience, which is the whole point.. This game is a master piece, again fromsoftware show us a perfect work, you need play this. Story: 8 Game play: 10 Music; 10 Visuals: 10 Personal score: 10 A master piece !!. Despite the hate on this game, this is my favourite. I have so many memorable moments with this game. This is a big leap in comparison to the 1st game.. This an absolutely beautiful game. My 150 hours in Dark Souls 2 was amazing. It has some frame rate issues on ps3, and not graphically advanced as other games in 2014. But it's still one of the best games I've ever played, 8 out of 10.. Having now beat the game, I can say this is really just a pale imitation of the first. Aping it with no skill or understanding. I don't want to particularly go into my reasons, so I will say that the Matthewmatosis ""Dark Souls 2 Critique"" youtube video really sums it up and coalesces my thoughts and raw feelings into something more tangible. Long, but worth the watch, even if you like the game. (mild optional boss spoilers) Some areas I must mention, that really stood out to me (well or stunk) were the -gauntlets- to the boss fights Ancient Dragon and Smelter Demon 2: This time he's Blue. Oh and Frigid Outskirts.. ugh. (mild optional boss spoilers) Anyway, there are some good ideas in this sequel, pretty areas, but a whole lot of bad, terrible ideas and retreads from the last game. A shame because I find the quality never quite dips to the rush job that the lord souls were in the first game, mostly, but is overall just weak. I did enjoy the game, I found some areas to be of good quality and I did like some of it.. just really, really hated the bad parts and poor design decisions w/r/t game systems, specifically the total souls level/multiplayer matchmaking I can recommend this, most of the truly horrible gauntlet sections are optional, the multiplayer is probably not a factor at this time.. FromSoftware are masterminds for making this game, Thank You Hidetaka Miyazaki for this masterpiece!. This is the besto Dark Souls - Why? First of all - It's different from the other ones, makes an outstanding work driving you nuts through the new mechanics of game play and game menú, it feels fresh and brings things that DS1 and DS3 doesnt have like enemies disappear after you reach the time beaten them - this makes farm for souls even harder and makes you twink twice the way you are going to spend those souls makes even hard and painful to die and loss souls - i love this. Dark Souls II is an epic experience and follows the path of its predecessor. You get a rock heavy gameplay, challenging but always fair. The atmosphere is brilliant dark and intensifies the mystic story. Modern classic, must play!. Dark Souls II may have had many new ideas but not all of them were executed too well in this game, Dark Souls II is a good game overall but not a good Souls game, it is the least enjoyable game in the series and a pretty big disappointment overall, awkward gameplay, artificial difficulty, and questionable control feel are the major problems. Dark Souls II does have really good things though that keep the game from being bad, the world of Drangleic is amazing and visually stunning, the combat works, the soundtrack is really good, NPCs are interesting and memorable, interesting new mechanics like power stance and stat reallocation, it has a good new game plus, and build variety, but that's it, while it's not the worst video game sequel out there, it's definitely the weakest of the Souls series.. At first I didn't like the game. But after I completed it two times I can say, it's not as good as the first part, but still it's a great game. It denies some ideas of the original game, but at the same time deepens some other. It widens the game world and moves the story to another place, still connected to Lordran. Anyway I can recommend the game to anyone no matter whether you played the original game or not.. Demon Souls 1? Legendary. Dark Souls 1? Masterpiece. Light Souls 2? What a PIECE of TVRD, ¡seriously!? There are too many enemies and bosses doing s**t that is just just random, absurd or jank. Honestly, it's just barely above ""Lords of the Fallen"" trash mechanics. Dark Souls 3? Amazing.. (Mar 2, 2017) This was one of my weirdest yet greatest experiences on PlayStation 3. My first 7 hours were terrible since it was something new for me and the weakest enemies kept killing me. I even thought about regretting my purchase. After two weeks, I played it again and started to understand its mechanics. My deaths were less frequent and I was able to defeat the first bosses and continue with the game. I like the way it tells its story by separating it between most of the land's NPCs. The visuals and artistic design are amazing and the gameplay is very good. If you did not play the previous Souls installments like me, you are going to have a rough time during your first hours, but you will eventually start to advance and enjoy it. Dark Souls II is hard, demanding and sometimes unfair. Most bosses are great but there are too many, some of them are a joke and two can one-shot you. The satisfaction for defeating a hard boss or area its fantastic. I also like being able to revive bosses (and make them harder) to get new items or more souls. Some areas can be very challenging but I like exploring them to find weapons, armor and items. Sometimes it can be a horror game because of the tension of dying when you have to recover your souls. I love Majula as the hub world because it feels like a small town in which you are safe and can rest. I also prefer that DSII lets you decide when you want to start New Game+ after beating the final boss. Probably the worst thing about this game is the incoherence between some areas. For example, Earthen Peak has a big windmill whose top is completely destroyed. After defeating the boss, you access an elevator that takes you to the Iron Keep, which is surrounded by lava. Also, in Shrine of Winter there's a long tunnel that leads you to Drangleic Castle and suddenly it's nighttime and is raining. It seems that the level designers were split into various teams with no communication between them. I didn't play co-op or PVP that much but the only thing I'll say is that the matchmaking system is dumb. Soul Memory, really? Despite that, it's quite fun to humiliate bosses with a friend when both of you are OP after dozens of hours. The three DLCs and its bosses are go","this game feels more like a missed opportunity than a cohesive experience . while its core gameplay revolves around defeating enemies, there’s little to no narrative to provide context or purpose . the lack of a compelling story leaves the experience feeling hollow, as if the sole objective is to overcome increasingly difficult challenges ."
27.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this game, mods excluded. It's a meh game with the mehest combat system and RPG elements.. Skyrim remains unsurpassed to this very day in being the most fully realized fantasy RPG video game ever created. Every NPC has a schedule and backstory. It's world beautiful and hand crafted. The mods available are endless. Mods don't make Skyrim great. They are only great because Skyrim is already masterpiece.. If I can sink hundreds of hours into this one single-player game, then it's probably a really great game. It definitely got addicting to level up my character, and go on seemingly hundreds of quests finding new gear and loot. A reason I enjoy this game so much even after years of playing it, is that there is just a stunning amount of content packed into this one game. It will easily take 80+ hours for you to complete all the main, and side quests of the game alongside a casual playthrough with most of the map explored, but even then there is just so much more to find in this game. I'm still finding new things in this game years later after first playing it. Yes, as I have played it over the years, I've definitely noticed some flaws like the not so great combat and the sufficeable RPG mechanics, but thanks to mods there are fixes for some of those issues. Skyrim is still truly a beautiful game with its breadth of content, amazing open world, and a masterpiece of a soundtrack to go with it. A very nice, chill game to play as well, and I would highly recommend it.. One of the greatest games. skyrim has a few issues that have become more clear as time goes on. Lack of major rpg mechanics. The grey world is sometimes depressing to look at. performance issues that are somehow still an issue on a over ten year old game.. I played this game endlessly on my 360. Skyrim will probably always be my favorite game of all time. My favorite part is chopping firewood. Its music, NPC's, open world, atmosphere, mod download feature in the main menu are truly the work of Bethesda... This game gives me peace 10/10. 1. Trash writing thanks to Emil Pagliarulo 2. Trash enemies autoleveling. 3. Million billion bugs.. One of the best games of all time. A unique masterpiece! Its just perfect!!. best game i have played in a long time. i got a xbox 360 not long ago and i bought skyrim and that is the best game i have played. I have loved this game since it came out in 2011 despite the fact that I am terrible at most games. Even now, it's a fantastic way to escape the drudgery of everyday life by swinging swords at dragons, hunting for treasure, learning how to make potions and armor, and once you level up enough, receiving the praise of townsfolk you've helped out. Have I lost weeks of my life to this game? Yes. Do I regret it? No. It's more interesting than scrolling through social media ad nauseum, and my partner, who is an avid gamer and epic nerd, helps me when there are villains I can't defeat.. ""You never really quit Skyrim.. you just take breaks"" Yeah its that good. Even all these years later.. This is hands down one of **** the greatest RPGs of all time. Even though there are great RPGs out now this still ranks as one of my all time greats. 13 years later and I still enjoy the world amd game play. I've put a total of 3,000 hours in this game since release, I can't in good faith rate it any lower. The Best game of all time, pure perfection. My favourite game ever, incredibly immersive and engrossing. Skyrim is the living reminder that Bethesda is the absolute masters of immersive open world experience and hopefully putting the countless haters to rest.. With over 800 hours can say without a doubt Skyrim is easily one of the best games of all time. The base game is Mixed is above average but it's not good enough in my opinion to get an 8 or 9 With mods and the sheer unlimited mods you can transform this world to your liking but in the end, what you get in the base game is a 7 at best.. Skyrim is not just a game, it is a fully immersive experience in an epic fantasy world. From the moment you take your first steps onto the vast continent of Tamriel, you feel like you are part of something much bigger. The freedom it offers is the game’s greatest triumph. Every corner of Skyrim hides an adventure, whether you are exploring ancient ruins, climbing towering mountains or delving into mysterious caves. It is a living, breathing world, where NPCs have their own routines and the environment reacts to your **** way the game allows you to create your own path is unparalleled. You can be whoever you want to be—a noble warrior, a sneaky thief, a powerful mage, or even a combination of all. The choices are yours, and the game never limits your creativity. The ability to shape your journey by making decisions that directly impact the world around you makes the experience unique and rewarding. The skill system, which improves based on what you do, further encourages this freedom. While the main campaign, involving dragons and the fight against Alduin, is captivating, it’s the side quests and guilds that Skyrim truly shines. The Dark Brotherhood, Companions, Thieves Guild, and College of Winterhold all offer rich and engaging stories, each with their own memorable characters and intriguing plots. Even the random quests have a special touch that makes them **** epic soundtrack, composed by Jeremy Soule, elevates the Skyrim experience to a whole new level. From the powerful dragon chants that echo in battle to the soothing melodies that accompany your exploration, the music perfectly captures the grandeur and solitude of Skyrim. It blends into the environment, making each journey memorable.Despite the game’s release years ago, the visuals still impress. The beauty of the snowy landscapes, dense forests, and majestic cities is breathtaking. The variety of biomes and environments ensures that the world never gets boring. And even with its technical limitations at the time of its release, the art and design make up for any graphical flaws.""Skyrim"" is a milestone in the history of RPGs and deserves every point of its 10/10 rating. With a vast and rich world, absolute freedom of choice, and an unparalleled immersive atmosphere, it's the kind of game that keeps you hooked for hours on end, always with something new to discover. Even after finishing the main campaign, you'll find yourself coming back to the game, exploring every corner of Tamriel in search of adventure. Skyrim is not just a game, it's an epic journey that remains unforgettable even years after your first experience.. Nothing comes close, I played this when I was 12 years old I still remember getting lost in the world of Tamriel on a school night at 4am. I hope Bethesda makes a comeback with TES 6.. I’ve played for over 7,000 hours since 2013, and I’m still playing. It’s truly a masterpiece Nothing better has come out yet. You should definitely play it! Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin naal ok zin los vahriin Wahdein vokul mahfaeraak ast vaal. Story: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Visuals: 9/10 Soundtrack: 10/10 One of the best RPG games of all time.. Skyrim is an epic masterpiece that offers endless exploration, rich storytelling, and immersive gameplay. The vast open world, detailed environments, and engaging quests make it a 10/10 experience for any RPG fan.. This game has set the industry standard for RPGs in the the 2010's and 2020's and I still do not think anyone has come close to beating it. One of the greatest games ever made and it will go down as a technological marvel.. Fun and addictive game. Lots of side quests, time flies when I play this. One of the best RPGs ever made.. An absolutely incredible game. So much freedom to mold your character to your chosen play style and a huge world that begs to be explored.. This game gives you the opportunity to play any role you want. Do you want to be an archer? You can. Do you want to be an sorcerer? You can. Do you want to be an paladin, necromancer, assassin, thief, or anything you want to be? You can be one of them. Also, this game has an incredible feeling of exploration. The world of this game is full of accesible places and things to do. As you go from one place to another, you encounter dozens of tasks to do. And each of the side missions in this game is different from each other and has a good scenario. There are many factions you can join throughout the game. If you are a wizard you can join Winterhold College, if you are a thief you can join the Thieves Guild, if you are an Assassin you can join the Dark Brotherhood, if you are a warrior you can join the Companions. There are many guilds like this. And these guilds all have different quests and scenarios, and many of them have special **** main mission of the game is about becoming a dragonborn and defeating the dragons that spread chaos to the world. Not gonna lie, the main quest is not as good as the side quests or faction storylines. But, the main story is not bad tho. There is a skill tree that you can develop depending on the role you want to play. You can unlock new features by improving your skills depending on the role you will play. There are tons of books to read in the game. By reading these books, you can learn about the universe of the game and its situations. The Elder Scrolls universe always has a very good lore, you can learn the lore of this universe by reading the books in the game. It has good graphics and a very good atmosphere for its time. The music of this game is always hits different. Amazing soundtracks. Peaceful, relaxing and sometimes, exciting. Finally, the only thing missing and bad for me is the physics and the feeling of combat. I'm not saying these are bad because they're old, there were games in 2011 that did these things well. It's something that happens because the game engine has been the same for years. Those were the only bad things I could say about this excellent game. All in all, this game is a masterpiece in my eyes, and until something better comes along, this is the best for now.. Your just free to do what you want. A masterpiece and one of the greatest games of all times (even better with mods).. There’s a reason this game has been ported a million times. It’s because everyone knows what Skyrim is. It’s not perfect, but Skyrim changed everything.. Legitimately the worst game I've ever played. I've played big rigs, ive played sonic 06, ive played action 52. None of it comes close, those games I can at least laugh at, but not skyrim. It's clunky, boring and dull and every fan of the game ive met thinks its the best thing since the internet. Straight up you could force me to play every tiger electronic handheld while making me watch everything I know and love burn and waterboard me and I'd still have infinitely more fun than even thinking about skyrim ever again. The RPG that changed everything. Best RPG of all time, for sure. Skyrim is an unforgettable experience.. This game is amazing. I have been able to play this game for hours and hours and still have fun, despite putting off completing the main questline or any faction quests. The world is crafted very well, with each city feeling unique, especially the main five. The various NPCs are well-written, feeling like actual characters and not quests on a stick. The skill system has great variety, allowing you to level up your player character in a way that is unique and fits your playstyle. That system is also augmented by the Standing Stones and race system, which give you extra abilities to further vary your playthroughs. The game has several glitches, but most are either helpful or fun to play around with. The game's vibrant modding community for most versions further improves replayability and can be used to fix most of the game's flaws. I would recommend Skyrim to anyone who has not played it before.. Ngl kind of a boring game. Characters are uninteresting. Not as good as fallout new vegas.. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of open-world RPGs, offering players an unparalleled sense of adventure and exploration. The remastered version brings enhanced graphics, breathing new life into the vast and diverse landscapes of Skyrim, making each journey through its breathtaking wilderness a visual **** of Skyrim's greatest strengths is the incredible feeling of adventure it instills in players. The freedom to roam the world at will, stumble upon hidden dungeons, and uncover countless mysteries is a core part of the game's enduring appeal. The sheer variety of builds, weapons, and magic spells available ensures that each playthrough can be a unique and personal experience, catering to a wide range of **** game's design is nothing short of fantastic. From the snowy peaks of the Throat of the World to the dark depths of Dwemer ruins, Skyrim's world is meticulously crafted, inviting players to lose themselves in its expanses and adventures.However, Skyrim does falter in its narrative elements. The writing often leaves much to be desired, with many characters coming across as uninteresting and dialogues feeling flat and uninspired. This lack of depth in character interaction can detract from the overall immersion, especially when compared to the rich, detailed world the game presents.Taking these factors into account, I would rate The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim an 8 out of 10. While it excels in world-building, exploration, and gameplay variety, it falls short in delivering compelling characters and engaging **** conclusion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a masterclass in open-world design, providing an epic adventure filled with endless possibilities. Despite its narrative shortcomings, it remains a must-play for fans of the genre, offering an experience that is as vast and varied as the world it depicts.. A stunning Tolkien inspired world, filled with original fantasy history and a grave exciting landscape to explore, it is truly a magnificent game. The seenorey and interactive environments make the game feel so real but has a lack of much biodiversity which makes animals feel repetitive. The cultures that you find while you cross the snow plagued mountains are a great way to collect new armor and weapons, and can give you a different perspective on the world and other groups. There are some minor glitchs you may come across that can spoil your experience slightly, but are no need to worry about. The various dungeons you may come across can carry them selves out a bit and take forever to get out of. As an open world game Skyrim is a great option, with a deep expansive world to venture and can definitely see how it is one of the greatest games.. Skyrim doesn't have the best writing. It doesn't have the best gameplay mechanics. It doesn't have the best combat. But that's not what makes this game what it is. Skyrim is a world, a beautiful, rich, alive world, that lets you craft your own story and be whoever and whatever you want to be. That's what makes The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim special.. An addictive game that will never die in my heart. Also I'll always reach level 50 before meeting with the greybeards. This game is overrated. Bland, and boring. Never understood the hype train. I finished it, and couldn't bring myself to want to continue playing. I 100 percented it, because I used to achievement ****. But that itself was a chore. I'm glad ppl enjoyed it, but it wasn't for me. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the GOAT for RPGs and what all other RPGs try to live up to. Peak Bethesda. Hopefully ES6 will be at least half as good within my lifetime. Best game ever for many reasons, the quest, the open world, the dialogues, the lore, the RPG and everything mean EVERYTHING in this masterpiece is very VERY GOOD. Possibly one of, if not THE best open world game of all time. Skyrim has offered people over a decade of entertainment thanks in large part to its thriving mod community and ease of play, but also its rich vibrant world that seemingly never gets old or boring.. The best game of all time, theres nothing more to say, and it's still playable, and even better than lots of todays games. The stories, and all these opportunities are simply amazing. You can choose your own path, what kind of character you wanna be, and you can select your own faction to team up with. One thing to add would be more different types of monsters, besides the countless human(-oid) enemies you have to face during quests, but also big boss monster here and ther would be cool, i hope there's room for that in Elder Scrolls VI Hammerfell!. Top 10 best games of all time, simple as that. It played a huge role in my life, even saving me from depression. A must play for everyone!. The best game that humanity ever created, with the most beautiful ambientation of video game's story. This is the fifth time I've played this truly unique game. Each time I discover new details. Such games can be counted on the fingers. This is a true masterpiece.. Arguably my favorite game of all time. Although it's not perfect (bugs, glitches, Paarthurnax), it is probably the best RPG game (in my opinion), especially considering it still holds up today.. i can't stand with this game. The games atmosphere is terrible, also it has fantastic stuff. Music is good.. One the greatest rpgs of all time the exploration is immmaculate and to think that this masterpiece is already 13 years old. It’s simply timeless. A beautiful open world RPG by one of the most legendary studios of all time. Skyrim is a game that **** you into it's insanely large and immersive world that will never make you want to put it down.

Whether you're a fan of the genre or new to RPGs, Skyrim is a must-play game that will keep you hooked for hours on end.. This game will forever be a 10/10 and a game I will come back to playing. I wish Bethesda were still that good today, but instead we recently got Starflop.. one of the greatest games ever. I still go back and play it to get lost in the world of Skyrim. My favorite game from the xbox 360. Best lore ever writen. Hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of content. Only bad side is the bugs.. Simply ****'s the greatest video game of all time. Absolute game changer. There is no other game like Skyrim till this day. Best exploration experience in gaming history. This game isn't perfect but why care about that when the world is this open.. Mmmmmmmmm love :) clearly an amazing game that still holds to this day and by far the best bethesda game. Going into this blind (well as blind as I could be) was wonderful and i loved it!! quite buggy tho and the artstyle is not my personal fav or anything. It's boring and nothing like Fallout 3 and 4 or Oblivion. They haven't worked on scripts like in Oblivion, in Skyrim you can already see little desire to work on scripts in the side quests that made him abandon the game due to lack of interest and in Elder Scrolls Online was the confirmation of Bethesda's loss of identity. I feel real fear in the sixth installment of elder scrols. one of the best games that i ever played thats all i can say about this game. Not the best part of the series, but quite playable for 1 time, although boring. With mods it becomes much better both visually and storywise. Absolute masterpiece. Beautiful scenery. Still holds up today. Unique expanding gameplay and exploration. 10/10. I will continue defending this game to the grave. Every once in a while I remember how high I personally regarded it and then I think about it for a while before rethinking my doubts immediately.. RPG gaming done right! If you haven't played Skyrim... just play it. Ignore the mods or you won't stop downloading them.... Genuinely my favourite game of all time. It will always have a special place in my heart! Hopefully ES6 is as good as this.. I played this game in some platforms and it is always surprising. I love how open is this game, letting you go anywhere, anytime. The main story and the missions are well designed and, even with some things repeated along the world (like caves, missions,...), you don't get bored frequently Also, I like how developers made a platform to install mods in their game, so even if you have spend like +200h in this game, you can spend another 100h doing new missions. There is a good community behind I mean, we are talking about a game released in 2011, it's an incredible work and they have been doing an awesome job through the last versions.. This game is what I base a lot of other games off of when I think of how fun it is to this day, this and fallout are about neck and neck but in the end I still think Skyrim is the GOAT.. What a boring, ugly and overrated game. F. Sooo overrated. The modding community is the savior of this very basic, very lazy game. The engine is just too damn dated. Cannot recommend this to anyone. I'm sorry but i really did'nt like this game.. This epic role-playing game might be Bethesda's best game yet, and offers an unique and spectacular world filled with fun. The freedom ensures a great experience for both the casual and hardcore gamer, as you're free to play the game how you like.. an all time great game with elite storytelling and game play. This game is the GOAT elder scrolls game and one of the best games of the 2010s. Countless ports, new editions, and content that dominated gaming culture and memes. I miss this games prime and I hope ES6 is just as good.. It is October, 2023 and this is still Bethesda’s best game to date. Oblivion, Fallout 3, Morrowind and Fallout 4 were all phenomenal, but there is just something about Skyrim that is really something unique and special. Immersing playets in The Elder Scrolls’ world is unlike anything else, and Skyrim is the best at doing so. The only other game I can think of that has had this much of an impact on my life is Mass Effect 2. There will never be another Skyrim.. I generally greatly enjoyed the game, the combat is a lil floaty but hey thats just how these games are. Story is pretty decent nothing compared to the detailed and intricate dialogue trees of Fallout new Vegas though.. Although when I first attempted to play this game when it came as a free download with my new Xbox 360, it felt clunky. Over the years I have repeatedly returned and played through all major expansions and come to love this game. This enjoyment came from leaving the beaten path and focusing on side quests, some which are far superior to the main plot.. The best 7 out of ten out there. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably the game that stays in my head the most with Minecraft when it comes to the best game I've ever played. Not a 10 though cause Bethesda games are flawed with glitches and some wonky things.. Even a decade later I have yet to find an experience like Skyrim that keeps bringing me back. Bethesda has built a world unlike anything else at the time. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack that is a masterpiece on its own. This game might as well be the best game ever made.. A top 3 rpg, barely beating out it's cousin FNV. This game is a flawed masterpiece with practically infinite potential thanks to it's huge modding scene that is delivering ground breaking mods 10+ years after it's release. Through it's bugs, crashes and scripting issues, it still stands as a mastodon of the genre half a decade after it's release. If I could choose one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be this one, hands down. Bethesda will never make an RPG this good again.. just a pure masterpiece, I even play this game after 10 years when anniversary edition came out. every time give me fresh feeling. This was the last good game they made.. The greatest RPG ever created. The perfect RPG masterpiece alongside Oblivion and Fallout New Vegas. Best bethesda game tied with Fallout:NV. Skyrim is exactly the masterpiece that the game industry needed This title is masterfully made with the utmost love and interest. All the points of the game and the game systems are deep and incredible. Skyrim, having a beautiful story and extremely beautiful sub-plots, and with high freedom of action, makes you enjoy every minute of the game. Tiger and makes Skyrim an eternal work The combat system of the game consists of many different weapons, abilities and magic spells, which really make the combats of the game challenging and attractive. What is a bit interesting is the technical problems and artificial intelligence of the game, which do not hinder the progress of the player in the game at all Skyrim, with its very beautiful and unique design of the main and secondary factions, characters, spells and abilities, its vast and attractive combat system, its wonderful map design, and of course its music, Skyrim does something that has been in my mind for many years. to remain a player and turn himself into an eternal work. If there's any title this game deserves above all else, it's this- most overrated game of all time.. The best Western RPG and surely the best TES entry. Amazing world, Amazing gameplay, tons of quests and tons of extra content.. Skyrim is to this date a nearly perfect RPG experience. Even after 6 playthroughs, nothing beats the atmosphere, the soundtrack and this warm feeling like arriving home. Everybody should have played this game at least once! I played the Legendary Edition with all the DLCs - which are great. Overall rating: 9.4.. The fifth Elder Scrolls game has more impressive visuals, slicker combat and a more user friendly menu system than the previous game as well as creating an absorbing and believable world to explore and interact with. Not quite as good as the Mass Effect games, but a worthy runner up.. Even without the DLCs, this game got me playing it for days and days in a feral way, it's just an amazing game that can't be explained and must be played before talking about it, the bad thing about it it's dealing with the joypad for a game that looks so much like it was born for a PC. absolute masterpiece ****, in 2012 I got lost in this world for months.. Good game but get stale after afew hours. Luckily the modding community makes it so much better. Skyrim is a big mess ****. On the one hand, Bethesda's game design ****. The combat is really bad. RPG choice making is borderline nonexistent. Character progression has been excessively streamlined. Level scaling makes it feel like you arent getting stronger. There is an over abundance of loot. There are tons of immersion breaking things happening in the world. On the other hand, content is king. Skyrim has a ton of content. Not all of it is great, most of it isnt even good. But there's quite a lot, dozens of hours worth, of great content. So I have to give it props for that. But to get to that content you have to slog through some horrific gameplay. And its not like the main story saves that. Mods, do, however, save this game and can make it an 8/10 game. But vanilla is a 5 at best.. The amount of times I've replayed this game is utterly ridiculous, thousands of hours spent on a single player rpg. That's because this game is mind bending and it absorbs you into this rich and heavy world which will leave you with so many unforgettable experiences where you truly change the world of Skyrim for better or for the worse. This game is over 10 years old and I always somehow come back to this world. There's so much to do and to this day I'm always discovering something new. Then lastly there is the never ending modding community which gives you EVEN MORE content. Skyrim is the best game ever! I bought this game and hated it. I made myself play it nonetheless and I absolutely fell in love. I got all the achievements and played it 3 times lol. That's about 900 hours of gaming and it was well worth it. Skyrim is the best- glitches and all!. Its skyrim.. theres nothing else to really be said at this point. (obviously play it). One of the greatest games of all time. I don’t need to explain why it’s all been said. This game is a must play and every gamer’s right of passage. This will always have a special place in my heart.. it is a game that I have always enjoyed my score is mixed because simply it is such a big game I never finished it which is always a shame. the graphics in the game are fantastic for the time and I can see why it is so popular. the customisable content in the game was something astonishing of the time and the story part of the game made it new amazing experience honestly when it came to the challenges they were perfect they were challenging but also not so challenging that it takes away from the game absolutely perfect balance for a game.. Skyrim is one of these games where you can truly become whoever you want and do, mostly, whatever you want. Want to kill guards? Sure go ahead, prepare for the consequences though. The skill tree is immense and really makes you want to try different builds (mage, alchemist, barbarian, knight, ....). I spent my entire summer of 2012 playing this game and creating different characters, some good, some bad, test your karma. I will forever be grateful to have tried it, it was my first BGS game and I have to put it on my top 3 games of all time along with Minecraft and GTA4.. The sheer nostalgia with this game... I used to say I liked Oblivion better back when this first came out. Oblivion certainly does have its strengths and it does thrive in areas where Skyrim isn't as strong. Looking back now, though, I took this game for granted. What a journey it is.. Unlike Elden Ring. This game is an actual Masterpiece. I Like to say no game is really a ten but like its predecessors it is fun for 100s of hours. I have close to 2000 hours of this game in total. And the team at Bet","""skyrim"" is a meh game with the mehest combat system and RPG elements . it's the most fully realized fantasy rpg video game ever created . mods are only great because skyrim is already masterpiece ."
270.Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove,"The game is fun & charming. The DLC, with the exception of plaque knight, are just as great as the base game while adding their own flare. Having everything included is noticeably generous.. Using this as a placeholder for the original Shovel Knight. It's perfect, what else can I say?. This game is so good. everything about it is good. the price is cheap, you get 5 games in one, and 3 of them are in my top 10 games of all time! king of Cards has a fun card mini-game and short'n sweet levels. specters of Torment has incredibly fun mechanics and an incredibly deep story. Shovel Knight is simple yet fun. Shovel Knight show-down doesn't have me playing too much, but is a fun time with friends for a while. And Plague of shadows is the only thing holding this game from a 10. this game is a steal, and if you haven't played it yet, you need to now! (by the way, the order was favorite, to least favorite). Really fun game with great ideas and great music. Lots of fun with this game. My main problem is how I'm not very good at it and the game doesn't really tell you anything. I'm pretty sure the game normally comes with a manual but I could only find it used.. Shovel Knight manages to be a wonderful mix of nostalgia and various other platforming elements. Its simple gimmicks and mechanics are bound to keep anybody playing for long enough. The story is also interesting, with a story told through three campaigns that focus on being a ""prequel"" to the fourth main campaign; which will most likely take you the longest to finish. The game isn't even 1 gigabyte, yet it manages to have content that AAA games strive to have. All of this content is polished beyond belief. The levels are fun to play and have a nice difficulty curve. Overall, I really like this game and you should play it. In fact, I made an account just to make this review!. play shovel knight if you haven't. such a good experience, it's fair except for instant death from falling in pits, it happens to the best of us.i have yet to play the plague knight and king knight campaigns, but i still think its beyond impressive how they packed so much game into this game. 9/10, play it.. I love how the world is built and the design of everything in general is fantastic. Sometimes it feels a little boring due to the classic platform aesthetics, but that is compensated by the various forms of gameplay with each character and the way you move, it is quite fun and enjoyable 100% recommended for gamers or casual players. Five star platforming goodness. Old school graphics. Challenging but not blow your brains out frustrating. I frequently find myself returning to this game when I want a platformer and I’ve got three dozen other platfomers on backlog to play. This one just does it for me. Highest recommendation .. Disclaimer: I only played an hour of this. There is a lot of uncertainty in my view. 5 I know this game is supposed to be retro, but when playing, I can't feel but find it a bit ugly and outdated optically. I really enjoy the soundtrack though. For its genre, this seems like a very good game. The levels are challenging (a bit too hard for my taste, but still fine) and the game play is pretty fun (although not quite as fun/fluid as games like cuphead). Also, there is some story, and a nice world with other characters. I think it is a very good game for its genre, but unfortunately, I don't enjoy 2D plattformers/hard games too much. Still, I do like the game when I play it occasionally, although I don't feel too often like playing it.. Very gud. Absolute modern masterpiece and instant classic. Many great games in one, packaged into a one of a kind, amazing experience unlike anything else. The world and humor is so incredibly charming that my words couldn't do them justice. My personal favorite campaign was King of Cards where a new gameplay loop is introduced, and the humor is at it's best. If I had one word to describe the experience: Iconic. These characters and this world now mean to me what Mario and Sonic are to me; it feels like they're apart of a series that have always been with me. The experience may be wrapped up in a nice bow, but this incredibly creative world can be limitless.. Not only does this game have arguably the greatest 2D platformer of all time, but it includes 3 other unique campaigns starring different characters and level designs, and on top of that there's a fighting mode. All of that for forty dollars is a steal. Amazing game.. Shovel: eight Bomb: six Dead: ten Rich: nine Real real ong kinda heat fr fr. The go to for anyone wanting a traditional 2D platformer. No need for powerups as each character has a simple move set with massive potential. Level design is fantastic, with secrets scattered all over. Characters have fun designs and great personalities. Certain level mechanics and relics can be annoying/unbalanced and King of Cards is overall lacking; but the game still comes out pretty good.. Shovel Knight is not just my favorite indie game of all time, but my favorite 2D platformer of all time. It's incredible how well Yacht Club Games have replicated the style of NES games while making something even better out of it. The game can be challenging the first time you play it, and the New Game + in particular is really tough, but the stages are just so much fun. The level design in this game is some of the best I've ever seen in a game, with tight and fluid controls to go alongside it. Shovel Knight can use his shovel to bounce on enemies and gain height, and he has a healthy amount of subweapons that can be bought which includes a fire rod, a protective shield, claws that let you dig through dirt, and more. The shovel itself can be upgraded to dig up patches of dirt faster and send out a spark when you have full health, and if that wasn't enough, Shovel Knight himself can also score upgrades to his health and magic meter for continued use of subweapons. The stages are littered with gold that can be used to buy subweapons and various armor sets that all have unique perks. Taking a cue from Dark Souls, however, you lose some gold when you die and you have one shot to get it back in the spot you died in before it gets lost forever. Since there are no lives in Shovel Knight, this is a good way to keep the player engaged and on their toes despite no threat **** over. The overworld of the game has a few minibosses and smaller platforming challenges with a higher payout of gold, which are a nice in-between activity while transitioning through stages. Each stage is slightly on the long side, but there are multiple creative gimmicks that keep the stages interesting, fresh, and very replayable. The only nitpick I have with this game is that you can't immediately return to the overworld when you're visiting the game's town, but that's it. I have nothing else to complain about, because this game is just that good. If you haven't played it by this point, I implore you to do so.. Definitely a highlight in the modern indie game scene. The full package with every story expansions adds so much, so many fresh stories and mechanics to each character. The team did a beautiful job translating a classic genre for new generations looking to dip their toes in the games many inspirations and and references.. Great fun! I played and completed all four game modes. Each was different enough to still keep it fun. Would definitely play again. the game is amazing, I am only on shovel of hope right now but the gameplays fun and has some difficulty, And the music is amazing, And the amount of content is so big its obvious if you want to do a full playthrough you will be here for a while, I have been looking around for years for a game like shovel knight, its the game i never knew i wanted its like if you took some of ducktales gameplay added megamans boss levels and mario 3's overworld you get this, an astonishing tribute to 8-bit platforming games. And ode to the classic NES games. Top best soundtracks of all time and the characters are very charismatic. A must play! Really cool and challenging game, not too hard, not too easy. Amazing soundtrack and amazing pixelart, just take your shovel and enjoy killing enemies!. this game is not good. i really dislike all the content from here. the gameplay is so... lazy?. All 4 games are lots of fun definitely worth the price. Plague Knight is probably the weakest of the 4 due to its unintuitive platforming, but I like its story the most and speed running is crazy. Shovel Knight is 3rd imo for just being an overall solid game in all aspects. Specter knight is 2nd and has the most fun platforming, but the story is weak and its lack of an overworld feels off. King knight is best for its great platforming, a great story, great level structure, and of course the very fun card minigame. The game is about 40 hours, would definitely recommend!. Played the first three and they are brilliant. Actually brilliant. Can be difficult, but the checkpoint system makes the game feel fair, like you’re able to jump straight back into things. Brilliant games.. It's really hard to judge the game as a single game. I'll just review the games separately: Shovel of Hope is good. The controls feel nice. The pixel graphics are awesome. There are some instant deaths, but you can avoid some using an item. The story is decent, with an interesting twist at the end. The level design is really thoughtful and well executed. Plague of Shadows is garbage. For a platformer, it's an extremely bold choice that Plague Knight can't pull off a decent jump. Even with the double jump, the height is ridiculous. You have to throw something at the peak of the double jump (with very difficult timing) to get the few extra pixels of height you need. The other option is the dash, which moves you way too fast and too far. It's very hard to control, you'll constantly touch enemies just to get knocked back ten meters, and die in a pit. Also, someone had the genius idea that you have to hold down the attack button for (what feels like) a minute to dash. This means that you can't attack while you charge the dash move, and you can waste a bomb because there's a limit on how many bombs you can throw at a time. The bombs also feel like trash. You constantly have to go to the menu to change what bomb you use or how you throw it. There's a quick selection, but it's useless because all the icons look the same, and you have to read the description. Also, it's frustrating that sometimes you forget to change the bomb (after every single enemy!) and you throw a wrong bomb, and then you die. The story is the only good thing about this game. Honestly, it plays like s**** and every good aspect can be found in the other games. Just don't play this game, and you'll have a good time with Treasure Trove. Specter of Torment is the best game of Treasure Trove. The wall climbing and dash move make Specter Knight the best playable character in the whole game. It's just incredible how good movement feels. As standalone game, it would be one of the best 2D platformers of all time. The story is also very dark and engaging, the hub world is full of dark charm and has an extra vicious challenge. My only criticism is that Specter Knight can feel a little overpowered sometimes, especially when you fight bosses from Shovel of Hope who weren't adapted for Specter Knights moveset. King of Cards is just a little better than Shovel of Hope. The moveset is a little more interesting. It is very clever that it is so forgiving, other than Plague of Shadows. Your dash move can be halted, and you can make another dash if you got hit by something to save your skin. The additional card game is fun, but it's just like EA games: pay to win. You can simply destroy your opponent with cheats you bought with in-game currency. The story is very funny, especially King Knight's mother. Showdown is like Super Smash Bros. for retro 2D characters. The menu is very unintuitive, the characters are not balanced well, and a few of the stages ****, but all in all, it's very much fun. The counter move is very nice, and it uses the elements from the previous games in a very clever way. Finally, I'd say that Shovel Knight is very good. The separate games recycle a lot of enemies and stages, but for each game, movement changes a lot. The level design is adapted to it, so it looks the same but feels different. I just wish they would make more bosses, or at least change their moveset more. It's a great platformer. Just don't play Plague of Shadows.. Very good. It’s basically 3 games in one and they play pretty differently. Great platforming and boss fights.. I know this gets a lot of love, but I just cant get into it. I am relatively new to video games and this felt so dated to me. I assume many people feel nostalgia while playing this, but I just felt frustration at the artificial limits placed on the player due to trying to achieve that ""older"" feel.. This is probably the most objectively perfect game I've ever played. Nothing but tightly designed levels, fun abilities, and with excellent visual presentation and music. For $40 it's well worth the price. If even remotely like 2D platformers then you need to play this game.. Soo much passion was put into this game. Amazing soundtrack and combat. Amazing content and replayability. Such a good game, although quite diffucult.. Shovel Knight might be the perfect example of retro gaming done well. It might also be the perfect example of indie gaming done well. Its definitely the perfect example of 2D platforming done well. Strongly recommended!. There are so many great games in this package, it can't really be faulted. My personal favourites are King Of Cards and Shovel Of Hope but it's all wonderful. So endearing, such tight gameplay.. This game is fantastic! Great Level Design, items are optional, the death system that is very similar to Dark Souls is motivating and there is so much content. Three campaigns, one of them is also playable in co op Mode. Also, Shovel Knight Showdown is fun to play for a few rounds. Best Indie Game ever made and one of the best Platformers out there.. The best action-platformer I played with some actual difficulty and great boss battles.. Shovel Knight, or as I like to call it: The little game that could. What was once just a simple kickstarter game has now etched its way into video game history with the character itself appearing in several other games. From a cameo in Yooka-Laylee, to a secret boss in Azure Striker Gunvolt, to a playable character in several indie fighting games. It would have never been so popular if the game itself wasn’t good and thankfully it is (could you imagine if it flopped). The game wears its Mega Man inspirations on it sleeves. It stars a hero in blue armor (a knight in this case), who has to defeat eight other evil knights and their master with the final battle/stage taking place in a castle. To say that it is a ripoff is completely off base, it may have the same premise, but it is in a completely different time period and it has a lot of personality (and there were no new Mega Man games being released so I doubt anyone would complain if they got anything resembling a Mega Man game). Every NPC has some dialogue and even some of the more random characters get fleshed out in DLC. As for the main character Shovel Knight. He may not have a lot of personality (one thing some people critiqued about the game), but think of other game characters like Mario, Link, or Mega Man. Other 8 bit heroes who did not have much personality, but they are all icons in the gaming world. What makes the character so memorable is… well he has a gimmick, he is a knight who uses a Shovel and that was all he needed. As a wrestling fan I know first hand that if a character has a cool gimmick they can get popular instantly. There are some layers to his characters however. I won’t go to deep into to avoid spoilers, but let’s just say that after some levels he will have a recurring dream about his greatest failure. So beneath that armor is a tortured soul with a big regret and it is his driving force on his quest. The bosses have their own motivations too, some are more expanded upon on in the DLC (which I will not be talking about because they all deserve their own review). They are fun characters who make the most of their screen time like the greedy Treasure Knight, the itty bitty Tinker Knight, the pretentious Propeller Knight, and my personal favorite Polar Knight who gives off an “I’m too old for this **** vibe. It goes without saying that all of the gimmicks of the knights reflect on their stages. All of the stages are colorful and challenging and memorable in their own way (side rant Propeller Knight took off years of my life and I hate him and his airship). While you don’t get a special power up or form from defeating the bosses, but during the levels if you go off the beaten path and find a treasure chest you can find a relic that relates to the boss, but at a cost. These things aren’t cheap ya know, but a lot of them aren’t worth it. Personally I just used the Dust Knuckles, Flame Wand, The Phase Locket, and the Chalices. Not gonna lie the Phase Locket bailed me out of a jam. Some might say that these relics and health upgrades can make the game easier, but you can make it more difficult by destroying the checkpoints and in return you’ll get some money. As for the final boss it is a pretty emotional fight and when you get to the final phase and after conquering the other bosses it makes you feel like you can take on the world. The ending will put a smile on your face as you see what happened to the other characters and how they turned their lives around (except for King Knight) and that final scene was just heartwarming, making your entire journey and the frustrations along the way worth the effort. I loved Shovel Knight and it deserves the praise it received.. this is one of the legendary indie games, and a must buy. my favorite part of these games are how they adds new mechanics constantly throughout the level, usually to combine them all in the final stretch in a very difficult section. King of cards has more simple, shorter levels, similar to mario games. Shovel of hope:10/10 Plague of shadows:7/10 specter of torment: 10/10 king of cards:11/10. First of all i think shovel knight treasure trove is the best game ever made. With that said people maybe would raise and eyebrow for that statement but really what yacht club has created is the perfect example of an indie game done right. I truly think that every indie game developer should take yacht club as an inspiration. Why i love shovel knight so much? First i think the platforming is one of the best especially with specter knight and king knight. Second the story is so good for NES like game and good anyway especially with specter knight and shovel knight. Third the content the game has to offer is just sooooooo good for a indie platformer you will always have fun even on the side stuff especially with king knight. And well i can go on forever why this game is the best but to round things up this game have magic that i didn't experience in any other game and i played a LOT of games in my time.. This software reeks of NES by its graphics, epic musics, sound effects, gameplay and difficulty level. But the developers cheated a bit, the NES would have never been able to reproduce such a platformer: No sprite flickering and no sound bugs, while providing comfort instalments like automatic game saves between the stages. It contains five games nowadays: - The original Shovel Knight (called Shovel of Hope here) - Plague of Shadows - Specter of Torment - King of Cards - Showdown (a game like an 8 bit version of Super Smash Bros.) My favourite out of these is clearly the original game. A knight with huge horns on his helmet who battles with a shovel, while using it also like Scrooge McDuck uses his cane in the NES game Duck Tales, jumping around on it like on a pogo stick. Without being sarcastic: Which geniuses came up with these ideas? That said, I had to lower the score a bit. A kind of lassitude came up because I played all the games (minus Showdown) consecutively without really playing a different game in between. On top of that I got stuck in the middle of Plague of Shadows, having difficulties to fully familiarise with the crucial bomb throwing mechanic, and in King of Cards, though the addition of a card game was a nice diversion I'm kind of bad at those in general.. These devs are some of the most devoted I have ever seen. They literally added a Smash Bros mode for no reason and it's amazing.. Not too difficult. Always fair. 100s of mechanics. The difficult is not felt as a chore. Can be played as bite sized chunch. The 4 characters play very differently and the makes to game looks like new every time. The fact that the story is coherent and interesting all along is remarkable. The only other game that goes that far is Hollow Knight.. Must be something wrong with me because unlike almost everyone else I don’t get why this game is such a big deal. It’s ok, but has nothing other retro platformers don’t - Nice pixel art? Check. Secrets? Check - personally I had a lot more fun with The Messenger. Ultimately, this game is frequently frustrating as hell. Like you make a perfectly good jump but an off-screen enemy flies in and bounces you back into a pit. Oh great, back to the last checkpoint - AGAIN.. A very good indie game and 2D Platformer. I had many fun with that game. The graphic is also cool.. An expensive trip down memory lane, when games really ****. Repetitive, frustrating, and ridiculously overpriced at $30.. the original game is definetly the best (10/10) while the other included games are more like an 7/10. Not fun at all. Feels like an old arcade game where the only goal was to get you to shove more quarters into the machine. Die, go back to the last checkpoint, grind your way back to some unfun boss or “skill” test, die, go back to the last checkpoint, etc., etc. Old graphics, old mechanics ... worth $5 maximum.. This game is ok, but is definitely frustrating at times. It is a Mega Man clone, especially in level design, enemy design and boss design. Level selection layout is similar to Super Mario 3. Interestingly, it shares similarities with Hollow Knight, with the shovel bounce off the heads of enemies and the money drop that floats in air upon death. All of those games I enjoyed a ton, but Shovel Knight not quite as much. Mega Man bosses were easy if you figured out the order to beat the bosses in and a particular boss’s weakness. Shovel Knight bosses were just easy. Super Mario 3 just had better gameplay, along with a bigger map with interesting warp options. Hollow Knight had better gameplay, better art, less frustrating deaths, and you could get your money back most of the time. Mostly, I just didn’t find the game well balanced. Shovel knight’s purple armor allowed additional magic, the phase locket cost little magic to induce invincibility, and 2 goblets of red ichor could be called upon to replenish both magic and HP completely. Consequently, deaths by enemy were few. Deaths instead came through frustrating platforming falls into bottomless pits or spikes for an instant death. These were often caused by kickback from your own attack, difficult sections of moving parts, or a combination of wind and spikes. I like hard games, and Super Meat Boy was a favorite, but these deaths always seamed to come after a significant playthrough, right before the next checkpoint. A portion of my money was often lost as it would fall in difficult and/or unretrievable areas. Unlocking secret areas was pretty unimaginative as well, as most were simply found by shoveling through a knot in the wall. I did enjoy the tower of fate and the final bosses, but it wasn’t enough to make up for the rest of the game. And worst of all, after beating Shovel of Hope, I played the next game expecting a new game. What I got was largely THE SAME GAME!!!! - same exact levels, tweaked a little. The difference was that you played with a different character with a new set of skills - lame. Ok - so I kept playing and the game was tweaked more than I thought. It burrowed levels from the original but changed them to varying degrees, rewrote the stories, and changed various other aspects. Plague knight had a steeper learning curve and lots of weapon combination choices. It was perhaps the most frustrating game of the 4, but also had the most replay ability. Also, the best writing of the 4 games was Plague knight. Specter knight I found most enjoyable overall as the gameplay felt so natural and pit deaths were minimized. King of cards probably had second best gameplay and introduced a card game, but the rules were not explained well. This was probably the second most enjoyable for me.. Nice graphics, excellent gameplay and an amazing soundtrack. This game understood the greatness of retro 2D-Platormers and took it to the sky and beyond! I enjoyed every bit of the four campaigns, it's worth every penny!. I do feel the name speaks for itself. This game is truly a treasure trove of content. Fun throughout.. Overrated made videogame; it took all the frustrating **** from old games, made another game in the oversatured artstyle and it is just ****. Not a bad game, but certainly does not live up its name and all the ridiculous praise. Very generic plattformer at best. Only played a bit of Shovel of Hope so far. Love the design and charm of the game, but the controls are suuuuper clunky to the point where it sometimes feels like the game is eating your input. Shovel Knight handles like he weighs approximately two tons, really sluggish with a jump that is just really short for my taste. Also, SoH brings back the ""classic"" Castlevania feature of knocking you back every time you get hit, thereby ensuring you dying, losing your treasure and getting sent back to the last checkpoint. WTF??? Are you serious?? This was **** 30 years ago and it's still **** now. Another thing: Why bind the downward shovel attack to pressing down?? This makes executing the move really awkward, since you pretty much always want to also move left or right in the air at the same time. There are SOOOOOO MANY buttons on modern controllers. USE THEM!!!. Terrible character controls make the game borderline unplayable, and definitely not enjoyable. I seriously don't know what yall smoked to give it a 10. The original Super Mario Brothers controlled much better than this.. Giving treasure trove a rating any less than 10 would be ridiculous. Shovel of Hope is a solid and varied platforming game inspired by the NES era. Plague of Shadows is out of the four campaigns, in my opinion, the weakest but it still stands a fantastic love story with a complicated but rewarding item system. Specter of Torment has absolutely buttery smooth platforming and makes every button press a joy. King of Cards is almost as good of a platformer as Specter of Torment, but what ties it with the aforementioned in quality is Joustus, a strategy card game with an impressive amount of depth for how easy it is to understand. Each campaign also has amazing music and art. Easily the best indie game of all time.. Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove may be one of the best value games every created. For only 40 dollars, it comes with the base game along with 3 full DLC campaigns and a fighting game! The platforming feels very fair yet challenging and the boss battles are the best I have ever seen besides for Cuphead (and possibly Hollow Knight). Many people compare this to games of old - it does share many similarites, but is not quite the same. Shovel Knight takes the classic Mega Man/ Mario platforming genre and polishes it so that every aspect of thew game seems fair. There is much to adore in this Kickstarter-funded game and it lives up to the praise it is given.. What a legendary experience this game is. All 4 DLC bring so much to the table, and really mix it up every-time.. The game was really good but there’s 2 things that really took a step back for me. The knock back of an attack was really intense, almost 1/4 of the screen. Just not needed to be that strong. The other is that there are NO music note hints. I like exploration games and I loved the music notes, but i need to know how many are left in each level or something. Extremely minimal hints. I just have no idea where I’m missing them and I don’t want to turn to google.. Pure creativity. So much love in these games. My ranking of the games would be: Shovel of Hope, Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards. Shovel has a great story and great gameplay. Plague's story is my favorite of the four but the the controls were a little wonky for me it wasn't until I got the vast where I was starting to catch a rhythm. Specter was super smooth and the story twists were a nice surprise also thankfully they changed the stages up a bit more. And King is just the perfect sendoff. I spent over 25 hours in this game, it is so worth it. I haven't touched Showdown as of yet but that mode just adds more meat to the game. So much packed in this game.. This game is absolutely fantastic and every platformer fan should play this. It has amazing level design, funny and charming character, fun jump-physics and tons of fun items and even cheat-codes.. Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is a wonderful, well-made game. Despite its homage to various old games (like Mega Man), this game is solid in and of itself, with a simple but enjoyable story, well-designed and fun levels, nice graphics and music, and responsive controls, lacking in major flaws. Positives: + The controls are quite fluid, especially if you are using a controller. + Graphics are detailed and pretty + Stages and bosses are well designed and challenging. + The story is sufficiently interesting and emotional + The music is fantastic + The developers have been building the game with dedication, continuing to release new content and improvements for more than 5 years. Negatives: - The projectiles of certain enemies and bosses are hard to see in the background. Neutral: ~ The difficulty is very high, amplified by the existence of knockback and insta-death pits. Depending on who you are, this may be a pro or a con. Overall: Enjoyable, challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and lacking in major flaws. Nostalgic players may enjoy it even more than average players.. This is one of my favorite indie games,period. The outstandingly fun,innovative and challenging (but not too hard) gameplay,combined with great stories,an awesome soundtrack by Jake Kaufman and,of course,the beautiful 8-Bit style,which unlike many indie games,actually evokes NEStalgia,wrapped in a bow with four campaigns,plus multiplayer mode make an incredible product. If you like any type of Jump-'n-Run games,be it Mario,Mega Man,Ducktales,etc.,you have no excuse to not get this game. Did I mention that $40 is quite a small price for four campaigns,plus an additional four player-battle mode?. I do not give a 10 so easily, im giving it right now for this game and also Hollow knight, and there is a thing in common with this games, prepare for the cringe, the thing has ""love"". Both games had an amazing support from their developers years after thei release, this one had three DLC, very cheap for all the content it adds (3 more campaigns + smash bross like brawl), the best campaign for me is specter but still havent played king knight. The DLC also has a ""smash bross like brawl"" which is very fun, it feels a lot like super smash 64 because of the number of players and game mechanics (i can finally play shield knight and specter is great for battle), there is story mode for every character (just a series of figths but you have limited lives and different difficulties) and couch pvp 1 to 4. Know what about shovel knight? the game is a homag","king of cards has a fun card mini-game and short'n sweet levels . Plague of shadows has incredibly fun mechanics and an incredibly deep story . the game isn't even 1 gigabyte, yet it manages to have content that AAA games strive to have ."
271.Mario Golf,"A classic that aged very well due to the easy to play yet challenging to master mechanics. I remember renting this game multiple times and never getting enough of it, and now that there are other ways to play the game today, it still has that magic element that keeps pulling you back. But in addition to the simple yet highly refined game mechanics, the game does a great job of implementing Nintendo’s charm without making it about gimmicks. The levels have nice little touches of Nintendo without being overbearing like the later games in the series. The music is simple but it works so well with the game. I also like how the game is designed to help you become better by replaying the same courses, which sounds bad, but it’s very rewarding. There are several characters to unlock and several modes to explore, there is a lot to experience here. It’s my favorite in the Mario Golf series and it holds up to the rest of time very well.. A well engineered and attractively presented golf game but not different enough from the others to convert unbelievers.. Probably the best console golf game that's name doesn't start with ""Hot Shots"". Worst golf game I've ever played! And what's even worse, is that ""Mario"" is not even a character from the start... You have to play against characters to unlock more, and the npc's always gets the best shots etcetera. So winning is impossible... This is a great sleeper of a Mario game with an especially great soundtrack. Really simple yet fun to play.. It sure is golf. Although it's fun, that's really it. I prefer Mario Tennis but this game is alright.. Although I do not like golf, I must admit that I have spent quite a few hours with this video game addiction.. There is nothing like a good game of golf with Nintendo's mascot & friends on N64 & GBC!. This game is okay. I have it on the Wii, and played it once. I haven't played it in AGES but is still a good game. The graphics are great for the N64. The controls are mediocre but got used to it. The character selection is okay. The course designs were fine. Mario Golf 64 is good overall but not the best. It is wourth playing.. I remember playing this on lazy days in with the family. A great multi-player game if you're after a chilled out affair! Never did really enjoy playing it alone though.","the music is simple but it works so well with the game . the game is designed to help you become better by replaying the same courses, which sounds bad, but it’s very rewarding . it's my favorite in the Mario golf series and it holds up to the rest of time very well ."
272.Crash Bandicoot: Warped,"Brilliant game, best in the series, Crash Bandicoot: Warped is a extremely memorable game from the PS1, and still holds up today. It's fun and dangerous boss fights mixed with the smooth soundtrack makes it a blast all the way through. I've replayed Crash 3 about 10 times. One of the best (if not the best) Crash game out there. A classic if you love platformers.. Crash bandicoot Warped or 3 for me are best game of crash bandicoot I played. Great and fun game. I think the only thing holding it back is a lot of gimmicky levels like the bike ones, the water levels and the pura rides, that got me really annoyed specially when trying to 100% it. But they are still fun levels and the animation and characters are still goofy and fun like the others. Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is an absolute masterpiece **** that has stood the test of time. The game is a true gem of the platforming genre, and it's easy to see why it's still held in such high regard years after its release. The graphics are outstanding, with vibrant colors and detailed environments that truly bring the game to life. The sound design is also top-notch, with *catchy* music and a wide range of sound effects that perfectly complement the action on screen. The gameplay is where Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped truly shines. The game offers a perfect mix of platforming and action, with a variety of levels that each offer their own unique challenges and obstacles. The controls are precise and responsive, making it easy to navigate the levels and pull off some truly impressive moves. One of the standout features of the game is the ability to travel through time and explore different eras and locations. This adds an extra layer of depth to the game and keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. Overall, Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is a must-play game that I would highly recommend to anyone who loves platformers. With its incredible graphics, fantastic gameplay, and memorable characters, it's easy to see why this game has become a classic in the world of gaming. 10/10. (Just for any question, my favorite level was Double-header). One of the best games for me when I was child. The best from the PS1 games, awesome to replay everything for gems til you complete the whole game. Looks objectively better than the N-Sane remaster. Just objectively better.. Sony Computer Entertainment America's Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped for PlayStation is a perfect game!. 2nd best in the franchise and it's still a 10/10. .. The best platformer game ever. Graphics, characters, level design, soundtrack, everything is an absolute beauty. Must - play!. My favorite game from original Crash trilogy. It brought power ups to the game (for defeating bosses), time trials and also you can play as Coco in some levels.. Truly a step up from it’s predecessors and even competition. Easily takes the cake. ----------------------------------------------**** of my favorite game of all time-------------------------------------. The Gameplay Have Many Ideas And I like all ot them especially flying levels and the music are so good I like dingodile and n tropy oat and the visual are very good I never bored of this game and the story is good not The Best story but it's good and make game better This Game Is One Of The Best 3 Games I Ever Played. Captivating, fun, clever game. There are no games like this anymore. It's quite difficult but it has a lot of replay value!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The third installment in the crash bandicoot franchise was an extremely strong one. For the time it looked great and ran well. The gameplay and controls were peak although I didn't like all of the vehicle sections, most notably the plane sections. The idea of warp rooms and crate breaking mechanics were great ideas, it had motivation to be completed too with the reward of new levels. It was quite a small amount of glitches which is always welcome. It is an easier game than crash 1+2 but still a gem and a truly classic crash game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A classic. Although I'm not a huge fan of the franchise, this one was pretty good.. I will never forget how excited I was to play this game, I really liked it when Coco could go up to the Pura, good soundtrack, all good. By adding new mechanics to a crash game, naughty dog ​​gave us a very fun platform game. It's like a stone even today. Platform game lovers should play with emulators.. CRASH BANDICOOT 3 biggest problem is too many mini games and they are not that good . The new abilities feel more like a side grade Instead of upgrades so, it get in the way of the platforming. Que no se ha dicho de warped. Es un juegazo para la PS1 y el mejor juego de crash bandicoot. Sin duda la merece la aclamación universal. Buena historia, Buenos gráficos, Buena música y nuevos elementos importantes e icónicos para la franquicia. aunque hay un montón de vehículos que a veces aleja al plataformeo. pero si tienes PS1 o los remasters. no pienses dos veces y juégalo. Everything we could possibly say for Warped has been said already. It's a great game for the PS1 and the best crash bandicoot game. It certainly deserves universal acclaim. Good story, good graphics, good music, and important and iconic new elements for the franchise. although there are a lot of vehicles that sometimes take the platform away. but if you have PS1 or the remasters. don't think twice and play it.. Spanish: La culminación de la saga crash. Aquí se combina lo mejor de la trilogía. 9.1/10 English: The culmination of the crash saga. Here the best of the trilogy is combined. 91/100. CB3 it's a great game, great music and graphics, the story maybe not so good but works and the gameplay has some flaws but still playable. Very good plataformer for PS1. Crash 3 is a fantastic sequel but I'm going to explain why this is my least favourite in trilogy. 1. It's far too ez, the difficulty also spikes quite often in this game. Warp room 3 is actually harder than warp room 5. This is a great game for children but has the least replay ability for me due to its difficulty. 2. Too many vehicle levels. I mean almost half the game is non-platform levels and while I do like the underwater and the pura levels the rest of the vehicle levels are poorly executed. 3. The level design at times is very uninspired, I'm not talking about the theming I'm talking about how the actual levels play take the medieval levels, they are just boring theres nothing special about these levels they are just go from point a to point b. You can even ran on the edge of the levels avoiding the Pits and enemies. 4. The lack of secrets in this game harms the experience for me as that was one the most exciting things to discover in the previous games. And the 2 secret levels are bs especially the dino secret. Anyway crash 3 did a lot of amazing things like the bosses are the best and addition of the time relics is genius but these issues I have with crash are to big to go unnoticed which is whys it's my least favourite out off the trilogy.. I can't stop playing this game!!!This game is awsome!!!Great muscic,fantasticcheracters and this level desing :-). The graphics are excellent for a PlayStation 1 game, I love the variety in the level themes and to this day the game still looks wonderful with solid gameplay and challenging platforming and great level design and tight and responsive controls and the gameplay variety such as driving jetski and airplanes are fun but the motorcycle racing levels and the water levels are not that great, I love the amount of content in this game, and the secrets and the 100% completion gives a very fun challenge.. A timeless classic. We don't see perfect games release too often but this was one of the perfect titles I witnessed and experienced. It was re-released for PS4 and was still a huge success again years later.. Despite personally loving first two Crash games slightly more, Crash Bandicoot Warped is far above average platformer! This game, even nowadays, still feels the most fresh from the original trilogy and is technically and controll-wise the best. Naughty Dog expanded upon previous entries in many ways. We find out about Aku Aku's evil twin brother Uka Uka who was set free and become the main antagonist alongside Dr. Neo Cortex. Once again your main goal is to collect crystals and gems which were retrieved with a help of Dr. N. Tropy's time travel machine. During your journey you beat levels throughout whole history (Ancient Egypt, Great Wall of China, Medieval themed levels, etc.) and eventually make it to the future. After completing every level in certain warp room, you are able to take its boss on, these battles are fun, you battle Crash' old foes, but you also encounter some new faces. New playable character was added, Coco, Crash' sister, whose role is just minor and you controll her only in her specified levels. Additionally, two major things were included, new obtainable skills and mainly, time relics. Skills are acquired after defeating boss and are permanent, double jump and longer spin are both really useful, especially combined which is required in certain levels. Final ability called Crash Dash is highly useful when going for time relics which is simply collectible achieved by speedruning level and metting its target time. This collectible pushes replay value significantly higher and you find yourself attempting levels again and again for the best time.. Crash Bandicoot Warped is a game that I consider one of the must play titles for the PS1. The game improves upon the ground work laid by the previous entries in the series while staying true to the heart of the series. Each level brings new challenges for you to overcome. Graphically, it looks great considering the hardware of the PS1 and the soundtrack is one of my all time favorites. The additional powers you gain from boss fights are blended well into the game play and don't feel tacked on. Some levels (Bug Lite for example) can be a little unforgiving and the ride levels (Deep Trouble, Orange Asphalt and Makin' Waves for example) do feel a little clunky, and keeping the levels mostly within the same few themes (Egypt, Middle East, Medieval) does lead to some same feeling levels but overall, these are minor critiques and don't take away from this all time gem of a platformer.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. First game i ever played on PSX and the best one. This game is funny arcade adventure, perfect for console. I had no problem while i played it years and year ago and not yet in 2020. Even for 2020 it looks pretty good. I have to give this legend 10/10. Slightly worse than Crash Bandicoot 2 IMO. CB2 had better atmosphere even though it didn't have as much gameplay variety. Still a great game.. My hero, my pet, my friend, Crash is my childhood, the best game of him, I really missed the time when I played with my ps1. Best incarnation of Crash in original trilogy! Absolute masterpiece with countless replayability. I don't know how many hundrets (or thousands?) times I've played this game... Absolute gem (or power crystal?) which shaped my childhood. Unparalleled experience in platformer genre! I LOVE IT!. Crash Bandicoot is the King of platform gaming! You know what Einstein said? ""The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple"" And Crash is just that, a geniously designed (credit to Naughty Dog) game full of gems (literally and metaphorically). It's simplistic in style and beautiful. It's hard, but rewarding. It is designed to be fun, but also to challenge the player. To be the crowning achievement in the Platforming experience!. That game just set standards in gaming, just like it's sequel, Crash Team Racing, it's a game at it's finest. Multiple challenges, different mechanics througout the game and wonderful music. This game is just WONDERFUL!!!. Banjo Kazooie is the best 3D Platformers of the 90s Not this I’m sorry I tried but in the end the bear and bird win 100% This is a very meh game the story is ok the gameplay is some what fun I guess, not as fun as say Super Mario 64 or even some parts of DK64. The level design is pretty basic run through, jump over obstacles With a pinch of hey this is cool let’s throw in some poorly designed water riding levels or some levels where you are riding a motorcycle and hopefully people like it type levels. Overall this game is pretty meh that gets to many good reviews from people with alot of nostalgia. 5/10. This is easily the best platformer game ever made and one of my favorite games of all time. A masterpiece. A lot better than a **** Mario game.. One of the best games ever. Must have. It is game of my childhood. Great gameplay, great music, awesome graphics. Just try excellent ps classic. This game is: simple, beautiful and timeless. It reminds me of my childhood. It was one of those games that I wanted to start again after 100% complete.. What a great game! While all three Crash Bandicoot games on the PS are superb, this might be the one with the most variaton. I have to say the first one still gives me the most nostalgic good feelings, but they're all very good. Not like the boring Crash games that appeared on the PS2!. A fantastic game keeping you hooked non stop. Its a game with little issues that will not stop you from its enjoyment. Crash Bandicoot 3 a game with a bunch of replay value. Crash Bandicoot 3 contains a bunch of different levels, challenges, and more vehicles then the previous installments in the series. The game's only let down is the number of vehicles, Crash Bandicoot 3 is a platform game after all. The vehicles are not too bad but are over used within the game. I would still recommend Crash Bandicoot 2 over the 3rd game due to this problem. In conclusion this is still a fantastic game. 9.5/10. Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped in many ways, is a massive let down. While Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back fixed most of flaws of the original game, Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped decided to add new problems. What few areas this game improves over Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back are not enough to save this game. I'd advise you skip this game entirely and simply play Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back.. crash bandicoot series are the best games on play station one . and best game of the series is this one i love it .. This game is a fun platformer with excellent levels, good controls and fun Bosses - however be warned that in the later part of the game you will need to perfect any power-ups otherwise you will be punished. And there is a strong replayablilty factor to this game to grab everything in every level to get the illusive 105% save file.. A masterful game in the PS1 Library, that combines amazing action platforming, fun and unique gameplay mechanics and a overall memorable experience.. The ""Crash Bandicoot"" series was one of the most popular PlayStation franchises out there in its heyday. And the first two games in the series, ""Crash Bandicoot"" and ""Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back,"" despite some flaws, were very fun and enjoyable platformers. But ""Crash Bandicoot: Warped,"" the third entry in the franchise, sees the much-loved PlayStation series at its absolute finest. Every aspect of ""Crash Bandicoot: Warped"" has been fine-tuned and polished to perfection to make this the best entry in the franchise. Much like the first two games, the visuals and music remain spot-on, but it's the gameplay where this one truly shines. Where the first two games would suffer from different problems, such as lack of variation, poor boss fights, and general trial-and-error gameplay that led to some instances of ""fake difficulty,"" this game suffers from none of those. The game throws a number of different styles at you, and makes them all work wonderfully. The levels feel lengthy, fun and well-designed, and the boss battles, one of my biggest problems with earlier ""Crash Bandicoot"" games, actually feel more enticing and interesting this time around. What's better, the game doesn't suffer from the same trial-and-error issues that plagued the first two games: where ""Crash Bandicoot"" and ""Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back"" would often have you die due to some kind of strange, impassable, and often cheap aspect of the gameplay, that won't happen this time. This actually feels like the first ""Crash Bandicoot"" game that I've played where all of my errors, deaths, and fails were legitimately my fault, and not the error of the game's development. It's plain to see, ""Crash Bandicoot: Warped"" is easily the best of the ""Crash Bandicoot"" games, and if you haven't played this gem, do yourself a favor! Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". That only nostalgia for me. I really like this game! That's fun to play it,excellent arcade. That's all i can say. Crash Bandicoot 3 is a fun, beautiful platformer held back by too many annoying gimmick levels. The main platformer levels are the real stars of the show here, and it helps that those let you use the upgrades you get from beating the bosses, unlike the boring flight, jetski, and underwater levels.. It was my very first game and I still believe its probably one of the best I've ever played. I strongly recommend this masterpiece to all gamers all over the world. Warped offers a lot of variety with it's gameplay, with in itself offers a very solid experience. In addition to this, the level designs are very creative, the 3D platforming levels are as solid and entertaining as ever, and the visuals are very good for it's time. Crash is as insane and likable as he has been, and the game features smooth controls as well. Earning new moves after the boss battles allow for new additional ways to approach the levels when replaying. This allows the replayability value to be enhanced. However, Crash isn't a revolutionary game, and it isn't a game that I feel comfortable jumping into at any time, due to it's narrow linear structure, and some controls like the vehicle levels having controls that feel outdated. Still, it is a very good gameplay experience, and is rightfully regarded to be the best game of the Crash franchise.. My favorite crash game yes I would still choose it over N. Sane Trilogy to my surprise. I just do not know where to start. The levels are fresh and brand new and there is **** minigames I don't know. Well anyways Crash 3 Warped all the way.. Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped Remastered Hit and miss. Warped is a bit of a mess... it adds a bunch of great things to the crash bandicoot series… but adds a bunch of questionable things and doesn’t do enough of the great stuff This game follows the same formula as the other 2 games, collect fruit, don’t die And story wise you’re dealing with great uka uka, and your aku aku friend knows exactly who this fool is and like in crash 2 you set out to gather 25 crystals and take out every games boss along the way… Crash 3s level design is a step up from crash 2, especially when it comes to the remastered version of these games… crash 2 felt like just a continuation of the original crash in the collection while warped stands out as its own thing… easily the best looking game in the trilogy this is also the shortest game in the trilogy only taking me 4 and a half hours to complete… This is also the easiest game in the trilogy as I didn’t feel the need to grind once.. it feels very modern because of this… added to this game to make it even easier are special moves you get once you defeat a boss… these moves include the ability to double jump and a gun to kill enemies long range which really make the final stretch of the game a breeze… The hardest part of this game is actually its bosses… They’re tough from the start... they aren’t a walk in the park break from the game like the other 2 crash games... these bosses keep you on your toes as you’re juggling different items on screen with your eyes trying not to take damage.. And while the bosses are the hardest part, they aren’t the most frustrating part… that award goes to the hog riding races… these levels are not fun at all... and require you to get a perfect run in order to be rewarded your crystal… and this along with other gimmicks is where I feel crash 3 went wrong… I didn’t mind the underwater sections here… and I really loved the Yoshi style 10 seconds I got in one level and would’ve loved to see more of that… But this game also adds jet ski levels and dog fighting levels that are just complete garbage with of course the hog riding… and it seems these were added in at the expense of boulder dashes as they’re gone from the game aside from 2 moments in the platforming levels where you get a little taste… You’re also having a back and forth playing as coco bandicoot here as well.. She takes your place in the animal riding sections as she travels along the great wall on an adorable tiger… I had a lot of fun with crash 3 most of the time… without the crappy vehicle levels, and more of the baby dyno riding, crash 3 had potential to be my favorite game in the series... but these vehicles are bad enough to bring this game down to being the weakest in the n sane trilogy... I give Crash Bandicoot 3 Warped Remastered a 6/10. Nice memories 18 years ago... nice levels, bosses, secrets, graphichs for the last year... now im trying go to 105% of the game in a emulator of android phone. :3. The best Crash game out of the original three games on the PS1. The controls are so tight and responsive, the levels are incredibly well designed and memorable and adding the special power ups to this game was a brilliant edition Honestly my favorite PS1 platformer and a game I regularly play for fun.. This game was amazing! This game did do a lot but didn't get out of hand (looking at you wrath of cortex) I love this game and I would 100% recommend this game.. Masterpiece ****, arguably the best in the series. Levels and soundtrack are so iconic and nostalgic for me, and the replay value for this is incredible. One of the best platformers ever and will always be.. On its own, Crash 3 is an amazing game. However when compared to the last game, I feel like Crash 2 was just much better with more platforming levels and secrets than the third game. There are to many levels with different controls and gameplay styles. In Crash 2 there were only 4 levels out of 25 that had a different gameplay style, thats not even 20% of the game, the rest is just fun platforming and what you'd expect from a Crash Bandicoot game. In Crash 3 its 11 out of 25, which means that you'll be spending 44% of the game in boring minigame levels. The only thing I can say is better in Crash 3 over the last two games are the bosses and powerups. The game as a whole is still amazing and a worthy ending to the trilogy. SCORE: 9.1 / 10. My favorite Crash Bandicoot game ever. This is one of best games on the original Playstation and is still amazingly playable to this day. Well worth a play.. This is one fantastic game! My nostalgia might be clouding my judgement a little bit, but this game is still very fun. Great levels for the most part and great gameplay. The story is kind of there, but that doesn't matter as much for a game if the rest of the game is good. Technically, the only replay value is the Time Trial, but I love coming back to this game a lot. It's worth playing a lot.. Crash Bandicoot: Warped is a 3D platform game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. + Super Fun + Variety Levels. The conclusion to the Crash Bandicoot trilogy, this title is certainly the most impressive game ever released on the PlayStation One. Sure, it might not be as hard of a challenge to complete this game as it was two decades ago, but there isn't any other game on that system that could ever get close in ranking to this masterpiece.. This is the best crash game of all time! This game has a lot of great variety and uses it well. The graphics look amazing and the gameplay is amazing. Best playstation 1 game of all time!. I am going to be that guy who says that I personally like Crash 1 & 2 better, but to this day there is still so much fun to be had with warped. Its one of those timeless classics that we can revisit in years to come and still feel fresh because it played so well. In terms of a challenge, its still very difficult, but this one is the weakest of the 3. However the gameplay, secrets and longevity make up for it. I gave this an 8 out of 10 because of the tedious vehicle levels which have bad controls and I don't really find them that fun anymore. Aside from that, amazing game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10 out of freaking ten for this one I didn't really like crash 2 so I wasn't sure how this one would go but seroiusly make sure you have a good surgeon to re attach your chin when it falls of because of how great this game is. What more can be asked great levels, great bosses, awesome power ups that tips the hat to Mega Man as to how you get them. Anyone who has a ps1 2 or even 3 HAS to get this if you love crash. Seroiusly id you don't like this then go to I psychiatrist or something because I can't drag you out of that pit in your mind.. Crash Bandicoot: Warped is a 3D platform game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game's story takes place immediately after the events of the preceding game: Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. The ruins of a space station called the Cortex Vortex owned by the series antagonist, Doctor Neo Cortex, crash-lands on Earth and unleashes an evil entity known as Uka Uka, Aku Aku's evil younger twin brother, who joins with Cortex and the time-obsessed Doctor Nefarious Tropy and they plan to gather powerful Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth. The game follows the main characters Crash and Coco Bandicoot as they travel through time and prevent the villains from gathering the Crystals by collecting them themselves.. Crash Bandicoot Warped is a 3D platformer done right. The levels are very well designed, the bosses are challenging and fun, there is loads of replay ability, and the characters are quirky and memorable. The only thing I didn't like we're the water levels, but other than that, this is easily one of the best games on the PS1. Final Score-9/10. A game that defined my childhood simply a masterpiece of a platformer naughty dogs third installment in the series is the best one with it's amazing diverse gameplay.. This is best PSONE GAME with Metal Gear Solid in my opinion . This game better than Super Mario 64 , but Sonic Adventure better than Crash Bandicoot Warped , but Crash bandicoot warped cool too . In this game good storyline and goo graphics for 1998 .. Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 8 Story : 7 Sound : 8 ********************************************************************************** Overall : 9. Simply the best 2.5D platformer on the Playstation with great graphics and sound effects, and great controls. All 3 Crash Bandicoot games are excellent, all other Bandicoot games that came out on PS2 are not even close to this! If I have to chose the ideal mascot to represent the Playstation, I would doubt between Lara Croft or Crash Bandicoot. That's how good they are! I rate this game a perfect 10 out of 10.. Deceptively imprecise platforming, due to the controls and the camera angle. By today's standards a short and clichéd game. Classic mechanics perform as expected, few surprises for those familiar with the genre. Compared to the newer Rayman or Mario games, this old PS1 'gem' is just way less fun. And fun is the only thing it aims for. Unless it meant to be that frustrating.. Most frustrating game i have ever played, but still i love this game. Nice gameplay, much to explore, many bonuses, and much collecting. There are hard bosses, but they are fun to defeat, and it's a memorable game. This game has nice graphics, and many different levels. This is a game i will recommend everybody.. This is 1 of the select few games that game companies should look at for inspiration and it shows that it stood the test of time as it is still one of the best 3d platformers out.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. my childhood. that was this game is. my **** childhood. even now i love to play this **** awesome game !!! breathtaking graphics. looks like an early ps2 game. for me crash 3 was the best game on the ps1. and still **** is. awesome enemies. great boss fights. everything in this game look detailed. sometimes u can play with the coco bandicoot with great levels. awesome sound effects. amazing soundtrack and badass **** dialogue. oh and btw. F*CK activision for **** with this franchise. i hope it will return to naughty dog.. It is hard to follow up with good sequels; however, this was not the case with Crash Bandicoot 3. Everything from part 1 and 2 are here but with extra touches that improved the overall quality of the gameplay. The game was varied and bosses were challenging. Crash Bandicoot Warped was very fun to play and had a high reply value. Immortal. Crash Bandicoot 3 is a game that I will remember forever as the greatest linear action-adventure game for the Playstation 1. I played all 3 games around a decade ago and even to this very day, they hold a special place in my history as a gamer. Crash, despite not being able to talk is still one of the wackiest, most fun heroes I have ever played and all the funny deaths, all the crazy moves and wumpa fruit collecting to get the relics and gems were awesome. The aircraft battles, motorcycle races, jetskis, running, bazookas and crazy shet were infinitely fun! I loved every minute of being addicted to this game! I really hope they make something like this again in that exact old style. I'd but it in a heartbeat.. The third installment of the Crash Bandicoot,frankly was the best.With great soundtrack,awesome graphics and great playabilitie. 10/10 Soundtrack-10/10 Graphics-9/10 Playabilitie-10/10 Too bad it was the last true Crash Bandicoot platformer. Review-Henry4Dead. Classic platformer, great graphics, 30,000 frames of animation (at least I have heard it has over that sum) and THE best 3D controls for a PS game, whether you use the D-Pad or the Joystick. Only a few action buttons are required to play the game and the control scheme is easy to get a hold for, and to make beating bosses feel even more rewarding than in previous Crash titles, as you can unlock new abilities by killing them. so good.. All I can say is that if you have not played this game, you are not a gamer. This was the first game I ever owned and it is the best platformer of all time. Mario can shove it up his ass because he's got nothing on crash.. Naughty Dog should be proud. They've made one of the best 3D platformers ever made! It's colorful graphics, over-the-top voice acting, and fast gameplay leaves your head spinning for days!. This game is simply perfect. The story is short, but concise and clear, and the premise is spot on. The character models and design are awesome, the level design is beautiful, creative, and immersive, and graphics for its day are objectively top-notch (remember that this was on the PS1!). The controls are tight, and the replayability that the Time Trial mechanic adds will keep you hooked! The variety in the gameplay is outstanding, yet similar enough with itself to remind you that it is all in one game! This game is even a technical masterpiece due to the smoothness of the many engines, and the game runs very well! It is extremely difficult to dislike this game, especially if it is your first time playing - I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.. My jaw dropped to the floor when I first played the jetski levels, the bike racing tracks, the tiger riding goodness. Each level is exquisitely crafted, the controls are excellent, the graphics are gorg","""crash bandicoot 3: warped"" is a must-play game for anyone who loves platformers . the game offers a perfect mix of platforming and action, with a variety of levels . the controls are precise and responsive, making it easy to navigate the levels ."
273.Call of Duty,"A Very Good game. It's not fantastic - or even ""Great"" by its own merits. But it does its job well and is a very, very good product. It's worth having and playing for the old fashioned qualities and historical significance alone. The game may run you a few bucks - but the feeling you get when comparing it to modern incarnations of the franchise is priceless - and you will not be disappointed.. The one that started it all. Call of Duty was able to release a game the improved on everything that Medal of Honor was doing at the time.. Good game. An intense game where you live the war, the ambience is so immersive.. 1. Design - The mechanics and the design are well ahead of their time, so for that they have a 9 from me. 2. Repeatability - I would totally play this game again. I liked it a lot. It has a solid 10 from me on this one. 3. Luck-Tactic - You can make **** tactic, because the randomness is nearly nonexistent. For that, it has an 8 from me here. 4. Value for money - 10 € for it on Steam is a bit much, but for the time it was released at, it's quite ok. For today though, it's a bit much. An 8 on this from me. (9+10+2*8)/4=35/4=8.75, so 9. No matter how much you slander the courage and sacrifice of Soviet people, you can never falsify that the Soviet Union was the greatest contributor to the victory of WWII.. ""Call of Duty,"" developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision, is a popular first-person shooter (FPS) video game series. The series includes a variety of games that appeal to a broad player base, exploring themes of war. The initial ""Call of Duty"" game was released in 2003 and has expanded over the years with numerous sequels and spin-off stories. Here is a detailed review of the ""Call of Duty"" game, focusing on the series' core features:Game Story:""Call of Duty"" typically features rich and diverse stories based on war themes. In its first installment, players are engaged in various theaters of World War II, experiencing events through the eyes of different characters in different campaigns. Over time, the series has explored modern warfare, the Cold War, and even science fiction themes.Game Mechanics:""Call of Duty"" provides a fluid and fast-paced gaming experience. The games often follow a linear progression model, allowing players to use various weapons, interact with teammates, and engage in strategic battles with enemies. Additionally, the series offers a wide range of multiplayer modes.Graphics and Atmosphere:The later games in the series have presented impressive graphics tailored to their respective time periods.

Team-based modes, deathmatch, capture the flag, and various other modes provide players with a competitive multiplayer experience. Each player can select their military class and engage in battles using their chosen abilities.Overall Evaluation:""Call of Duty"" is a FPS game series with a long history and continuous evolution. With rich stories, fast gameplay mechanics, impressive graphics, and diverse multiplayer modes, it has appealed to a wide player audience. With each new installment, it leaves a significant impact on the world of war games.. All the Call of Duty's have been exactly the same thing for the last 20 years which is repetitive, cheap, meaningless garbage. Sometimes you walk away from game and come back to it later in life and it's different but God never is and it always disappoints because they do nothing about the cheaters, or the gun balance, or update patches. The game is 200 gb so it takes up most of internal memory so it's hard to play anything else. The community is cringe and the reviews are lying. 29,000 reviews on xbox with less than 3 stars. Come on, people hate this game and everyone knows it.. I will probably describe the game briefly.A decent shooter, even for today. Missions with outdated graphics still give incredible emotions. And this game is still much better than the new COD parts.Therefore, I recommend playing this legendary masterpiece!​. I decided to get acquainted with this series of games, and the first was Call of Duty 1, a game released in 2003. At the time of writing, I'm still thinking about what rating to give the game. And I was very surprised when I saw 91 points. Perhaps people judged it based on the standards of the time, or because they have fond memories of the game. But even so, you can find a couple of disadvantages for the game. Very stupid scripts, nothing can be done with them, if at a certain moment your HP is slightly less than the situation allows, you cannot do anything. Because of this, I replayed the moments several times. There is a variety of gameplay, but it’s small, usually it’s about blowing up something, but otherwise it’s just a shooting gallery. There are a couple of atmospheric missions, with tanks, part of the plot in the USSR, the final mission. The landing of soldiers into battle, speeches. And the moment where they were forced to fight without rifles at all and stopped desertion was just wow. But I can’t say that this game suited me, maybe the theme is not the same, or something else, but this is my subjective opinion. Therefore, for me this game is 5 points, perhaps there is a lack **** character, incorrect setting of the plot, detailing of locations, and so on.. As the first version of Call of Duty, and the rival of the Medal of Honor, it appeared great and still fun after 20 years. In the online section, ok It has different servers with different modes that can be fun for hours, especially if you play with your friends.. You don't often get games, where everything is just right. The first COD is one of those games. No wonder, it became one of the most popular game series in history. Overall rating: 9.2.. The OG Call of Duty. That one was hardcore, and I still have some good memories. One of the best early 2000s FPS (and there were a lot of good FPS back in the day). Where it all began, and it plays like a completely different game. Much more of a medal of honor clone than a new take on the historical first person shooter, Activisions first attempt with call of duty falls flat amidst a sea of much better games of its own genre.. Beginning of a legend. Brings back good old memories.King of fps **** war experience it gives was immaculate. Original Call of Duty revolutionized WWII shooters with cinematic set-pieces, immersive gameplay, and stunning visuals. A genre-defining classic.. An intensely fun game, even to this day. The missions are not as varied or as memorable, but the game set the standard for all of the sequels after, by making it entertaining through its animations, audio, and addictive gameplay loop. Its intensely fun to snipe, explode, and mow down patches of enemies, and the combination of loud, powerful sounding weapons and reactive enemy wounding and killing animations make it a short but sweet experience.. The true origins of the series, before becoming a cashflow. The first Call of Duty is where it all began and what inspired a series of good sequels, along with the cashflow milking cow that it has become today. The original game shined with excellent AI, a solid story and fluent mechanics. Call of Duty revolves around the events of the second world war. Although this concept is nothing new and used many times before, it is one of the more stable, balanced and straightforward ones that was around at the time. The main difference with other WWII franchises is that you play as multiple countries that fought in the war like Russia, Great Brittan and the United States. You start as Private Martin, a paratrooper that has been sent behind enemy lines in the events of D-Day. His platoon is scattered badly and nowhere is were he should be. You mission is to disable Flak guns and artillery positions to grant the soldiers some slack that are fighting on the beaches. Then, the perspective switches over to Sergeant Evans, in the British army. After participating in Operation Tonga, you are transferred to the commando SAS unit, which is then tasked with sabotaging the Eder Dam. After that, you infiltrate the battleship Tirpitz with Sergeant Price and a small squad. You discover plans from the Germans in which they are about to launch their feared V-2 rockets. You destroy the rockets before joining your squad mates in the battles ahead. You also play as Corporal Alexei, starting at the battle for Stalingrad. Your heroic deeds get you promoted to Sergeant and after many battles with lots of lives lost, you enter Berlin and conquer the city with your fellow squad mates, ending the war. The first Call of Duty is the only game in the series that implements the health bar. Although opinions differ about what system is better, I preferred the search for health kits and keeping track of your current vitality. It is what makes an FPS interesting and challenging in my opinion. Medal of Honor is another franchise that shined in this mechanic, by finding soldier canteens. Call of Duty looked beautiful back then and, even to today, still does. Surely it aged and the graphics can be considered ancient, but the detail remains fair enough. The small blood effects and explosions are still great. The sound effects are still solid. All the sounds of guns firing and grenades that explode are still awesome. I like the Kar98 sound effects the most, it is just a solid blast when you fire your single bullet towards the enemy. What sets Call of Duty apart is its excellent AI, especially for the time. Enemies and squad mates “do their own thing” and are focused on the battles ahead. There is also a solid balance between the focus on you and the AI on each other. You can surprise an enemy from the side because he is busy fighting with another soldier and does not notice you yet. The expansion pack, United Offensive, I did not play. This was only because my PC back then, would not read the disc properly. This is something that I want to complete at least once in the future. Call of Duty will always remain a true classic and, even today, it is still played widely, although many servers are now fun and hack servers with some crazy **** going on. There are custom made maps in toy block landscapes, obstacle courses, you name it. It is a shame that the series nowadays is a business model in which the same crap is released every year and kids today do not know how great the series was back then, but before I turn into a complete grandpa again, that is all I will say about it. I definitely still recommend this true original classic.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. One of the greatest fps games ever and one of the best WW2 games. Much better than the new ones honestly even though it's 20 years old.. the best cod game after all this years , the campaign is the best of all cod games not any other game has such a fun and epic campaign that is as immersive as this , you genuinely feel as a ww2 soldier on the allied side and you see and feel and struggles of the biggest war humanity has ever taken part of , while cod 4 is a great game and made a good transition from ww2 to modern warfare i still consider it inferior to the original game , while cod 2 , cod 3 and cod 5 waw also had ww2 as their main argument i dont think any of them did it as well as the original cod 1 game 9/10. Good CoD and that's all. Game had fine singleplayer. Nowaday playing in CoD1 is just ok, better play CoD2.. i hate this f*cking game **** they are CHEATERS! they have no recoil and this is especially evident on a machine gun when they shoot at you and you can’t even look out to kill him NO he will hit you 389 million times when you look out for 1 second 2. I don’t know why but sometimes I just have any NPCs stand in a T-pose and it looks miserable and spoils the atmosphere 3. it's very difficult especially in stalengrad where these damn machine guns are placed everywhere and it's infuriating, you will die in this place 10-20 times until you super neatly pass the moment and it's very infuriating!. Revolution for its time, but difficult to play today if you want to try it out.. The origins. It's pity to look at the franchise in 2022. Probably it's better for CoD to just die, so it can't get worse with each new release. My analysis takes into account that I played this game for the first time in 2022, I wanted to start playing from the first because it's something I like to do in the series. I believe that at the time it must have been very good, but playing it nowadays was very bearable. The campaign is focused on small historical moments and the controlled character has any name that is irrelevant to the story. The gameplay is difficult, a little strange to play nowadays. As the gameplay is locked it's even easy to finish the campaign on the hardest difficulty, but it's boring. For the price it is sold, I don't recommend it even on sale.. est MP experience i have had in years. I have a feeling i will be playing this game for a veryest MP experience i have had in years. I have a feeling i will be playing this game for a veryest MP experience i have had in years. I have a feeling i will be playing this game for a veryest MP experience i have had in years.

I have a feeling i will be playing this game for a veryest MP experience i have had in years. I have a feeling i will be playing this game for a very. The game has a good story and good gameplay for the time. However, those times are long gone and this game cannot live up to modern standards. You get what you pay for and any reviews over 7 out of ten are most likely due to the individual’s nostalgia for it. This review does not take into account of nostalgia, the age of the game or the price but solely on quality.. Call of Duty is the memorable type of experience that despite its age, thrives even in comparison with newer titles.. I was playing this pearl yesterday and what a game! It is impressive that in the middle of 2003 they had already put bullet marks on the wall and high number of bodies on the floor after killing. Very good game and definitly worth buying but be warned the game is pretty difficult the health pickups are pretty rare making you go most of the game being able to get 1 shotted. So watch out but if you`re already familiar with fps games then go ahead and enjoy. Also pretty short don`t expect an amazing story but expect fantastic gameplay.. This Game Is 1 of The Most Iconic Shoter Games This Game Is A Great Game I'm Really Really Really Love This Game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Classic WW2 shooter! Didn't passed the time check, but come on... this game literally destroyed Medal of honor and create a series that possibly will outlive all of us!. the best wwii singleplayer game (albeit short), besides maybe call of duty: world at war. Call of Duty was one of the best FPS games of all time, till now. Highly recommend to play this game, one of the best old school games way back 2003 (Gameplay) If we go back at around the year of 2003, the gameplay in this game is one of the best, you can feel like you're inside of the game. (Story) The story is great and you're not just playing at a single character's story, there are others story too, that gives a different taste and gameplay of it. (Sound) This is one of the best sound/soundtrack I have ever heard way back the old days at 2003, it's just way too good, but there are times that will cut off suddenly and whenever you're at the next level, you can see your teammates and enemies fighting but there are no sounds playing. (Details) Details is good at this game way back 2003 but whenever you killed someone near at a balcony, they will just sometimes run through the balcony and just fells off, I know what are the plans of Infinity Ward here, but that's just a weird thing, anyways, way back before is just wasn't that good but still, details at this game are perfect way back 2003 === (AI) AI on this game is kinda annoying, teammates keeps on blocking you and sometimes, they threw a grenade near at you (Regular Veteran) I do not know but the regular difficulty seems goes to veteran at a certain point, whenever you peek, a sudden headshot. According to the year of construction, they have achieved a very successful atmosphere. The game reflects the feeling of war, the emotions of the soldiers and their inner voices very well. It would be nice to play through the eyes of German soldiers, all I want in the Cod series.. Even now, 18 years later, I launched this game and enjoyed it! By far one of the best shooters of the time, that want to play now!. Call of Duty was such a magical experience when i first played it. Nowadays the game's lost in the array of its sequels. The original COD games are long forgotten these days but to be honest the original COD is a classic that has aged like a fine wine, now unfortunately i couldn't finish the game because i encountered a weird bug near the end of the game however going back and experiencing the original COD game really reminded me what really established call of duty as a brand.. This is the best ever Call Of Duty game,very interesting plot,very big arsenal of weapons.There is simply no layer, this is a classic.Everyone should play this game.. I've played most of the Call of Duty campaigns at this point and I got to say after playing the first title it's perfectly okay. The visuals are alright considering this came out in 03 and the sound design on weapons' and sound effects are nice and punchy. Like most of the old CODs there's 3 different campaigns with American, British and Soviet theaters of war. Although it can be kind of jarring in this one because there's no heads up you just kinda swap in between the campaigns. If I had to pick one as my favorite it would be the Soviet campaign with it's opening crossing the river at Stalingrad to the attack on the Reichstag. It feels grand in a way even though later titles would do most of these battles way better it still does a good enough job making you feel like a solider in these battles. At least compared to the other allied campaigns that after a few missions helping the battle of D day as paratroopers will right after send you and your squad on these secret special missions which feel a lot like later Call of duty gamers. Foe example one of the US missions has a part straight out of Indiana Jones 3 with a secret fire place revealing a coms room. Which leads me to believe that COD has always been kinda stupid and that later titles simply cranked up the ridiculous factor to 11. I also find that more of the western theater levels are more frustrating although one of the soviet levels also was really annoying. But in total something like half the levels either had parts that were really annoying or frustration or the entire level was frustrating. And the gunplay is fine it's nothing really spectacular but it does the job for what it is. Overall I don't hate the game it has some really good moments I just think that most of the real good parts it has have been done much better in later titles and that it suffers from alot annoying crap in much of the game. Such as poor level design and having just way to many enemy's coming at you at points. Overall not terrible but not really exceptionable by todays standards so it's okay worth maybe a play through but I don't see my self returning to this one when I need a Call of duty fix. Also side note there's no shotguns in this game which meant there's only rifles, machine guns and side arms you'll never use. And I don't know if this meant that the multiplayer was the best ever or the worst ever in the series. I guess that's a matter of opinion on if you enjoy using shotguns in COD games more then you hate getting destroyed by them or not.. Call Of Duty marks the beginning of one of the most famous FPS series ever. And it´s probably still the best one. Graphics are great, the atmosphere is dense and the sound is epic. If you want to play a WWII game, this is the best choice. Really enjoyable, even today!. The beginning part of the legendary series... I'm glad that I played this game. Once upon a time, I couldn't stop playing this game... One of the best games in its time.... Believe it or not, this is the only Call of Duty game I haven't played yet. I went in and was immediately surprised by how well it looked, for a 2003 game my mind was blown. The game lets you play 3 major Allied Powers (US, Britain, and Soviet Russia) and you kill a whole lot of ****. The shooting holds up really well, the sound design is amazing, the music was the best part of this game (especially during the last mission). Now to talk about the negatives, The story is pretty much non-existent with immemorable characters and no cutscenes. Friendly AI is the most **** AI I've ever witnessed, they have no idea where to position themselves when the game gives them that freedom. They seriously lack aim training. I played this game on Veteran difficulty from start to finish, and let me tell you... It's hard, but not in a fun way. The game has no health packs on Veteran, so you mostly get stuck with 1 HP for the rest of the mission until you beat it and it resets. I get making it challenging, but no health packs make the experience unfun and super annoying especially when you get hit by friendly fire. The level design is amazing but it comes with shortcomings and really questionable choices, there are times where you have to infiltrate whole enemy bases and for some dumb reason you're sent alone with no backup... Are we playing as Rambo or something? On other levels you start off with friendlies that all of a sudden disappear and don't follow you so once again you have to kill over 100 soldiers by yourself, the game really takes you out of the immersion at times, which is disappointing in a World War 2 game. Oh, and there is no sprinting which makes it really awkward when the commander shouts at you to RUN RUN and you just casually walk as 10 Machine guns spray at you. Overall, it's a mixed bag, If you wanna play it, don't do it on Veteran difficulty. The game is really short, I beat it in about 5 hours with all the restarts. Lower difficulties would probably be able to beat it in 3 hours.. I haven't played it for almost 13 years but I still remember it fondly. It was my first ""military"" game :). A Cult Classic. I loved this game so much when I was younger. I must have played a thousand times. The Golden Era of WWII games.. The first Call of Duty was so good that it changed the whole genre. Amazing game.. Definately deserve good ratings. No wall running and gadgets but pure classic action. Except few missions where you feel as if the developers had forcibly included some irrelevant sequences, every mission of the game is varied and incredibly tense unlike the newer Battlefield games that tries to mimick it.. Story - 6/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics - 6/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Levels - 6/10 Replay value - 5/10. The beginning of all beginnings. Passed in childhood but decided to write now, since I created an account here.. A true masterpiece. Revolutionary and absolutely amazing. This was my first COD and this game has an amazing campaign, plus a really fun multiplayer despite there being no killstreaks.. TOP 100 Games for Low END PC (64 MB / 128 MB / 256 MB VRAM) This list includes the best low spec PC games from different genres such as FPS, Open World, Fighting, Racing and many more that you can play on your old PC & Laptop NOTE: It's a listing from 1 to 100 in no particular order. After playing the first Call of Duty I've come to appreciate even more the modern and lates COD titles. So... COD was developed by a new studio (back in that day) called Infinity Ward, formed by developers who previously worked on Medal of Honor, an extremely WWII shooter before cod. Back in 2003 COD got released on the market published by Activision and somehow it became more popular than Medal of Honor. COD 1 is way too generic!!!! even more than MOH... you got no interesting battles, no memorable characters... nothing. The level design is repetitive and so unimaginative... it just have no creative structure. The game is divided on 3 campaigns, The American, the British and the Russian... only the Russian campaign is really worth it and the best part of the whole game. Visually... it came back in 2003, but there were other games released during that time or even before that look way better than this one, it just... didn't age well, and if you really look at it... it looks really amateur. Still... this is the game that started it all, and an important peace of gaming history.. Brilliant single player and multiplayer, best FPS ever, non of the modern shooters match it.. The single play was brilliant, I loved it, but it was way too short. The multiplayer could possibly be good if there was a way to get rid of all the cheating scum.. Its great and fun and for its time kind of revolutionary. But still forgettable and sometimes repetitive.. My first (modern) FPS game of my iife and also on of my favourite games with all its problems (surprisingly short campaign, bugs etc). If you are a newbie in the FPS genre, choose this masterpiece, you won't regret it.. the beginning **** series of games .. First in the franchise but not the best. Similar to MpH:AA with few upgrades that make this game different and unique. Love the intro !!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Surprisingly, this is one of the best games in the series. She's probably only a 4-part better. Many elements in the COD2 are made worse than in the original. The game is perfectly played in 2019, after that even as that funny look at BFV. A 16 years later, the singleplane at BFV looks a lot worse... One of the best games about World War II..

The first Call of Duty game which is the only one i liked in the whole franchise, after it they kept coming back to its core mechanics. From its Technical and graphics stand point the game was impressive when i played it in 2003, the gameplay and controls were tight and cool, you will feel that you are fighting in the WW2 era. Story wise there is nothing since its your average war games where you shoot the enemy till they die and proceed to the next level. 7/10 Best one in the series.. The first presentation of Call of Duty is a very entertaining experience, focused on the action (and not like its counterpart Medal of Honor). With a campaign divided into different characters from three different countries. Simple stories, and great sequences and a basic but fun gameplay.. Just classic. Game changer for its genre. Very good gaming experience for its time.. Still a fun single player experience even by today's standards. The story feels fairly dated but that is to be expected. I would say if you can pick this up on sale for about $10 it is definitely worth the 7 hrs or so it will take you. The story is a bit dated but not cringe-worthy. Aiming and shooting still feel great.. it was the first Call of Duty i ever played. For his time, was the gratest shooter i ever palyed and the first shooter. After this game i enjoyed FPS games and i learn how to shoot in games. This game is a must play for no questions. Single player campaign made this game.. One of the best FPS video games in PC after the release of Medal of Honor Allied Assault.Good graphics for a 2003 video **** separated campaign is awesome and has various approaches not always just like shoot somebody.There are stealth elements in some missions.. It is the best in the series. Every CoD after this is c*@p for casuals. The gameplay is like a mix of Quake and Half-Life in WWII setting. The atmosphere is brilliant. I was litterally crying at the beggining of Russian campain!. You don't have to worry about any little foul mouthed kids banging your mom here! Call of Duty should really return to its roots, the game had so much potential and I looked forward to its future back when it first came out. Now it's a blight on the gaming world, mainly thanks to the sheep that follow it.. Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 8 Story : 8 Sound : 8 ********************************************************************************** Overall : 9. Man. The only Call Of Duty that works. You are in World War 2. A shooter like no other will but will put you through nostalgia. As graphics still continue to develop in the 00's, This will still blow your ming because this idea was way out of it's time.. Uh 150 words ok here we go Call of duty 1 is in my opinion when it comes to the SP the best of the series 10 to 12 hours of no cutscenes and no MB moments makes it the best and longest COD to date! Great AI on enemys and team mates,great,story,animations,graphics and bla bla bla i buyed it 2 years ago whit the expansion for 8 bucks and i dont regret it there are still some people playing it becouse it has dedecited servers yes servers somethink they should add now. A long time ago, back when Activision strived for releasing a new game every time they released a game, Call of Duty was without a doubt the best non-science fiction shooter. The gritty World War II classic was one of the first major fps' to feature a lean function in campaign, and was also one of the first to introduce the 2-weapon rule, adding to the realism. The gameplay was smooth and non-clunky, hitting an enemy model varied in damage depending on the location of the hit, and the hardest difficulty level offered players a ""fair"" battle, where an enemy could kill you very easily. Best of all, the depictions of various historical elements were **** hates this today...accurate!. This game really returns you in that time. World war. Honestly there are a lot of games with WWII but many are not good. Yes I know, were fashionable in year 2003. However, a good game.. ""Never gets old"" The first CoD game is a brilliant World War II shooter, a thrilling experience for any shooter fan. The game is intense in times and provides great variety of battlefields.

274.Mario Kart DS,"This is a game of constant fun. I love Mario Kart Wii and this game is the only other Mario Kart game to come close to recapturing that magic. It really does feel like a console game on the go with the amount of tracks, missions, and characters there are. I recommend.. game is fun and the battle mode is good too, and I like abusing the mini turbo system lol. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If I could rate this a 7.5/10 instead of an 8 I would. Game was perfect for the DS and everything you want from mario kart. Still mad to this day though that you can only play shy guy for local multiplayer.. Probably the best episode of the series. I'm probably influenced by the nostalgia I feel for this game. The single-player campaign is entertaining and breaks with the usual Mario Kart codes on handheld consoles (apart from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, I haven't played any other Mario Kart on home consoles). The music is well done, as are the character animations, so you get the impression they're alive.. Really great game, if you have a DS or even a 3DS its a must buy. The gameplay is tight, the balancing is great, and the visuals have aged well enough for the DS.. It is a very good game (if you know how to snake) the tracks are fantastic and there is many good things. Another title that I spent countless hours of my childhood playing, Mario Kart DS was a fan-favorite on the school bus. I have so many fond memories of DS Download balloon battles and races with as many people as we could get to join, and I was always delighted to play multiplayer with people who had the game so we could play the other 75% of tracks that aren't available over DS Download. In hindsight, the limitation of play over DS download made most multiplayer interactions far less exciting, but I'm sure it helped with sales. Regardless, this is another absolutely necessary title for any DS collection. The gameplay is fun and exciting, and the progression of unlocking cars and characters adds an addictive pull to the completionist in me. I do wish that it would be possible to play Balloon Battles and Shine Runners singleplayer with bots, but maybe I'll be able to find someone to play with again someday!!. This game is very nostalgic easily has the best selection of tracks and has the most content. With the best battle mode and a full on mission mode with boss fights. It was the first game in the series where you could play online. A stellar game. It's a good game, although a little overrated today. I personally enjoy it as a perfectly fine Mario Kart game, with a good roster, decent tracks, and goofy mechanics.. This isthe best game eva. Imean like whynotthisisgold. Fhdjejebebrjhdhdeiejrjrnr. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite being on a handheld this game is one of the most content packed in the series. Mission mode was great and should of become a mainstay game mode. The Retro track trend started here too, though they didn't really do the returning tracks justice for the most part.. I remember playing this as a kid. Back then you really had to play Grand Prixs to unlock new characters, new cars and new tracks, right now, you get them just by buying the game, which is kinda sad.. Drift mechanics are the best in the series, though having a lower skill ceiling than DD, MKDS really streamlined the series' accessibility through it's simple yet effective gameplay, and new online mode. Modern Mario Kart started with this title, and if the future titles are so critically acclaimed, then this one should be too.. Controls and maps are a bit off but the mission mode makes this game amazing. Mario Kart DS is an all-time classic and holds up really well to this day. It has some great new tracks and retro tracks as well. My favorite tracks include Waluigi Pinball and Rainbow Road. The mechanics in this game are awesome as well.. amazing game, one of my favourite mario karts, the missionmode, maps all mind blowing!. This is Mariokart at its finest. This is Nintendos best idea at a Mariokart game, despite it decent graphics for the DS, the gameplay is astinoshing, in this game you find some of the best maps in the whole of the Mariokart series also packed with incredible soundtracks and even after you finish the prix you can play missions which is perfect addition to the game. If you just got a DS buy this.. this game is definitely a game and is pretty good............................................................. In my opinion, Mario kart DS is the best Mario kart game. It has a lot of fun tracks, characters and karts. Also its pretty awesome that you can play this game on the go. 10/10 recommended to play. I haven't played too many Mario karts yet besides playing 64 before ds and still needing to beat double dash and 7 but even if I do still need to beat those other games I come back to DS. DS has a good amount of modes and online was probably good back then but these are reasons why its worth going back too. 1. Is that all the characters are good even though I will admit Dry bones and rob are a bit of an odd inclusion but I don't mind (probably because dry bones is the best in my opinion) and the track them self are either the best tracks in the franchise or the worse. Now hear me out figure 8 circuit and shroom ridge and etc. aren't bad by any mean but compared o other tracks in the game and in the entirely of the franchise these tracks are pretty forgettable but when they are good here good like waluigi pinball, Luigi's mansion, Delfino square, etc. and this game introduced retro tracks which have been a stable since and gives more replay value. 2. Battle mode is great though compared to double dash there are less modes and the tracks are fine but really the only one I'm going back to are block fort Tho driving on a DS isn't bad. The mode present are balloon battle and newly added shine runners which are both good on their own right and this entry is the first one being able to play by yourself with coms. 3. A reason why you should come back to this entry is because exclusive to DS is mission mode which are 6 levels all with little challenge in each level and when you finish all the challenge there a boss fight and when you beat them you go onto the next level and it's a great addition to the single player side of Mario kart and surprisingly hasn't been in ant future Mario kart games. 4. A couple little thing left like your able to make an emblem that you may see during a race but its still a nice little edition plus the game did introduce online play to the series which had only some tracks you could play (at least that's what I heard). So at the end of the day even with those couple flaws with the game ill still give it a 10 because of a pretty balanced yet wacky races it has plus some exclusives not even in modern titles and some of the most memorable/least memorable in the entire franchise so either way you should get the game already! Actually wait 9.9 they mad baby park 5 laps (but because I can't do decimals ill round it up to 10). It has not aged well with its graphics, but what do I expect, its a Nintendo DS game. The tracks are not the best but there are some good ones. The character roster is excellent. The battle mode is amazing. And they should have kept mission mode in future games because it was so good. A good mario kart game but I don't see myself playing it again.. Another incarnation of the hugely popular karting game which no doubt appeals to fans, but the simplified tracks and handling of the karting format plus the sheer ease of progress in solo mode means its multiplayer appeal doesn't really transfer over to the single player game. Reasonably good fun but short lived.. One of the highlights of the DS library and the game which defined the standards for future MK games. Great and memorable tracks, small but solid character roster, sneaking mechanics, and the only appearance of battle mode in MK's history. Despite the years it hasn't aged poorly and can still be great fun to pick up and play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing driving game that an iconic maps, iconic characters and very fun challenges. Some of the challenges include even fighting some mythic hands. My favourite map is either bowsers castle or the rainbow map due to its difficulty. Definitely was a must play for all Nintendo players.. If you need some evidence to prove if this game is one of the best on DS, I played it so much that I wore out the R trigger on my DS Lite and had to repair it. This is THE game of my childhood and probably the first video game I have ever played. I just love every single pixel in this game and still play it sometimes today.. This mario kart have really addictive gameplay! The IA can be very challenging and the courses are versatile with many shortcuts. Visually and content wise of course it us not the best game of all mario kart but handling of the vehicles and fast gameplay is really made this game special. I was surprised how much fun I actually had with this game. Must play for Mario kart fans!. Mario Kart 8 deluxe may be a great, but Mario Kart ds is the best in the series. Yes, you read that right, I think this game is better than Mario kart 8 deluxe and the overrated Mario kart Wii. (No, I don't think Wii is bad). This was the first game I ever played back when I was only 5 years old, and I still love it to this day. This game has only 1 flaw, and I'll to that later. The controls are perfect; the character roster is perfect, the graphics were decent for the ds, and the tracks are great. The Nitro tracks are very creative and have so many references o past games in the series. This was the first game in the series to properly introduce retro tracks, and for a first try, they did pretty well. Yes, they have been stripped down, but they had to so the ds could handle it. I will say though, this game ruined GCN (Game cube Nintendo system) Baby part and made one of the worst tracks in the series. They shortened it from 7 laps to 5 and made it really bland. Thankfully though, it's the only dud in this masterpiece of a kart racer. There's nothing to dislike about this game, it's a must buy. The mission mode is great, and I wonder why they still haven't brought it bad to this day and the battle mode is perfect in this game. The multi-player and single player vs mode is fantastic as well. This game came out when Nintendo actually cared about their mascot and in a time where they weren't lazy. Too bad they got worse as time went along. Overall, this game is a 10/10.. This game is so good for no reason. I’m not a huge fan of Mario Kart,(My favorite Mario spin-offs are the Paper Marios) but this game got me hooked. The last Mario Kart, Mario Kart for the GBA, wasn’t the greatest. But in 4 years, they went from trash to treasure. How? This Mario Kart had a huge graphical update, as the DS could at least try to do 3d, while the GBA couldn’t at all. The presentation isn’t the star of the show here, but it’s certainly quite good. This game is oozing with content. There are tons of single player unlockables, all found through racing. My favorite unlockable is Waluigi, but I don’t remember how to get him. You could also play as R.O.B if you tried enough. The single player modes are the greatest in the series. You can complete missions to get unlockables. They all have challenge, and while you could rage at them, they were fun. There were lots of online stuff to do, like share your best times on tracks, battle modes (My favorite) and, actual racing. I’m at a loss of words to explain why this game is so good. I think this is the best Mario Kart game. Praise Waluigi Pinball!!. A must have DS game even in 2022, if you are a DS connoisseur then this is the game for you. This is the first Mario Kart game with tracks from all the past games, but the tracks they picked were terrible, the new tracks are amazing especially the new karts! People today say this game hasn't aged well but mods like Ermii Kart DS and CTGP-Nitro make this game alive again!. pretty good review: its mariokart nothing else has to be said except for the fact i have to stretch this out so i can upload this review.. While the visuals of this title do not hold up very well these days, this is peak Mario Kart, the best mechanics, pioneer in legacy tracks, and the beloved mission mode which is still exclusive to this game. If you can look past the blocky and pixelated textures, there is a ton to enjoy here.. Great game with some incredibly hard and satisfying mechanics would reccomend. The best Mario Kart game, and quite possibly the best DS game of all time. Great tracks Has f*cking R.O.B. the robot Extremely boppin' soundtrack and crazy nostalgic. The best Mario Kart besides Mk8 Deluxe. So much content and revolutionary ideas!. Mario Kart DS is easily the best Mario Kart game along with Mario Kart Wii, with a great balance of new tracks, retro tracks, battle arenas, character roster, and unique to DS mission mode. It has an excellent soundtrack too, and still holds up well today.. I used to feel that this game hadn’t aged very well, until I properly played through it again. There are some excellent tracks featured including Tick Tock Clock, Delfino Square, Luigi’s Mansion, Airship Fortress and the best of them all, Waluigi Pinball! This was the first Mario Kart to introduce retro tracks (not including Super Circuit) and while I wasn’t a fan of a lot of the choices and a few of them (the GCN ones) were downgrades, it was a huge step forward for the franchise. The character roster is a downgrade from the previous entry due to it being a handheld, but there were a couple unique additions being Dry Bones and the bizzare choice of R.O.B. The core gameplay is fun and it controls well. While some people hate snaking, you gotta admit it’s awesome to be able to control your drift! My favourite thing about this game is the missions with so many different tasks like collecting coins, driving through tires and boss fights! I hope this mode comes back one day. The graphics are a bit pixelated but the game looked good for the DS at the time. There are some memorable tunes from this game especially one in particular (Waluigi Pinball). It was the first game to introduce online even though the Wii’s was the first to gain popularity. There is a cool extra feature where you can customize your emblem on your car which is unique to this game. The new items are a mixed bag, with the blooper which is completely useless and I have no idea why they kept it around, and the bullet bill which was epic and the best item of all time! The battle mode is great and you can finally play it in single player mode against computers! There are some fun new stages and a couple of retro ones including Pipe Plaza. This might be one of the better Mario Kart games in the series, and it’s jam packed with fun!. extremely fun game, its my first and currently only mario kart game. pulling off a mini turbo always feels satisfying. it has amazing tracks but also some bland ones that i can excuse. i felt as if there wasn't enough variety in the missions which just seems like wasted potential to me. there's WAY too much blue shells up your ass at all time i like the idea of a blue shell but sometimes I'm at the end of the match and i get blueshelled causing me to come 3rd or something. racing on rainbow road was very annoying cause it's a very pretty and iconic track but every time i bump into anyone i get sent flying behind into the void. tick tock clock makes me cream everytime i play on it. Overall love love love!. One of my favorite games. 150ccm is exactly the fitting difficulty for me. The items mix a little bit of unpredictability in the game, but it still seems fair. They are not entirely random, but based on your position and item stats. Sometimes it feels more like a shooter or fighting game when there are intense item battles. Please don't hate me for this, but I don't even hate the blue shell. Of course it is frustrating for players who are excellent at racing and always get the top spot right away. However, if it is a suspenseful, balanced race, where you have to struggle to get to the first position, it can actually help you just as much. The minimap on the DS is absolutely brilliant, one thing that Mario Kart 8 is missing. Also, the drifting feels very satisfying, better than in the sequels. You have to give your D-pad a little jerk to spark the boost, it actually feels like lighting a match or a lighter. The stages also strike the perfect balance between detailed and simple. A lot of the sequels have tracks that feel more like labyrinths, or have you racing upside down or other weird stuff. I enjoyed the linear design of this game far more, the few secret short cuts actually feel special because there's not five of them in every track. The crown jewel of the game is obviously the balloon mode. Fighting with the items is actually more fun than racing. Of course the graphics are very old and crappy, but the courses still look good enough, and the characters drive by so fast that you won't even pay much attention to their appearance. The gameplay is just so fast and so much fun that is doesn't matter.. This game first introduced the drift controls that we have now, and it is good. There's new items like Blooper and Bullet Bill. However, I have to applaud Mario Kart DS for its numbers of content. It remade lots of old tracks, from GC to SNES. The game is birth to Waluigi Pinball, Delfino Square, and Wario Stadium. It has a good range of characters, and the kart selection is decent. The Bosses and Challenges are fun, and for me I think this is the most interesting Mario Kart game.. Mario kart ds can be played anywhere and the game is also very good, the tracklist is all good, unique, beautiful soundtrack, the best nds game for me. Lots of childhood memories here. I may not be as head over heels for it as most people are, but I will admit I still really like this game.. Easily in the top 3 Mario Karts. This is so much fun, especially with friends! The only big minus point are the controls.. Best racing game on Nintendo DS what i played,Not boring gameplay,many maps from past parts,many characters and karts,Mario Kart is the best racing game on every Nintendo console.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i would give this a 28% the graphics were terrible the previous Mario kart game had great graphic and then they give use this with horrible graphic the story is plain. The challenge mode is boring just a boring game in general. The first portable Mario Kart in true 3D. Mario Kart's formula has proven to be an incredibly fun multiplayer experience. Mario Kart DS is that except its portable, in true 3D, and has wireless multiplayer. Carrying around that experience was refreshing back then. Even just playing the Grand Prix single player was awesome fun. If not then there are missions and time trials. The missions were really simple though, nothing deep. The turbo drift mechanic was done great. Inputs for it felt natural and just difficult enough that it felt satisfying to pull off. The AI and item usage programming was done well. Rarely did I feel completely left behind as 8th, as I still had a chance to catch up with good items. And I couldn't feel completely safe in 1st, as I might get hit by an item. The map on the bottom screen was well made. Was simple enough, and icons were big enough for me to glance at and locate opponent positions. SNES wasn't done well, because of the map angle, and the unnecessary large kart icons. The controls however, had issues. Holding L to keep a shell behind me was difficult, because the DS itself doesn't feel good to hold when pressing too many buttons. When drifting, holding a shell, and accelerating, I'm crunching my hands holding 3 buttons at the same time. My hands would cramp up quickly. I just end up not holding shells behind me, which was unfortunate, because I missed out on an important defensive mechanic. There were times when I could've protected myself with a shell, but couldn't because it was too painful to hold L. Though this was a hardware limitation. There wasn't any remapping I could think of that the devs could have set to fix the issue. This game most definitely caused many detentions for students playing it during class under their desk... In my oppinion the best Mario Kart game of all time, it doesn't have too much powerups and extra's and it has enough gamemodes and powerups to keep the customer satisfied. This is as perfect as a Mario Kart game can get.. Mario Kart DS is the absolute best of all Mario Kart games. The controls are tight, and the tracks are fantastic. And the Mission mode really defines this game as something better than any Mario Kart out there. I'll probably never change my mind on my opinion that DS truly is the best.. Definitely not the best Mario Kart but I can't remember any other game on the DS that I had this much fun with.. Very fun game, I love every single map! The only issue I have with the game is that it is too easy and the character selection is very limited. But other than that it is a fantastic game!. The Best Mario kart game ever to come out of Nintendo minds. Even on a limited system, it is still stellar. Only about £15/€15/$15 in a second hand game store.. It is an incredibly fun mario kart game to play with your friends, it has many characters, and many amazing traks.. The best Mario game. Not the best Mario Kart game, the best game out of every game to feature Mario. This game has a vibe that will probably never be replicated, Nintendo has tried making new Mario Kart's but they honestly **** in comparison. There will never be another game like Mario Kart DS, you need to play it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It didn't do much new. But it didn't do anything bad. It is the perfekt mario kart gameplay. A usual mario kart game. It's most fun if ypu play with the other people. Recommended for casual racing game fans.. This is THE title to play if you want a portable Mario Kart. Memorable courses and very fun battle modes give this game high praise, but the extra modes defined it. Mission Mode was one of the most unique concepts to bring into a Mario Kart, and they since haven’t brought it truly back. That, and the emblem maker, set this game apart from the rest. A solid 8.16/10 puts it at the third best title in the Mario Kart series.. This game is the epitome of overrated. This is the first Mario Kart I have ever owned and it will also be my last. I hope you like replaying levels over and over, because they make sure you have to by explaining literally NOTHING about the gameplay. You’ll also really need to like figuring things out as you go because that’s literally the only way to win anything. I personally feel like it’s just a way to make a hollow game seem deep. This game is made for people who hate any sort of progression, story, or semblance of an actual, cohesive goal other than mindlessly racing. I guess it’s for the same people who like battle royale games and Minecraft. It’s not for me, though.. 10 - Outstanding Mario Kart, has a large variety of modes with really good replay value and one of the best battle modes. Online was decent for the time, and new characters and stages were well done. VS mode was also very re-playable and fun. Epic game.. Until the release of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U/Switch this DS iteration of remained my favourite in the long running series. The track design and gameplay are excellent as always but, for me at least, Mario Kart DS struck the best balance between luck and rewarding skilful driving. My friends and I lost many hours to this game for a very good reason!. Mario Kart DS was easily one of my favorite games to play on the DS. It's ""online"" capability was truly impressive at the time and I had so much fun. Not exactly my favorite Mario Kart game, but easily one of the ones that I had a lot of fun playing. I miss my DS though.. My most played mario kart game to date and still a fantastic game. A solid entry in the series.. The best Mario kart with great courses, characters, versus mode, battle mode and a mission mode. Great game. Arguably one of the best Mario Kart games in the series. Plenty of content and local multiplayer was amazing when it first released. The online doesn't work now but when it was online, it worked well and was very entertaining.. Gameplay: 9/10, Graphics: 7/10, Replayability: 8/10. One of the first video game that i've ever played and enjoyed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I just wanted to give this game a better score. It is 100% a 9/10. djsadjasdnajk. My favourite Mario Kart game. Sure, it is very easy when playing against the cpu's. Sure, some of the tracks feel very empty. Sure, especially in 2019 the graphics barely hold up. And sure, there are now newer mario karts to play. But honestly, i think this is one of the best, most progressive Mario Karts in the series. Mission mode, first inclusion of the bullet bill, great tracks such as waluigi's pinball and tick tock clock, and the first in the series to be able to connect online to race. I wish maybe the game felt a bit faster like my second favourite mario kart, Mario kart double dash, but it is my favourite mario kart and i love it to pieces.. One Of The DS’s Best Mario Kart DS is a blast pretty much from start to finish.. The most competitive Mario Kart game of all time, showing how far the series had been improved upon by the time the DS was released, and how serious they were when they made it. If you couldn't snake, you couldn't win.. Music: 3/5 Game Play: 4.5/5 Graphics: 4/5 Story: ???/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall:4/5. When the DS came out, I thought that it was going to be a worse GBA and I was sort of right and then they released the ds light and a system that can play GBA games on a lighter screen with a simple design. I like most bought it and loved it. I had a few games on their some really god and some I regret buying. But then it came out my favourite DS game of all time and for good reason. This is Mario Kart DS. This was a game that took Mario kart made it hand held and out did a lot of the Mario kart games. Need I say more.. I loved to play it so much, nothing so say about, it's just incredible. One of the best Mario Kart games.. This game is fun, and with multiplayer, it is chaos, but at the end of the day, it is good, simple and polished Mario Kart fun.. Out of all the handheld Mario Kart games: Mario Kart Super Circuit, Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart 7, etc., Mario Kart DS has to be the best. No other Mario Kart lets you customize your own emblem, do they?. Nintendo's Mario Kart series is quite literally what started the character-racing genre back in 1992, and even after countless clones and copycats from other designers and publishers throughout the past 13 years the spotlight's always on the company to move the genre forward. There are high expectations from gamers whenever Nintendo announces a new game in the series, and that's exactly what's happening with Mario Kart DS. Nintendo's pulled out all the stops for this ""next generation"" Mario Kart sequel, and though it's a handheld game, there's nothing small about this design. There's absolutely not a doubt in my mind: Mario Kart DS is the greatest Mario Kart game ever, which, in turn, makes it the greatest Kart racer game ever created. Mario Kart DS's production value is almost staggering. The development team worked an unbelievable amount of focus in nearly every aspect of this racing design, pushing a huge amount of effort in both the single player experience as well as the multiplayer competition. The gameplay depth is absolutely stunning -- Mario Kart DS is incredibly deep in features, so don't be surprised if you forget about some options because some other mode grabbed you by the crotch and refuses to let go. And that's a good thing. The DS game admittedly has a lot to live up to, what with the game following only two years after the GameCube game that many people (myself included) believed that went too far away from the original game's feel. But this portable game brings the series back to the basics of what made the original Super Mario Kart so awesome, with the development team balancing and tweaking the gameplay so intricately that it's near impossible to find any hard fault with the design. If you've missed any of the Mario Kart games in the series' past, shame on you. The series has never been about realistic racing, but that's its charm -- players still have to employ some proper racing skill and strategy, but the power-up element can throw off even the best driver. These power-ups are the gameplay's ""equalizer;"" there's nothing more humbling than taking a turtle shell up the tailpipe, or being knocked down to second from a well-positioned banana peel. Many companies have tried to best the classic Mario Kart design with their own take, but none have had the gameplay succeed as well as Nintendo. Mario Kart DS is, at its core, the ""best of the Mario Kart best."" Nintendo's designers clearly took a good, long, hard look at what made each game in the series the classic Kart design the franchise has been known for. It's not just in the course designs, either; granted, half of the tracks in Mario Kart DS are ""reprints"" from the past Mario Kart games on the Super NES, N64, Game Boy Advance, and GameCube, but that's only half the nostalgia. The kart mechanics, handling, and techniques are a mishmash of elements from all games in the series, from the kart hopping of the SNES original to the powersliding and boosting from the GameCube sequel. As a result of this focus, the racing design of Mario Kart DS is remarkably tight and responsive with tons of strategy that are both apparent and hidden, and even with weeks out on the courses you still may find one or two techniques that'll take a few ticks off the clock. After experiencing Mario Kart DS, it's hard to imagine how Nintendo's going to improve on what they've done for this stunning portable rendition. There's so much gameplay and depth in this design, moreso than the series has ever had in the past. It's an amazingly addictive racer both in single and multiplayer modes, and even with the limitations of the online functions, it's impossible to avoid becoming addicted to the long distance Mario Kart match-ups. The only way to finish this review is just to say it: this is the greatest Mario Kart game ever developed, and is without a doubt the best DS game of 2005. This Is My childhood and best Mario kart game ever!. Mario Kart DS is easily the best Mario Kart in existence. It has the best Mario Kart tracks, such as Airship Fortress, Tick Tock Clock, Delfino Square, Luigi's Mansion, and many others, it introduced retro tracks from the prior Mario Karts with some new additions, the second screen having the best map system makes this the most fair Mario Kart ever, the racing is so fast paced that getting hit by a Blue Shell barely slows you down, it has an amazing Battle Mode, and the best part: Mission Mode. This mode has you complete certain tasks and there are plenty of unique ones, like driving through gates, driving backwards, driving through gates backwards, and freaking boss fights! And I don't just mean rival races, I mean actual boss fights! All of this adds up to the most fresh experience you'll ever have in Mario Kart.. This is THE Mario Kart of our loved NIntendo DS. The game who introduced online to Nintendo fans, and one of the games that almost everyone had on their game library. As well this is the first Nintendo game I ever played, in 2007, on a lite Nintendo DS. I just played it for some days as my console broke, but 1 year later I finally saw 100% all what Mario Kart DS is capable of. Also enjoyed that ""story mode"" with the 6 bosses and the funny Battle Mod","the single-player campaign is entertaining and breaks with the usual codes on handheld consoles . the music is well done, as are the character animations so you get the impression they're alive . if you have a DS or even a 3DS its a must buy ."
275.Assassin's Creed II,"Story is okay. Other than that nothing to complain about. Graphics is okay considering the time that it was released. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game compared to the first is just perfect improved in literally everyway its a must play for every person. Loved this game so much. Best childhood game and even replaying it for platinum was fun. Minus the feathers, hate that. Amazing game, beautiful soundtrack, story, and design. This is how an Assassins Creed game should be, not like the newest ones. Sadly this game has a very bad combat and a really bad AI.. Assassin's Creed 2 brings Italy to life! With improvements in everywhere from the original.. It's ok. It's good at the start but gets kind of boring towards the end. Story is kind of bs. Although it is a different experience, Odyssey is the best Assassin's Creed I've played.. The experience is unique, and shows an incredible attention to detail. This is the game that you don’t know what you will do because everything is fun the gameplay , story , and even side quests, the game is well worth your time and money. Best game of the entire franchise. Location, characters, story everything in it's peak. Delivers on the promise of the original. Ezio's climb from haughty novice to master assassin is brilliantly told. The gameplay is much improved. The present-day segments are much more rewarding. Sets the bar for many years to come and arguably is still the best of the series.. Incredible game. This is where I started the series, and I reccomend anyone else to start here as well. Perfect story, loveable characters, fun gameplay. The only flaw it has are the relatively boring side missions. But other than that, it was fantastic.. The game was good, safe fun that set the stage for all future Ubisoft titles... even though that is a bad thing with 7000 collectables that are fundamentally meaningless in an open world that you spend most of the time just chasing down the next plot point. Looking at you Watch_Dogs. This game was pretty balanced in the collectable department, with about 400 to nab over a 30 hour play through that have markers. I didn't bother with the feathers or the glyphs. The gameplay was pretty well refined ""New age runner game"". There were a few frustrating spots where the contextual cameras threw off my groove or you didn't lock to a grip spot that seemed to work every other time, but overall, it was pretty well done. The story feels like a background thought for the large part of the game, with the gameplay being king. The characters are pretty likable and unique, but none of them really stick around long enough to be very interesting. The platforming is god, safe, fun, not doing anything too special, but it generally did feel pretty good to play. The combat was fairly basic, but did give you a nice ""Power trip"" feeling, like you were playing as the hero, so, nicely done. The voice acting and was pretty good, and the animations were fairly well done for the time. Graphically, it was about as good as you could get with as large of a world as they were rendering based on the power of the consoles at the time. I overall enjoyed my time with this game. Except for the ending. That was real stupid.. 9/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Game Mechanics: 8/10 Great game, the mechanics could've been better. Its was annoying climbing sometimes. I played on PC. This was better then the first game, but definitely still aggravating. The story was cool, however I was a little more interested with what was happening with Desmond. The parkour aspect was improved, but would still force you into jumps which could be very disruptive, especially when you needed it to work most. Due to this every time-based mission where you either had to race somewhere or chase a target, was annoying. I enjoyed the business aspect more then I thought I would and it gave me an incentive to grind and collect, and that grind effecting the passive income was nice too. Overall, this was cool and a very good sequel, however the controls were my biggest issue and how responsive everything was. Aside from that I really enjoyed the game and it's story and look forward to playing Brotherhood.. I platinumed it and this is a fantastic game i love this game so much. And i m italian. Damn this game feels so good to play, both the combat and the parkour are so smooth and Ezio has such a wide range of abilities. This game's voice lines are very memorable and the story is meaningful, unlike some nonsense you get in games nowadays (looking at you Rise of the Tomb Raider) One small issue that's to do with Xbox about how it just wiped my save every time I quit the game when logged out, and it randomly logged me out on Xbox 360 without logging me out on normal Xbox, but it was worth it to play the story up to Tuscany four times and up to Venice twice.. The Ezio games never get old, the best trilogy in any video game franchise ever, LOVE THIS GAME.. I only played a few hours this game, so this is why I gave this an eighth but those few hours were amazing. Assassin's Creed 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've had the opportunity to play. The intricate storyline and the main character's development made every moment of gameplay incredibly enjoyable for me. Additionally, the accompanying incredible soundtrack set the perfect mood and provided an amazing atmosphere for the missions and puzzles. The graphics, considering the time of release, hold up quite well. I particularly appreciated the color palette, which varies in each city, adding diversity and, similar to the soundtrack, creating a unique atmosphere. The game offers a wide range of missions, side tasks, crypts, collectibles, economy elements, parkour, and, above all, a vast open world with multiple locations. This makes it a title that can be completed 100% without getting bored. The only aspect that didn't entirely appeal to me was the combat system. Despite being satisfying and featuring cool assassination animations, I preferred to avoid direct confrontations as they were simply too easy. I found the action of staying hidden and executing quick assassinations with the hidden blade and smoke bombs much more enjoyable. Despite its age, Assassin's Creed 2 is worth playing as it still provides a lot of fun due to elements that simply don't age.. One of the best games ever.Unforgettable,iconic end it has a very good ending. Probably the best of the saga, the history is perfect and well-written, and it immerses you in Ezio's character. The gameplay is very good with a lot of animations and moves. You can choose weapons from a big list and you can customize and upgrade your armor. Well done for a game of 2009. Still serving as a sketch for future better games, as much as in terms of gameplay and lore as it is as history, this gnostic propaganda urge with rage against every conceivable established notion of christian hierarchy, order, morals and codes, and invites the player enter in the most contratitory methods to achieve freedom allying with lumpenproletarian figures like prostitutes, thieves and mercenaries to take down templars, priests, mongs and the Pope. If it didn't end making its point abundantly clear with its targets and agressive explanation of reality and genesis of humans, it could serve as a simplistic piece of fiction, despite still being cynical. However, the way it presents, it's just propaganda, and a bad one. The dialogue, terribly written; the history unfolds a quite linear path merging with the gameplay evolution, as secrets of the lore are discovered at the same time the protagonist uses them to enhance his skills and weapons. The drama is underperfomed by the characters facial expressions and the twists are quite uneven for general arcs; it didn't help the fact that the direction of Sylvain Bernard opts for the most uninteresting angles and framework, making the decoupage of cutscenes look extremely poor. What saves the product of being unbearable is the visual splendor of the textures of the faithful architecture, buildings, churches, water, clothes and green fields. The same level of details cannot be said to have been applied to combat and the precision of parkour - although pretty functional -, none of them explored as in-depth as Batman Arkham Asylum was - released at the same year. Being better playable, with more variety of main missions, and bigger than the atrocious first game is not a grand merit, but having an infantile conception of the world and not being executed with compromise with deep action gameplay or stealth gameplay, trying to please two consagrated styles, is one hell of a ""good to look at, average to play"" demerit.. Theres so many good things about this game that have been said countless times already. What a game. From the story, to the cast, the MUSIC, the performances, the locations. Just beautiful. Marred only by that all time bad ending. To this day I don't know what they were thinking with making the famed assassin Ezio Auditore, who continued his ""career"" long after the events of this game, spare Rodrigo at the end (more sequels more money, probably).. played.. Refined mechanics and a gripping story led this series from an uncertain beginning to the massive franchise it has become today. The characters are inspired and the tie-ins to famous historical figures are something I was happily surprised to see.. Gameplay - 8 Plot & Characters - 7 Storytelling - 7 Pacing - 6 Music & Sound - 7 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. This game is my childhood. I remember when I entered it for the first time and started playing this excellent game. Many years after the first passage of this game, I remembered these beautiful moments. These soundtracks are made by great musicians. This visual style is conceived by an amazing artist. This story is written by good writers. And the atmosphere made by the wonderful developers of this game. I feel sorry for the series. Which have been rolled to the bottom. I love this game. And it will always be a pleasant childhood memory.. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. Overall excellent game. Stealth gameplay is the star. A simple but diverse stealth toolkit combined with intricately designed levels and a beautiful, unique setting leads to one of the best and most expansive stealth games ever made. You can see why it set the formula for years to come.. This game is really good. A far cry better than the first game. In-fact I want to give it a 9 or a 10 but a few things keep me from that. But let's start with positives. - Ezio is an amazing character and this game gives him such a good backstory. - the historical story line is really fun and interesting - Venice as a setting and open world is to die for. - the movement is far better here than in the first game. - the remaster has really good graphics. - the combat is greatly improved. - really great mission design and set pieces in this game. Here are the negatives that kept me from scoring it higher. - the movement though better still can be janky and have mission ruining consequences. Really frustrating in key moments. - the enemy AI will go from really dumb to game breakingly hard. - the modern narrative just is not interesting to me. - the remastered version adds in sequence 12-13 which were originally cut content, but were added in as DLC later, and are included as part of the base game in the collected remastered version of the game. These two sequences break the pacing of the narrative, are a slog, are confusing, and feel irrelevant. The missions in it are long and frustrating (a nine person assassination mission across an entire map, I kid you not). These additional sequences put the game's momentum to a halt. Ubisoft, next time just leave cut content cut.. An improvement on the first game in every possible way, and a high that none of the games after this one meet. Truly the best in the series.. ""Assassin's Creed II"" is a huge improvement over its predecessor. Featuring a great story, likeable protagonist and good mission variety, it represents a course correction. This is what the first AC should've been all along. The open-world is amazing and the gameplay is fantastic. I would easily compare it to ""Grand Theft Auto III"". Players that become bored with the first installment will love this one. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. Great set pieces, a very good story, incredibly good parkour but, horrible climing and the goddamn tombs. However the game was so good it got me to start studying Italian. Exploring the world and performing assassinations is fun and feels like a lived-in experience. Shame the world is rather lacking in engaging activities.. Masterpiece , but my first game in assassin's saga it's Assassins Creed 3. >. Ezio Auditore Da Firenze is such a cool character, I wish Italian people were real.. The first thing that comes to anyone who plays this if they played followed the series from the first through to present day assassin's is wtf happened to the graphics good god I purchased this and was like wtf happened to the look of the characters it looks very horrible in assassin's 2 very horrible. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the greatest games ever made, amongst the elite echelons of culture-defining art works. When the first sequence of missions ends and the title screen rolls, I immediately knew and felt that this game was something special. The game was never repetitive and continuously improvised, improved, and inspired with the interplay of historical fact, mission diversity, and plot development. It's a game that instills a strong set of values, elevated the scene of graphics and scale in a mixed open-world and linear game. Everything about this game is liable to excite, entertain, and impress. A delightful experience. Assassin's Creed 2, with one of the greatest characters in video game history, with a coherent and powerful moral story, and with a sense of fluidity rivaled only by other great games like Ocarina of Time and others, is a master piece and easily one of the top five greatest video games of all time.. This is the best Assassin's creed so far , might always be. I still remember playing it years ago, and did it again via the Ezio Collection. This game is a masterpiece, if you didnt played yet, you should. This is a classic. Positive things ; + The best soundtracks in video game industry + Great story + The characters are well built Up + The map is insane to explore Negative things ; - Nothing. Best ac game in existance, a massive evolution of rom assassin's creed 1 and one of my favorite games, just wanted to make something good for the time i spent playing as ezio -Requescat in pace AC Franchise, we will always remember you for these konds of games, not oddessey or origins made just get their wallets full. another good game, plot, mechanics, climbing buildings, well-known characters and on top of that stories related to them, well-written protagonist that we can get to know well, what more to want. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfectly balanced with a unic story mode which don't make the player feel is a costant and boring game because of the variation of scenes and characters and plot twists.. ASSASSIN'S CREED II is imperfect .personally I do not enjoy parkour .this game in 2009 was unique and amazing .but as time pass history became history .the battle system was not good enough /it feels like phase not smooth . the building was very beautiful ,much more valuable than those female characters .somehow I want to enjoy watching ladies on the street . but their face changed ,this frightened me ,bad one .. I really wanted to enjoy this game, I loved it as a child and now that I'm trying to playa adult well it's just say that it felt like I was playing it tutorial for 4 hours and I think the painting in start of the game is awful I mean I like what it's sitting up but it's just so slow. I would say the game kind of legs Focus in the start of the game it just feels like too much padding. Am I was falling asleep maybe i just i play too many open World games on now this is just not special anymore it's always have a nice body my heart but I will not play agains. The game that started my love for the franchise. Have replayed it a few times. A classic.. Assassin's Creed 2 is a great game with really good story and beautiful soundtrack. It is a masterpiece.. This game is something else man, it's an experience that I'll never forget. It's just special and I wish my memory would be erased so I can experience this again, I truly recommend it! :D. Great game and a great assassin, but the game aged poorly. It's got some glitches and bugs that make it very frustrating.. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 10 Story: 10 Total: 9.67. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. the best assassin. no more words. I ain't critic for throught a lot of good words and reasons to buy this game. I just give you an advice. If you like a good story, parkour yamakasi style and the best ubisoft gameplay ever. You need that game. 10 for me.. Probably THE best Assassin's Creed game and the trilogy about Ezio Auditore.. This is one of the best AC games I have ever played the story was just amazing this is such an upgrade from the first game I miss when Ubisoft made great games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The AC game that really brought a lot of fans to the series. Better mechanics and the beginning of a unforgettable trilogy.. In general, I really, really liked this game. Great story tiling, the same characters, the new mechanics are good, and the old mechanics from the first part also migrated well into the second part of the game. For the open world, I also put a plus. Making a lot of cities and not a bad transition location - This is a work that deserves praise. But the family has its black sheep. I often saw bugs in the game. One of the bugs caused one NPC to be skinless. From that NPC there were only hair, eyes, teeth with a mouth and clothes. But that's not the point. The main bug is Deleting the save date. This happened three times in completing the game, although I did not download the pirated version. That's why I didn't put 10, but 9 is also very good, isn't it?. This is the best AC game I'd ever played, I can't say anything but fantastic.. The greatest game of the generation. This game can not be toped in any media.. The only negative aspect of the game is combat. It has aged extremely bad in my opinion.. I loved the perfect design, the brilliant rendition of the historical epoch and the beauty of Italian cities. I had been to Florence and Venice myself, and I had a déjà vu when walking in some places in game. The often tedious gameplay is well offset by a great plot and art. Anyone should play this before proceeding to the latest games of the series.. Actially i can't understand why big number of people say the game is great. combat system not soo cool (capture of the enemy or disarmament that is the question). parkour is **** a small pit (very small) appears on your way, the hero cannot just go through it, he will stand and wait for the order to **** it is very difficult to show the direction of the hero's jump on the gamepad and parkour animation limps. And STEALTH ubisoft added stealth missions in game without stealth (stealth is the worst in all games). so... i hate this game and I do not advise playing it.. This game rescues the essence of your predecessor, improving the system of battle that was a poor point of AC and giving us the great Ezio, that really embraces the serie. A weaky side is the same error that was in the game of Altaïr: side quests that increases nothing to the plot and were too boring.. The beginning of the Ezio trilogy, and how brilliant it was. The gameplay and graphics improved, the story became much much better, one of the best AC games ever. An enormous improvement from Assassin's Creed I in terms of gameplay, and a great sequel as a story. Pros: - You cannot randomly jump from building to building randomly without thinking, because one wrong jump from rooftop to ground will deplete Ezio's life a great deal. This is an improvement from AC1, where you could jump around mindlessly. - There is more humor in the dialog, and also the English is easier to understand compared to AC1 because this is 200 years later. - The game contains interesting characters, and also nicely develops Ezio as a character from the beginning of the game. The game gives you as the player an urge to defeat the Templars and those responsible for Ezio father's death with emotional cut-scenes and dialogs. - There is a large improvement in graphics from AC1. - The kingdom is a lot more open compared to AC1. - ""The Truth"" gives the game a very deep mystery. It is a great way of motivating gamers to complete the game(s) in order to know more about the plot. - Supporting characters throughout the game are very interesting and humorous. They all possess unique personalities. - The incentive and story behind each mission is more exciting and less boring than AC1. - The story. Cons: - At times when the game needs you to get through obstacles fast either chasing after someone or doing a time trial, Ezio does not jump exactly where you want him. The place you want to jump to needs to be positioned precisely. - You cannot make Ezio do a small/medium jump off a platform. It is either drop straight down or jump as far as he can.. the Ezio era begins. it fixed all the **** that the first one had bugs, combat, story (in some elements) this italian assassin takes **** to another level. you meet da vinci who gives you the first flying machine...thats dope as hell. you a fan of the series? get this game, its dirt cheap now days.. Very good game, has beautiful story and have god syde mission and item's and item menu but has terible climbing mechanick. I can tell that to for horse you uside once and you can even enter a city. Have okey graphic.. Such a step up after AC1! Pros: * Ezio has an origin story. And likeable personality. Bene! It makes the game so much more congruent. * Most of the Ezio's friends are great too. It's a Mario! Leonardo. Machiavelli. Bene! * Florence is beautiful. After the game I was able to recognize the sights during my real trip to Italy. * The cities are designed better to run around and climb stuff. * The onboarding of the first two hours is so smooth and well done. Maybe this game w/o an open world would be even a better game. * The ending breaking the fourth wall in a sense is mesmerising. First time I saw this trick in videogames. * In general, now this game has great side missions. Especially the one with climbing inside the churches. Delicious. * The view point has much more diversity now. They get repetitive midway. But first 10 are a blast. * The Carnaval! Cons: * The targets and the assassinations themselves are meh. This game kinda has the Marvel movies problem. All the effort went to good guys. * The controls and camera are not tight enough. Even after 20+ hours the race missions feel forced and annoying. Same goes for complex jumps during puzzles. And Venice suffers because of that the most. It's just not fun to run around. * Some side missions feel undercooked and bugged. Especially, the ship ones. Both the templar shipyard platforming one and the merchant stealth-kill-on-a-ship one were awful. With NPCs freezing. And controls making me fail and start over again and again and again. * Achievement to collect 100 feathers w/o in-game hints. Ubisoft, it's not as bad as 400 flags from AC1, but it's still very-very bad. * Why do they need to hide HUD when you enable eagle vision? * I played the game on Series X as part of Ezio collection and 4K and time are not kins to this game. You can clearly see how NPCs popup in thin air and the low-res textures on the buildings further away. To some extent this rough edges are even more visible than in AC1 sue to overall better colors and contrast in the game.. I absolutely love this game it improves upon every aspect that the previous assassins creed had implemented in almost every except for the graphics in my opinion. The story can be a little hit or miss but it completely made up for it in gameplay and in the main character who is by far the best main character in all of the assassins creed series, hence why they made 3 games about him. Has my favorite parkour in all of the series for the great city layouts and that it made you feel more in control of the mechanic than later installments i.e. assassins creed 3 and later. Possibly my favorite assassins creed!. TL;DR spoiler-free Review. Absolutely amazing story, Healthy amount of side quests. Overall: 87. The best of the saga by far, an amazing expierience with incredibly well done characters, there is a lot to do in this long and satisfying campaign, if you didnt play it, try it, you will not regret it.. Still my favorite AC to date. One of the best stories in gaming. Ezio's growth as an assassin also translates over to his growth as a person and you see it as the story progesses. Gameplay is outdated but at release it was leaps ahead of the original. Even now in 2020 I highly recommend this game.. With all its ups and downs the assassin's creed series is a must-play. All games are enjoyable even though generic some times. A great inspiration for a history lover.. ___________ This is the best ASSASSIN'S CREED's game. _____________________. Beautiful cities with the deep going characters. Following Ezio's step to find the story about his family and Templar, the best game I've played.. An huge improvement from the first game, likeable characters and good story, my favourite AC game. The player feels that he is in Italy. Great visuals for the time, a must play. A charismatic protagonist. A bromance. Manipulative enemies. A powerful family. Revenge. All of this is what made Assassin's Creed II the great game it still is today.. Technically impressive with stunning presentation, but the boring combat, cheesy story and rigid stealth hold it back. The best Assassin's Creed game ever. A personal story with the best protagonist in the series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the one that got them their franchise they really struck gold on this one. the story is what holds it to this day.. A masterpiece of how to do the things in a correct way. The story of Ezio Auditore is so good and the gameplay amazing, that feeling of being an assassin, woww.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: AWESOME. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: AWESOME.. Best game of all AC Games even in 2020. The main character is likeable and relateable. The story makes fun and kept me interesting from beginning to end. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. That game is very successfully for telling story and building game world. Ezio Auditores' life was tragic and you're a person who lived that. This is something that most games fail.. Personally for me this game is 9.5/10, but unfortunately metacritic does not give users ability to correct marks properly, so i will stop on 10/10 This part of AC is legendary. For most of the fans this is the best part, and one of the best games they have ever played( with both i agree) It is a sad story about a young man, who was the witness **** injustice and had to grow up fast and revenge. Ezio's story is fantastic, i think, it somehow symbolizes our life. It has WONDERFUL atmosphere and music. which shows an Italy of Renaissance great. Also, the plot and the characters are awesome. I think, that it is a game from which everyone should start their experience of Assassin's creed franchise.. It has nothing going for it. The gameplay, story, writing, characters, environments, graphics, controls, combat all **** beyond words. It's a chore to play and never satisfying.. In assassin's creed 2 you play as ezio auditore which is a great character that you will most likely fall in love with while playing this game. It has an amazing story that will keep you invested from start to finnish. The diffrent cities are beautiful and have diffrent soundtracks witch makes each and every place fun to roam around and explore in. Ac 2 is worth your time so play it. :). a beautiful game the truth without words is a work of art, without a doubt impeccable graphics and history!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I am a big Assassin's Creed fan, and I gotta say that this game is honestly the best game that I've ever played. God, I love this game. I've finished it more than 200 times. I swear to God. It did not bore me, or disappoint me even once. This game is perfect in all aspects. The gameplay is perfect. The music by Kyd is fantastic. The Voice job is great. The story is so good that I never get bored of it. This game is PERFECT. And oh my God! Ezio Auditore is the best protagonist ever. Good job Ubisoft. Brilliant!. I am playing every game and this game is absolutely magical! Graphics: 9 Music: 9 Cinematics : 8 Story : 9 Content : 8 Controls : 9 Gameplay : 10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolutely amazing and by far the best in the series. The story of ezio's vengeance against the killers of his father and brothers was narrated beautifully and the soundtrack was perfect for the setting and the stealth and combat style were ahead of it's time .This game deserve the appreciation it got.. Considering this game was made in 2009, I'm giving it a 10 ! I played this game in 2014 and actually have nostalgia for all the good memories I kept. The story, the art, the characters are really well done. Assassin's creed II is also a huge improvement from the original Assassin's Creed. I also liked the fact that you can own Monterrigioni (not sure about the exact name) as you progress in the game. Some music tracks are unforgettable (like the mission on the rooftop in Venice). The cities, especially Florence and Venice are really well designed !. This game is 9 years old already?! Damn, I love this game for a lot of small things, but the best thing about all this is story. Gameplay is... Fine. I mean it gets boring sometimes - especially in the end - but it's also really satisfacting to look at all of these finishers. Biggest problem about this game is that there is too much to do, and it's way too long. Oh, and soundtrack! Still gives me chills.. AC II''s highest point is the marvelous and holding story. The game has the best story of franchise and this sustain the game, generates curiosity about what will gonna happen in the story and that makes player wants to play more and more. Game's plot is innovating and very creative, and adding charismatic caracters, making this one being one of the best story on videogame's story. Although having many missions,sidequests and big maps too, game is quite repetitive, principally quests and main missions ,that looks like each other. Unfortunately game gots old bad and nowadays its just a copy of itself. But still tasteful to play.. If I had written this review in 2009 I would've given it a 6/10 or thereabouts. Not because I thought the game ****, but simply because, at the time, I didn't particularly enjoy the setting of Italy, I didn't understand the story and felt it was way too convoluted compared to the original, and I did not like Ezio as a character. I had no interest in learning about the Renaissance and I cared nothing for any of the characters nor the real figures that were involved. I just didn't care. Despite that, I did enjoy the gameplay and actually doing the missions themselves, I just didn't know why I was doing them nor did I care much. I played it right through to 100% and even got all the achievements for the Xbox 360 ver","Assassin's Creed 2 is the best Assassin's Creed game of the entire franchise . story, characters, story everything in it's peak. delivers on the promise of the original . graphics are okay considering the time that it was released ."
276.Balatro,"Balatro is a drug. This game is a deck-building roguelike based on the game of Poker, where each round you try to upgrade your hands to score more points: buying cards, various upgrades, and powerful Jokers, each with its unique special ability and multiplying capabilities .A game so simple yet so addicting, showing that often less is more, and developers can be creative with their projects even without ground-breaking premises. Great soundtrack and interesting card design, can’t wait to play a much-needed expansion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pretty fun for a roguelike card game, has some interesting mechanics, great art-style, and an addictive gameplay loop that makes you want to keep playing for hours. I do wish losing was more rewarding though, realistically, there is no reason to keep playing after a while, since you don't really unlock anything. It's one of those games that focus on being enjoyable, and it's genuinely a fun game to play when you have nothing else to do. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: NA. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GREAT. Voice Acting: NA.. Unique ideas and art style show promise, but shallow mechanics, poor balance, and repetitive gameplay hold it back.. ""number go up"" is a surprisingly fun game loop! very pretty and satisfying graphics. im horrifically addicted to this calculator simulator, help me.. the most overrated, boring gameplay in the history of indie gaming, it's like when you try to turn the chess 2.0 meme into reality but instead this one is for people with gambling addiction, though the music in this game is actually great (that's what made up 99% of the score **** so like, 5 is a decent score). Yo big number satisfy monkey brain, don't gamble kids but buy Balatro is good game. This game was absolutely deserving **** nomination. On the surface it seems like a fairly straightforward poker-meets-roguelike fusion, but one quickly realizes just how deep the game goes. Is it perfectly balanced? No, but it's close. The game is addicting because of its simple rules yet complex synergistic and strategic potential. I recommend any fan of strategy games or roguelikes immediately pick this one up.. Weirdly acceptable: ""Hey! Try this game! It's suuuper addictive!"" Weirdly unacceptable: ""Hey! Try this game! You'll stop brushing your teeth and maintaining friendships!"". Score: 8.5 Very addictive and fun game. The fact that one dude made this is crazy Just play it and have fun. I can't stand it. Anywhere I look, there's a Joker staring right back at me. I'm trying to work, a Joker's on my screen. I'm trying to eat, a Joker's in my food. I'm trying to shower, a Joker's on my shampoo bottle label. I'M TRYING TO SLEEP, A JOKER APPEARS IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE! balatro.. Refunded after about an hour. it's just poker with RNG roguelike mechanics. The fact that the game was $10 is a pure rip-off. I'm never listening to another gen z reviewer ever again. they'll easily entertained.. Gameplay: (Amazing) ----- Graphics: (Good) ----- Story: (N/A) ----- Score: (Great). While it may not have pulled me into its mechanics as successfully as a game like Slay the Spire, where you constantly have to calculate not just your movement across the map, your damage output, and also the damage output of your enemies and how to deal with that in the best possible way, with all of that also being highly dependent on the character you choose to play. Balatro, just like StS, is still a basically endlessly replayable roguelike deckbuilder. Only this time you don't fight for your life against dozens of different enemies. You are instead met with a mix of poker mechanics, jokers that buff your deck, tarot cards that give numerous different buffs, planet cards that buff your hands, and the joy of opening card packs, all in the hopes that you manage to build a deck that will give you hundreds, thousands, if not even millions of points, sometimes in a single hand. There is beauty in the simplicity here, with the only thing you need to worry about being the score target at the end of each turn. Even if you don't manage to score enough points and lose, a round of Balatro shouldn't take you more than half an hour, which just screams **** that I will casually replay for years to come. And while I haven't played with every deck in the game just yet, I wish there were overall fewer decks, but that they changed up the gameplay more drastically than the ones we have in the game at this moment. So far my strategy of going for high-end full houses hasn't really met a whole lot of opposition (this may ofcourse change with higher difficulties and some later decks). Oh, and an option in the settings that would speed up the animations a bit would be highly appreciated.. Balatro is my favorite rougue like game. Even if you don't care for or know how to play poker itreally doesn't take awat from the expereince. For this, I reference my girlfriend who put well over 100 hours into Balatro this year. The game loop is addicting and the more jokers you unlock the better you get at the game. The better you get at the game the higher stakes and different decks begin to provide the challenge. It's a game that gives back what you put into it and for $15 your not gonna find anything better in 2024.. It's a joke that this game was nominated for GOTY. The game is good, but not good enough. It's addictive at first, but quickly gets boring. It bored me after 4 hours.. A game in which prides itself on its simplicity and addictive nature. Balatro is a game which will have users consistently returning, and finding themselves with an unsatiable drive to keep building new combinations. Overall, a game which is a must play, especially with it's incredibly reasonable asking price.. Really addicting, Really fun, Endless Possibilities. So much to this game, yet such a simple concept. Only played for a day or 2, but I won't be stopping anytime soon!. A really impressive first game from a single developer. Third best deckbuilding rogue like.. Balatro is a really unique game that combines traditional poker, with rogue like deck building elements to create something truely unique. The presentation is barebones, but it has a unique style with it's jokers and use of transitioning audio. It's fairly cheap, available on mobile, or steam deck and it's got an endlessly playable quality in a similar vein to slay the spire, making it ideal for those moments you just have some time to kill. My only complaint with the game is with it's boss blinds, which have unique abilities for example ""disable all hearts"" or disable a random joker"", some of which just straight up hard counter certain playstyles. The game randomly pushes you into a style of play, and it can feel particularly unfair to reach the end of a challenging run only to find the boss hard counters your otherwise winning deck. For example, if I randomly get stuff that buffs heart cards and I build around that, then a later boss disables all hearts. Feels terrible, in an otherwise enjoyable game.. Very addicting, I could not put it down for the first few hours, so I guess thats something… having said that I got bored of it rather quickly.. An absurdly addicting game. I genuinely cannot find a flaw within it. Some achievements may be hard, but they’re doable. Once you start trying to go for an achievement, you can’t stop. It genuinely is just poker without any negative consequences (if you don’t count losing track of time as you play it).. Don't buy this! It's just poker with extra heroine for the gambling addicts. Calling this a video game is insulting to all other games that Do have art, music and actual gameplay. This is a cheap casino game or an early 2000's mobile game at it's very best. Just buy a deck of cards, it will have a ton more gameplay and will cost a lot cheaper. Absolutely biggest fraud of the year.. Balatro is a unique card-based strategy game that mixes poker mechanics with deck-building, creating a highly strategic and engaging experience. Players collect and upgrade cards, using jokers and modifiers to improve their hands, while facing increasingly difficult ""Boss Blinds"" that add extra rules and challenges. The game is known for its depth, with each decision affecting your chances of success. Its quirky design and playful jokers, like the Banana Joker, add fun elements to the gameplay. While the difficulty spikes can be overwhelming at times, the game offers rewarding moments, especially after overcoming tough challenges. I have never been an enthusiast of roguelites, though I have always had a weak spot for card games. However, Balatro brings a formula that is successful in delivering what such games are supposed to: it’s fun, well-crafted, and entertaining.. Worst game on mobile pixel graphics yet high battery and process consumption.. it's just an addiction. I love how such a new play mechanic was executed perfectly and the art style is just something else.. You will guaranteed have fun all the time playing this it almost instantly gets you addicted. Honestly I find people who review games lowly based upon their ""overhype,"" rather lame. It just makes reviewing a high-low game for developers where they want enough people to support the game to finance their endeavors but not too many as to get crucified by game snob reviewers. Anyways, now to the game. It's successful in its ability to be different with every play. I've seen other reviews that complain that it's just luck or compare it to being like pulling the lever of a slot machine, but that couldn't be further from the truth unless you're unable to think on your feet about which choices will mathematically benefit you the most. I find it ridiculous to complain about a game just because you don't have enough skill to see the skill it is based on. The aesthetics are charming and simple enough not to overwhelm ""non-gamers."" My only gripe is that although many mods exist for the game, its gameplay loop is generally unaltered after you unlock all gold on a deck and all the jokers (granted is typically a lot of playtime). Still, I'd like to see other modes or more than the 20 challenges in the game (which I'm sure the developer is working on).. Time to throw some cold water on the fervent crowd endlessly praising this game. First off, this game is in no way game of the year territory. It's a very basic rogue-like deck builder, with the most, and I mean THE MOST, bare bones artistic style and presentation I have ever seen. But none of that really matters when gameplay is king. Unfortunately THIS gameplay is anything but. After only a few rounds you'll realize you simply need to reroll until you get a busted run where you simply dominate. Rinse and repeat. Which is why I believe some people swear by this game. Starting a run is the equivalent to pulling the handle on a slot machine; you just want to see if you can get that jackpot. But with how long it takes to see if a run will work it just feels like a waste of time to me.. For those that love card games it's a must play. But the hype and praise for the game is excessive. The game is overly complex with little introduction. There's standard cards, plasma cards, glass cards, steel cards, gold cards, nebula cards, tarot cards, planet cards, spectrak cards. Then there's lucky modifiers, enhanced modifiers, bonus modifiers. Then there's seals, stamps, stickers, vouchers. And finally there's jokers, many different types of jokers. There might be more types as it's impossible to understand them all without committing a lot of time researching things by yourself outside of the game. There's a brief introduction on your first play that is extremely basic and brief and absolutely nothing else after that point so you're completely on your own. The concept of the game is you get a hand and you must play your hand to earn chips, and a certain number of chips will beat the level. Each level (boss) has different handicaps placed on your hand to nerf your cards to make it harder. The different types of card or modifiers affect your hand in other ways, mostly positively, sometimes negatively. The idea is interesting, and the idea of ""permanent unlocks"" is most intriguing. Alas, despite the game repeatedly stating there are permanent unlocks. Once you die, they're lost, and so the game gets incredibly grindy and repetitive. Trying to find modifiers or cards that give you a chance of progressing before you lose them all again. Eventually I realised I just want to play traditional poker again. Also, the game recently released on android, but has no optimizations for small screens so is incredibly difficult to play comfortably. Best played on PC.. Gamble away your life instead of money!!! Who needs hours when you've got millions of fake chips.. My personal GOTY. It's much more than just addictive, it's a very well-made and very complex game, with simple but efficient music and frenetic gameplay.. The most addicting game I've ever played. Casinos will lose a lot of revenue due to Balatro. It's extremely fun and there seem to be endless combos to theorycraft.. It was fun in the beginning but got bored after a dozen of runs. Good as time filler but there are many other games attracting more than this game. I think it's little bit overhyped.. Been playing it since release, lots of replayability, amazing interactions, builds and variety. Before this game I never played anything related to cards/poker, but the game simply offers almost endless fun.. Certainly the best game of 2024. Probably one the all time great computer games. Easy to get in to, lots of combinations to try out, excellent replay value. Not Since Slay the Spire has a game come out that it this new and fun.. I'm sure we all know this by now, but there is never enough time to enjoy all this ****'s a life-altering experience.. This game will consume you and your life. The sound of the multipliers hitting, the dings, will haunt you for nights to come. It will make you think you have had a chronic gambling problem. Amazing game, highly recommended.. Balatro is easily the best indie title that I've played so far. It's addicting and it's definitely my game of the year!. Absolutely amazing game. This concept is incredible and the gameplay mechanics keep you hooked for hours. I love the creativity put into the different jokers.. Very interesting game concept something that I have never seen anywhere else it's so much fun and it is very addictive but it's soooo good.. Great and addictive game. While it gets a bit stale after several completed runs, it offers a lot for many more hours for those craving more, and achieves all this with a simple core system. If you haven't yet, great game to pick up, especially if you lile Poker or card deck games and roguelites in general. Very satisfying 5-10 hours, recommended.. I didn't even know how to play poker before this game. It has a perfect way of telegraphing the consequences of the player's actions. Each run feels different so it never gets boring. Overall, it's an amazing addictive game!. Absolutly addicting rouge-like Pokergame. A lot of replay value. Despite the simple gameplay there is much content and many achievements.. Balatro has a simple concept. You earn points through a standard 52 card deck of playing cards. The higher the hand the better. For example, a flush will earn you more points than a two pair (like in standard poker games). Where the fun and addiction comes from is what you can do to your 52 card deck. Balatro uses a ""joker"" style system where different jokers can give you more points depending on what the joker adds to your score. For example, there are jokers that adds a multiplier to your hand. There are jokers that gives you more cards, and so on. Tarot cards also come into play as well as planet cards. Tarot cards change the way your deck looks. Planet cards will upgrade the hand that is listed on the planet card, which in turn gives you more points. This recipe of deck manipulation adds to the addiction and pleasure of this game. After playing this game for over 200 hours by now, I think this is one of the best games of 2024. The game is cheap, super fun, and highly addictive. Also I would add that any cheap PC can run this game. You don't need a high end PC to play it.. Lots of fun. Interesting and innovative gameplay with very stylish presentation.. I might've just realized that roguelike deck-builders are my favorite genre of games.. I am addicted to this game. Such a simple concept, not the first deck builder, terrible graphics but I find myself replaying it again and again and again, looking for that perfect combination of cumulative jokers that will work in synch. This game is the first, in an extensive Steam library, that makes me want to buy a Steam Deck. Brilliant. This game falls amongst the ranks of Spelunky 2 and The Binding of Isaac for me. It is an all time classic rogue-like that constantly challenges you to reach new high scores and find fun and interesting synergies. It's like a drug. I have a drug addiction. Please send help. The Wheel of Fortune card RNG is trash. Otherwise, amazing game.. This game is special .Playing trump sounds boring .But the game designer has excellent sense on editing .Me too, i'm not creator but i do have some idea about chinese chess .It is all about how to make the game interesting ,The most complex problem of creation . I insist this kind of games like pokemon ,yugioh are very suitable as mini game ,To cooperate with 3A games like The Witcher 3, Elder Scroll ,GTA . travel ,race collect like Gwent card . The reason why special ,Even doomsday Without electric and internet, You can craft this game by handmade .Historic . What's more,You can play this with child to guide them interest about junior math .. The concept is fun, the game lacks replayability for a roguelike, it feels not worth to 100% the game. Once you've won with every deck and start uping the difficulty it just becomes ""can i get my broken combo"" simulator, still, with a few tweaks to balance, the game can become and easy 8/10.. I'm 33 yrs old and this is one of the best unique games created in the past **** you like poker (or know how card games work) this is super **** many ways to beat the game, so different builds to try and days to be lucky with jokers.I don't play it often on Steam (bought it to use files to port to my handheld).Have the game on PS5, Steam and R36s device (ported via Portmaster).10/10 must have game!. This game is incredible. It feels like one of those games that has a twist at the end, or some dark secret, but so far I have not been able to find one, nor have I heard of one. I have not fully beaten the game, but I have completed multiple runs and I have not gotten sick of it yet. Give it a try!. One of the games that isn't exactly memorable but you WILL play for a long time. Good bang for buck!. Never really played poker before, but gave this game a try thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews - and am now hopelessly addicted, with over 40 hours logged in the game.. Idea of the game is very simple. You play poker game and collect tokens. Here comes the roguelite elements where your build is based on joker cards with different buffs and debuffs. In store you can purchase packs with different style of additional cards to buff your deck. Runs are very addictive and can be relatively fast which makes it very replayable. After beating the game you unlock new decks and challanges that makes game much harder and challanging. Game has very big potential for adding content in the future aswell. Highly recommend. That's a really good game. You can play it everywhere, when youwant to playlike 20 minutes in the train or public transports you can just start a game a then take it later if you want to stop before finishin the game. Great game.I have played for only 3 hours and beat 2 runs and I can already see the depth of the game. There are so many different builds and combos. I love this game already.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun concept with extreme spikes of unfairness. The boss blinds need adjustment.. insanely good. awesome take on poker and the holographic cards are sick. still trying to get those achievement tho. One of the most unique and addicting roguelikes out there, definitelyworth your time and money. The most addictive roguelike I've ever played. You will spend hundreds of hours on this game and it will never become repetitive. There are 15 different decks, 8 different difficulties, 20 special challenges, 28 different bosses, and hundreds of different game elements (including 150 jokers, 52 consumables, 24 tags, 32 vouchers, etc), so there are infinite different combos to try.. Fun for a short time, but nothing too awesome. No real new mechanics from my perspective, just another roguelike with a little bit different theme.. The kind of game that only comes along once every ten years and reminds you that videogame addiction is a real thing. An absolute wonder of a poker based roguelike. The gameplay loop is extremely satisfying and rewarding, there are enough unique hands, jokes, tickets, etc,. to keep the game fresh every time you pick it up.. I don't like the theme or better: it has no theme, which bothers me. Otherwise the game is ok, but just didn't grab me.. I was looking for something to compete with Slay the Spire, and this may be it. We'll see how the longjevity pansout. A simple and addictive game that keeps you wanting to do one more run(it's never just one more). It is very original. The mix a roguelike with poker. It is very fun and cool. It is simple, but addictive. I enjoyed a lot.. This game is a masterpiece! Will be playing for years to come. Many thanks to everyone involved in making this gem!. Balatro is a deck-building roguelike in which you play a series of poker hands in order to beat a set score. As you progress you can level up hands and add powers to individual cards so that earn more points and higher multipliers. It doesn’t quite offer the level of variety and challenge of Slay the Spire (still the best example of this genre in my opinion), but the intricately constructed systems and almost infinite combinations of modifiers and upgrades makes for a very addictive game.. The best roguelikes are those that keep rules relatively simple, but allow for the player to elaborate complex tactics and strategies. Pair this with some nice retro/vaporwave audio and visual aesthetics, and there you have balastro Simple, fun, enjoyable, very well made! It remembers me the first time I played Slay the Spire (although it is a very different game). Very similar to Slay the Spire, and that game was amazing, so you know you're in for a treat.. Fantastic game, highly recommend if you enjoy Slay the Spire or any roguelike, this is top notch!. As a person who does not like poker I loved this game and enjoyed it as the masterpiece that is. 9.2 - Very addictive roguelike card game! Very similar to Slay the Spire. If you loved that, you will love this as well, even more so if you like Poker. If you’ve never played Poker before then don’t fret, the game will show you all you need to know. Love this game. Simple, but addictive!. Incredible, very addictive. Makes so much fun with so many little things. The best deck builder ever.. Ok this is actually good card game but there is Monster Train which is the best deck builder of all time. Slay The Spire comes second acompanied by many of its clones like neoverse, castle **** etc. Balatro is quite original, but cant say its better than the others. Check out Inscryption which is also fresh and quite awesome.. Easy GOTY contender by taking a fresh look into how Poker and Roguelike can be combined, it's endless amounts of fun and a great challenge. I'm still trying to beat it as we speak.. This is the most addictive roguelike game you’ll ever play, there is no narrative or anything apart from cold hard numbers going up based on your upgrades and poker hands you play. There is not permanent upgrades so every run is different.. This is best roguelike deck builder since Slay The Spire, IMO. The variety of builds and strategies is bananas. It's deep, and very addictive!. This roguelike has permanent unlocks, but no permanent upgrades. As it is a card game, and fairly simple in its core, you can only marginally get better (count probabilities >> prioritize money >> utilize synergy of in-run upgrades and your fortes), while outcome and progression is mostly determined by luck or its absense. Basically, game is a time killer and just a tiny bit more engaging than an average ""cookie clicker"".. Addictive and challenging Poker-based deck builder. The best in genre since Slay the Spire.. Super addictive game for anyone who is a fan of poker. Its essentially a poker game mixed with the deck building and rogue elements of Slay the Spire. It’s fairly straight forward, but it requires a healthy amount of planning and strategy, especially in the later rounds. While I enjoyed Slay the Spire, I did feel like 75% of that game was my brain going on autopilot. You cannot do that in this game which I very much appreciate. It’s such a fun new angle at poker. The only complaint I have about the game is actually related to one of its strengths - the presentation of the game is very simple. The music, the graphics, the visuals, everything is extremely simple. Part of that is the charm and appeal of this game, it’s literally just streamlined into focusing on the gameplay. Considering that I spent a ridiculous amount of hours playing a small Texas hold em device powered by a single AA battery when I was much younger, this is going to keep me hooked for awhile. No idea where this game came from, but if you like poker and Slay the Spire, you’re in for a huge treat. Who knew that in 2024 I would be hooked on a rogue like permadeath poker deck building game.. It is a very fun game that you can make a lot of strategies in and I think 30h on the demo only says enough.. Such a clever game, you have to play it to understand! Then you won't be able to stop.... Virtual Crack. Never have I seen so much content packed into only 50MB. Literally infinitely replayable.. Insanely addicting and satisfying to play. One of the best roguelikes I’ve played in a long time. One of the best deckbuilding rogue like I have ever played. Incredibly addictive, it reinvents video poker and transforms it into an incredible concept. The game has everything to become a classic, from a very generous content (so many things to unlock!) to an eerie atmosphere and a general art direction that is mastered. GOTY contender. made an account just to give this a 10/10. i love how such a simple premise blossoms into something amazing, yet never feels too overwhelming. i've had the game 2 days and i've put 20 hours into it (not including time i put into the demo before the launch). Balatro is easily the best roguelike, and maybe even one of the best games released in 2024 so far. With 20+ hours in the demo alone, the game is addicting, and always fun to play, as each run is different from the last. The full release added 100 new jokers and more, and I love playing the full game even more then the demo! A great game, would 100% recommend.. This game has really good pixel art and is veeery addicting. It adds some new mechanics to a very well known card game and that is what makes it fun and challenging.. An amazing idea to combine poker combinations with a roguelike system, thanks to the huge number of combinations and incredibly interesting games, after each game you want to play again and again, and you don’t notice how half a day has passed :)","balatro is a deck-building roguelike based on the game of poker . the game has some interesting mechanics, great art-style, and an addictive gameplay loop . unique ideas and art style show promise, but shallow mechanics and poor balance hold it back ."
277.Project Gotham Racing 2,"Pioneer in its genre with circuit in real streets. He gave a kick in graphics, speed and gameplay to PS2 Gran Turismo. The best racing game for the original Xbox. From visuals to perfect driving mechanics - everything works fine in this fun game. Overall rating: 9.2.. This game is a classic Xbox game. I love that this game has damage, which a lot of racing games like gran turismo lack. Looks beautiful, definitely great!. PGR2 was better than its predecessor in every way and pushed the Original Xbox graphics to new limits.. This game is possibly the most overrated racing game ever. Still don't understand why people like this game so much. The racing's clunky, the car balancing is god-awful (some cars will ALWAYS beat other cars, even if they're in the same catagory), the A.I. is flawless and becomes impossible in harder modes, and the Kudos system is set up in such a way that it feels like YEARS before you unlock every car. I could go on and on, but i don't feel like it.. This is the game that kicked off my foray into the racing genre and I've honestly never looked back. It's a game I played for hours on end with family and friends via couch co-op. Even by today's standards, the graphics still hold up rather well for a 16 year old game. The tracks are largely city streets and they're all rendered beautifully, considering the Xbox hardware specs for the time. Sadly, this game has largely fallen by the wayside among the emergence of Forza Motorsport, Project Cars, Grand Turismo and Need For Speed. But it was a legitimate contender for being the one of best racing series available, making Project Gotham Racing 2 and under appreciated gem.. Couldn't ask for much more from a racing game on that generation of consoles. perfect blend of arcade and sim and love the kudos system. Worth itttttt. This game ****!!!!!! You have to play it for hours before you can use any of the good cars. The steering is difficult because it starts you off with bad cars. And the courses also ****, because they're too short. Don't bother with this one. All the positive reviews for this game are likely from people who have played the game for ample time. If you're looking for a quick play to have fun, look elsewhere.. The best racing game I've ever played. The sheer perfection of practically everything makes this a game worth getting no matter what the cost. With so many beautiful cars, tracks, wonderful custom track list and just so many songs, wonderful menus, organization of the showcase, impressive online, single, and multiplayer modes, including the arcade mode... etc. etc. The main single player campaign is pretty long and the replay value is pretty high, assuming you want to play online or test your skills at getting some of the bonus cars in the game (my favorite being the Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion. Anyways, this game is extremely satisfying - buy it right now! Gameplay: 9.5/10 Story: N/A/10 Music: 9.5/10 Presentation: 9.5/10 Length: 9.5/10 Overall: 10/10. While I have played racers that have a purer fun factor and others with OTT simulation, this is likely the slickest racing game I will ever play. The mere act of driving through the streets of its many cities is cool in every sense, particularly at night and your favourite track on the in game radio comes on. The difficulty is just about right, arcade mode in particular demands a challenge even for gold medals which makes them all the more satisfying once you have attained them. Graphically still holds up, the cities are wholly convincing and little touches like the cable cars moving in the background of Barcelona or trains on the rails above in Chicago show a great deal of care. Racing feels smooth, not frustrating like sims can be but definitely need a bit of mastery that other arcade racers don't cater for. Racing style is what the game wants, and you will want to beat the game with as much Kudos as possible after a short time getting in the groove, and ultimately its a game that's very hard to put down. Buy if you liked the other PGR games, and try it out if forza is just not as fun as you would like, but still want a game with somewhat grounded racing.","gran turismo is the best racing game for the original Xbox . from visuals to perfect driving mechanics - everything works fine in this fun game . clunky, balancing is god-awful and the Kudos system is set up in such a way that it feels like YEARS before you unlock every car ."
278.Animal Crossing: New Horizons,"It WAS a great game. The game just doesnt get Updates anymore. The last big Update was the 2.0 Update in 2021. The game just gets boring after some time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. its a beautiful fun game with a nice story great casual play and almost a impossibly perfect formula for seemingly infinite content if it was 2020 i would say its a must have for any switch owner but since like 2022 the game feels unsupported and baren the only kind of people playing it are avid fans and treasure island streams and i would really suggest just waiting until Nintendo ether gives new support to the game or makes a new animal crossing. This is a really fun franchise and game. You can feel the amount of creativity that went into every single one of the games. But I unfortunately don't find these games all too appealing. I spent maybe a month or two on this game before forgetting I even owned it.. Amazing Game Would Recommend To All My Friends. It Is A Chill Signal Player Game. Bland turbo-trash that killed its updates way too early. Avoid this turbo-steaming, fiery pile of trash like a disease.. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s such a chill and relaxing experience that you can sink hours into without even realizing it. The freedom you get to design your island, customize your house, and create your own little paradise is unmatched. Whether you’re planting flowers, building bridges, or just hanging out with the adorable villagers, it’s the kind of game that makes you feel at peace. The seasonal events and special updates keep it fresh and exciting, making you want to come back and see what’s **** music and sound effects are so soothing and really add to the vibe of the game. And don’t even get me started on the villagers—they have so much personality and make the game feel alive. You get attached to them, and when they leave, it’s like saying goodbye to a friend. And then there’s Tom Nook, the capitalistic king of the island who somehow manages to make you feel like you’re the one in charge while he’s pulling all the strings behind the scenes. The man’s a genius when it comes to selling you overpriced homes and upgrades, but you can’t help but love him for it. It’s hilarious how he’s both a business mogul and your best buddy at the same time.I used to play it all the time, but sadly, I sold my Switch because I wasn’t using it much. Now, I really regret it. I miss spending time in my little island paradise, creating new designs, and seeing what my favorite villagers are up to. It’s such a great game that I’d love to pick up again. It’s just pure comfort and joy, and the kind of game that makes you smile every time you play.. Very fun game and really relaxing. Don't really like how it follows real world time but still very fun and relaxing. Haven't even played it and can already tell it is one of the better Nintendo games out there. Trumps Mario Odyssey by miles, never play odyssey, play animal crossing. How on earth does this game have a 5.8 rating?? You either don't know what animal crossing is or trolling. I'll admit the game gets repetitive but i put like 400hrs into it. Its a good game if you know what Animal Crossing is!. Absolutely amazing game a must have for everyone. Can't wait to see what's next!. I like the game, but there are some people saying there are 1 island per switch. What a time sink ****, for good and for bad. The game has a lot of things to do around your island at first but it does tend to get a bit repetitive after a 200 hours or so but even then, you could continue perfecting your island or spending more time with the DLC Home designer which could be a great experience. Overall it is the game we all needed at the time but now the lack of substantial content drops have limited its replay value. Phenomenal!!! I don't even like cozy farm games anymore, but this game is soooo goood! It's cute and pollished. It has a sense of addictiveness that me and many other people enjoy. The community while filled with complaining attitudes is one of the most special elements of this game. I will say that I understand the critisism that this game was a letdown. We were promised 2-3 years of updates, and all we got was around 1 and a half. I will say that the people saying that have put thousands of hours into the game already so it's a bit of a moot point. This game has many plus's tho- It's seriously unbeleivaby cute, everything from the animals, to the objects, character creators are so adorable. The gameplay is fun especially when you don't time travel. You get a sense of accomplishment which is funny because all you did was sit at home playing Animal Crossing (This part was fun especially in the 2020 lockdown) This game while clearly not being even remotly realistic is a great social sim. The villagers are charming and fun to talk to, you can build them objects and fufill requests, give them gifts etc. The game is forever playable and never ending. So you can get as much animal crossing content as you want until you eventually get sick of i, and the animals will be waiting for you to come back when you do. It's great, I've sunk far too many hours into it, but I love it. The idea of not letting you proceed with the game after your daily job is done so that you will have to come back tomorrow is so brilliant yet so simple.. Boring crap. who cares about a farm sim? Glad I don't play this garbage. Yuck.. This game saved my life. I was on the verge of DEATH when this game grew wings, FLEW to my bed, and gave me a kiss My cat, poor soul, was DYING, when ANIMAL CROSSING, NEW HORIZONS, gave me some catat food and my BEAUTIFUL CAT, ate it up, and now is alive. 10 out of 10 game. This is my favorite game, it is very meditative and relaxing. It is always a pleasure to return to the world of animal crossing. This game is capable of dragging on for a long time, and surprises with new events every time. If you have a Nintendo switch, then you just have to play this masterpiece.. Possibly the best animal crossing game to come. .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I thought this game was okay. Some things in the game are cool but it is a game that loves to waste the players time with everything that you do, and because of that, I hate it so much. The Good The graphics are very good and cute. You can move most of the objects that you place. You can customize your house and island. The Bad There’s no story. You just have to talk to right people to make your island better. And, even when I was putting a lot of cool expensive things around the island, Isabelle still gave it a 1 star, saying that I needed to improve it. The game is so damn grindy. Omg. The amount of time that it takes to accumulate enough money to pay off each debt keeps increasing to a stupid degree. How can adding another room be more expensive than the last extra room? Dialogue takes forever to complete, even when you are pressing it to make it go faster. It still takes too long!You can’t buy a ton of a single item at once. You can only buy an item one at a time. It’s crazy! I expected more from Nintendo. You can however buy seeds in bulk of 5 at the shop. Everything wastes your time. Talking to the museum owl, he says the same thing every time and it’s annoying. All his complaining and bulls##t too. Crafting items ****. When crafting you have to manually put the specific ingredients in your bag to craft an item. Items cannot be used from your storage. Tools that you make break fast. It’s beyond stupid how that works for your high-end tools. All the characters seem to talk the same. Some may have their own little quirks like Cherry saying “what what” at the end of sentences. Birds who appear on the beach all make you do the same fetch every time! Same with the ghost! The scallop guy in the ocean is annoying when he pops up and wants to spread his useless thoughts. You have to hold the “B” button then move the analog all the way to make your character run. Just make the damn character run! What else is that button used for? Going to another island when using a ticket makes the switch run hotter and you can hear it and feel it. Like, how can a small island with one villager stress the switch? There’s no way to know what items you already own. I had no idea what clothes or stuff I bought from the nook store. So I stopped caring and just wore one thing. No point in collecting a ton of clothes or items that I’ll never know that I have dupes of, especially when it doesn’t matter and even more so when there is only so much space in the storage. Hanging clothes on the walls is dumb. There’s no way to change controls, keybindings, or settings. I wanted to play with the dpad. Scared of drift. People want and can leave the island. Problem is, you need resources that you can only get once per day, and then you have to use that to buy a ticket to then fly to get people. Why make it a pain in the a#$ to have some attempt to beat this game? Everything in this game is so expensive. An achievement wants you to play every day for a year. Some items take too long or are too hard to get. Conclusion I gave the game 85 hours of my life, when I knew that playing my other games, like mario wonder or kingdom hearts, was way more fun. Bottomline, the game doesn’t respect your time.. Animal crossing it's alright one of my most played games on my switch. Thing is it's so stresssfulwith the decorating getting materials and stuff. I recently came back to it and resetted my island and a fresh start by flattening it but it'shust to much. You have to place furniture everywhere outside like i wish it was basic and just flowers and path and trees only outside like new leaf and no terraforming makes it complicated. This is my first Animal Crossing game. I bought it back in late November 2020 to help with my PTSD. I'm still playing it as of this post. Doing island chores each day (30 minutes to an hour) might be boring to some people but it helps me relax, and I'm grateful for that.. It's a time sink, but sadly for all the wrong reasons. I have 75 hours so far in the game. But a LOT of it is basically fast clicking to repeat mundane tasks like buying bell vouchers, crafting multiples of the same thing etc. Instead of doing the logical thing and having an option to purchase or craft multiples by a simple box asking how many it's five different clicks per item purchased, several clicks per item crafted etc. How is this in any way acceptable? Luckily I am the only person using my switch. But the limit to one island per console is also a MAJOR point of pure idiocy. And no cloud save means if the console goes so does your island (yes, this has happened to me). It does have some things going for it. The graphics are cute, the social aspect is fine (though I do think **** Valley does it better) but it is hard to respect a game that clearly doesn't respect your time.. It's a little unfair , I gave that Game a 9. It would've gotten a 10 , if I was someone who loves to craf and design for hours. But I'm not xd. Nevertheless, for me it's a ""I should check out my Island a little"" then play it for 1-2 Hours make some changes and go off. Even though im not the guy for Sandbox, this game calls me everyday to play it a little. Bought this for my girlfriend. Without a doubt, the best decision of my life.. I have been playing since 2006. The characters have been massively dumbed down, they have no personality. WAY too many weeds. Terraforming is not fun, please make it stop. Everything takes so much time, it’s overwhelming. I don’t want to craft all day. Where has all the fruit gone? There is nothing new that is fun. The islands you can travel to collect things ****. The easter event is awful. The shop upgrade is so basic. I am so disappointed, instead of enhancing the experience you have ruined it. This was my comfort game, now it is just a stressful, unpleasant experience.. The game have much potential but it don t use all beacues have so much bug and after finish the game you can t make much,but only for the dlc the game are safe 6/10. Animal Crossing New Horizons is a ball of a time but you have to understand that when you play it you will hit a wall. eventually you do whatever you wanted to do and you need to take abreak before finding the next thing.Other than that the game isso smooth and well done giving an excellent simulator game for a guy that doesnt even really like simulator games.. Being a big fan of Animal Crossing, it's impossible not to play it!On the other hand, we very quickly reach the limits of the switch, the devs understood this well and quickly stopped the updates, which is a shame.. Personally a big waste of money, in terms of quality there is no doubt, the game takes you a lot even if you don't like it, because it tries to prolong everything you have to do. Of course, if you don't like the genre, you'll never like it. Animal Crossing New Horizons is basically perfect. This games music atmosphere and characters are all amazing. This game is very calming and the community is amazing (Just don't mention Raymond). I love this game, it's bright and friendly community helped me stay sane during covid-times. It was such a perfect timing with this game, lucky :)) but also the game itself is super adorable and relaxing!. Disappointing. First of all, I am a fan of the series. New Leaf was one of my favorite 3DS games. I enjoyed New Horizons for some time so my score is not lower than 5. What made me keep playing New Horizons was the possibility of building my ultimate dream world. At first, it started great, hour by hour, slowly improving my island. After a hundred hours, though, I started to lose interest, and looking back, all I saw were unfinished dreams and bitter feelings of regret for losing all these hours. So, what happened? To start and invest time in these games, you have to build trust in the game itself about what the end game will bring. However, the game came out unfinished so the trust shifted from the game itself to the developers. Ultimately, the developers failed to deliver quality updates and it made everything fall to the ground. My last complaint is about the villager's personalities. They are always so agreeable and getting the same line from two different villagers with the same personality breaks the immersion.. Gotta be honest, I find this game really boring. The only improvements are the amount of customization options and different skintones (because animal crossing was way behind in that aspect). Other than that, this is a step down from New Leaf. The terraforming, which was the most advertised feature, takes forever to get to. New Leaf lets you jump into the fun immediately, but here you have to wait soo long until the interesting part. I actually didn't get to the terraforming because I put the game down a year ago and haven't checked on it since. I've never lost interest in a game so quickly. Another thing that bothers me is how washed down and boring the villagers (or islanders) are now. I know there were people who didn't like how some villagers were mean or sassy in older games, but you can't deny that it added spice and made them feel like real neighbors (because not everybody will instantly love you upon first meeting in real life, obviously). But now all the villagers have the same cookie-cutter niceness, making them lose what made them distict. Even villagers with snooty and grouchy personality types lack the edge they used to have. New Horizons was only critically acclaimed because it released during the pandemic when everyone was dying of boredom. If it was released before or a year after the pandemic, I'd imagine people would've been much more critical of it. I think they tried too hard to be ""cozy"" and ""chill"" that it backfired and made the game boring and bland.. Animal crossing new horizons is a great looking game but lacks the charm and content the series is know for and feels to short. There is only a few goals in the game to keep the player intrigued and if the player fails to find a connection with the game they will probably stop playing as they feel unfufilled.. This game single handley helped me through the first year of the pandemic , and made cozy games a whole new genre chefs kiss.. Yeah yeah yeah farming and **** we get it. I like slave labour and abusing animals as much as the next guy but the lack of Ugnaughts in this horrid game is disturbing!. Animal Crossing New Horizons success was complete luck in that the COVID 19 pandemic meant people needed something to do, and which game was just coming out? Animal Crossing New Horizons. However, previous Animal Crossing players such as myself noticed that something was missing in this game. A lot of things were missing. And even after the year and a half of updates that should have been there from the start, there were still things missing. While Harvey’s Island added pop up shops, it was a lazy excuse for past games permanent shops and even shopping districts. The game also took away several NPCs that were staples in the franchise, as well as also removing the negative aspects of Villager dialogue almost completely. The only time villagers get mad at you anymore is if you hit them with a net or push them around. The game also puts an immense focus on decorating and customization so much that you’re basically god. You can put anything wherever you want, villagers no longer move out on their own but instead need your permission, and with the DLC you can also customize their houses at your will. All of the charm was taken out replaced by you making every signal decision and you now being your islands new monarchy.. Animal Crossing New Horizons occupies a weird spot in my games folder. It flourishes with great ideas and additions like terra forming, the crafting of tools and furnitures, and basically unlimited control over your island. During the Covid pandemic, the game really appeared as a life saver, allowing us to get together in our little islands. However, since then, we got barely any new content aside from a god-awful Easter event and a mild separate island for bonus characters like Redd the kitsune or Saharah the camel. Ultimately, this meant having basically less content than what the 3DS game offered, but in a pricier package. No shop upgrades after the first one, no coffee shop separate from the museum, golden tools that are breakable despite their awful price, no Kappn Island, and a paid DLC that barely improved anything at all despite known issues for months. This leaves ACNH as an unfinished, unpolished state that feels more like an open beta than a fully finished game. As such, while I cannot call it a ""bad"" game per se, I cannot in my right mind recommend it.. I really enjoyed my time on this game, especially during COVID. The game is great and the content was good and it was my first experience with this sage. But since, there is a lack of content, things are always the same and it has been boring. We got 1 major update and the game was abandonned.. It was fun playing it, even though after some time it feels dull. After a certain point, the things you can do in one day are fishing, plugging weed on your island and go to another island to do the same. After you have done your ""daily duties"", you can go on and do them again or drop the game like i did. Some parts just feel to long, building a house for another islander - takes atleast a day. Expand your home - takes atleast a day. and so on.. Especially the part where you have to get a better rating for your island to progress takes longer and the definition is too ""sloppy"" and takes forever to progress past that. Not even the cuteness factor of the islanders can sustain my interest in progressing further.. I really enjoyed my time with other games in this series, specifically the DS and 3DS version. Unfortunately, this one really didn't do anything new for me. While its never looked better and you might have 1 or 2 new tools, its just is that same game over a decade later. Even the multiplayer stuff is implemented so poorly and just getting to a friends island is a hassle. That's no surprise since Nintendo still relies on friend codes in this day and age. The loop of getting money in these games is still not changed after all this time either, which could use a serious improvement. Even just the stuff you put on your island is not interesting enough, make more interactable items to use or play mini games on, something!. Critics love Nintendo but the reality is that they overrated this game by a lot. It's very boring and doesn't have anything special about it.. It got us all through 2020 lockdowns ok it's a clear 10 out of 10. I'm still playing it in 2024 somehow too which is honestly just wild.. Needs a rework of multiplayer and minigames. Very customizable and a large amount of villages to get. The game is a bit grindy and a lot of things take many weeks to do, not possible to unlock everything in one day. It makes you want to come back everyday and do more. 8/10. By far the deepest entry in this series of animal crossing games, New horizons is a cozy crafting king.. New Horizons is kinda a step back from New Leaf in a few ways that I don't like, but ultimately it's better for it. The slow build to making your island into a villager/town is actually kinda inspiring, and being able to control far more than you ever could in New Leaf will certainly make it hard to go to back to. The new characters are all pretty much hits, and while I do miss some of the older characters, the promise of new updates and proper fixes may mean any complains will be moot as well. Still breakable tools, not being able to bulk craft, and season events being tied to the internet still **** at launch. I'm glad we rented this as it's impossible for a family to enjoy the game and build his own island. For some obscure reason, the game can only handles a single island per Nintendo Switch so only one of the profile on the console can actually unlocks stuff on the island.. Just another animal crossing game, but this time you need to pay a subscription to play with your friends, while the game itself is not even the best Animal Crossing. It's okay for the most part, but not much more than that. If I could give this game -9999 I would do it in a hear beat. It feels like some employee at nintendo, wanted to watch the world burn. This game is a literal waste of time.Nintendo Sales Rep (hypothetical): In this new rendition of animal crossing, EVERYTHING is movable.That is a COMPLETE lie. It's true that everything is movable, but not the damn residence centertownhall. Literally wasted my time playing my way through to the point of landscaping, only to discover; majority of the buildings are movable.... ACNH is a paper weight now.Nintendo has gone donw the gutter IMO... This idea of a paywall to access my own internet. That is a new low. Nintendo, welcome to my blacklist.. Fun and perfect, but also incredibly nerve wracking. One of the few games that don't give me a headache from too much visual noise. It's a good virtual retreat from reality.. You have to dump trash all over your island to increase your island score. Whoever designed this system is a moron.. Animal Crossing has been one of nintendos franchises that always stood out to me as a core nintendo fan enjoying each part the franchise has to offer. As the super Animal Crossing fan I am, I feel that we can safely dub this the greatest Animal Crossing game to date. The game completely opens the customization options for the player being the first game to do many new quality of life improvements and the first to completely fill the game with new features. However, while the new levels of customization are fantastic it comes at the cost of the villagers being bland/general lack of interaction with NPC's. ACNH focused on giving the player the best experience in terms of its core concept, building a community from scratch on a desert island, however sometimes the community feeling dissapears with the lack of backbone and sometimes raw personality from villagers. ACNH also has fewer buildings and special characters in general compared to its predecessor New Leaf mostly due to the setting but this doesn't excuse the fact that this does make your home island much more empty. And while ACNH feels the same if not slightly worse in a lot of those aspects compared to ACNL it does however exceed its predecessor in almost all other categories. The visuals of the game are stunning with each sprite feeling detailed and completely finished with no parts of the games visuals giving off the sense of ""cut corners"" to save development time. New features in this games make their exclusion in past game stick out showing nintendo's great vision for the franchise. Crafting and placing furniture outside is a must have creating endless possibilities for the ever creative fanbase. As previously stated many quality of life improvements are amazing with decorating your own house now being a breeze. As for the DLC expansion it does not disappoint. It provides a completely new setting and main goal only paywalling small features not forcing players into buying it. All in all, I place this game as the best of the best in nintendos history books.. Really fun to design your island and live your life peacefully. This game will help calm you down after a long day at school or work. Collecting all the creatures to fill out the critterpedia is so fun and a long task. Only gripe is that the villager interactions are stale so there's not much use talking to them unlike in previous games.. This Animal Crossing game is highly customizeable in its world building. You have to be aware when buying this, that you need to make your own goals in the game and I'd generally say you'd need to be into the concept of creating your own little wholesome world in order to enjoy this game in the first place. In terms of actual entertainment provided from the game itself, there are special events like holidays etc. where there are certain tasks you can fulfill. Other than that you're basically on your own with what you want to do, which can be both positive or negative. This game is super saturated, cute and cozy. I'd genuinely give it a 10/10 rating, and believe it could be one of the best games in its genre, but unfortunately I have to subtract a point for the lack of minigames that were a very BIG part of the multiplayer fun in ACNL. It's definitely something that's missing. Still, I have around 600hours in this game and only connect positive times with it. (*´˘`*)♡. really good just not my thing. This game is amazing, there is nothing wrong with it except for the some what soulless NPCs, I only say this because the last games had very geniune NPCswho were actually interesting to talk to. This is really the only problem with the game. Many people will say its for people who dont play videogames or dont have time, blablabla. I have played videogames all my life, I love games in which u can grind for hours and never get bored, the thing is my dopamine recievers are melted down like these other losers who say its bad do to the progression. Its a great game, its so fun to play alone, the enviromnet of it is amazing, the music is great (not as good as the older games though) and its just as what its presented as. If you arent fond of games with slow progression than dont buy it, if you actually have a the brain of a average human and dont spend 10 hours on tiktok everyday thenyou will have a lot of fun.. I didn't know what to expect from AC one of my female friends just pestered me until I gave in and bought it. I tured out to be surprised by it though AC is a good game to play when you just want to sit back and chill. The gameplay is perhaps too simple though with perhaps the best description for it being all the potential of the world but the ability of a chimp. You can buy things like tractors and boats but you can't drive them yourself and just about everything you'll do you'll think the developers could have added 2 or 3 more layers of depth to keep things more interesting and engaging. Speaking to my female friend she informed me of many things previous AC installments had and how they are not in AC for Switch, I have to admit I feel disappointed by not having what I've been told about in AC for Switch and if I had played earlier AC games I'd be downright annoyed about it and probably rating AC for Switch a 610. If AC on Switch will be your first AC game though then there is plenty to introduce you to things here and hopefully, in time, features lacking or outright missing will get put back because the game really needs some more depth and it is overdue some good DLCs.. Animal Crossing New Horizons is basically perfect. Full of wholesome content that helped us cope with the. Maybe a good decoration game but a bad Animal Crossing in my opinion. Content events from previous games from which certain elements are removed, which gives the feeling of emptiness. Soulless villagers. Robotics PNG. Quite a few farming mechanics from mobile games. Lack of care on the mystery islands. Game too focused on social networks, photos in my taste. I loved what this serie of game was before, but now I don't. I don't forget also the removal of posters from the catalog to re-unlock them with Amiibo a month later and the removal of zoning... This game being a pioneer at this level with the aim of preventing having several islands on the same console also says a lot about respect and the consideration of the players. This series is no longer produced by people passionate about video games but financiers with objectives to achieve and start to be mainstream and viral with the people who like show what they do with the elements provided for decoration, by their prominence and cute and instagrammable side.. this game came out during lockdown, which explained why it got a huge amount of sales, but who actually plays this in 2023? i remeber loving this game in 2020, updates and just the diffrent approach this game took, you could edit your island in many diffrent ways which was never done in any other animal crossing but nintendo has killed this game in recent years, the game is very easily explioted, and you can get bots coming to your island to give you loads of good stuff, and nintendo stopped updating this game, it was good while it lasted. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is probably my favourite game of all time. Putting aside its timely release during a period where we were stuck inside, I cannot help but go back to my island regularly, even though it’s been 3 years since its release. The level of customisation on your island is impeccable, and the attention to detail never fails to impress. From the little secrets and easter eggs suffused throughout the game, down to the UI where each individual UI element has a unique sound effect attached to it. Details like these are a testament to the love, hard work, and effort poured into the game, and for that alone I personally think it deserves a 10. The visuals are an aesthetic feast. I mean, the creatures have TOE BEANS. The graphics, although adorably simplistic, are intricate and realistic when they need to be (see: furniture and fish/bugs/sea creatures). There are so many villagers, both cute and kitsch, and they are filled to the brim with personality and charm. That is, if you have villagers with different personality types on your island. Probably one of the few shortcomings of the game would be the lack of depth of the dialogue. Villagers with similar personality types or hobbies may end up repeating dialogue/spewing similar rhetoric as each other. If you’re like me and you enjoy talking to the same villager over and over until they get sick of it, you’ve probably had them repeat themselves a couple of times, or repeat the same s",the last big Update was the 2.0 Update in 2021 . Animal Crossing: newhorizons is one of the best games i’ve ever played . the game is a great fun game with a nice story great casual play .
279.The Sims 2,"i was triying to review the DS version of this crap but metacritic crashefd. This is a masterpiece. It should be in history books. I remember playing this as a preteen. It is great for long road trips. I love keelhauling cards.. The best SIMS game ever made. Many hours of pure fun, simple and fun game. No new Sims games can beat this.. It's mediocre compared to the third game. I played it a bit in the past and it was boring.. The base of the sims original, with beautiful graphics and more options beyond your house. Also good as house builder and with a terrible DLC politic. the best game in the sims series, it has small details in it that surpasses the sims 3/4 is this game is from 2004. Will made games out of love and care after he left EA just made them for money. The Sims 2 was released back in 2004 and is still today a fun game. The Game has many details and is very realistic. The physics are great aswell.. I love this game and it's my absolute favorite! I feel I have to take a point off because of corruption issues and glitches but there are ways to avoid corruption. It's an incredibly fun and addicting game! I've played so much sims 2, years, and I still learn new things about it and the gameplay!. After the great success of The Sims 2 with the Nightlife, Open for Business, University expansions, it was undoubtedly one of the best games in The Sims series. The expansions were great and always brought new content to the base game.. Much better than the sims one more realistic in terms of ageing just don’t like the slow uploads and crashed occasionally.. I fell in love with The Sims 1. One day EA started handing out the complete edition of The Sims 2 on Origin, so I didn't hesitate and immediately took the game. I did well. You can see a noticeable difference in graphics right after launch. The game looks a lot better and you have a lot more options to customize your Sim. The same goes for your house. But what is a huge plus is the ability to travel to other places and you do not have to be at home all the time. A pleasant diversification of the game. However, there is a ton of content in the game and it is a pity that a lot of it is part of the DLC, so you have to pay extra to make your gaming experience a little more varied. Besides, it's a great game and perhaps one of the best life simulators I've ever experienced.. The best one in the franchise, a truly masterpiece. It's a shame that The Sims 4 is so bad and compared to this amazing game it looks like a real trash.. This game gives me so much nostalgia. I remember playing a lot of this game but I wouldn't recommend it now. The second entry to the Sims series brought even more wacky tone and developed it greatly with very imaginative DLCs. Even more possibilities, even better music, even more Sims.. A great extension to the life sim universe. All the DLCs combined make it a perfect game. even with all the sims sequels that are already out, the sims 2 stays unmatched. brilliant and and idea out of the box by the time it was released.. The Sims 2 is the very height of quality of the Sims franchise. It's better in every way than other products in the series. The subsequent games (review was written in the time of Sims 4 being on market for quite few years) have never even **** its potential. The game has many, many mechanics and everything is polished. It's very fun to play, and I enjoyed every minute of it.. A classic, recently rebought it with some expansion packs. game play 9: It depends a bit on how you play the game, generally Sims learn how you like to do things meaning even if you don't give them the orders to do something; they do what they think you would have ordered to do things. So it how smooth it goes depends on how you 'trained' your sim. Also love how you can get promoted as demoted for making the right/wrong decision at work. I do however notice I choose the military almost every time due to the salary and the chance of some really big cash at the top of your career, w/o having to use cheats or anything. The aging thing though is a bummer, I usually use cheats to put it off as I'm not interested in going for that green hourglass all the time to prevent aging. Graphics: 8, it's not a new game and this should thus come as no surprise; certainly if you'd compare it to the sequels that came out; though still extremely impressive for it's time; especially when you compare it to the prequel. Story 9. I've had some expansion packs so it's not building a home all the time; you can go out bowling, clubbing, doing groceries, go on vacation (very original) and I've even created some great additional tourist attractions in all holiday scenes; even creating an entire scene myself (inspired by The Loire; castle region in France). Also the hidden sheds with their quests at the holidays add really original features. Conclusion: 9. Still recommended for anyone that considers; even though it's age. But before you do, you might want to check out their sequels too.. The best game of the series, the best idea. The best animations, the best story (yes it is there). And what's important, there was a soul in it.. My favourite game of all times, still so enjoyable and fun. This game has a very special place in my heart because it was the first sims game I played and the one I resort to when I miss the sims franchise. Sims 4 is just very lacking and sims 3 is too buggy to enjoy. The sims 2 is just the perfect combination of the two for me.. Was a nice game on its own, but not really great addition to the first game.. Probably the best Sims game in the entire series. Later games had too much bizarre and unneccesary stuff going on. Sim creation system was very advanced for the time. Graphics are nice even today.. It was best game of that time. On series normally sims 4 is better now but it is more fun than sims 3. Masterpiece.. I had a lot of fun with the Sims 2, it's really a shame that it doesn't run on newer PCs that well. You can create, build, and act out basically any story you want and the gameplay is much more open-ended than in the following Sims titles. If you can get it to run, this is the Sims game I regard as the best one of the series.. The Sims 2 is so simplistic it's easy to enjoy and lovable for all Sims fans around. One of the best Sims games out there and with all the expansions you'll find yourself playing every single little thing. Once mods come in too? Oh boy you won't stop playing. 2004 and still a pretty fun game today.. The best game in the whole series. Is so damn cute. I never seen a more cute game than this.. The Sims 2 is the game of my life, all the reality added to the game its amazing. I love it!. so many fake votes here... Boring gameplay in my view: I dont see any motivation to take care of a virtual person to do the same things I do in the real life: go to work, build up relationships, eat, sleep, piss. I guess this is for very casual gamer or women. Graphics is bad, even for such an old game. There is no wideview resolution. The style is childish and so hip and cool, for me boring and not immersive.. Top ten greatest PC game of all time for sure. So much production value, great story, great gameplay, great soundtrack. Looking back on it with the lens of having the Sims 3 and 4 released and how abysmal they are in comparison makes this game all the more nostalgic. Its still the best of the series despite being nearly 9 years old (with all expansions). If I could sum it up in one word, ""Iconic!"". The last great Sims game in the series. Great expansions that can be re-played multiple times. The community still makes great custom content for it and looks like it will stay like this forever.. I absolutly love this game. It is one of the alll time best PC games of all time. In my other revew i accidently clicked on five instead of ten, so if this says five, it was a mistke. I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone who has a computer. My only advice is to get the expansions, they add so much.. This game ain't good as sims 1 but it's still fun to play. It takes everything you love about sims 1 and makes it more enjoyable and playable. I love playing this game and I do recommend it.. This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. It is more than just a life simulator. Of course, you can create your Sim, and from the beginning you can create children, spouses, or friends for your Sim. I prefer to start from scratch and do the whole relationship thing. What makes this different from real life is that you can build your dream house (it is actually very intuitive), control many Sims, and it has some game elements to it. You have to try to complete Sim's wants and try to avoid their fears to give them aspiration points, which can unlock special items not available for purchasing. It also adds to your life score. There are many expansions to the game: University, Pets, Seasons, and more. I have the University pack which allows a Sim to go to college and it is like a whole other game. The Sims 2 actually brings me emotion, and it feels like I am actually controlling real people sometimes. Those moments when your Sim falls in love with another Sim, when a baby is born, when a teen turns into an adult, all are extremely satisfying moments and can bring out my emotions like no other game can. 12 years later, this is the best Sims game and I am still hooked to this day.. To this day I still come back to this game and play it for hours. Whether it's to play with my sims, Build houses, or burn them mercilessly. It's much better than sims 4. The thing that keeps this game from being a perfect 10 is the glitches. This is one of the most unstable games I have ever played. Despite this I still like it a lot.. The Sims 2 is the place where you know you are wasting your time building a dream life for your character instead of your own. But you just do not care, because what matters now is your sim.. A perfect and well simulator of life, the gameplay is so addictive and well designed, i love the concept of the skill and personality points, and how this affects the gameplay of your character.. HEY,HEY,HEY! Its fat albert and this game is awesome! But seriously. This game is awesome. The Gameplay,The Expansions,The Fun. I found it better than Sims 3. Well. At least more enjoyable. It's definitely HOURS OF HOURS OF FUN!. Great game! Very fun to play, with lots of details. It's truly a masterpiece to the series. The base game didn't have that much of content, but you could really enjoy playing it for weeks! The animations were great, the Sims had life, they were funny! I love this game. The only thing i didn't like was the very limited CAS. If you wanted to create beautiful Sims, they would all look the same. Besides that, The Sims 2 was perfect!. The Sims 2 is the epitome of life simulation. The quality and depth on running a person's lifestyle is superb. There are a ton of careers to choose from, basically unlimited customization with building a house and decorating it, and the extra activities to do in your home and around the town. The amount of customization with making a family and choosing their looks and personality is also limitless. I never ever get tired of this game even after playing for hours and hours over many days. The Sims 2 is meant to be played by anyone, even by not the typical gamer and it's a must play.. I bought every expansion, and every stuff pack. This game is so addicting, and fun and satisfying. It's been six years since the last expansion was released, and The Sims 4 will be coming out sometime this year, but this is the best simming experience so far. The Sims 3 is good, but very glitchy, very frustrating, and even high-end PC's have difficulty running it. These days most computers (and laptops) will run The Sims 2 and all that comes with it without a problem. The Sims 2 just has a nostalgic feeling about **** The Sims 3 is just inferior to The Sims 2. Period.. On older machines (of the time of release ) works good but without expansion packs if you install expansion packs , the game becomes laggy . The game is quite fun and is good , graphics are ok but after some time , the game could bore you. The Sims 2 is very different from its predecessor. New possibilities for creating a Sim, build houses, new music, new phrases in Simlish and much more. I especially liked the creation of a family. Now you can choose the age group from infant and ending pensioner!. In The Sims 1 we had a choice between a child and an adult. And of course, now we can freely change the face, dress, and character traits. For the game entered a system of ""desires and fears."" Not much I liked it but I can not say it is bad. It seems to me that it was underdeveloped because after some time, desires and fears of a repeat. The visuals look much better than The Sims 1 the same applies to music. Finally the world sims and themselves are in 3D. The Sims 2 is the best game in the series.. I truly like that game. I even loved it. But yes time has been passed and now to think there were quite much annoying things in base game. With expansions, The Sims 2 is perfect, but only base game is little bit empty.. But despite that I love The Sims 2, although I play now The Sims 3. This game is amazing, it is truly a masterpiece, maybe not my favorite game but still up there in my top 5, sure by todays standards it does not have the best graphics, but great graphics does not make a game good, its quality gameplay, controls, and replayability that makes a game good imo, in my years of gaming i have spent at least a good 100 to 150 hours playing this, and i still play it every so often, it just has a charm that makes it so appealing to come back to. With all of its humor, wit, great simulation and awesome building tools. to me this is one game that defined the mid 2000's. I've gotta say that this game certainly improved from the first game, I like the first game don't get me wrong, but like I said in my review of that game, The Sims 1 was mainly about controlling Sims lives and for me that got a bit tedious after a while, but this game makes it so much easier. The Sims 2 has a lot of new features that really immerse you, their is so much more content, a new town builder, community lots that you can visit without having to buy expansion packs, a proper Create-a-Sim tool that really lets you create almost any Sim you want, the house building tools have been expanded, it is just so awesome with what you can do on this game. Even controlling The Sims are a lot more fun now, with awesome new graphics and improved 3D view making it much more immersive and fun, The Sims 2 really makes me feel like my Sims are actually there, even though they aren't real. However if I must I do have one criticism, and that is get the expansion packs. This might not sound like a criticism but get the following expansions: Open For Business Nightlife University Bon Voyage Apartment Life Because you need these just to see how much potential this game has. There are other expansions like Pets, which although I like I wouldn't always use and their is also The Sims 2 Seasons Expansion, but I never bought it and to be honest I don't really mind if their isn't weather in the Sims, it would be cool to have, but I don't fully want it. So, since this was for the base game and not including the expansions, I'll give it and 8/10, like I said, get the expansions so that you can fully enjoy this game. Oh and also, don't buy the stuff packs, they are a waste of money.. The Sims 2 is one of the best PC games ever developed. The transition from the original The Sims was huge life stages, social options, richer tools and neighborhoods are just a few. The game could have ended up complicated but it's in fact a very simple and dynamic game that never gets boring.. The game is not good. There are some innovative things regarding the gameplay, but it's still too much similar to the first one. They should release the game with already ALL the expansions, since you pay it a lot. The graphics **** pretty much, compared to the Half Life 2 ones, which was released in the same year.. It's pretty cool. The best Sims game. The expansions add a lot more content. The graphics are actually pretty good for 2004. There are so many things you can do in this game. However, there are a ton of limits. For instance, a skilled player can get two adult sims to fall in love in maybe less than 2 hours of gameplay. However, it takes so damn long to get teens to fall in love. It's possible. The mechanic is in there. It's just insanely difficult. That's just one of the things that bothers me. Another one, this probably pisses me off the most, is in the Pets expansion, you can't control your pets! Why not? They could have made it possible. But they didn't! It's still a great game and can keep anyone entertained for hours, unless you have a very, very short attention span or ADHD or something.. The Sims 2 is a pretty fun game. The Sims 2 alone isn't great, but with expansions, The Sims 2 is a great simulation game that is fun for everyone. I recommend checking it out for those simulation fans.. This game it's really genial because it's crazy as heck and playing it is extremely fun. I didn't try any expansion but I think they add a lot to the gameplay.. This game is amazing, you have loads to do on it such as holidays, shopping trips and you can also buy a pet, the sims grow up really fast so you don't really get chance to do much as children. It is good the way at the bottom of the screen it shows you what the sims want to do.. The Sims 2 is impressive and addictive. Now, that some cool thing are added, this game could be perfect, but It's not. Adding the city exploration is a great idea, but sometimes feels, unrealistic. Compared with The Sims 3's exploration, this game is not better, but It's amazing. The gameplay still stays to It's best, and graphics are great. And making family is improved so much, that you will think that a sim haves a real life personality. Only if the exploration is better, because I'm lazy to wait for frequently loading while playing the game. 91 out of 100. The Sims 2 is the greatest life simulator games. There you can do a lot of things, but not everything. It may be better if you can explore the city without loading, but still it is a masterpiece, and better than The Sims 3.. I LOVE ""THE SIMS 2"" AND ALL EXPASION PACKS!!! THE GAME IS JUST A MASTERPIECE!!! 10/10. Amazing , This game is one of THE BEST P.C Games out. Far more enjoyable then Sims 3. Its simple to play and the options are endless ! Im glad with how fast the sims grow up , if it was any longer ide be forwarding . I actually wished the 'teen' stage was shorter . But eh , What the hell :). The SIms 2 is just one of the best games of all times! Has everything that the other Sims games had before it, and oh-so-much-more. With amazing graphics and sound it really makes one enjoy the game fully. I cannot even count how many hours I've spent playing this game. Highly recommended to both people who just want to build stuff, but also to the people who want to actually control lives and create stories on their own. Excellent game!!. It's safe to say this is one of the best games I've ever played. It hasn't been quite a year yet since I first played it, but it's just so addictive and fun. Yes, it has the old ''put the rubbish out'' and the ""go to the toilet"", but it's much harder than that. And much more fun. It's hilarious to see your Sims get fired from their jobs, get stuck, die, etc. It's much more than just ""create a big happy family"". You can create a group of crims, politicians, group of nerds, hideous Sims, gay and lesbian Sims, torture areas, prisons or you could be racist and have a bunch of Asians in your basement writing novels for you. There's so much creativity, freedom and nice additions which make it (probably) the best Sims game yet. The best thing about the Sims 2 is the cheat codes. Ever want to make your Sims forever happy? Ever wanted to purposely kill a Sim? Ever wanted a huge amount of money? Ever wanted to alter their personality even more? Ever wanted to see what that particular Sim looks like in a swimsuit? Ever wanted to not make your kid/teen go to school? Ever wanted that Sim selectable? There's too many to mention. Best cheat codes ever. The only bone I have to pick with it though are the bugs and glitches in this game. Even though I have the patched up 2008 version, there's still a truckload more. It will crash a lot, you sometimes can't use objects, Sims will freeze and there's nothing you can do about it... And of course a lot more. 9/10 from me.. As a game, this is a casuals-only thing. Why should I care about imaginary people instead of doing the things in game with my own life? However, if you're using hacks to make the bars fill up more and put, say, your best friend and Starscream in the same apartment, then it becomes fun. It's still just something to **** around in, though.","the best game in the sims series, it has small details in it that surpasses the sims 3/4 is this game is from 2004 . the game has many details and is very realistic in terms of ageing just don't like the slow uploads and crashed occasionally . you can see a noticeable difference in graphics right after launch ."
28.Half-Life,"I didn’t enjoy the old and new Doom games I played before because they felt too meaningless. However, Half-Life delivers both an engaging story foundation and cinematic storytelling, while maintaining a perfectly balanced pace. It satisfies the need for action without feeling empty or pointless.. My childhood game, Im glad I started PC gaming with it, Im glad I lived in it time line and Im glad that it exists. One of those games that just make you do nothing but sit in your chair and stare at your screen, asking yourself ""What the hell have I just experienced?"" for five minutes straight.... I don't understand why all these people on the Internet decided that the first Half-Life was well preserved and feels great today. It was supposed to be an incredibly immersive puzzle and platforming shooter. But the game doesn't work out to be any of these. The platforming is poorly done because the movement is too inert and unpredictable, and the platforming sequences are simply crooked and counterintuitive. But the only thing worse is the shooting. Any shooter is guns and guns are made in half-life... pretty mediocre. There is no serious progression, no need for juggling, no interesting ammo management. There is no management of any resources in the game, and throughout the entire walkthrough the player remains in only 2 states: sometimes it's thick, sometimes it's empty. Further - worse. Dumb-nosed opponents, no adequate counterplay to their behavior, and absolutely no combination or integration of them into the level. All the game can do is sneak packs of dummies behind your back, and the only way to get through any fight without serious losses is to stupidly memorize who, when, and in what quantity the game decides to throw at you. It turns out to be such a Hotline Miami, without everything that made it fun - speed and skill-based gameplay. It's cool in general, but to get a similar experience, I prefer Dark Souls II. If you understand what I'm talking about. And the cherry on the cake is the small enemies. Headcrabs and exploding bugs are just different little things that you can't get into, but you can't ignore. All they do is annoy and break the whole gameplay dynamic. This is the basic rule of good shooters - don't make a bunch of small opponents. It's not fun. Like, at all. And this is all a puzzle approach, where you need to ""think an assess the situation"" as the guys from rewievs say. The game always tries to dump a lot of unfair damage on you or even take a oneshot, which is impossible to predict if you are not aware of it in advance. If these are interesting puzzles, then I'd rather watch how the pasta water boils, because it's much more exciting. The plot is quite good, but nothing more. Games with a plot are not new even for 1998. Just for the record, System Shock was released 4 years before Half-Life, and the year before that, Ultima Underworld, with a much more innovative narrative and depth of interaction with the world. That's really where the emerging games of the new generation are, and not the vonnaby efforts of Gabe and the company, inflated by competent marketing. But for some reason they don't have more than 50 Game of the year awards. Graphics and engine? Quake ll was released a year before HL and has already implemented primitive physics and destructibility of objects, color lighting and levels stitched with transitions. Unreal was released in the same year 98 and also demonstrated an unprecedented scale of levels. But I understand why the game became successful at the time - it is well thought out, it has a good story and a cool atmosphere, a well-stitched narrative and openness to interpretations that are interesting to discuss, plus friendliness to mods and fun multiplayer from above. Nowadays, it plays a little better than the failed Daikatana in all respects, and that's only because it's assembled tolerably well, and it doesn't crash without reason, although I've had a couple of crashes and a broken OpenGL render, but it would be stupid to blame a fossil from the Mesozoic for that. And to claim that this is the ""best shooter of all time"" and ""the best game ever made"" will only be people with fatal perceptual distortions who are simply afraid to admit that the main game of their childhood and youth grew old a long time ago, died, was cremated and put on public display in an urn as a relic of the past.. half life is a masterpiece. The game has so much fighting and very good puzles, For the price 0f 10 dollars you can get one of the best games ever made. You must figure everything out by your self. The levels look very good for a 1998 game.. Good for gameplay wise not for graphics wise. Not as good as todays games, best in its years. Still fire tho. It was an incredible game for its time. It's an instant classic and a must-play (especially the remake of Black Mesa).. The start of an era, truly the game that defied game machnaics at the time.. The Half-Life Series is really a story about a man and his crowbar. This platonic love story has been heralded as a classic within the video game community and was a better love story then Twilight …and Half-Life came out years before.Half-Life is an early First Person Shooter, and a Classic to Steam, having been one of the first available games on the platform when Valve still made video games, Half-Life was released in 1998. Story: Our story begins in the morning on the Black Mesa Transit system Tram at the Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico. You play as Dr. Gordon Freeman a graduate of MIT, having earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. Not that you’ll need to know any of that when everything goes sideways and Gordon Freeman is forced to take up crowbar against an invading alien **** you play you’ll encounter some military personnel who have been tasked with cleaning up this disaster, but part of that clean up involves the death of everyone in the Black Mesa Research Facility, especially Gordan Freeman as he has come to realize his true purpose in life: Button-presser, trigger-puller, crowbar-wacker. Gameplay: Half-Life was more tough than I expected. I was all confident walking into this game thinking “Hmmm, yes, yes, I’ve played many First Person Shooters, put me at your normal difficulty coach, I can take it”. I guess by that you can say I got what I deserved for being over **** game holds up very well, even though it was released in the late 90’s. I’m not sure if that’s more a testament to the good simple controls of the game, the simplicity of First Person Shooters, my experience with the later Half-Life 2 games… or some blending of all the above.Nearly all the controls were exactly as expected with standard WASD controls, crouching with CTRL, Interact with E, Flashlight with F, switch between weapons with the scroll wheel or number keys.There were two surprising mechanics I didn’t learn about until the end of the game. First: There’s a “Long Jump” you don’t get access to until the end of the game, where the scientist who gave me the module said “hopefully you’ve taken the Black Mesa Training”. NO I HAVEN’T TAKEN THE TRAINING, I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT GAME I WAS PLAYING! Here’s what you do: While running press crouch and then jump. You can’t beat the game without it. After taking the training course (which I was certain I didn’t need) I learned you can also grab and pull boxes towards you by holding down the interact key and moving backwards. Conclusion: I’ve played and reviewed a bunch of different games from all kinds of different times; but I’ve always enjoyed having the chance to go back and revisit classic games. Other than going back to visit a classic game, or nostalgia for a different time… I don’t know what else you’d be doing by playing **** you’re interested in checking out Half-Life or thinking about buying it, you can always wait for a Steam Sale. I picked my copy up on a 90% off sale. I punch those numbers into my calculator and it makes a smiley face. …There's more to the review, but I'm out of Characters... If you want to know more, please check out my YouTube Video or Steam Review.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. in my personal experience I would give it a 7.7 but I do understand what it did for the genre so I’ll give it a 8.2 with a stamp of approval ( it does hold up even too today standard ) but I highly recommend playing this one before the second which I think had a saying in why I didn’t enjoy this one as much, but that being said it’s still a greatly immersive experience as all half life games pride themselves on if you are a fan of valve and fps action adventure games this is a must play even if you don’t feel inclined to beat it I still recommend getting it as it goes on sell for very cheap at times and you get to experience some truly unique experiences I really felt like I was playing on a window 98 computer again, the only bad thing I really have to say is I just got kind of bored probably because I knew the story already so nothing kept me wanting to know more these are my personal experiences sotake with a grain of salt^^. I was an adolescent when Half-Life came out and was primarily obsessed with iD Software games in particular, namely Doom and Quake, but I was already captivated by the possibilities of expanded narrative and interactivity promised more and more, bit by bit, by games that were coming out. Half-Life was a tremendous leap forward, but in many ways was soon eclipsed at least in its original form by System Shock 2, but as a polished linear experience, Half-Life simply set the standard. My memories of playing the game for the first time are truly burned in, as I got the game for Christmas in 1998 and was so absorbed in it that a week later I barely noticed the fireworks of New Year's Eve brought in 1999. As everyone notes now in particular, the final sections of the game are lamentable in the break in pace and tension leading up to it. Still, the rest of the game is so genuinely, literally iconic that I simply can't object to it too much.. Delivers an immersive sci-fi experience with innovative gameplay and storytelling. The seamless transition between combat, puzzles, and narrative keeps players hooked. Its atmosphere, intelligent AI, and gripping plot make it a timeless classic.. absolute masterpiece please pay for this game its worth the money (sorry for the bad english). This game is old but amazing. It has a simple but great story. Amazing gameplay. And the pacing keeps it intriguing. 10/10. It may have since been surpassed by it’s sequel, but back in the late 90’s Half-Life was a genre defining first person shooter and sits amongst the very best games of it’s generation.. Still a very enjoyable game despite it's age. A must-play for any PC gamer.. Half Life establishes the connection of scientific moment with interdimensional resonance of supernatural intelligence. Planning, safety, and aim will be necessary to survive the situation within Half Life. Expect to interface with scientists, dimensional beings, and military personnel in this experience of foreshadowed science fiction or possibly a shared interdimensional disclosed message. Auto-aim is sometimes unpredictable. Expect some situations of awkwardly precise maneuvering and jumping to advance through some sections. Some of the sounds and voices are humorous but muffled. A few parts may be slightly challenging if unprepared. Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to future Half Life continuations.. Not as good as Half life 2 but still a good game, the mechanics were revolutionary, the story was alright, and the graphics were okay for the time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. its a pretty fun game (which only changed the game industry for basically, forever). Even after 26+ years Half life feels like a breath of fresh air, it was so ahead of it's time it's actually crazy, and getting it for free was an absolute blessing, one of the most fun fps I have ever played. Great game, but gets overshadowed by half life 2. Still a great game that is definitely worth checking out.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I still can't forget my first experience with the heavy shotgun. The support of my childhood. god. Half-Life is one of the best games in the world. The design is perfect for the year it was made and the multiplayer servers are still full 26 years later. Half-Life's map design, storyline, weapon variety can really be praised. Many things we see today are based on Half-Life. For example; Garry's Mod Counter Strike - Cavalry Gaming. Again with the classic game, story gameplay and the timeline in this game is just something else back in the 2000's when i first hear this game i dont like it it was boring. Then my friend bought this game and we start playing oh my this game is good.. Gordon Freeman's first adventure is really great. A lot of shooting, weapons to use. Interesting chapters and the whole plot is really interesting. In addition to killing aliens, we have to kill H.E.C.U and destroy their troops and difficult Black Ops. A absolute must play for any gamer. Not only is it a major part of gaming history but it remains a fun game to play that stands the of time.. I tried it 2 months ago and its now one of my favorite games, seriously this game is a masterpiece and i wish i could give it an 11/10. spectacular game even tho it does not age well with the **** stuff like having to crouch jump in a akward way to not get blown to bits in some levels. Amazing Game for fps shooter starters and perfect conecction to servers in the game. A Classic an exciting game. Well made story, outstanding gameplay, and funny videos made by it's community. Where would I be without the outstanding Half-Life?. A really damn good video game that blends boomer shooter mechanics with narrative gameplay. A masterpiece.. Must play for FPS lovers. Great story, great enemy AI, excellent level build and overall one of the greatest games out there.. An instant classic that influenced many games which came after it. A replay to celebrate the 25th anniversary.. This game changed the game industry forever. This is a must play for anyone that plays video games.. I'm sorry to be the bearer of the bad news but Half Life hasn't aged well. Over two decades ago Goldsource may have been astonishing, although now game feels genuinly clunky. However the first half of it certainly can be enjoyable, can't say that about the second half. Score is increased, as it was indeed revolutionary.. An important and influential FPS that changed the landscape of the genre forever. And it is a masterpiece.. Honestly I didn't really know what was going on in this game but I really loved the movement mechanics and play style. the game is unique with its range of human and alien like enemies which makes it fun. One of the best FPS videogames that innovated all the way to his humble beginning's. Half-Life is truly a game every passionate gamer needs to at least play once in their lifes.. Simply Half Life, one of the best games in history. Its mystery makes everything even more special, not to mention its sensational campaign.. i dont like the jumpscares. they are scary in a funny game :( this isnt lethal komepny. Great game, just not for me. Feels like the story is a bit too long for my tastes and the puzzles are a tiny bit unintuitive. I dislike it but I'm rating it objectively for what it's worth.. Holy crap this game is ahead of its time, the fact that this game was made in 1998 is just insane to me. That's it, play the **** game.. If you were like me and on the fence, play this game! I experienced this game 25 years late so can't quite appreciate the historical significance and impact of the OG Half-Life. But still I was fairly surprised how well it still stands up on its own. The gunplay and atmosphere are great, story is way more compelling than I had anticipated, fun level design, and better AI than a majority of modern games. Also fairly challenging game if you try to avoid save scumming - with a couple of particular levels in mind ;). Maybe it was great when it came out, but it just feels like a Doom rip off now. This game was my first FPS experience in childhood. I can still remember those feelings when I was a child playing this game on my old PC. It's still my favorite game; sometimes I download it again on Steam and try to relive some nostalgia.. Anything and everything that has been said about Half Life and its influence on video games in general, as well as the FPS genre and narratives in games has already been said, printed, shared, spoken, and said again to such an extent that anyone who knows anything about games will have the mere name stapled to the interior of their skull. My personal take, however, is much of the same. It's good. Quite simply put. There are, however, spots that attract the ire of even the most die-hard fans, such as Residue Processing, Surface Tension, and Xen. I personally don't mind Residue Processing, I find Surface Tension to be tolerable (with ungodly amounts of quicksaves and loads), and Xen is Xen. It's a good game if you have an analytical eye and a good sense of retrospect when it comes to the history of games. If you don't, well, at least you have the Tau Cannon.. engish version:my experience in the game was incredible I loved the game I recommend it the game is immersive you feel in the shoes of the protagonist especially that he doesn't speak it makes you imagine how the character the maps are real it seems real xen or zen is a beautiful place and it looks peaceful and it should be peaceful this is a summary of what I think there is more but the text is too big so that's it pt version:minha experiência no jogo foi incrível eu amei o jogo eu recomendo ele o jogo é imersivo voce se sente na pele do protragonista especialmente que ele não fala isso faz como se voce imagine como o personagem os mapas são reais parece reais o xen ou zen é um lugar lindo e parece pacifico e deve ser pacifico isso é um resumo do que eu acho tem mais mas ta muito grande o texto então é isso. I believe it took the FPS game in a worse direction. Xen is boring. It's still a good shooter.. I suppose? Single player isn't that special. Multiplayer on Crossfire would still be pretty fun. Shame it didn't have bot support.. Half-Life, released in 1998, was a revolutionary game for its time. It opened a new era in the genre of first-person shooters and offered players a fascinating story, exciting gameplay mechanics and a unique **** story of Half-Life begins with the arrival of the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, at the secret scientific facility Black Mesa. The player has to go through various levels, fighting aggressive creatures and solving various puzzles. It is quite interesting how the events unfold and what will be the end of the **** for gameplay, Half-Life offers intuitive controls and a variety of weapons that add variety to combat situations. Most of the enemies in the game are well animated and pose a real threat to the player. Plus, the developers introduce some unexpected twists in the game to keep you interested.However, despite all its advantages, Half-Life has its drawbacks. One of them is the outdated graphics, which can certainly put some players off if they are used to modern games with stunning visuals. Also, the game has quite a high difficulty, especially for beginners.Overall, I would rate Half-Life 1998 a 7 out of 10. It represents an important part of video game history and made a huge contribution to the first-person shooter genre. However, it has some flaws that may affect the satisfaction of the game for certain audiences. If you are a fan of classic shooters, Half-Life is worth a try to appreciate its contribution to the gaming industry.. I feel like the controls are the main reason why it ages, not as good as people remember. I was persuaded to play that game because it's story still is great even for today's standards, but I was ready for old graphic, but not for badly aged controls.. Half-Life is an amazing classic experience that I would recommend anyone to try out. There is so much good about the Half-Life game. The mechanics, challenges, and puzzles you encounter throughout the game keep you engaged, entertained, and immersed in the world of Black Messa. The visuals, while of course not realistic, are still pleasing and nice in spite of such. If there HAD to be something to criticise about the game, some of the movement controls (especially jumping) can take a short while to get used to. But with time you'll be able to grasp it. There are also ""some"" visual bugs I encountered but they were extremely insignificant and depending on how you're playing, you may not even encounter them at all. So overall, Half-Life is an iconic, enjoyable, engaging, entertaining, and fascinating game that I would recommend nearly everyone to play. If there was a game that I would confidentially give a 10/10, this would be one of them.. The first part of this game feels like a 9.5, then the awful jumping and climbing come [jumping on those hanging boxes killed me more than Fromsoftware bosses] with a whole host of other isnta-death things that make you need to save every 5 seconds. This game has alot of great ideas, but is very very cheap with his liberal use of insta-kills. Expect the basic military guys to either be easy or instakill, you never know.. Its the most clasical game of Pc whitouth counting wolfestein and doom but its a great heeat over the videogamee industry. The classic and timeless masterpiece from Valve, Half-Life delivers a phenomenal first-person shooter campaign that combines excellent combat and environmental puzzles with a mysterious and fascinating world, delivering scripted cinematics and abstract storytelling to maintain pacing throughout. While the graphics may seem dated by current standards, the sound design remains excellent, and the innovative use of physics and gameplay elements such as teleportation display true genius in Valve's game design. The vast array of unique weapons and large-scale combat encounters keep Half-Life tense and exciting when resources become scarce. While some chapters contain frustrating sections or dated gameplay elements, Half-Life remains a must-play and its notable impact on gaming as a whole cannot be understated.. I have learned something while playing Half-Life, I don't like First Person Shooters. As much as I like Metroid Prime and shooters like Resident Evil 4, there is just something about Half-Life's platforming and shooting that doesn't resonate with me nearly as well. The story is interesting for a bit, but just kinda ends up going from horror themed adventure to action adventure that, while realistic, didn't really pull me in. I will agree that I probably just **** at this game, but there is a number of difficulty spikes throughout and a lot of the puzzles can feel very obtuse and make you wonder if you're going the right way. More often than not I was either getting killed a lot for the rapid gunfire from enemies or from platforming around trying to figure out where to go to next, sometimes both. A lot of the soundtrack just tended to blend into sound effects, and I had to actually look up to make sure the game indeed had a soundtrack, and while it is there, I'd argue it's not very remember-able. Add all this together with a very annoying final boss fight and outdated graphics really makes me wonder how anyone saw this game as a classic. I'll agree that a lot of the charm is lost through time, but largely I feel very apathetic with my time with Half-Life.. one of the best fps games to release sure it doesnt have good graphics and is old but that doesnt stop it from being amazing. Love the game, got it for free thanks to the 25th anniversary. The graphics, even though old, have their own beauty and the story is amazing.. This game is a masterpiece. I love the combat system and its gameplay is really good.. amazing game with funny monsters and weapons amazing voice acting would play again with mod. Really good game but reason i gave it 10/10 cuz its now free but only today and tomorrow and also happy 25th anniversary. Half-Life sadly has no baby stealing although it does have quite good gameplay... although i've never played it due it its 10$ price tag on steam and the fact that im poor as ****, but i have seen gameplay and non of it included baby stealing.. Even in 2023 you can appreciate how good and revolutionary this game has been. Half life is the same for video games, what was addition of colour for black-and-white television.. the world feels really real for such an old gameplay the story is good but other then gman not very unique. the gameplay can be fun but a lot of the time very frustrating. Half-Life is a testament to how far passion, detail, and expertly crafted atmosphere and game design can get you. Valve knocked it out of the park with this one. The atmosphere is tense, its awesome, and its such a late 90's product. The gunplay still holds up to an extent, the AI is still remarkably impressive for 1998 standards, and there is an insane level of detail in all the smallest places. The game trips up in terms of level design in the fourth quarter, but it doesn't last long and honestly the cool fights and everything else makes up for it. Strong reccomend. Play Half-Life and experience what brought a lot of modern shooter games to fruition.. Graphics: 6/10; Storyline: 5/10; Gameplay: 7/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 7/10. great gameplay, great enemys, great story ,good weapons and bad final **** you want to see what hapened in other parts of Black Mesa i recomend playng Oposing force and Blue Shift.. best game ever also headcrab for cristmas. This gameThis game is very good even in our times! Interesting plot, nostalgic graphics and sounds, and so on... A very imbic game! 10/10. The game that changed the gaming industry. We can talk about it endlessly, but still it's the best computer game I have ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Classic masterpiece.. Second best FPS game (first one is HL2).. I understand why this game has so acknowledgment. It cames out in 1998 and, for the time it was released, it had interesting mechanincs and amazing storytelling that don't use cutscenes. In other words: it's a pioneer videogame. Despite this... I don't feel like this game is enjoyable in 2023 knowing that nowadays there are lots of videogames that have followed this formula and improved it in their respective genres. Mechanics, story and world design feels really oddy and old, and this is how it has to be for agame released 25 years ago.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Half-Life, released in 1998, stands as a monumental achievement in the history of video games, a true masterpiece that forever altered the landscape of the medium. Valve's groundbreaking first-person shooter not only delivered a thrilling and immersive gaming experience but also introduced innovative storytelling techniques that have since become industry standards. From the moment players step into the shoes of the silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, it's clear that Half-Life is something extraordinary. The game's opening sequence, set within the Black Mesa Research Facility, masterfully immerses players in its detailed and believable world. The level design is exceptional, offering a perfect balance of action, exploration, and environmental storytelling. Half-Life's gameplay was revolutionary in its time and remains incredibly engaging to this day. The introduction of a continuous, seamless narrative-driven experience, with no cutscenes or loading screens, was groundbreaking. The immersive first-person perspective places players directly into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, enhancing the sense of agency and presence. The game's arsenal of weapons is iconic, with each firearm offering a unique feel and strategic advantage. The memorable enemy design, from the parasitic Headcrabs to the imposing Vortigaunts, adds variety to combat encounters. The introduction of the crowbar as a signature melee weapon is a stroke of genius, becoming an instant classic in gaming history. One of Half-Life's standout features is its storytelling. Instead of relying on traditional cutscenes, the game presents its narrative through in-game events and environmental cues. Players learn about the unfolding crisis at Black Mesa by observing the actions of other characters and listening to their conversations, creating a deep sense of immersion and connection to the world. Half-Life's puzzles are both clever and integrated seamlessly into the gameplay. They challenge players to think critically and use the tools at their disposal to progress, adding a layer of intellectual engagement to the experience. The game's level of detail and environmental storytelling is astonishing, with every area of Black Mesa feeling like a real, lived-in space. The ambiance, sound design, and music all contribute to a haunting and immersive atmosphere. Despite being released over two decades ago, Half-Life's graphics have aged gracefully, thanks in part to its art style. The Source engine's facial animations were groundbreaking at the time and added depth to character interactions. In conclusion, Half-Life is a timeless masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the world of video games. Its innovative gameplay, seamless narrative, and immersive world-building set new standards for the medium. It remains an essential experience for gamers and a testament to the power of interactive storytelling.. the game is cool and fun.. Half-Life is a great game. It keeps you into the FPS mindset with lots of action and ties in realistic puzzles that keep you sharp and on your toes.. THIS game has Extraordinary Graphics,Very Beautiful Gameplay,Movie like Sequences, and Awesome Sound! I hope people who play this game will last a life time in there hearts because this game still ROCKs all others ever made for the PC Valve i love your Work! please keep kickin ass on the best game series you have made in the Years and in the years to come!. this is better than 2 everyone like this because of popular cultuer but i play the game and that was boring mostly people like bc this is childhood game i guess. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I haven't finished Half-life 1. But the story has been spoiled to me, so I think I can give a review on it. I'm currently on Chapter 10 and I love this game. If you don't, then at least give the game a higher number than 0. Just make sure HD models are off. The HD models **** and take away the classic look. Luckily you can easily turn these off,. This game has better story telling than most modern games. Half-Life has more life than Call Of Duty and Battlefield combined. Truly one of THE BEST FPS GAMES ON THE MARKET.. I'm not fan of shooter games but this game is awesome... Great history, great immersion, very good shooter. The options for multiplayer games made the title infinite. ""Half-Life,"" the original entry in the franchise, is often considered a landmark game in the first-person shooter genre. Its impact on gaming history, innovation, and lasting influence contribute to its reputation as a 9 out of 10 title. Here's why: While ""Half-Life"" is praised for its contributions to the gaming industry, some players might not rate it a perfect 10 due to potential dated graphics and technical limitations compared to modern games. However, its innovative gameplay mechanics, narrative presentation, and lasting legacy easily justify a 9/10 rating.. A standard of the industry, especially for the FPS genre. Who thinks they could released a game like this in 1997, 1998 lol. So many things that make Half-Life is one of the greatest games of all time, And even better, this game has many mods, some of them are iconi","the game was supposed to be an incredibly immersive puzzle and platforming shooter . the platforming is poorly done because the movement is too inert and unpredictable, and the platforming sequences are simply crooked and counterintuitive . the only thing worse is the shooting ."
280.Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers,"Very good story. This is the masterpiece of Final Fantasy. It will be a piece that will go down in history.. Best expansion ever, say no more. We will never forget about you Emet, my favorite character in FFXIV.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best story experience of all time. Sometimes you can catch lightning in a bottle it seems.. giving it a 10 bc it’s my favorite still after two expansions. emet selchs character has motivated me as a person to bear the legacies of the long fallen.. Simply one of the best written RPGs ever made. This is also the xpac that introduced npcs helping with story content, and some of the best large scale events to date in the ishgardian restoration and bozja.. The golden age of FFXIV. It takes everything good about the writing, story, music and improves it tenfold. I honestly cannot think up any negatives, only positives. By far the best expansion.. FFXIV is good, and in shadowbringers you finally get answers and the story just grabs a hold of you, leaving you aching to get to play Endwalker. So worth it, as a story alone one of the best games I've experienced.. The turning point in a massive franchise that marks when things get really good. Shadowbringers takes some twists and turns to bring you a fresh adventure and managing to lose some of the shackles that brought the previous expansions down.. There's not a lot to say that other's haven't. It's genuinely a wonderful start to the end that is Endwalker. It does a great job of reaching back to 2.0 and even the trailer for 2.0. Ishikawa has done an amazing job here of not just starting to find a way to make old elements relevant, but also character development and making you care about all of these Scions who have come and gone from your player character's life over the years.. The first expansion they got a different main writer, and had some balls to get some dark fantasy stuff going to feel like I’m fighting for something.. A phenomenal expansion that captures everything an MMO should be, especially a Final Fantasy one. Story that can't be matched, characters that grow and climax in their story arcs, music that took a gigantic step forward and will forever be in my personal playlist (and made me buy the soundtrack in appreciation) and above all, some of the best content and mixture of content in this game's now 11 year lifespan. I've seen people that don't enjoy video games enjoy this MMO, and I've seen people that never cared for FF fall in love with the series thanks to this one. You will not regret picking this game up, especially with the very generous free trial that for some reason doesn't allow you to make parties?. Awesome expansion, really got the story moving and introduced more mysteries that need answers.. The storytelling for this expansion was absolutely top notch. It had everything you could want. You had drama, romance, action, etc. The writers managed to take a nuanced approach to the whole darkness versus light subject, setting up a scenario where both Hydaelyn and Zodiark were right AND wrong.. This company steals from **** you pay for a subscription and then cancel, they will take your money the next month even though you cancelled. They took my money and then refused to give it back. I was a loyal customer of theirs for many decades, occasionally buying games and services but after this experience, I will never buy another game or service from Square Enix ever again!. Shadowbringers is where you truly get a massive pick up in story. This expansion was truly great, plenty of laughs and crying in this. Story is solid, raids are stunning and fun, crossover with Nier: Automata was perfection. If I could replay this with no memory I would easily.. All the marks were hit with this expansion, XIV has had it's shares of ups and downs with content and I must say it's been a rollercoaster trying to figure out where much of my opinions lie when it comes to each featured expansion. Shadowbringers however I can't bring myself to fault, it brought us the new continent within one of the Reflections, a highly developed landmass telling it's own story with it's own unique cast. Harping on tropes without relying so heavily on them as to stifle the creativity of the story itself. Shadowbringers was perhaps the best expansion of XIV to date, only just ahead of Stormblood as my personal favorite. From sympathetic, fleshed out and well-concluded villains to satisfying, sentimental and meaningful interactions with companions, XIV Shadowbringers holds the best of all the game has to offer within it's story. The expansion doesn't overstay it's welcome, maintaining pacing and enjoyment throughout; Shadowbringers brought us Bozja, Zadnor, some of the best high end content we've seen to date all while managing to deliver some amazing casual and story content to boot. This is the definitive XIV expansion to date. My only gripe is what it comes to mean when set against the other expansions, taking place in a realm outside of our own, the story felt isolated away from our experiences and as such the world of Norvrandt doesn't evolve with the newly passing expansions as we do.. One of the best stories ever toid in an MMO, with so many multifaceted and unique characters culminating in a storyline that you'll likely never forget that could stand on its own entirely as a great final fantasy game.. Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers is a masterpiece of an RPG that manages to tell an emotional & heartfelt story and has some great gameplay & encounter design along the way. It still bears a few of FFXIV's pacing problems, but it's still come a long way since A Realm Reborn. The music of this expansion is also superb! 10/10. “Remember… Remember us… Remember that we once lived.”. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this fourteenth game in the series. this expansion is breathtaking!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An MMO expansion is not just its story. Yes, the 5.0 MSQ storyline is great. Yes, the 5.1 through 5.3 storyline is overall good. However, the rest of the expansion was noticeably lacking compared to prior expansions. We've gone from getting 3 dungeons per patch, to 2, to just getting one. Instead of getting 4 grind zones, we instead only get 2. No Hildibrand questline. We went from getting dozens of job questlines, to only 4 role questlines and all of them are meh, not even scratching ""decent"". Instead of getting 3 jobs, we got 2. We get fewer new armor sets and more recolors of old stuff we already got. There is a noticeable lack in the amount of new music produced for ShB, with one trial boss reusing the generic dungeon boss theme, the 5.3 trial boss not even getting a second theme for his second phase, no new dungeon boss theme for 5.4 and 5.5 dungeons, and Bozja pretty much just reusing FF12's ost.. I got into FF14 right before this expansion came out. This review is late, but I didn't think to talk about it here til now. The story from the base game to the expansion before this was fascinating. There were several highs and a few lows throughout my blast through ARR, HW, and Stormblood. When this game came out I started a bit burnt out, but once I started getting into the main story quests (MSQ) I got a HUGE second wind. I beat the MSQ in a few weeks, not because it was short, but because I couldn't stop playing. Music - some songs are decent, but the main song for my playthrough was called ""High Treason."" Such a powerful musical movement that I listen to when I'm not playing the game, even to this day. There are lots of songs like this within the game that just captivate me. Gameplay - I started the new Tank class, Gunbreaker, when it released and I had a lot of fun getting to learn new rotations and play through the class quest. The dungeons and bosses were a lot of fun to play through and the overall experience of the game was my favorite for an MMO at the time. Story and Characters - This is where the meat of the playthrough occurred. The main villain is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. Only other ones that come to mind at this level are from playstation 1 games I played back in the early 2000's that continue to live with me today (Ghaleon from Lunar 1 and 2 really come to mind). This story is also an amazing bridge to Endwalker. Overall - This game is a love letter to fantasy and mmo players. Story is rich with content, characters are phenomenal, and the experience within the community is something I will treasure in my gaming life. You'll notice a trend with FF14 players talking about how important it is to experience the story (and I'll mention please feel free to experience the game the way YOU want to). If you're someone who enjoys the elements I discussed above, take the time to enjoy the journey. I remember into a month of this game existing, IGN's FB group had a lot of people saying this should be game of the year, and it was mine and many other's game of the year. Be safe and be sure to give this game a shot!. Amazing expansion. Has the best areas, cities, characters, story and dungeons of the game imo. I think Stormblood wins on trials by a tiny bit. Shadowbringers and FFXIV in general is one of the best experiences in gaming.. Probably one the best expansions from the game, i'm conflicted if i liked it more than endwalker or not as this point. but i loved everything about this expansion. The story for this expansion is as great as everyone says. On par with any of the great RPGs available today, owing to the dedication of the whole FFXIV team. Each named side characters introduced are well fleshed out and not throwaways for the sake of the story. The music for each zone and dungeons are fitting and a joy to listen to even at many repetitions. As for the looks of the zone, most of them are improvements to previous content partially owing to the use of larger range of colours. A minor gripe storywise for me is that sometimes, even when our character is at a position to do something to resolve a situation to a happier end, they just watch instead for the sake of the story. For example, our character may be well in position physically to intercept an enemy to rescue someone but instead just looks on in shock, leading to a death that could have been avoidable. I think it would add more believability if, for example, our character was on the other side of a chasm as he looks on, but that is not the case on some NPC deaths. There were also changes to all classes. I can only speak of my experience playing as a Dark Knight, however. The new DRK changes are pretty straightforward and removes the spammy element. The only underwhelming skill I have encountered is the final skill which is to summon a shadowy figure to unleash some damage using DRK skills. My problem is, its just that. Its only function is to be used on cooldown as a damage increase with no interaction with the player. I was expecting it copy what the player would do, and so summoning it must needs preparation to deal the most damage, which sadly is not the case. Some new content available is more of the same as previous expansions. A respectable amount of dungeons each with a unqiue aesthetic and atmosphere, and three trials with an additional extreme modes for two of the three, all of which are suitably challenging. However, FATES in the new zones have been revised and now gives incentives to players to acutally do them for more than just for experience by adding a rank system and currency to it. Earned currency can be spent on various rewards ranging from mount speed increase of the zone, materials to chocobo bardings. You will have a rank for each zone which determines what items can be bought from the Gem Traders, which are the vendors for the FATE rewards. Rank goes up to 3 with the better rewards unclokced for purchase at rank 2 and 3. Levelling to max will take a mix of main scenario quests, dungeons, and other activities such as FATEs. More on the dungeons, Shadowbringers also introduces the TRUST sytem, which now allows our characters to do dungeons with certain NPCs that are integral to the story. This feature boosted my immersion to the story immensely as you can now take your time on the dungeons to look at every detail you desire without the pressure of potentially wasting other players' time. The NPCs also engage in colourful banter, which makes it all the more immersive. Additionally, they are helpful in learning the dungeon boss mechanics as they are coded to do them properly. The only downside would be that the TRUST NPCs will have potentially a lower damage output compared to players. Potentially. However, after completing the story, the NPC levels will drop and will require you to level them up by taking them to dungeons. They acquire a set experience per run and will require multiple runs to level up, but according to some players, your experience gain will outpace theirs, which in my opinion, is a problem.. What a phenomenal expansion. Story takes a while to pick up and become interesting but since it went on a darker tone and cutscenes are pretty great you don't mind as much as in Stormblood. Once it does pick up its a blast until the end.. easy 10/10 best mmo - good story and good savage fights. only thing lacking is good pvp. This game is juste amazing. The story is probably one of the best we ever had in FF games. The new map is also amazing. Can't tell more without spoil but this game is for sure one of the best MMO and one of the best final fantasy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. MSQ very same-y, more voice acting and interesting cut scenes than previous expansions, still far too many unvoiced poorly animated cut scenes though. Some nice introductions, like the trust system which makes the MSQ dungeons much more engaging, lots of solo trials also as part of the MSQ... Overall the MSQ is still below par unfortunately but it's an improvement. Raids offer an acceptable level of difficult which makes them accessible to the vast amount of players, but could do with a more difficult version of savages/ultimates to extend the amount of content in the game for PvM players.. Great story and great music. Definitely worth the money and so worth playing!. This expansion cemented my love for this amazing MMO. Fantastic story telling, memorable zones and characters. I was sad to leave it when Endwalker was announced. Super great expansion!. Perfect expansion. If only devs could muster up some courage and finally kill some major npc. The only thing this story lacks is some stakes, actual risks.. Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers is one of the best video game experiences, period. The story of the game thus far has slowly been rising in quality, but in this expansion, the growth was exponential—so much so that it has become one of the best video game narratives I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The foreboding tone, the themes of indolence and finality, and the overall ""feel"" were very consistent and executed to nigh-perfection. Supporting this narrative was a cast of characters that felt more real and relatable than any before, with the returning Scions truly feeling like a group of companions and friends one can rely on. It must be said that no few tears were shed in some scenes and character moments. Gameplay-wise, it is more of the same which is not a bad thing; in fact, some dungeons and trials still stand out as fun and interesting. Shadowbringers was the expansion wherein I finally told myself, ""That FFXIV might be among the best JRPGs I have ever had the joy playing"".. It's kinda ironic that this 2019 Final Fantasy Fourteen Shadowbringers is much better than 2013/2018-? Grand Theft Auto+Red Dead Online not to mention remind me to 2020 Hades PC too.. This is the first time I play FFXIV in general, as a long time (over 8 years) WoW player. I simply cannot explain how good this game actually is. From the story, to the zones, to the system, to actually having meaningful choices. It's sooo good. If you're looking for a MMORPG/RPGMMO, this is the game for you, it does not waste your time, it respects it, this is one of the many things that the game does right.. If you don’t like the Trial / “Realm Reborn” take my word, you won’t like any of it… New players hope you are ready for 200+ hours of MSQ which is mainly reading text. I fell for the recent hype. To all the people who says “it gets better” seriously, what is wrong with you? This constant insincerity is what kept me going. IT DOESN’T GET BETTER (a least to the point it serves as a valid argument). I just finished Shadowbringers 5.5 MSQ, and let me tell you, this is an “interactive Novel” more than it is a video game. Sure with each expansion the game (novel) gets a little better, in terms of graphics, animations, storytelling, but the CORE of the game doesn’t change, it is still this outdated mmorpg tab targeting, with its main FOCUS on MSQ, which is basically walls of text. Your quests in order of occurrences is: talk, travel, click objects, kill NPCs, do dungeons/trials/story instances. They added one different mechanic in Stormblood lol, which is to “click stuff in FPS mode”. I can count the EPIC moments of the story in one hand! 3 of them were in Havensward and 2 in Shadowbringers (forget RR and SB). The main focus of this game is the MSQ, but the problem is; the MSQ is 90% fluff pointless writing and storytelling, you could cut out 80% of this writing and still get a concise accurate description of the story, albeit just more on point. What Square Enix is doing is inflating game time content with more and more text and sloppy animation screens, which I’m not kidding stretches the MSQ than it really needs to be. I’m not even talking about important background build up, I’m talking about content you won’t even remember because it served no purpose in the grand scheme of things. (Anything you wont remember a month from now isn't worth reading about). Because the MSQ is mainly storytelling, and single player orientated, why not just play better solo video games that are much, much better technically advanced in gameplay, like GTA 5, Witcher 3, red redemption 2, and hundreds of others titles? There were times I was so desperate to just “play” the game, because there is so few dungeons/trials and killing quests in-between all the walls of text. One could always pay a story skip potion, but the fact is MSQ is the focus of this game, the endgame is extra stuff. Players and Square have both said that MSQ is the focus of the game, and the more casual player base. WoW = focuses on repeatable endgame content after a short introductory (and often crap) storyline. FF14 = 200 hours of MSQ (at minimum) at which point you can cycle through some endgame content and get max ilvl gear fairly easily. But levelling others job/crafts, which has its own questlines seems be one of the most popular things to do. I won’t be buying Endwalker. People who enjoy reading fluff for hundreds of hours to see one good cutscene here and there, you do that, enjoy! I’ll watch it in a recap YouTube video and do more productive things with my life than read FLUFF MSQ content, which is intentionally used to extend game play time. “You can always make more money, but you can’t make more time” think about if you’re really enjoying that 200 hours or if you’re only enjoy small amounts of it. Whilst the epic moments were epic, the pain of going through so much unfun content to see it was not worth it. The balance is definitely not there. Even most fans think the post RR quests are so bad, yet square hasnt fixed it by just removing it for new players short narration cutscene to bring players up to date for havensward. (And i heard it was even worse, oh dear God).. In 2021 I started playing from ARR to Shadowbringers and I am blown away that a 10/10 game could get better. 100/10 easily. Having played FFXIV actively for two years now, I can honestly say it is one of the best video game experiences I have had the pleasure of playing. Shadowbringers is the highlight of the journey, bringing a story that made me cry more times than every other game combined. If you enjoy a good fantasy story, you can't go wrong with Final Fantasy XIV. Every expansion is like a new book or a season of a fantasy series, and Shadowbringers is where the game rewards you for the investment of getting so far.. Played Lineage 2, World of Warcraft, was in need of a new MMORPG and tried FF. The walls of text, the bad UI and the super boring tutorial just didn't do for me.. The Shadowbringers expansion is the pinnacle in Final Fantasy series, while the early game can turn some people a way but the overall gameplay is only getting better and better over time.. Great story, great raids and dungeons, great content. The best online game experience out there. EDIT: For quite some time I would have rated it 10/10 BUT: Square simply can't make content work. The new resistance weapons are a senseless grind (completing raids over and over) and require you to play bozja - which for itself isnt bad BUT: Players only join and ask for the big event and dont play the zone whatsoever, the event has a player cap which locks unlucky players out... The new content delivered during the current update and the current patches is nothing but a senseless grind in content, which square tries to make interesting again, but turnes out to be a total catastrophe and not fun in the slightest. Raids and Trials (even extreme, savage and ultimate) are far to easy. The ignorance on squares side to bring features to the game, the biggest part of the playerbase would like to see shows their low appreciation for their customers in a perfect way. The only thing that keeps me playing are friends that still play, the content simply cant entertain me anymore.. The story continues and builds on one started almost a decade ago, and it is amazing. Fantastic game with so much care put into it, beautiful for its age, god tier music, the most chill and friendly community I've ever seen. This is the best mmo of all time, and this is their best xpac yet. Can't wait to see the conclusion of the story arc that started with 1.0 to end in Endwalker, and definitely can't wait to see what the next arc will be.. I have well over 1,000 hours in this fantastic MMO. It is my favorite Final Fantasy story as well as my favorite MMO of all time. Shadowbringers is straight fire baby! Best expansion by far! I don't know how Endwalker will top it, but I believe in the Dev team. 10/10 would recommend.. Amazing story. Best in the final fantasy franchise. Characters are amazing and the main villian is the best character I have ever seen in a game. Music is the outstanding and the areas are beautiful. Masterpiece.. Oh good God help me! This game is endless dialogue from some guy you'll never see again that was going from Point-A to Point-B and then lost his stuff, and then you get it, and then he's gone forever, and then you hand it in with more pointless dialogue about it, and then you have to talk to him again for his new quest, and his quest is to go talk to someone else about the most boring inconsequential **** you've ever heard, AND THIS IS THE MAIN **** QUEST! I feel like I'm gonna have a stroke or mental disability if I play this any longer, everyone says it's great after the first 60 hours, how anyone got through those first 60 is beyond me, and if there's better fish in the sea, swim with them. It's too bad, because the combat system is very smooth and has potential. And in case you're wondering, all the side quests are go kill 3 monsters etc.. best, amazing story gameplay and everything , nothing even close to ff14, not even WOW. One of the most unique and delightful rpgs of all history, not just mmos. This is the only rpg on the market where you can pick up for 300 hours and feel like it’s one giant story despite being segmented expansion packs because even in the 300th hour are themes and clues from the first expansion become major plot points.. This game just keeps getting better and better. I cannot wait for the new classes of the next expansion and the continuation of this epic saga.. Hello, I'm absolutly not a paid corporate shill and this is my unbiased Review for SHADOWBRINGERS SHADOWBRINGERS is a masterpiece of video game narrative. Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never ""fun"". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, SHADOWBRINGERS is Schindler's List. And just like that film, there were times when I wasn't sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful. With moments you NEVER find in video games. But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you'll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air. That's saying a lot. I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget SHADOWBRINGERS is a game that will change you. In short, SHADOWBRINGERS put me through hell. I did not enjoy it. I wasn't supposed to. I was affected by it. Like no game before. I am in awe of it. I am recovering from it.. This expansion had me crying my eyes out. Everything from the story, characters, music, dialogue, everything is brilliant. The only bad thing about this expansion, is that it set the bar so high that I don't think it's possible for the next expansion to be as good as this one.. First of all I wanna say I'm a guy who love play everytime of game online or not and I played a lot of mmorpg over the years... that said, I feel cursed for never playing final fantasy XIV... Shadowbringer is for me the best game I've ever played, just brilliant. It had been a long time since I had seen something so puzzling and magnificent. If you came here looking to know if it's worth playing. YEA! But if you are going to start in FFXIV play without haste, forget that the game is a mmorpg, enjoy the story as if it were an offline game and you will not be disappointed. The greatest MMO expansion ever made by a long shot. It's going to be a tough, if not impossible, task for Yoshi and his crew to top this one. The story ramped into something truly beautiful and amazing with a main villain that was relatable and charismatic without being the usual 'cliché charismatic guy', giving a beautiful and fitting end to the story arc that it closed. The world, characters and story were just fantastic, beautiful visually, and well written. The music per the usual was also A+ and some of the best you'll find in gaming. Something FF14 has always done infinitely better than WoW is class balance which they constantly listen to feedback on and make tweaks on to try to line jobs up better with one another based off their utility or lack therefore. All of them are performing pretty well and Monks just got an excellent and much needed rework . You can play any job in here you desire and feel like you're pull your weight, whether through the powerful buffs or sheer nuking power. And that's a formula that has continued to stick true in Shadowbringers. They just continue to excel at balance. If it looks fun, play it. You'll have value in groups or savage raids in the end. To those of you that play WoW and may be reading this wondering if this could be a breath of fresh air to you after the crap show that's Shadowlands the answer is yes. ESPECIALLY if you love a well written story and characters. The Expansion may be drawing towards a close in a few months, but it's still very much worth getting into. Especially now that ARR's story has received a much needed pruning that will make the level 50 slog from ARR to Heavensward (Where the game truly starts to shine.) much more manageable. That slog was often the defeat of many people trying the game out. But stick through till Heavensward and you'll be justly reward going onwards. I should mention that the classes and savage/ultimate raids are quite unlike anything you're used to in WoW. The classes are more in depth and have deeper and longer rotations. A slightly longer GCD than WoW helps out a lot with this and for 'weaving' abilities inbetween them that are off it. If you like the fast playstyle of WoW over a slower one, I would recommend looking into Ninja as a melee or Summoner as a caster as they have many abilities to weave that makes them feel faster. There's tons of resources out there such as The Balance discord to help you on the way and learn the ins and outs of these as well as many youtube videos. And there's easier options of the 'holy trinity' if you don't want to play anything too complex. White Mage (Healer), Red Mage (DPS), and Warrior (Tank) come to mind there as examples. The dungeons are quite easy, Mythic + in WoW is going to be more of a challenge. But the Savage/Ultimate raids are a completely different ballpark from WoW that requires a good, coordinated group and being good at your job as you have many mechanics to go through all the while keeping your dps/healing up to task. One death, especially in ultimate, can spell the difference between victory or a wipe/enrage. And it will also make you a hell of a player over in WoW after spending some time with it. Dodging mechanics in WoW is a joke after learning to dodge some of the mechanics FF14 throws out you in those high end raids.. Gorgeous spell animations, every healer can brez (looking at you wow), class balance is immaculate, and god damn can SE tell a story. I was sobbing for half of this xpac and most of the patch content. Cute world events, glamour, housing and great raid/dungeon encounters, this game is perfect.. Phenomenal story arc which leaves you wanting for more. Shadowbringers also brings some welcome changes to class skills by making them more streamlined and coherent.. This is possibly the best Final Fantasy in the series... and it's an MMO on top of that. The systems they use are perfected. They don't change very much, but that's because they're done so well. All they do is add more and more content to do and more classes to play. The music is 11/10 as well.. One of the best gaming experiences from start to finish I have ever had. This expansion cements FFXIV as not only The best MMO currently operating but also one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series.. The best MMO out there! Undoubtedly shadowbringers was a surprise, beautiful landscapes, captivating characters, fantastic fights, and let's not forget the soundtrack, incredible!. Amazing story. Graphics has a great emphasis on attention to detail from scenery to character.. Shadowbringers is, in my experience, without a doubt the greatest multiplayer story ever told through a game. I've played many Final Fantasy games, but Shadowbringers is my favourite of all. It puts forth the greatest depth accompanied by dark, interesting themes, that are tackled with an expert finesse. Like it's predecessors, Shadowbringers is truly a game upon itself rather than a simple expansion. A story that deserves to be experienced by all, but unfortunately may only be experienced by few, as it is necessary to work your way through the other fantastic FFXIV expansions before arriving at Shadowbringers. Shadowbringers is a masterpiece that brings a level of worldbuilding that is a rarity in JRPGs, and unrivaled in the MMORPG genre.. ShB has been around for one and a half year and we know what it is now, you can of course trust all day 1 reviews or the recent ones. Lets break this down in 3 Categories. Story, Gameplay ",emet selch's character has motivated me as a person to bear the legacies of the long fallen . a phenomenal expansion that captures everything an MMO should be . a turning point in a massive franchise that marks when things get really good .
281.World of Warcraft: Cataclysm,"Even though Its peak was with WOTLK this one always really resonated with my with that spacy Cataclysm world.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You can love it or hate it, but this is the best PVE expansion and peak raiding experience in WoW - the game, living for 20+ years.. Jumping into Cataclysm years after its initial release, I've got to admit, it's a darn good expansion. The introduction of worgens, my personal favorites, is a definite highlight. The expansion also nails it with engaging stories and meticulously crafted zones. My only gripe lies in the fact that while Cataclysm kicked off numerous narratives across different areas, it seemed to leave a few of them hanging or not entirely fleshed out in my view.. Unlike most people, I didn't hate Cataclysm. It was a step in the right direction, from WotLK, but sadly had to suffer all of the flaws added to the game, in that expansion - Like Looking for Group, Phasing, Unbalanced PvE and PvP in the first many months of the expanion. The are really only 3 things I disliked about Cataclysm: Looking For Raid (Obviously), the removal of the original ZG and ZA, and the two Deathwing-encounters. Loved the PvP, loved the all the item set's visuals, loved the new abilities, loved the rework of Azeroth, loved the many new addons that were added (Like Tradeskill Master), and loved many of the WoW PvP Videos from this expansion too, like Drakedog X, Reckful 3, and Adouken. Many great memories from this expansion, once I accepted that WoW was a shell of its former self (Vanilla / TBC).. absolute garbage! Cataclysm destroyed what good was left in the world, from here it starts the race to the bottom!!. It was the end of my WoW experience because after Cataclysm I stopped playing. The changes to maps where good idea on paper, and many players complained that old maps are lifeless, but that's the way it is with MMORPGS. The flying mounts in Azeroth where biggest mistake ever, it ruined core maps for me. It is also the very start of countless ways to dumb-down the game, making everything simpler for causal players.. This game did so many things right. It was deeply underappreciated. Several years ago I look back and wish I invested more in Cataclysm when it was the last expansion that felt like WoW.. I feel like this expansion isn't appreciated enough, I love how they reworked the zones and how much more storyline driven they are + worgens and goblins are both really nice races that I love. addon cataclysm very noticeably spoiled the game. But still, the game didn’t fall into a complete slag. And the addon both added bad qualities and good ones (albeit less than bad ones). It's ok.. This was the start of the end.... but not just for in game story. But for the game itself to many players. Talent trees were gutted, items and quests were lost. and the game became much easier. Truly a departure from classic wow.. The first major misstep for WOW. And the thing is the expansion was not that bad, it was more a matter of the lasting effect on the game, if they had know ahead of time what they where doing they might have been able to save this a lot more by using the phasing mechanic, so you didn't change the lower level parts of the game.. The meme is for most people to hate this expansion but that's mainly from people that were small children in Vanilla and then this happened to come when they got older and couldn't stand the extreme grind of WoW anymore. The expansion is a small improvement over the combat subsystems of the game and the content is fine and frankly the world was good to change since the questing in Vanilla was a disconnected mess (which didn't exist on purpose but because they had no time to do it right). The end game content was fine but as always beyond this point the game needs quitting it after a few days since to have any real challenge (for most people) you have to delve into an extreme time investment and work a second job for a guild.. this was a great release, good raids and nice and dark themed world. Balance was good and overall a great expansion really enjoyed it.. The new zones are good and the revamp of the old world, very needed and on point. Firelands was awesome, but the rest is lackluster. Dragon Soul is the worst final raid ever.. the scaled back class talent system started to show it's ugly head here. Blizz seemed to begin scaling back the complexity of the class development systems, which i believe ultimately resulted in a far less rewarding system than previous expansions.. This was the worst expansion for max level players, and they ruined big raid guilds, and made too many difficulty levels for players so many got burned. updates to old world was the only good thing.. Another garbage xpac for a garbage game. They could have improved the game, instead they put a glossy finish over broken content that's been there for seven years and say, 'oh look, those enemies that were once bears are now scorpids, brand new game!'. You're fighting black dragons, again, Ragnaros, again- it's the same old grind with better looking fire graphics. Only real new thing is the underwater zone- which is a sliver of the 'new' content anyway. Best of all, they made pvp even worse, I don't know how but they did it- healers are even more ridiculously OP, crowd control has been buffed through the roof- they essentially took every bit of feedback on what makes pvp bad and doubled it. The best part about Cataclysm is the goblin starting area- that is just fun. Sadly, once you're done that, the game is a steaming pile of dung.. every expansion has made the game worse. im not excited about the new level cap or the new grinding. there have to be better ways to add content to a game. cataclysm is one of the most deeply hated expansions for a reason. Garbage. They destroyed the continents. Same problems. Not worth the $15 a month by a longshot. I'd rather play Nostalrius ad infinitum until the end of the universe.. Only for remake the Azeroth, only for this reason, Cataclysm is a good expansion, but this expansion he had to keep the excellence of his ancestral expansions, and Catalysm didn't exceed or maintain. Cataclysm have a big preassure... and dont pass, but de remake world, and new quest, and new atmosphere is a excelent work.. This absolute garbage for a game. Just click and move with a horrible graphics character. Play valve games or at least a decent game. Not this. It surprises me that this gets a 90 but other significantly good games don't. Get a life your virgins.. High on my list of reasons why I quit WoW, this expansion just took the cake as far as nerfing things to placate incompetents and dullards. Absolutely nothing was a challenge, or if something was it lasted for about a week until Blizzard got round to nerfing it. Anyone who suffered through the indignities of Wrath and Cataclysm and is still playing the game either has incredible staying power with lost causes (Perhaps they`re all from Scotland) or at least one serious mental problem. The only positive innovation I could find was the inclusion of rated battlegrounds, which were great fun while my ill-considered final WoW subscription ran its course. But who subs to an MMORPG to play RBGs? I know I don`t, and everything else was total trash.. Well done blizzard! I did like cataclysm because of new zones raids and dungeons! Not bad! I did like some of the raids like Firelands, Dragon soul, Bastion of twilight or end time. Dungeons were cool, too but raids were better. Okay let's start with zones. I did enjoy playing in vashj'ir, deepholm and the best zone was uldum. I loved uldum because of cool atmosphere and dungeons. Vashj'ir okay 6 out of 10 quests were not so good. Okay, some cataclysm quests did ****. I'm glad that there were cool raids. I bloodly hated questing in deepholm because of too many strong mobs. Mount hyjal - bad. Too small and why did u place sulfurion spire there? I still wonder. Lore was bad. Raids - Awesome! Loved them! Dragon soul was best and firelands too because they were so epic!!! Just the bosses of dragon soul and firelands did stop me reviewing this 3. Dungeons- nah crap had moments. Okay. About global changes. I think, cata did kinda fail because of global. Wow is getting too easy. You can simply raise your character to level 100 in 5 days or 85 when i was playing cata. Okay cata - 5 out of 10 nice.. The ideas behind this expansion were solid and quite interesting. It was exciting to see Deathwing break out into the world from Deepholm in the opening cinematic and play through the story of Deathwing throughout the expansion. The worlds and questing story was great. However, at times, there were sections of the expansion that felt forced. This includes some of the raids and some of the zones and quests in the game. It felt as though they didn't have enough stuff for Deathwing in the game so they just threw in some extra side stuff and it didn't feel as though it all belonged in this expansion as everything did with Wrath of the Lich King. The game was quite fun, but the raids got boring quick. I still think it was a decent expansion though. It could have been worse, like Mists of Pandaria.. Pros: N/A Cons: The game lore was destroyed after Deathwing came back to life for the ""Cataclysm expansion; highly inflationary economy; terrible leveling and gear systems where for example a level one character cannot even harm a level 80; each new expansion effectively resets the game, making your previous achievements through time invested worthless; game is deliberately designed like a giant money-generating hamster wheel for the players to run on, that is it rewards time invested very much and actual skill very little; once a new expansion is out, you can really no longer play the older versions of the game you had paid for. Score Breakdown: Sound Effects and Music 9/10, Game Stability 8/10, Graphics 8/10, Loading Screens and Frame Rate 5/10, Voice Acting 5/10, Background Story 2/10, Plot Development 0/10, Realism 0/10, Gameplay 0/10, Replay Value 0/10, Game Publisher's Ethics -100/10, Total Score 0/10 Conclusion: Ignore this game instead of playing or buying it.. A lot of people didn't/ don't like this expansion but I really enjoyed it. It was difficult and made the bad players who thought they were good (who also happen to always have the biggest mouths) leave out of frustration. The community continues to get more and more toxic and it continues to effect the game itself. Some of the best 5man content comes from this expansion as well as some of the best raid boss fights. BWD (and the final boss) could be argued as reused content like NAXX as well as reusing a certain famous boss from the original game. At this point all my friends have stopped playing which lowered my enjoyment by half. I also enjoyed the remake of the original game, it needed the upgrade bad.. so incredibly easy that a 5 year old could level 90 in one day... oh wait that's what Blizz was ACTUALLY going for?! Oh GJ Blizz (and dont even get me started with the Warcraft Pokemons!). World of Warcraft: Cataclysm ****! Why? -more than 40 minutes waiting in a queue to play random dungeons -bugged quests and dungeons -mobs that never die -lags that disconnect you from server -piece of **** gameplay -censorhip -never get an answer from customer support/ticket system -fanatism -and many lies TO ALL BLIZZARD EMPLOYEES: GO F--- YOURSELVES!. Cataclysm was a positive expansion for WoW.... but not as much as TBC or WotLK. Cata brought about come game updates that really needed to happen for the future of the game... but didn't provide as much content for end-game as the previous expansions.. Why ""modern"" WoW is bad: First of all there isn't a world anymore. In a normal world you get to know people, know their strengths, their weaknesses. It used to be that way in WoW too, back when each player didn't own 30 alts on his account, 30 on a friends account and 30 more on his grandma's. Instant lvl 80, RaF and all this crap. Also, in a normal world there aren't 50 different versions of Elwynn Forest like there are in WoW (*cough *cough server hopping). Not to mention the good old summoning stones that actually required 2 people to fly to instance for a summon (at least they still exist in raid dungeons).. If you think about it they have cut down the time required on a lot of things (from looting to getting on your mount) Dailies. Did I say dailies? Are those quests? Those little dots that appear on the minimap? Those little dots that you just follow and just start clicking buttons mindlessly? You don't even have to do any research about the legendary quest... It just pops up in the middle of your god damn screen. DAMN, that's some hardcore gaming right there. Thank you Wowhead we won't need you again, back to farming dots for our alts. Of course since everyone is busy playing on all of their 8 alts each day, nobody can play ANY class well. And of course nobody has the proper gear for the raid dungeon he is about to attempt.. So we make raid dungeons have no requirements. You can basically enter with uncommon gear and clear it in no time. Hooray, that was fun. I understand that there weren't that many """"""""""""""""""""gamers"""""""""""""""""""""" using the internet back in 2004, but ruining a good game for those casual players who think that they are paying for an enhanced version of plant vs zombies is simply unacceptable.. I started playing WoW a few months after release and continued playing fervently up until WotLK was released. I still played on and off casually during WotLK, however, still thinking the game was fun, but I just didn't have enough time to play as much anymore. I bought Cataclysm on the day of release to try it out and had a few thoughts on it. First of all, the game became a total joke (even more than before) where every quest or NPC was some silly pop culture reference, which I found to be a turn off. An entire zone was based off of an Indiana Jones movie! I made it to level 85, and quickly found myself bored by the PvE content. On the bright side, they added a talent to fury warriors that allowed me to pull aggro constantly during normal 5 mans and not die because of the increased chance to parry. This was very useful and enjoyable while DPSing, as paying attention to aggro became too tedious. In fact, it was at this time that the best part of Cataclysm stood out to me: huge explosions of large yellow numbers, more yellow numbers than I had ever seen on my screen before as a warrior. Maybe years of WoW playing just burned me out, or maybe Cataclysm ****. If you really want to buy the game and try it then decide for yourself, but I'd say its worth passing on unless you really love the WoW universe.. This expansion definitely made the game worse than it was before. The transition from the old world to the new one, although it looked fun as an idea, turned out to be pretty bad. I suddenly felt myself alienated from the game, there was no world as I knew it anymore, and instead just super-simplified zones where you just moved from one griffon master to another and doing all those small quests. Yet I must say in retrospect, that compared to what they did in Mysts of Pandaria, this expansion was still pretty much on Blizzard's level.. Blizzard made a huge mistake in this particular expansion. The game has been dumbed down, to the point where hardcore gamers are just a bunch of tryhard ****. This game takes minimal effort for the original gamers, and they will find themselves done with the game completely if they are in a competent guild in no time. It also reduced the amount of individuality that the game had by decreasing the amount a person can use their talent tree, or at least the freedom to do so. Now if you are new to WOW this expansion is quite awesome. The way a person is able to rise to the top with the best gear around by putting minimal effort and being that idiot that sits in a corner due to lag or lack of any idea as to what they are doing. Old WOW is dead, and so is the reward.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really liked the Heroic Difficulty and raid mechanics that the dungeons had at the start of the expansion, i really dislike the other stuff like pvp, questing and the lore that this game gave us.. This is where things started to get really bad. The inherent problem lies in the fact that this is the turning point of WoW where it became all about grinding, and less about the story or having **** classic wow and the expansions leading up to this abomination it was about exploring the new content, roleplaying, watching the storyline unfold, and having fun with your friends, but with THIS expansion, it was about hitting the level cap and grinding for gear. Part of the problem is that the community was starting to take a nosedive in wotlk, but atleast in wotlk the community was still atleast half decent, but in cataclysm the community hit rock bottom, and the game isn't to blame for this, just bad customer service and other people not keeping the community in line, And while there are those rare servers that kept their communities in line, such as Cenarion Circle, those were RARE, and even if you were on one of those servers, those servers felt pretty empty and were not nearly as lively as they used to be. Even with a good community though, the game still ****, mainly because the content felt shallow and it was all about grinding, which, by the way, may be necessary to an extent, they took it TOO FAR in this expansion. WoW would never get it's groove back after this expansion was released, going on to make a **** storyline about the events leading up to killing deathwing, and another **** expansion, Mists of pandaria.. Haven't played on the official site yet!!! But a pretty good one!! Amazing ideas used!!! I guess the best online game till date!!! Gotta see the latest addition!!. The turning point in WoW as Blizzard start to run out of ideas ? Much of the old content is now gone and changed to suit the casual player and leveling and dungeons have been made very easy. Still a great story being told and the base game play is still fun.. Worst expansion to date (didn't try MOP yet) but it wasn't that bad. Biggest plus for reworking 1-60 zones, 80-85 was OK and end game was just more of the same. It was just missing the feeling that TBC and WOTLK had.. Cataclysm is an expansion that had so much **** new races are terrific.Unfortunately, questing in Outlands and Northrend is still terrible after 100 **** endgame has few dungeons, that are not so **** the final boss/patch was just too fast and not epic.. I'm not sure why I didn't end up enjoying Cataclysm - it was based upon a lot of revolutionary ideas. Up until that point, I hadn't been that excited about a new expansion since Burning Crusade. The events leading up to Cataclysm were well done and exciting. The new races were additions to the game that I felt were long overdue. Archaeology was a new secondary profession I looked forward to, as well as the concept of guild leveling. The breaking of the world and overhaul/redesign of classic zones was an innovative, ballsy and refreshing move by Blizzard, and I felt it would breathe new life into the game. I was giddy with anticipation at the inclusion of new zones that were an integral part of Warcraft lore such as Hyjal and Vashj'ir. However, Cataclysm is a hard lesson for everyone that shows how an outstanding idea can be implemented in the wrong way. First, the good: The new zones were beautiful and fun to play in, though like in WOTLK, Blizzard decided to force the player to choose between two fantastic zones that robbed the player of the full leveling experience of Cataclysm by making Vashj'ir and Hyjal the same zone level. Having to choose between these zones was a horrible decision to make, because I was keenly interested in both. The quests in these new zones were, at times, broken and lackluster. In addition, the new zones were spread WAY too far apart and didn't seem to fit together. Next, let's look at the new races. I hate what they did with the starting areas - why they made these areas ""instanced"" is beyond me. One can argue that the Cataclysm that drove these races to their respective factions is why you can never return to these zones, but it was exceedingly annoying that your new characters had no access to mailboxes after you left the initial starting zone, and if you got sick of the starting zone, you HAD to finish it before joining the rest of Azeroth. They wrote themselves into a corner and had to do it this way, but surely they could have written the lore differently so that, like other races, they could easily port to a new zone in Azeroth if they grew tired of being forced to go through the same story over and over. I was particularly disappointed with the Worgen, because the fall of Gilneas is STILL broken, and one wrong move during this final battle and you're ported back to the beginning of the instance and have to start over. Quests in the starting areas had a few fun experiences, but many were tedious. I felt the new quests in the retailored classic zones were redundant, because it was more efficient for players to grind through levels by running dungeons and battlegrounds, while questing in the refurbished zones wasn't nearly as fast. All of the work done by writers and developers to overhaul the classic zones was wasted, since running dungeons would get a player leveled more quickly. The ethos of WoW seemed to change with Cata, where leveling was no longer a journey to be enjoyed but a grind to be overcome. Perhaps it's because max level is ridiculously high while Blizzard hasn't adequately increased experience gained by questing to make players want to bother. In addition, the game has become far too easy. Cata kind of went from one extreme to another - they broke the healing class and made it exceedingly difficult to make it through a dungeon alive, and then they went the other way and made it far too easy. Guild leveling, intended to bring members **** closer together, acted instead to make guilds more cliquey - and now, almost 2 years post-Cata, people are only joining level 25 guilds for the benefits and ignoring the lower level guilds, making it almost impossible for new guilds to level, as there's no incentive to join. I'm not sure why I left two months after Cata's release - I became aware of Cata's faults later on, but at the time I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it. I just found myself in Stormwind one day with some friends repeatedly jumping off our flying mounts into the water, and realized, ""I'm bored and unmotivated...what's the point of playing this game anymore?"" I returned briefly 9 months later, only to have my lowbie slaughtered repeatedly with players decked out in BoA gear in battlegrounds and then slapped in the face with MoP, a further degradation into mediocrity. Cataclysm is when WoW lost its magic for me, and MoP ended up being the nail in the coffin of a once fantastic game. If Blizzard created separate servers for Vanilla WoW or BC (with achievements) or even WOTLK (still good, but not my favourite), I'd pay a monthly fee and play again in a heartbeat, but the direction developers have taken and the decisions they have made with this game since Cata has rendered this game unplayable.. WoW was a fantastic game in the past. It was filled with adventure, discovery, and most importantly, teamwork. However, the game has been going downhill recently with the release of the new expansion, the Mists of Pandaria. It has become too simplistic, and plays like a console game. There is no sense of accomplishment and adventure anymore. Clearly, Blizzard is now targeting a different demographic - the game is now for kids. If you enjoy paying a monthly fee AND playing with (other) children, this game might be for you.. I am officially late in writing this review, but I finally finished playing the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this expansion and the progression of the WoW story. The game is aging, though perhaps aging well. High-points were the Firelands raid, and the heroics and raids present at launch. Vashir was beautifully done, and has the least annoying underwater combat in any game I've ever played (though the gated nature of the zone almost forbade exploration and there was no reason to go back to it afterwards). Transmog (item appearance customization) arrived (at last... better 7 years late than never), but is still too restrictive... this made old content fresh again... brilliant! Low points were the dismally small amount of raid bosses released with Firelands and Dragon Soul. The progression reset with a new expansion's increased level cap is unavoidable, but the structure of valor/justice/heroics made for a mini-progression reset with every sub-patch, and really forced many people to see the gear treadmill through the curtain. Quests were also painfully linear. Talent trees were simplified with the aim of reducing options while increasing choice... unfortunately, the opposite happened, taking 10 or so ""truly-optional"" talent assignments down to ~3. Mists has reduced this further. Goblin and worgen starting quests were well done. The community has been becoming increasingly toxic, but cross-server raiding has the chance to make this less of an issue, as it has opened the door for sites like **** where there are consequences once again for being a d-bag. Overall, I had some of my happiest moments in videogames with this expansion. I mostly blame my guild for that, but this game let that happen, so I'm deeply appreciative.. As far as MMO's go, I have played better. Unfortunately in WoW you will frequently find yourself standing 40 yrds, from an enemy and casting spells or attacks at him over and over. IMO the cap should have been 75 at most, beyond that just feels like grinding.. The good old days, when WoW was a revolution are over. To be honest: Cataclysm just deserves the 3 Points, because of changing the world map - an idea that came a few years too late. And the rest of the game? Well, it's pretty unfair. The way, Mounts and stuff are patched out of the game or being reduced to a minimum, so everyone playing 10h can get something, you've been working weeks for, is just unfair. Also the balance: while some classes get nerved all the time, pretty Paladin gets more and more op stuff. The times, feeling like a hero, having some things nearly alone, are gone. It became more and more a game for 6 year old children. I won't even describe the horrible quest system or even the achievements.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Seriously, this game needs complete graphic engine update. I do not understand why Blizzard do not invest money in this direction since apparently they have all possibilities to do so.. The thoughts going into the Cataclysm expansion were good ones. There was an intention of customization and letting people play how they wanted to play. What came out of beta and was shipped and then patched was nothing like what was promised. Stat customization went from an optional cool thing, to something that was just plainly required because itemization went down the drain. The talent tree revamp flopped. The raid content flopped for the most part. A lot of pvp content that was supposed to come in, never did, and got pushed into MoP instead, and the stuff that should have come out in MoP is not coming out. That is to say PvP content that had been around in files since the Cataclysm beta were never utilized and instead just recycled for a later expansion, which they have no context in. Blizzard has become quicker to do knee jerk nerfs, but now waits years to fix any problems they create in their knee jerk nerfs. Druids are a case and point in this expansion, early on they were doing fairly solid all around, average players stayed in the middle of the pack while playing the class, and awesome players performed awesomely, instead of the druid class' usual performance where average players perform sub par and good players may just barely make out ahead of the middle of the pack. Blizzard's methods for remedying this change in performance were to put mechanics into the class that removed key talents and abilities from toolkits thus severely nerfing you no matter what you did. MoP is showing the same trends in dev behavior. No they can't be reasoned with to be shown the errors of their ways, they just dig in deeper when you prove them wrong. The amount of content put in this expansion is the smallest amount put in any iteration of WoW to date, and all for the same price (for you) as previous iterations. This also isn't a trend that doesn't seem to be going away or getting better, but instead getting worse in the upcoming years. Yeah, I could write a short novel on all of the downfalls of Cata, and the problems so far seen in the next xpack MoP. I can't do that here, so just walk away with the knowledge and suggestion to stay away from WoW until next year at the earliest, maybe the end of next year to check up and see if anything has been fixed, and the devs have gotten a few humble pills so that way they stop thinking they can treat their customers like crap and still charge full price for less than half of the content advertised.. I can't believe i went back to WOW for this, i left after i got bored with Burning Crusade thinking Cataclysm would bring dramatic changes, but it's just the same old crap, boring questing. I've played Guild wars 2 for about 10 hours and already had more FUN then the 3 or so years I've had in WOW.. I cannot believe how sad this game was. Every expansion it seems like they are trying to dumb it down even more so than the vanilla game was. The only things nice were the water, new graphics and new race/class options. The quests and environment changes were fun for twenty minutes then it got bland and only seemed like rehashed quests and Wrath of the Lich King buildings.. WoW is a great game, but this is not a great expansion. The storyline is really boring and Deathwing is very impersonal antagonist. In BC and WotLK the antagonists were very well known and loved Blizzard characters: Illidan and Arthas. Also the overall style of the expansion is rather cheesy. The new Thrall seems more like a coward than a legendary orc hero. Some of the new areas indeed look nice - but because they're split all over the world there's not really a nice connection between them like in the two earlier expansions. And there's not a main city which would serve as a whole server's meeting place and a place to hang out. To sum up, the Cataclysm was a huge disappointment. The original ""Warcraft-feel"" is gone. The storyline's not interesting anymore. BC and WotLK had a lot of influences from earlier Warcraft-series games, such as Warcraft 3. Cataclysm doesn't.. Leveling 1-60 once again was a bit of fun seeing the new content and zones, but entirely a single-player experience. Thankfully, it is a quick journey. After that though, you realize how bad the questing is in the Burning Crusade zones and trudge through (or do nothing but dungeons) until you hit the Lick King content. Once you hit end game, it's the same WoW you've always known. Grind for gear, grind for rep, grind for some more gear, and then grind some more. Is it fun? Not for me anymore, but WoW still remains the most ""solid"" and polished MMO experience to date - though the impressiveness of that feat is diminished by the fact they've had 8 years now to work on it. Mists of Panderia will be the first WoW expansion I do not purchase, and not only because of how much Cataclysm changed the game (for worse) but because the Everquest model of grind levels to then grind gear is just not enough to hold my interest anymore.. I liked this game when I was leveling. It was very tedious because quests were just a simple go there and","it's the best PVE expansion and peak raiding experience in WoW - the game, living for 20+ years . the introduction of worgens, my personal favorites, is a definite highlight . it's a step in the right direction, from WotLK, but sadly had to suffer all of the flaws added to the game, in that expansion ."
282.Bayonetta,"Having played Bayonetta on the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, with the most time spent on the Xbox 360, I can confidently say that this game stands as the best in the series. While the PS3 version suffered from notably slow loading times, the overall experience on the Xbox 360 was exceptional. Nowadays I prefer the Steam version. Bayonetta offers a thrilling gameplay experience that is challenging and rewarding. The combat mechanics are finely tuned, allowing for a seamless blend of combos and special moves. This game demands skill and precision, making every encounter feel engaging and intense. The focus on gameplay is evident, providing a rich and varied action experience that keeps players coming back for more. The soundtrack of Bayonetta is nothing short of fantastic, perfectly complementing the high-octane action with memorable tracks that enhance the overall atmosphere. Coupled with interesting levels, the game creates a vibrant world filled with diverse environments. Bayonetta serves as a clear climax of the series, showcasing everything that makes it great. The variety in gameplay keeps each level feeling fresh, whether you're battling angels or engaging in epic boss fights. As one of my favorite games of all time, Bayonetta has left a lasting impression on me. Its combination of superb gameplay, captivating music, and unique design elements make it a standout title in the action genre. For fans of challenging and stylish combat games, Bayonetta is an absolute must-play. It is also way faster than games like DMC.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is stylish: It is witty, sexy, and violent. The feelings I get while playing are somewhat similar to a Tarantino movie. My major gripe with the game is the combat. Basically, there are a ton of enemies, and it feels like all I do is spam dodge and then spam some random buttons. It is a bit boring and repetitive and since this is a large chunk of the game, I feel quite conflicted whether this should be a 5 rather than a 6. I have to admit that I only played the game for 3 hours, but at that point some boredom with the core fighting gameplay set in. I probably need to play some more to form a more certain opinion.. An arguably worse DMC 5 that is carried by its stylish and satisfying combat, but weighed down by a weak story & uninteresting characters. Great game, solid gameplay and a fun storyline.. AMAZING game. incredible combat,characters,music,story,graphics,EVERYTHING! A learning curve greater than DMC and awesome turn-your-brain-on fun! Ultra must buy!!!. PlatinumGames hits it out of the park with this smexy game. Bayonetta the game and the character both make me feel things.. Bayonetta is one of the best & most underrated series in gaming PERIOD. Replaying this game in 2022 right before 3 comes out made me love it even more than I did all those years ago in my first (admittedly rough) playthrough. The Bayonetta games may have my favorite combat system in any game (rivaled by the new Spider-Man games & some others) And I may be in the minority, but I really enjoy the stories of both games! I prefer Bayo 1’s story to Bayo 2’s, but the combat of 2 >1. The story pacing is a bit wonky, but things always escalate out of control by the end, I truly love how ridiculous and campy these games get. Bayonetta herself is the icon, the legend & the moment.. Solid hack and slash that goes over the top in the characters, tone, and combat. The story is all over the place, but it fits with the world. This game takes a lot of risks and a lot of them pay off.. A well used sexy character, great combos, enemies and bosses, the history didn't catch me that much, but maybe i was distracted by **** and ass.. Bayonetta's few flaws in level design and structure are buried deeply under immense amounts of creative charm and beautiful yet brutal aesthetic. Some of the greatest combat of all time coupled with over-the-top demon action, phenomenal boss fights, great writing, fantastic music, and a story with some real heart makes for an all-time high within the hack-and-slash genre.. Wow! That was sexy & Fantastic! Very very fun to play with amazing action scenes and lovable characters!. Sir, I pursue your twitter. You are creator of S E C S. I need B I G K O K. I’m not taking commissions right no- B I G K O K for madam. Yes, I am K Y O O M I N G on the thought.. DMC but with sexy and beautiful girl. Greate combat system, fast action, recommend!. I preferred it to 2 as it has a bit more story going for it, but honestly it still doesn't really do it for me. Platinum games are too formulaic for me, with the exception of Wonderful 101. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Playing this title in 2021, Bayonetta is simply breathtaking, the combat system is near perfect, what an amazing game. A master piece, wonderful, amusing and surprisingly this title don´t get old.. OVERALL - 78% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 6/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Fast paced, creative action.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the best action games I ever had played in my life. I first played the game back in 2010, and now I´m still playing it.. The best hack and slash game. Very intense, with powerfull musik, nice handling of the main character and great bosses!!. This is one of the great action games made for the Xbox 360. It's an epic masterpiece that is an equal to ""God of War III"" in every way. Campy, bizarre and over-the-top, ""Bayonetta"" is a visual stunner that builds upon the combat of ""Devil May Cry"". The story might be convoluted, but the gameplay is top-notch. Fighting is fast, fluid and flashy. There are also moments that recall Sega classics such as ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" and ""Space Harrier"". While the game may not be for everyone due to the sexual references and anime-like weirdness, it still packs quite a wallop. So if you're a fan of Dante, Kratos and Ryu Hayabusa, then you'll love Bayonetta. I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10.. Bayonetta One of the most ridiculous games ive ever played Bayonetta is a hack and slash game where you play as a half dark half light witch bayonetta after a gem known as the right eye And while this game isn’t free of problems, it was great finally seeing what all of the fuss is about… This hack and slash games brought so much joy for me with its random and ridiculous humor and story telling.. I ended up loving every character I came across in this game.. The playfulness here is what makes this otherwise just okay game so great… The gameplay isn’t anything special and level design isn’t anything special either… The game is pretty linear with the ocassional forcing you to dodge a light to freeze time so you can walk on water or break a wall.. but for the most part this is very much a barebones version of God of War… there will be walls that go up that wont come down until you hack and slash your way through all of the enemies… the combat is swift and fun, though not too satisfying, but youre able to fill up a meter to torture your enemies for an instakill as well as pick up their weapons which do a great deal of damage but break fairly quickly.. and the enemies drop these haloes that you can trade for new moves, items, and weapons… And finishing an area will cause the game to take a snapshot of usually your vag, cause japan…. And randomly on your journey youll run into crazy huge bosses that you take down with your hair… because of course you do… your hair covers your body so while using it.. it isn’t quite covering your body as much anymore.. I found each boss battle to be fun and engaging, and I found all 9 hours of this game to be perfectly paced for the most part… The progression is very linear here, and there are a few really cool cinematic moment to keep the game feeling fresh throughout.. it never becomes predictable, it will introduce and drop mechanics all the time it keeps the game fun and stops it from ever feeling like a chore… Where pacing did become a problem for me though is with the vehicle based missions… there are few sprinkled in here.. and theyre fun at the start.. but they drag on for what feels like forever.. less is more and that definitely should’ve been the case here.. these levels get uninteresting quickly and bring the rest of the perfectly paced game down… aside for the poorly paced vehicle missions, my biggest issue with this game is its collectibles.. Theyre all over the place but they pause the game every single time you pick one up.. I understand this game is from 2009.. but still.. its annoying and frequent… it almost discouraged me from picking them up completely.. Bayonetta Is one of the few games that gets praise today that actually deserves it… Despite the annoying collectibles that break the flow of the game.. Bayonetta is a sexually charged game of joy and heart, youre guaranteed to smile at least 42 times while playing.. I give Bayonetta an 8/10. Bayonetta is a great spectacle-fighter. The gameplay is great,with a deep and satisfying combat system with over 100 combos to **** game is also extremely challenging,so expect to die a lot.However,if you die 3 times,you must restart the chapter (level) from the beginning.I don't like this system,as you can get a lot of cheap deaths on QTE's,which brings me to the other flaw in the gameplay,which is the over-reliance on QTE's,which ruins some of the game to be honest.Level design is superb though. The graphics are great,and the framerate never drops through all the carnage going on. The sound design is mediocre though,and the soundtrack is awful. However,Bayonetta is an awesome game that is well worth checking out.. Aside from the story being **** crazy, in your first playthrough, normal mode is going to feel like it should be called hard mode and you'll encounter enemies that you think have balancing issues. For an older game, it puts to shame a lot of triple A games released in the year of 2016 because of the replay ability, not requiring a consistent internet connection, and you're not being consistently nickel & dimed (microtransactions) for a new weapon or costume. On the note of the story again, the protagonist, Bayonetta, is likable & memorable, as well as supporting characters like Luka, Jeanne, and Rodin. In other words, you're going to have a tough time in your first playthrough if you're on normal mode, but that should incentivize you to get better and unlock new items you missed. And you won't be nickel & dimed once for those items. The story might be crazy, but the cast is pretty memorable. I've yet to get a Wii U and experience the second game.. I want tell you this game's bad thing. First, the difficulty. this game's 'normal' difficulty is 'hard' difficulty in other games. i really wanted to play game between normal and easy difficulty. easy difficulty is too easy. even there exist very easy mode. 'easy' mode can clear with only button attack. Second, there is no practice mode. i didn't know the combo until see ending.. very charismatic character and with personality. The game is quite active scenarios are cool. In addition you have a good list of moves. This very well but there Ninja gaiden this bayonetta knows very little.. An absolute masterpiece, it has everything you want in a videogame. It has length, content, game-play, grapics, 60 fps. but the long pencil legs that bayonetta has are laughable, as well as her tiny head. The graphics are very good, I'll grant you that. The story and game play however are just boring after a very short period of playing. I was scratching my head the first half hour trying to work out what the game is about because I was looking for depth that wasn't there. Mostly a button masher at normal difficulty. I don't understand the over the top ratings this game got. The cut scenes are way too long and boring. I don't think I'm likely to finish it.. The director of the original Devil May Cry, Hideki Kamiya brings us another satisfying action game. The mix of ranged and melee combat brings back nostalgic memories of the PS2's demon hunter Dante. But don't just expect a Devil May Cry game under a different. Bayonetta has a personality and flair to combat all her own. Platinum Games tries to add a little sexy to death with their heroine. The results are a little uncomfortable. The rampant over-sexualization of the character actually made me dislike her a bit. The amount of suggestive poses and brief flashes of nudity gets out of hand at times. It tries to approach with some humor and a tongue-in-cheek tone, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still inappropriate. Bayonetta will be empowering women one minute only to keep them objectified the next. Luckily though it doesn't affect the mostly excellent gameplay. There is plenty of diversity to how you can approach combat. Different weapons can be combined on either Bayonetta's hands or feet. The simple act of changing where you equip a weapon changes your overall combat style and how combos will react. It's pretty brilliant. Enemy variety is also appreciated as they all have their distinctive qualities and require different approaches. A few boss battles make too many reappearances, but it's not a huge issue. There is a healthy challenge to this game. A few camera issues get in the way, but it's not a huge deal. It's also got some length behind and plenty of reasons to return thanks to unlockables. Higher difficulties will keep those looking for a real fight coming back. The length though is kind of an issue. It's nice that it's not a few hour romp, but it's clear that some sections go on for too long at times. There is some pretty obvious padding that causes the game to overstay it's welcome by just a little bit. However none of it's minor issues destroy this great action game. It's a spiritual successor that expands on a great series. They did go a bit overboard sexing up the title character and some segments go on for too long, but none of that changed the fact that I was having a blast with the great combat. Those who love their action games should check this one out.. Bayonetta stoops to the lowest common denominator. The character is empty and the plot even more shallow. A ""Witch"" who's only power is a hair suit that reveals **** and ass when she goes into beast mode. The game is a rip off of a far superior game in the genre ""Devil May Cry"". There is even an ""Auto play"" button for those too lazy to play. Who ever made this game needs to grow out their hair and hang them selves with it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Worst game I have played in my life. Its like DmC with a lot of bronze powder. The story is a bad joke, making have hard to stay playing this game after some hours.. One of the best hack n slash games of the 7th gen (alongside Rising). This game has high-octane action, an extremely memorable protagonist, a great soundtrack, great depth in its action and some funny liners here and there. The game's story is a little meh and the replay ability is ok, but not as good as say, Rising. Even though i prefer Rising over Bayonetta, it's still a recommend action game for anyone to try out.. Single Player/Multi Player (2/2) (If the single player is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no multplayer) (If the multiplayer is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no single player) Gameplay (2/2) Visuals/Story (1/2) (If the visuals are better than the story, review this section as if it had no story) (If the story is better than the visuals, review this section as if the visuals didn’t matter) Accessibility/Longevity (2/2) (Review this section only on Accessibility if the game has no longevity) (Review this section only on longevity if the game isn’t accessible) Pricing (1/2) Wildcard (0) This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. Bayonetta is one of the most suprising games ever made! I didn't expect much, but the fun you get from it: the laughs and cries, it's all pure gold! I rarely enjoy this kind of games but Bayonetta made me like this genre more. It looks good, it feels good and the storyline is funny but serious in the same time... weird game in brilliant package!. this game is better than god of war but its not as good as devil may cry bayonetta is one the hotest girl on videogame bayonetta has a good gameplay, good graphics its a fun game.. I've played many action/hack and slash games, everything from Devil May Cry to God of War to No More Heroes to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. While all of those games are amazing, none of them match the brilliance of Bayonetta. Essentially what I'm saying here is that Bayonetta is the best action game I've ever played. From a graphical standpoint, this game does not disappoint. The graphics are amazing, with outstanding enemy designs and ridiculous set pieces. The only issue is that there is frequent screen tearing which only happens in between fights. It's not much of an issue, just a noticeable flaw. The music too is excellent. For some reason, the mix of intense action and J-pop works very well. The best part of the sound track is a remake of Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"" as a j-pop song. The actions in Bayonetta is on a whole other level. Every weapon allows for a large variety of of combos, and every combination of items between the hands and feet of Bayonetta allows for even more combos. Simply put, there are a lot of possibilities to work with. The best mechanic of the game is Witch Time, which is a slow motion mechanic that is activated with every split second dodge. The actions is perfect. Even better is the fact that the game encourages replay ability, adding to the already 10 hour length of the campaign. The main issue that people seem to have with this game is the story. The point of the story is not to have players on the edge of their seats with suspense, but rather to provide context for the ridiculous set pieces and fights that ensue. All in all, this game is damn near perfection. Every action fan should pick it up, considering it's only $20 these days. 9.8/10. Devastatingly frustrating with bad cameras and nearly impossible to defeat enemies that ruin any chance for this game to succeed to me. Only thing that stuck out to me were the nice use of some graphical capabilities. 4 out of 10. Following a long war between the Lumen Sages and Umbra Witches only one witch, Bayonetta, remains thus causing a terrible imbalance in the universe. Alone in the world Bayonetta sets out to find the truth behind the events that unfolded only to find herself faced with angelic hordes intent on killing her. Created by Hideki Kamiya, the man behind Devil May Cry and Viewtiful Joe, Bayonetta delivers a fantastically over the top third person action game. Most importantly the fighting mechanics are arguably the best of any video game this generation. It is at once easy to grasp for beginners yet deep enough to encourage players to experiment. As expected the face buttons allow the player to kick, punch and fire Bayonetta's hand guns. The real key however is the ability to enter a 'bullet (Witch) time' mode by holding the right trigger just before an enemy lands an attack. This allows the player to give themselves some breathing space or land damage on tougher enemies. As well as many types of regular enemy Bayonetta also features its share of boss fights and virtually every one makes for a fantastic spectacle. Many are simply gargantuan is size and often require a bit of brain as well as brawn to defeat. Bayonetta herself makes for a fantastic lead character managing to be sexy, calm and confident all at the same time and is a joy to watch even during cut scenes. All in all this is a fantastic action game that aside from a slightly confusing story line does very little wrong. A must buy.. If you like the combat of hack and slash games such as DMC, DmC, Ninja Gaiden, God of War or Dante's **** should try this game. The story and characters at first is very annoying however as the game progresses it becomes more and more interesting and it even has a twisted ending that you would never guess and you grow to love the silly characters. The game itself it's very japanese(not in a kawaii style more like Viewtiful Joe) and if you don't like that style you are probably going to hate it. Also the tone is very girly (things like lipsticks, butterfly wings, violet and pink colors) however if you really don't mind the combination of gore with girly colors that's not a problem. The music it's awesome with many mixtures classic games music (like space harrier), jazz, upbeat techno, classical, etc.. and it's mostly awesome. The gameplay is the central piece of this game. The game is so fast and with such an awesome control over Bayonetta that you would feel it natural after a couple of hours. Also the levels are well designed and very different one from each other.After some days of bayonetta I returned to Dmc 3 and 4 and it was so slow and clumsy in comparison that I comeback to this game. The boss fights are epic as they can with huge with gargantuans as big as cities fighting against you. In conclusion, if you don't mind an over the top mixture of ridiculous history (like in DMC) and some girly tone and you are looking for an awesome combat gameplay and level design go for it. Notes: If you are the super serious masculine type of gamer that plays god of war, manhunt and hates japanese nonsense just play the game in mute, skip the cutscenes and put some metal music or something. The combat is so deep and fast paced that you won't mind after a while.Plus there is a lot of gore. If you played the demo and didn't like it give it a chance anyways I played it too and hate it but as it was a good reviewed hack n slash I bought it in a **** I love it the demo is just so misleading to the actual gameplay due to the fact that the awesomeness of the combat starts to show after and hour or two in the game.. Really a fantastic game. Great combat, brilliant visuals and interesting story. Granted, it is a blatant Devil May Cry clone, but an extremely good one and it does do enough of its own thing to be considered original. The visuals in the game are just remarkable and truly quite original (or at least creatively used if I'm wrong.) The gameplay is just non-stop fun and can be as simple or complex as you want, with a very reasonable learning curve. My only gripe with this game would be the lack of real character development for most of the side characters. Aside from Bayonetta and Jeanne, the rest of the cast seem very underdone and given little depth. Overall: Bayonetta is just a great game that I thoroughly enjoyed.. I know I'm just some dude on the Internet, but you've got to believe me when I say that Bayonetta is the finest action game of the generation and one of the defining games of the genre, Period. If you love action games like DMC or Ninja Gaiden, prepare to have your mind blown by this incredible game!. This game can be great but there are way too many annoying things, the camera angle is pure horrible, how can you make a game where you spent half your time fixing the camera angle so you can see the enermy? The boss are way too rediculous, it often feels like a lottery wether you win or not. the final boss was just stupid, with a one hit kill!! wtf is the point of that? the only wayt to escape is to go the panther form, but every now and then it will just return you to normal and thus killing you, just pure randomness wether you win or not.. I've owned this game three times from launch. I've gone from hating to loving it, and back and forth. It's taken years for me to be able to say this: Bayonetta is without a doubt the best 3rd person action game ever made. It has nowhere near the scope of God of War, my other favorite, but the wide open creative gameplay just can't be beat.. This is realy great game but to bad that there is no PC verion of this game (: The combat system is great the whole game is amazing but this game is not better then Devil May Cry 4 (:. Okay so to start off, I thought Bayonetta looked alright, but wasn't sure how it would play. Turns out it's Devil May Cry but with guns on your feet and dragons made out of hair. There is very little that is wrong with this game, in fact it is one of the finest I have ever played. The point of this game is the same as Devil May Cry - kill everything, and do so whilst jumping around the screen or teleporting, jumping off enemies' heads, and avoiding getting hit by all the hundreds of projectiles or diving attacks from the enemies that surround you. There is also a story but I don't care. You can assign one set of weapons to Bayonetta's hands, and one set to her feet (some weapons can be assigned to both, others are unique like the sword and iceskates). As well as this, you can have an alternative set of weapons on your hands and feet, which you can switch between whenever you want. So you have access to 2 sets of hand weapons, and 2 sets of feet weapons. Pressing the punch or kick buttons in sequences with or without pauses create different combos, and each set of weapons on her hands and feet work together for different combos. Most attacks and combos however do follow a pattern, but there are also unique attacks for each weapon, and sometimes unique attacks for a particular set of weapons. Basically, the amount of variety available here is astonishing when you consider that there are eight weapons to combine together. As you fight and taunt enemies, you fill a magic gauge which can be used for a number of things. First of all you can use a small amout for ""wicked weave"" attacks, which are giant hands or feet you can summon to smash enemies for high damage, knock them out of the way, and hit crowds of enemies at a time. You can also use special abilities like teleportation for small amounts of magic per use. The main use of the magic gauge is to perform torture attacks. To do this your magic gauge must be full, and then you can use it to do very high damage to a particular enemy. Your magic gauge will go down if you get hit, so you are rewarded for playing perfectly without taking damage. In addition, if you kill an enemy with a torture attack you can take their weapon - and these weapons can be used a limited amount of times to cause further high damage. There are many types of enemies to face off against, and each have a range of attacks and projectiles. Some enemy classes can carry different weapons, which really makes them a whole different class of enemies as they have different attacks. Bayonetta is also one of the few games that has genuinely interesting boss fights. Admitedly, not all of them are so good, but most are pretty extreme, and most importantly, can be beaten without taking damage, once you are an expert. The reason why Bayonetta works is because everything is fair. It's a very, very hard game, that's for sure. But along with every enemy attack, there is a sound effect or visual clue to tell you what is about to happen. Things are not just happening out of the blue with no way to react. There is a lot of information to take in, but if you are able to keep track of the entire battle and learn the clues that lead to each enemy attack, then you can fight aggressively, non-stop, whilst also being able to evade. This leads me to the genius that is the dodge-offset. You can perform a backflip at any time, which gives you a split second of invulnerability. This works as a standard dodge for all occassions, but if you time it exactly as an enemy attack reaches you, then you are rewarded with ""witch time"" (slow motion) for a few moments to get payback. In pretty much all other fighting games of this kind, if you are on the offensive, and then a projectile comes your way, you have to cancel your attack, and evade. Bayonetta introduces the dodge-offset, which allows you to hold down the button of your last attack, then press the evade button, then continue from the middle of your previous combo. After a little practice, it becomes apparent that the developers of Bayonetta are geniuses, and all other games are not worth playing because of this. You can replay each mission to try to earn medals, based upon time, damage taken, inventory items used, and combo points earned. This is the real challenge, aiming for perfection. Just surviving the game on each difficulty is hard enough, but living up to what the designers consider to be perfection is a whole different level of difficulty. It's up to you how serious you're going to take this game. I guess you can just get through it and enjoy it on some shallow level. But if you put the time in, you can achieve so much more, and experiment with what all the weapons and items have to offer.. This is one of the best games that I played in my life, I dont understand the bad critics about Bayonetta, maybe this guys wants attention. This game is serious stuff. This is the best action game I've ever played in my entire life. It's funny as hell, hectic, challenging and above all COOL. There are very very few games that I would give a 10, but Bayonetta is completely flawless.. Bayonetta has great combat mechanics, but it fails on fun. This game is all over the place and could have been much better if the designers had followed typical game design with character building. Bayonetta doesn't give a lot of explanation on how to actually play the game and instead leaves it up to the player. The problem is that there's a ton to learn and you're expected to know it from the beginning. Bayonetta contains a hidden challenge level called ""Alfheim"" in each chapter. It would have been the perfect place for gameplay instructions and letting players ","bayonetta offers a thrilling gameplay experience that is challenging and rewarding . the soundtrack is nothing short of fantastic, complementing the high-octane action with memorable tracks . for fans of challenging and stylish combat games, Bayonetta is an absolute must-play ."
283.Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition,"Besides lacking endgame content, the game is overwhelmingly good. Maybe it'll change one day when Blizzard idiots are finally gone.. As far as ARPG's go this was good. It wasn't perfect but by the time they released its replacement it was a gem ****. If you haven't played it and are looking at it. Its still worth a play. Can't say that about its replacement.. A very good arpg. Different from D2, but with its own charm. Recomended for any who want to play a great multiplayer game on arpg genre, probably the best experience on its kind.. Copying and pasting item tables from Diablo 2 is too hard. Heres 17 more ch. Seeing d3 s29 annoucement next to the d4 ,season of the barber, failing is way more fun than all their games from the last 10 years. This game isn't great, isn't good but isn't too bad it's fun game, espically when you get legendaries drop, but not too fun, you can't play this game too countinuesly, you'll get board after wave of enemy after enemy, thanks good it have check point reach check point and play it later after several hourshours. Worth less crap. Always online crap. Endless updates crap. Long sign in crap. Long menu crap. Everything is crap. PS4 sign in doesnt work. Blizzard worthless company. What a game. What an experience. Blizzard knows how to make a game fun. Diablo 3 was an absolute blast start to finish. Then again and again. Choice of how to play: Hardcore, seasonal, or normal. So many choices of punishment too (difficulty/world tier). Not lacking in action from start to end. Thank you for reading. Enjoy Gaming.. Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition is a solid action RPG experience that brings the series to the current generation of consoles. With the addition of the Reaper of Souls expansion, this version of the game offers plenty of content to keep players engaged for hours on end. The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, with a wide variety of skills and abilities to choose from, making it easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences. That being said, the game is not without its flaws. The storyline can feel disjointed and lackluster at times, and the repetitive nature of the gameplay can make it feel like you're going through the motions after a while. Additionally, the game's reliance on grinding for loot may not be for everyone, as it can feel like a chore at times. Overall, Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition is a fun and enjoyable game that will appeal to fans of the series and action RPGs in general. While it has its shortcomings, the game's strengths in combat, loot, and overall gameplay make it a worthwhile addition to any PlayStation 4 library.. I personally really liked this game. I played it both alone and on co-op and I can confidently say that playing solo is easier, but can feel more repetitive and redundant. Co-op makes this game genuinely fun, as long as you all manage to keep up with one another. I did manage to platinum this game, which even though took a lot of grinding, at the end felt extremely rewarding.. Great game witch very creative and interesting story. I like the combat system in the game (mainly with bosses). but the game is too simple and after some time of the game we are able to defeat millions of opponents while losing 2hp. But I the idea and the whole game are really good.. Best Game Best difficulty Best charakter movement More than 300 hours Diablo Immortal is the big ****. Highly immersive, unexpectedly fun and high replay value, the hours will pass by quickly playing this game. Plus, the controls are surprisingly easy and intuitive on a PS4 controller. Loading times between different areas are almost non-existent. Lots of mindless destruction and loot, spam that disintegration beam and obliterate monsters and demons in your path. Downside, the story needs more depth to actually care for the story characters. Finished the campaign using a wizard, playing demon hunter next, and glad the servers are still up and continue to support the season.. Good game from Blizzard, apart from completing Diablo III, I liked Act V of the game, the Mistica helped me a lot in the game.. More accessible than the previous games, but still deep and addicting gameplay. One of the best games on PS4 indeed.. An addictive grind, but it really is just one long long long grind. Not for me.. I played this game on the PS3, and then on the PS4, got the platinum on both, and had over what, 300 hours minimum on each version. After playing other, BETTER games, with looting or action hack and slash games, I'll say this: Diablo 3 is pretty boring, repetitive, does everything mediocre and doesn't feel like anything else other than an idiot for getting hooked on its borderline gambling mechanics. The story is just to be skipped, the loot doesn't matter until you start min-maxing it, and all the classes feel the same. Nioh has better loot mechanics than Diablo, and that's an actual game, not a mobile game wannabe like Diablo III. I'm glad I opened my eyes after playing other games, or else I'd be pretty ashamed of letting this one be my first DIablo game.. 2021 & it still holds up. It's mind-blowing how much better this is than modern day games.. For a long time this was the game I played when I had someone over. Super fun and I liked all the classes exept the monk. But it´s still a 10 for me.. Excellent game on the PS4! Played on a 10' projection screen and it was an awesome experience. Loved every part of it, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the level designs, all of it was so good. This is game you can play over and over again - can't wait for the next one!. Played by God with the controller, a very satisfying gaming experience compared to the mouse and keyboard counterpart. 10 and praise. First and last last Diablo game, you just need one button to finish the whole game without even dying. This is the first time in my life I felt so much joy after finishing the story and it made me happy for weeks because I finished an unplayable linear one button game. I really want to know what the review were smoking while rating this game. Did you enjoyed playing this one on PC, or do you even have two or three friends with whom you wanna play couch-coop, this is the game.. They have updated this game to hell. I got a legendary item belonging to the first boss before I even got to him..... god this is lifeless. You can stand still without taking damage, it feels like a dead MMO. I'm not much of an online player so I just stuck to the main campaign and to be honest I get why people really like this game! Took me about a day or so to finish and I had a blast doing it, plowing through enemies and looting and watching the numbers go higher and higher and changing my characters look. I had a ton of fun with it. The story is alright, it's really just a driving force to keep missions happening and I'll take it just to have more reasons to hit things. Really solid game. Blizzard the worst company ever and this is one of th worst games. Must be illeagle in every country!. Got a game together with a friend for local co-op. The game itself seems absolutely great and fun, all the abilities, magic, item collection etc. feels absolutely great, however, once we found out that that you cannot die without any negative consequences - it kind of killed it of for us altogether.. there is no challenge whatsoever! You just run around without worrying to die.. I get it, that many say ""story mode is just a training ground etc. etc."" , But I didn't want to ""grind"" the game in Adventure mode, we wanted to play it for story and wanted some challenge, but since you cannot die it seems absolutely a waste of time. Hardcore character doesn't fix it either, because it's a permadeath, and once you die (which you will most likely) you have to start from the very beginning.. ot just doesn't fit in my head how they could not make a middle ground between ""permadeath"" and ""god mode"". It was absolute disappointment for us... One of the first games I bought when I purchased my PS4. By the time I played it, the game was already polished. Apparently they were some problems at launch or earlier when it was released. I remember having so much fun playing Diablo 2 on PC and so surprised that it was good on console as well. Love the fact that I can play couch co-op with this game which is rare nowadays. In fact, I finished the main campaign playing with my partner who is not even a gamer.. Nothing has to say more about than this game is simply the best hack‘n slay loot dungeon crawler which was ever made. Every on this concept like gameplay and loot system seems to be perfectly balanced. The end game is so deep that this game will easily makes the same fun to play just after 8 years.. The game has a ton of things to do and explore, and a very long progression. Combat is fun and intense, but becomes very repetitive too. The plot of the story felt quite unsubstantial, I played it 3 times and never really followed its thread. However I think the game's attractiveness lies in the addictive character and gear progression. Which is what will keep you playing it. It is most fun in 4 player couch coop. Do that if you can!. Grate so gud optimize for consoles grafic is gud fan and adictiv whay beter then poe on consoles bcz blizzard acuali care about consoles players game run grate on ps4. I played this game on Pc for hundred of hours now I bought it on sale for my PS4 while waiting for the new season to start, graphically is very good , I love the semplification over the control to fit on console , very nice and clean even if sometimes movements feel a bit awkward. Story I personally like it even though isn't very original. I came back to this after a few years break and started a new ""season"" with characters from scratch. Played my preferred character through the story again and enjoyed it as much as I remember when I played for the first time (I have been a Diablo player from the first edition) .... then for the sake of it maxed out all different characters as a nostalgic exercise (via a select leveling process and metagaming, not storyline for each) I guess this reflects my enjoyment of the series (and I have to admit looking forward to Diablo IV) but this does not get a 10 because I recognize that outside the storyline all this ended up being was a loot grinding dungeon crawler. I have a twisted admiration of the top grinders of the Season but I was not interesting in engaging with post-endgame ""best of the best"" theatrics. Fantastic, engaging storyline ... but nothing genuine to offer for RPG gamers in the endgame. Its a game to play, enjoy and finish. I have no regrets to this year's return, but I have not continued and will not likely return. Diablo IV ? ... bring it on !!. Huge throwback to Diablo 2 days playing on my pc Bought this on a PS4 for 30 bucks, the whole collection, it felt more like a nostalgic trip than anything majorly new, not that am complaining. The last game worked wonders, and the new npcs added certainly helped enhance the experience.. Never understood this game's appeal, it was very easy. Yes you can increase the difficulty, but then you get better loot almost immediately that takes it back to being a button-mashing exercise... I don’t remember what difficulty level I was at but it was somewhere in the upper half ( the developer leaves it completely to the player to adjust the difficulty with dozens of difficulty levels as if to say they gave up trying to balance the gameplay) .. some people say that the real game starts after you finish the story when you get access to randomized dungeons, so I endured until then, but even that was more of the same .. The only thing that drew me to the Diablo franchise was the lore (of previous games)... The graphics is also almost cartoonish which is not consistent with the nightmarish story and lore the franchise wants to set. Hello everyone B-rod is back with a slightly older review, but it what I have. Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls the console version. I do know why they call these games Diablo, and it is not because Diablo is the main villain. It is because these games are so **** addictive it is unreal. I never played Diablo 1 or 2, I played 3 on the Xbox 360 and then again when it was originally re-released on the PS4. I must say replaying through this game again is just like when you watch your favorite movie again it; you may know it beat for beat, but it is still an experience you continue to enjoy. The story of Diablo 3 is all about the Black Soul Stone, and defeating the last of hells lords. You play as one of six different classes, but ultimately everyone just ends up calling you Nephilim. The story is serviceable it isn't bad, but this isn't the next Lord of the Rings if you know what I mean. For those who've played it time and time again tend to skip all the dialog. It is fully voice acted and has these story drawings inbetween anytime you did something crucial; mostly going through the acts. First timers to this game I would recommend actually listening to the story and diving into it because it is worth at least that. The sound in this game is a lot of background noise honestly. It has the sound effects you'd expect, but no real music to it outside of the CGI cutscenes. The voice acting is anywhere from bad to just barely getting the point across. I played as the Crusader who was a new addition to the game on the PS4, and he sounded like he was reading his lines, not the voice acting you'd expect. The game looks good on the PS4, but if you own this on a previous console it isn't a vast enough improvement to go out and grab a new copy. The gameplay is a dungeon crawler. What I notice throws some gamers off is the top down perspective, if you are one of those people who have seen gameplay and thought that maybe it wasn't for you. Play it. Seriously go out rent, borrow, steal I don't care just get your hands on it because it is damn near instantaneously addictive. The game keeps you playing mainly on the leveling up and the promise of bigger and better loot. The enemies don't serve much of a serious threat for the most part. This is a lot like playing the lottery. Most of the time you will get either crap or maybe something slightly better, but that one time that you get a legendary item than it sets off those endorphins that make you never want to stop. The game is long and with infinite replay value. I've beaten the game on two of the 12 difficulty settings. Each setting doesn't just make the game harder but it gives you better and better loot. The level max is 70 but it doesn't stop there with the paragon levels you can continue to make your character into a unstoppable killing machine. Then you add the Reaper of Souls on this and you get one helluva game experience. It is safe to say Diablo has something that few games are able to muster. I play it for so long my eyes turn bloodshot and I realize that I was dehydrated. Overall while the story is serviceable, and the sound is just noise, the graphics being good for what it is (excluding Blizzard Cutscenes). The gameplay is why people love the Diablo series and if you are new to Diablo 3 or just want to play it again this remastered game will not steer you wrong. I give this a 4.5/5. I leave you fair barbarians with a question. Should Blizzard port, or make more of their games for consoles as well or just stick with PC?. Story and graphics irrelevant, gameplay is excellently addictive, in both singleplayer and couch coop. I've never played a game as boring as this one. Even if you play it with your friends it still not able to entertain.. Diablo 3 is great and must-to-play game. It's polished to perfection slasher and it's enjoyable to play after work and relax because you don't need to think too much while playing - it's all about your reaction and reflexes. The game looks nice and it's pleasant to play. But there is one serious problems - the game requires grinding too much. The world is not massive, in fact there is no open world, just several number of locations. My summary: must-to-play game, but not a masterpiece.. I played the hell out of Diablo II in the 2000's. In my humble opinion, the gameplay suffers of time-aging. Out there there are a lot of games like this one from little studios and this game doesn't offer very much in term of action. I can't even finish it! Maybe it doesn't match my tastes anymore, i prefer From Software games or Ni-Oh. Art style and Design isn't great It has the incredibile looting system and other features improved from the series previous works, rather sometimes i found these frustrating and annoying.. I'd been watching a friend play this a lot lately and decided to just start from the beginning and run through it with him since he kept asking me to play. I had tons of fun getting trophies and actually found some stuff I didn't know was in the game. I almost maxed out my fresh seasonal monk in the process. Demon Hunters and Monks work really well together.. must be one of the best coop games out there, you can play local and online, hours of play.. Probably the most overrated game and the most boring experience ever. Graphics look nice, but smashing 1 or 2 buttons mainly for the whole game is really sad. How can this game have such a high rating?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Diablo 3 Eternal Collection is now the definitive way to play this game, but the Reaper of Souls expansion was so crucial in making D3 not fail like it did in the end game at launch with the ridiculous auction house. Reaper of Souls changed all that, and it was an excellent package. Story was cool, new bosses and areas were great, and the music was awesome. D3 turned from a nightmare into a gloriously addicting grind fest for gear and paragon levels! Just love it to this day. Eternal Collection is on sale for 2 days at Target for $20 and I snatched that up in a heartbeat! Just stinks I have to wait 5 days to pick it up because it wasn't in stock :(. very well made and polished game. I don't normally play this type of game but game Diablo a go and it was great! if this is your type of game im sure you would love it.. Blizzard knows how to make good games for sure. Diablo III is no exception, but as fun as it is, there's no disagreeing that it can and does get tediously repetitive. The game is a blast to play through first, the story being mediocre. Diablo III is a constant grind-fest, but through most of it, you're having fun. The middle of the game is the best part of it, not containing the bleak amount of abilities of the first hours, although they still manage to have some fun, and none of the horrible grinding for one specific item that is the very late game. The middle, for me, is from Act 2 or 3 till the first hundred or so levels of Paragon. Anything beyond that gets more and more redundant. A game that isn't anywhere near perfect, but is still fun to play, and even a blast sometimes.. simply amazing game love the graphics love the effects new characters in series is so amazing there is no weak point in the game but game is bit easy.traps should be more effective and if you just go play on torment+ you just randomly die but just lovley piece of Masterpiece !. I know this is an older game and I know initially this game had a rocky start but playing this game in 2018, I can happily say that its a good game. It’s an easy game to get into, you just sit and start grinding. I regularly talk about Podcasts game on this blog and this is one of the better ones. I do have a confession about this game, I barely paid attention to the story. I initially did, I always try to get into a video game story but the strength of this game is not its story so about halfway I stopped paying attention to it. It didn’t grab me so I just skipped through it. That’s my only criticism. The game feels good, it’s a fun loop, it’s a fun grind and it has a ton of replayability. It’s a game that you can sit down and play for 30 hours or 100+ hours. It has the versatility to allow the player to play until their hearts are content.. Really good game for players who enjoys loot hunting and local coop games. Story is good although not that long but still really good. I just wish the necromancer class was not a separate purchase though but it is what it is, Activision just messed up an almost perfect Diablo game. Thankfully the season updates keep the game fresh and interesting to play again so give it a shot and I guarantee you will enjoy it!. Graphics 10/10 Story 7/10 Game play 8/10 Badassery 10/10 Repetitive, sure but it is the pleasent kind of repetitive, the kind of repetitive grinding that you can actually get used to and really enjoy. I got this when it was about 30$. At this price is totally worth the price.. This game is like very old prostitute and you are a drunk customer. This is feeling after buying and playing this game. It is all about your money. One dollar is OK but more ? No is not worth it. Say no to old prostitute.. It's a shame that the Diablo series has proven unable to improve itself. It started out well with Diablo 1, really well. Diablo 2 is loved by many. But part 3 falls short in too many ways. There are only realy 2 things it has going for it, the first being the many different kinds of attack moves the player can choose from. You get a fair amount of moves on each class and each move can be adjusted (sometimes quite drastically in function and appearance) by 5 runes. The other thing that it has going for it is the interesting loot system, once you get to the endgame that is. Legendary items are fun to collect and extract abilities from to equip through other means as well. Legendary abilities can be quite creative and fun. Everything else about the game falls short, the storytelling, the cutscenes, the graphics, the music. But their biggest sin is the lack of a real challenge in this game. This game lacks any kind of real balance. You see, many games will design a game in such a way that things can actually go wrong because you made a mistake during combat. In Diablo 3, however, if you die it's probably just because you have to pick a lower difficulty level (out of the currently 17 available to you, yes you heard that right). And even if you do die the loss is completely negligible and you can just respawn right where you died. The only time you'll manage to find a challenge anywhere in the game is during rifts where the clock can become your enemy. The player is completely overpowering every enemy in the game, and the enemies fail to ever fight you in a very interesting way. They only really have two ways of attacking.. one of them just being attacking you directly, which you should survive (again, or just lower the difficulty level) the other is with targeting rings (from boss type enemies) on the ground you should avoid. In conclusion, this game does not offer up enough variety in its gameplay to keep the game interesting. The attack moves are fun, and quite varied. But cool attack moves with no real challenge on its own should not make up an entire game. The game being a grind is one thing, but it also being a grind with no real purpose, challenge, or variety.. makes it such a waste of your time.. The Ultimate Diablo Experience- As a day one launch user from the PC days, I can say that the game transitions extremely well for console - to the point where it is easily my preferred method of play for this game. With this edition, all of the updates that have made the game into what it is are available- patches, seasons, etc. If you're a fan of Diablo or ARPGs do yourself a favor and get this game.. Beautiful looking game. Its major problem is how easy it is. The music, the graphics and actual combat are fantastic and on the money but that desired sense of dread just ain't there. It is epic and not at the same time. Yes, I can hike up the difficulty but for me normal is how the games should be played and difficulty should be adjusted accordingly. Gorgeous game all the same.. I really tried to like this because I liked the original one long ago. But how much can you like a game in which you can't die even on the hardest level. It's almost like this game is made to be the next game kids play after Minecraft. It becomes incredibly repetitive very fast. Also the voice acing is terrible.. A bit late but I have finally played it. Diablo 3 is a solid hack-slashed game but not as good as Diablo 2. It run well on PS4. Game mechanic is still fun as always. Storyline is good too. The major problem is the difficulty that is SUPER EASY if compared to Diablo 2 or 1. I played as Barbarian and I wrecked everything in my path like breeze. On normal mode, I never died, no boss can put up a good fight with me. The fight always ended in 3-10 sec. Only the final boss can endure my attack a bit longer than that but still no challenge. If not because I wanted to know the story, I would have quit halfway . I started a second playthough with Wizard on hard mode, it felt better this time but still easy. Diablo 3 ditched out many good mechanics from Diablo 2, such as NO UP SKILL and STAT, no health potion (Drinking potion becomes a skill that has cool down.) No mana potion eithter (it regenerate itself), free town portal and identifying scroll (so what's the point of identification then ?). There are a lot of tools for you too use. Very few AI companions (only 3 from story and 2 are guys), no hiring system anymore. The game is still fun nonetheless, that is why I give it 8/10. I suggest start playing with hard difficulty if you want some little challenges.. Buying the game within Latin America, we can't choose to play the game in English. Congrats Blizzard, what a wonderful choice you made there. .. good game, with a good variety of gear, with a lot of upgrades, a god number of spells per class and all that personalization which the RPG-fans loves. Nice detail in scenarios and monsters, but doesn't reach the level of addiction that bliizard has accustomed us, but it's not that far to get there. Still good game to play solo or multiplayer, and well elaborated classes.. Far too easy. I played as a barbarian, and in the entire 5 acts, I died less than 10 times, and I ended up beating the game on Hardcore II difficulty. Most of the same stuff I enjoyed about previous Diablo games, it just makes it too simple for the player, which eliminates the strategy aspect. No limit on town portals, too many health regeneration buffs and abilities, losing almost nothing when you die, and too frequently finding great items are some of the more major flaws. Another big problem is that it only lets you increase the difficulty to a certain point before you complete Act 4. So, I wasn't able to make the game any harder until I was nearly done with it.. I will describe Diablo III in three words: pointless dungeon crawler. I was a big fan of Diablo 1 and 2 but this?! This is a big disappointment. I can't believe that Blizzard is calling this a Diablo game. Awful job. If you enjoy shallow story, repetitive hack'n'slash and lots of loot, then this game is for you. If you have IQ higher than room temperature then avoid this piece of s***. You've been warned.. I loved Diablo 1 and 2 growing up. I couldn't wait for the remastered ps4 version to come out and when I did it was the first game I got. I've been playing it consistently since the day it released and it still continues to entertain me. Blizzard has given this game a LOT of updates over the years and they finally took care of some of the issues with hacked gear in public servers which plagued the console version since its release, and while hacked gear isn't entirely gone it's been reduced significantly. They finally released Seasons now also so it gives you a reason to level up a new character each season so if you pass a level 70 Greater Rift you get the seasonal rewards which is pretty awesome. It's no easy task passing a level 70 Greater Rift, let me tell you. I have a 600 paragon non seasonal softcore fire wizard that still has trouble doing level 70 GR's. I like the incentive though. The upper ceiling for this game is basically unreachable. They make so many new changes to the gear that a build you have now might be irrelevant in three patches once something better comes out. The constant drive to push just one more greater rift level through new gear with better stat rolls or new paragon levels is what keeps you playing for the long term. Some might get bored, but for me, it's a perfect game to kill an hour on.. Hmm, brought it on pc on it's release. I was disappointed... after how much i liked diablo 2. Anyway.. after reading reviews and costing only 20Euros on psn , i gave it a try on ps4. (Just sold a couple of games cause they were boring to me and couldn't resist playing more that 2-3 hours: gta v, witcher 3 and metal gear solid V. Not that these games are not good, but i played so many similar games in the past.) Anyway.. this game is like it's been made to be played on ps4. I like it a lot in this formula with a big screen.. Extremely boring, repetitive button tapping game. Not challenging in the slightest, so disappointed after reading so many positive reviews. Can't believe people are able to enjoy it.. Really good game with too many complexity for a rpg. Too many hours to play and great gameplay. Maybe the graphics not are the best ones, but they are acceptable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm a fan of Diablo 2. I passed Diablo 2 at all levels of difficulty when I was in school. I was struck by the atmosphere of the dark Middle Ages in the first act. The second act plunged me into the movies of the forties about Sinbad. In the third act, I felt like a medieval Indiana Jones. The fourth act took me to the mysterious Tibet. The developers managed to achieve this effect with realistic stylistics, beautiful symphonic music and attentiveness to the quests. So I was disappointed when I played in Diablo 3. If they did the same thing, just using the new graphics technology, it would be better. But they very much simplified the gameplay and took away all your freedom. Maps have become corridor, now you do not decide where to go (I did not like it yet in the Titan Quest). You can use only those weapons and armor that suit your class. Therefore in the game there are only rudiments of role-playing game. Almost all the objects heal you, and the potions become endless. Therefore, you are ineligible. Even at a high level of complexity, mobs gain more health, but they remain weak. Therefore, play quickly bored. The only challenge that you throw the game - it's boredom. Also the game is very much lost in its own style. The graphics are absolutely unrealistic, the shells are endless. Their size is larger than the main character. Diablo 3 is more like a DotA than on Diablo 2. The plot could not catch me. It was very simple before. But now you just do not care what the NPS say. You read the text, but after a couple of minutes you forget which quest you're performing. But it is not important. Because you still just need to escape and kill boring mobs. I liked the customization of the armor. Very pleased with the cooperative regime. It works well and easily. I liked the new classes. The only pity is that there is no druid (I like to turn into a bear). Also, the game works well for ps4. Using the gamepad is convenient. Although there is a claim to the capture of the goal. Minus one for the causality. Minus one for lack of freedom. Minus one for the lost identity. I'm betting 7. It's annoying.. This is the first Diablo game i ever played and i am very happy with this purchase. Top down hack and slash at it's best with online multi player and with more free content updates than any game i have ever played, make this a must buy game.. This was my first Blizzard game and it is fantastic. I loved playing this game. It's fun, the loot is great and rewardin","besides lacking endgame content, the game is overwhelmingly good . besides lacking in action from start to end, the game was an absolute blast . with the addition of the Reaper of Souls expansion, this version of the game offers plenty of content ."
284.ICO,"Occasional frustrations with the awkward controls and clumsy combat are worth working through to experience such a unique and beautifully crafted puzzle-platformer.. no boring scenes, no texts to read but great story. that was awsome thank you team ico. This is one of the best games ive ever played in my life. I played ICO as a kid and i was fascinated with the graphics and the combat system, although i couldnt complete it beacause of the puzzles difficulty so when i was older(around 11-12 years old) i completed it and it has one of the best endings ive ever seen. IMO its a must play for me and i thank Fumito ueda and his team for making this masterpiece<3. Ico is one of my keystone gaming memories. A haunting story that has stayed with me 23 years later. The music, the world it portrays. A truly epic masterpiece.. Clearly a 10,this game is incredible,it has good.puzzles,good grafics,good difficulty,everything is good! This game have a creative and exciting history,and the musics are very good(when have music) the Yorda dont have a dumb programming,she can answer to all actions of the player,this game has very much bad ratings idk why,but play ico guys. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is the reason why I quit playing with my friend's gaming group. They were so obsessed with trying this ""gem from the past, but guess what, it's a borefest. They all loved it though.. Visually pleasing but that's pretty much all there's to it. It's yet another painful gaming experience people pretend to enjoy to drag more people to the same mistake.. +Unique experience +Very ascetically pleasing ~Atmosphere is driving force for sound ~Many puzzles are visual based ~No direction -AI can be wonky / slow-Castle areas often too dark -Combat can be frustrating and/or tedious. A true work of art, there is nothing like it and there will never be. I played it some years after its release, and before the PS2 was dead. The atmosphere was absolutely unique, I wish there were more games like this.. I'm still giving it a 7 because the game has beautiful graphics, good gameplay and a rousing soundtrack other than that it's 90% walking and solving puzzles. Atmospheric and beautiful 3D platform game that sees you guiding a helpless damsel in distress through monster infested castles. Enemies can feel a bit more like a nuisance than a threat but the intriguing storyline and lovely visuals make for a rather unique experience.. + Settings + Gameplay and puzzles + Art direction + Ambient sounds + Music + Plot + The castle is wonderfully interconnected + The relationship between Ico and Yorda who do not know each other and do not understand why they do not speak the same language, but who help each other to continue and escape from the castle + The feeling of making you feel small compared to the environment around you that give you some camera shots + No icon and Hud screen that makes you completely immerse in the environment and the game world + The places of the castle you see in the game you will reach them during the game and from different places you will review the places you have already visited because the castle is wonderfully interconnected + Perfect duration for the game type + Unlockable extra content once the game is over - None For me it’s crazy to think that Ico came out in 2001 and it was an incredible game for the time and it’s incredible even now, also it’s crazy how they made a game like that more than 20 years ago and that is still very enjoyable today. For my one of the best games of all time and one of my favorite games.. SHADOW OF THE CUCKOLD MAN BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game was played via the official emulator in its original PS2 version. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA: The game begins, as usual of Fumito Ueda, the lead designer of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian, with a mysterious silent Cutscene depicting the protagonist in the middle of a journey to an immense castle by the sea. As per his style, the whole thing comes across as extremely mysterious and open to interpretation. This is remarked by the language that the protagonist will speak, namely a made-up language, similar to Japanese, with reverse sentences. With the same mysteriousness as the intro, the game explains its mechanics; There is, in fact, no tutorial; the player will have to try his hand from the start in what is a puzzle game with hints of sword fighting. Just ahead of the initial area the little cuckolded man will free and get acquainted with a young girl, little older than herself, imprisoned in what looks like a birdcage. From there on, Ico's goal, and the player's accordingly, will be to discover the history of this castle, and to get the girl and himself outside the immense walls that separate them from the sea. EMBRACE YOUR STICK: The gameplay of Ico turns out to be as simple as it is intuitive. The basic parkour is well aroused by the genre of the game, the paths to follow being very intuitive, except for a few chaotic smears in which a player will rarely waste time finding the correct path. Puzzles remain very basic ranging from moving crates to operating levers to open paths. Combat, on the other hand, is very repetitive, consisting of few attacks and animations, and a couple of weapons that stand out only by their aesthetics and damage. The story is linear, allowing the player to retrace his steps whenever he wants, but leaving little freedom for exploration. The mechanic that gives the game a huge prominence is that of the girl, who will be an interacting character and not just a static NPC; in fact, the goal will always be to take her by the hand to drag her through the most difficult situations, creating easy passages for her thanks to puzzles, and defeating the enemies who will try to kidnap her. All this is of course balanced by impassable walls without the young girl, and the impossibility of saving to the game except in pairs. A wonderful little treat is the box art, which, at least in the Japanese version, represents a famous painting by painter Giorgio De Chirico. A SPRINGY SIGHT: The difficulty of evaluating a game played 20 years after its release is insane, but it is indisputable that Ico was a standard in its scene, with excellent and pleasing graphics even in modern times. The use of dull, gray colors makes the sight of bright colors such as green and blue a wonderful and exciting contrast. The animations are smooth and extremely natural, so much so that they impressed me in the foreground. Finally, the greatest virtue, from which many games should take a cue, concerns the camera; it, relying on the automatic one, turns out to be practically always perfect, engaging and suitable for every situation, following prominent cinematographic and directorial canons. HEARING DISTANT SCREAMS: The audio side of the game could be a very contestable point, as here too Ico stands out from the crowd, with little more than 3 in-game OSTs; most of the adventure is shrouded in silence, accompanied by chirps, gusts of wind, and bursts of grass. The ensemble creates an atmosphere of solitude and tranquility unique to the game and rarely seen in other titles. BUT WHY 9? PROS: Ico turns out to be one of those timeless gems. Even played after its 20th anniversary it turns out to be perfect in certain aspects and even undefeated in others, such as the already discussed camera. From the review itself it is easy to infer the merits and so no further information is necessary. CONS: The cons belong to small details that could be dictated by time and the inevitable aging of the video game. The biggest flaw is also related to the biggest virtue, namely the camera; it is not compulsorily automatic, but will be controllable by the player, in a way however, extremely unpleasant to the eye; the main sensation you get from using it is that it is like tied with a rubber band, and that it bounces every time you try to turn it. Combat is as already mentioned extremely repetitive, and the aesthetics of the enemies are of little consequence. The rest of the flaws found are superfluous and certainly given by the aging of the title, and it would therefore be pointless to criticize them. RATING Gameplay: 9 Music: 7 Story: 8 Art Direction: 10 _. Intuitive, dynamic and engaging puzzles organically lead players through the lonesome atmospheric environments of a wonderfully interconnected, imposing yet peaceful castle, while the threat posed by perilous platforming and hostile creatures create a delightful feeling of dread in spite of the simplistic combat, especially thanks to a perfectly placed checkpoints. A scarcely replayable but memorable journey where gameplay and story intertwine with powerful, mesmerizingly immersive results.. Simple yet genius. Ugly yet marvelous. Meaningless yet deep. Boring yet exciting. Outdated yet up-to-date. Goofy yet perfect. Forgotten yet legendary.. A Masterpiece. Beautiful story, you really become invested in the characters ICO and Yorda. The scenery is gorgeous and the level design great, good puzzles and obstacles. Controls are a little but clunky at times and the camera can be a bit unpredictable, but you soon become used to how it works! It's from the ps2 era so it isn't going to be perfect lol. Overall the storytelling, characters and puzzles outweigh the bad. A must play.. Short but sweet. ICO continues so much story just by its sheer environment.. An action/adventure title from the same era as Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, from which it seems to take a lot of inspiration. But it does everything differently, like Jackie Chan describing his approach compared to Bruce Lee. And the end result is almost as good. Subdued an melancholic where Prince of Persia was bombastic and cinematic.. The biggest issue here is the camera that affects the controls so directions are not accurate especially for free jumps it can be frustrating at some points and yorda is very slow especially climbing and descending ladders and she doesn't follow properly unless you hold her hand, the game has almost identical puzzles mirrored in the left and right part of the castle. level design, visuals and sound are amazing. The true enemy of Ico is the enemy of most PS2 era games... The camera. Be prepared to repeat puzzles over and over again due to camera error. Ico clumsy, bulky controls, while endearing to the character, don't lend themselves well to actually enjoying the game. This is one that once I complete it, I'll certainly never return to it.. A cool story, but would imagine it doesn't hold up well today. I'd play a remake/sequel though.. The game was too sick. there's sj in the game, like cmon free up my guy, Travis Scotts my guy with the burger but the feminism allow that but pls allow it this ain't pokemon but nobody beats Goku, but kar98 is the best still, one-shot some kill.. The most haunting game I ever play, a piece of art, doesn't like other popcorn culture games nowadays.. Still holds up in 2021 I recommend this game to anyone. Would love it to get the same treatment collous recently got.. One of the best games i've ever played. From the mechanics to the environment to the characters to the level design, everything is so unique and emotionally overwhelming. Fumito Ueda is one of the best game directors and imo this is his best creation. Ico will forever live in my mind. 10/10. It's like a game in which a typical Japanese boy is the main character. It also feels like a legend of Zelda. I feel like I've become the main character in a fairy tale. It's a very well-made game, but it's too bad because it's an old game. I hope it will be released again on Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 4.. There was never a game ilke ICO when it was released and only a few since (most of which were directly influenced by or paid homage to ICO - hello Rime!). It's combination of level design, animation and story-telling are things I've not seen matched in any other game. Players can take as much or as little as they want to from this play experience and, for me personally, ICO will always be a lovely vignette into a world I revisit every few years. Look beyond the date controls and camera scheme for this game that was launched in the early 2000s and you will be treated to a unique fairytale love story and creative partner-puzzle-solving experience.. A beautiful game, though a bit too empty to score higher than an eight. It's a beautiful story though.. I played this game in my ps3 and, well, I can't speak about the plot but the gameplay... Maybe it's because I feel too much the difference between ps2 games and ps4 games but I found it difficult and when you die you have to do part of the game again. Really, I don't have that pacience. Maybe when we were younger we were that pacient but not any more. At least me. I think Shadow of the Colossus will be better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such a great game that allows the player to figure out everything on their own and really explore the world. The only downside is that it is a very short game but everything is done really well. Embarked with ambient environments, brain busters, an arguably straightforward combat system and a story to remember, comes 2001's ""Ico"" a game exclusive to the PlayStation brand that can only be delivered with the comfort of it's controls on the DualShock controller. If you're a fan of unheavy complexion in video games, It's fair to say your chances of enjoying this game could come natural considering it takes a bit more than just the average IQ to progress in all stages of this game. There hasn't been a single puzzle believed to be the end of the road, if you utilize and understand your options, the game aids but doesn't baby you throughout the story. As mentioned before, the DualShock controller is your only tool to help you on your journey to beating Ico. Considering your options in this game, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase the game with the assumption that the controls might be too overwhelming or difficult to understand, this is the kind of game your entire family can enjoy with minimal effort. I can't say I've been disappointed. All things considered, I've come to realize that Ico was a game going out of the typical comfort zone of puzzle games and delivering a solution to a complex issue without being afraid to introduce the use of prior knowledge or backtracking as well as having the free-will to let your mind run wild as you try your best to find out what happens next. Style points for being oddly unique from the opening intro, menu system, overall battle presentation and feel of the game but perhaps a little too unique for my taste. At times, it does feel that some elements may come across as repetitive and sometimes even very slightly unnecessary but viewing it from a designer's perspective, it's easy to see these elements are present to preserve the dramatization of it's scenes but that's just a case of nitpicking if that kind of stuff matters to you. As you'll come to find out, the story runs deep and it's characters undoubtedly memorable. It's not a story understood primarily through logic but rather through sentiment and justice is served to the environments, the characters, it's system and the way it portrays it's unique puzzles. All in all, this game will leave you with very few words to describe it's experience and I couldn't have designed it's visuals better myself even if I tried.. It’s an inspiring piece of art, but not a great game. The game’s music and style is strange, but beautiful. It creates a very unique, mysterious atmosphere. The reason why I give this game a ”low” score is because of the lacking gameplay. The game is VERY frustrating to play as it has segments where you fight shadow monsters while ALSO escorting another character. Everyone hates escort missions and this one should not be able to pass the judgement. The game would be a lot better if it either removed the shadows or if the girl you’re escorting could actually protect herself instead of running around like a stupid chicken. In my opinion the game is actually not that great, but I definitely think that it’s worth to play the game for the ending alone. Yes, the ending is amazing.. The entire game is an escort quest. An ESCORT QUEST. The worst video game idea since quick time events. The combat is clunky and unsatisfying, the controls are loose and floaty, the camera is an absolute chore to control, and the graphics are subpar, even on the HD bundle on PS3. It's an annoying game that I strongly recommend against. Just skip it.. Ico is a puzzle-platformer and action-adventure video game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Ico and Yorda Mechanics + Fun Puzzles + Emotional. Even if its old take the opportunity to play this amazing game. It simply is outstanding and teaches a lesson the not so many developers understand: art and story overcome the technical shortcomings. This basically means that replaying it over a decade after its development it is still worth the time and kids loved it. Cannot wait to play the last guardian.. Ico is a puzzle-platformer and action-adventure video game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Ico is primarily a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle.These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open. Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game.. I was amazed seeing why this game is popular, im surprised i havnt forgotten this game along with sotc, its in my memory, i liked it, wasnt that bad, confusing though. I just can't believe this game is 15 years old. I played it on its release year and I haven't found another title that made me feel like ICO still makes me feel. This is such a haunting experience that it will stay with you quite for a long time - I don't feel any other title will ever be a match to the kind of powerful little (enormous) thing that ICO is. No Shadow of Colossus, not any. No other game will be as poetic and eerie and powerful and breathtaking. Do I need to say again it is 15 years old? Do I need to refer the massive changes gaming had in a decade, let it alone in a decade and a half? But ICO is still to this day the best, innovative, and stunning games ever designed - unique too. Just play it.. + clever puzzles and world design + The relationship between the characters + moving and engaging story told in very few cutscenes - Short - Frustrating A.I. - Repetitive Combat. This is what fantasy gaming is supposed to be... immersive, whimsical storytelling with little to no dialogue. The Hero's Journey incarnate, and still to this day— unique. Well done.. Everyday im moving towards this type of game, less or no item usage, simple gameplay (but complex in its own way) and very atmospheric, like a surreal ethereal experience. At first thought this was going to be another zelda clone, and while its inspired by it, is a complete different thing. My only grip is the controls, but they are not that bad, dont kill the experience at all. Cannot recommend this enough, just go and play it if you haven't is one of those games you'll treasure and keep for your grandchildren to play. Timeless almost masterpiece.. I don't get the hype for this ****,it is innovative but deeply flawed at the same **** game is basically a giant ""escort"" **** are put in the shoes of a boy sentenced to imprisonment/death because he has horns.Soon after you meet up with a girl and besides the fact they don't understand each-other,decides to break her free as **** have to get ou **** castle,solving many environmental puzzles in the way and fighting off ""shadow creatures"",you have no health bar and only fail if you fall a great height of if your companion is captured...First off,the **** game presents a great atmosphere where you really feel alone and **** thats about it. For a game with so much emphasis on platform,the mechanics feels dated (even for its time) and ****'ll miss jumps a lot,and it plays very awkwardly **** lack of any kind of checkpoint (except for the end of the game) make the fails just more ****'t believe the hype.This is a short and flawed game within it's **** a online walk trough,it will spare you the frustration and you get to see the beautiful **** the context of it's time,i give it a 6.5/10. This game is a visual treat. It can be fantastic too, if you completely forgive Yorda's dumb AI. Needless to say, the game is good. Frustrating, but good. I LOVED this game, with capital letters. I can't pin down one thing why I love this game, it's probably the superb atmosphere that is spread around the environment, the whole mystery why you're there, the exploration, the sense of isolation, the simple yet provocative mission of saving a girl. There are so many things that this artsy game gets right, the gameplay, the combat, the exploration, the mystery. This game is definitely not for everyone. If you're a battlefield or Call of Duty player and love those games, then this game is not for you. If you love fast paced action games, then this game is not for you, so don't bother playing and writing a review, because there's not going to be any weight to it. This is a game for those that take their time, want to explore every nook and cranny of the castle you're put in to explore, those that like to decipher the story without it being force fed to you. The emotional attachment that goes on after leading a companion around the castle happens naturally, and a sense of loss can happen if you are separated for a bit. I love this game because it takes a risk in telling a simple story, and it succeeds gloriously.. ICO is a beautiful game. You play as a young boy named Ico, who has been taken from his home village and imprisoned in a castle because his horns bring bad luck to the townsfolk. Upon being imprisoned a tremor causes your cell to collapse and you begin your journey to escape from the castle. You soon encounter a young girl named Yorda who glows pure white and speaks in a different language to you. Through means of physical contact and trust you must guide yourself and Yorda through the castle to escape. However a dark Queen wishes Yorda to stay and so you must battle the shadows to stop them from taking Yorda from you. The game looks absolutely stunning for an early PS2 game, extremely large environments, next to no loading times, highly detailed world and a beautiful soundtrack to match. ICO is a game everyone must experience, young or old, gamer or not. Every few years a game comes along that defines why gaming exists...this is one of them.. Beautiful story but the gameplay is horrible. It's full of bugs, and because of that simple movements turn to frustrating replays of the same area that you have to play again. But for a game like this is worthy.. just played this game after playing show of the colossus, and this game is nothing like it. i had high expectations for this game and this game didn't reach reach them by a milestone. this game didn't age very well, the gameplay and story is nothing special compared to shadow. the puzzles (for me) were way too hard, i might be dumb but i was stuck on each puzzle for a good 20 minutes each and it got annoying and repetitive for me. graphics are amazing for its time ill give it that, you'll be looking around and seeing the environments and what you're about to do next. if you've played show of the colossus first, dont expect the same here because it is not.. I really wanted to love this game completely. What I did love about it was the gorgeous architecture and the simplistic gameplay. I loved how this was a game where you had to figure out what to do completely on your own. This was one of the most brutally challenging adventure puzzles I've ever played and the puzzles were really brain scratching. The things that broke the experience for me was the unresponsive controls and ai of yorda. Most of the game I'd be cursing the controls and her ai which turned the experience more into a grueling chore than an immersion into another world. Throughout the game, just getting Ico to turn the right away or jump the right way was an infuriating pain in the ass that made me want to smash the controller repeatedly into the ground. The hit detection for the monsters was also very annoying. If the controls had been tight and responsive, I would have game this game a 10. Because this game really is an artpiece and I wish people could see how mature and artistic games could be. Unfortunately, I'm afraid this game would turnoff a lot more nongamers than get them interested in gaming. No doubt, this game has/will have a cult following, but if it ever wants to reach masterpiece status, it will have to work on its clumsy controls, since controls are the foundation ****.. Ico may be a little bit un-attractive at first glance. The box art features an ugly little kid on the front holding a stick, and on the back it says ""solve the puzzles or join the tourmented souls forever."" It embraces the fact that it is a puzzle game, and you might dismiss it for that. Even if you are a fan of puzzle games, you might turn your head and look at all of the other puzzle games that might possibly be good. But I will tell you right now: ICO is a truly immersive, rewarding, magical experiance that you will remember for the rest of your life. Indeed, its games like this that make people go into deep thought at what they experienced, and very few games have ever effected me emotionaly; made me care about the characters; made me feel so satisfied; made me so awe struck. ICO is truly an experience that no developer could ever duplicate. The story of ICO is very minimaland barley there, but is so intruiging and mysteryious that I can say it is one of my favorite video game plots ever, right up there with Final Fantasy VII, and Shadow of the Colossus. You play as ICO, a boy who was born with the curse of horns on his head, and is considered a bad omen among his village, and so he is banished to a castle as a sacrifice left to die, but a small tremor sets him free of his prison, and he tries to find a way out of the castle when he meets Yorda, a girl who was trapped in a cage before Ico rescued her, and is being hunted by shadow demonds, who plan to kidnap her. Ico and Yorda go about the castle together and try to find an exit and escape the castle. You might think that this story is really simpilistic, but the story goes on after that point, and I won't say anything because spoiling the game is the last thing I want to do to you guys, and the story is just as good as you make it out to be. As you play the game, you start to build some sort of connection to Yorda and feel the need to protect her. It's things like this that make me truly care about the charcaters, instead of finding them annoying and uninteresting (*coughahemfinalfantasyXcoughahem*). The chracters are as deep as you want them to be. Take ICO for example: He is a boy who is looked down on as a cursed child, hated and feared by everyone, maybe even his parents, and having to go through life with all of this must have been a nightmare for poor ICO. I could go on and on, but I think its time for the gameplay. ICO is a puzzle game, with platform elements in the mix, and you have to examine the enviorment around you to solve the puzzles to succede. While doing this, you also need to find a path for Yorda, as she cannot do athletic things that Ico can do, and you need her to open certain doors that Ico cannot. Each puzzle is well designed and requires a lot of examination and thinking to solve, although some puzzles can be really stupidly annoying just because the game didn't explain how the controls work. How was I supposed to know that I had to press O to swing on a chain? It is satisfying to complete a puzzle that had you stumped for so long, and then you find out what to do gives a great sense of accomplishment. Occasionaly, Shadow demonds come out of holes in the ground and try to capture Yorda, which leads to combat. I'll be blunt for the sake of time: Combat is button mashing, but you do get a sense of fright when these mosters come, and it works. Moving on. The graphics for the game are breath-taking!!! I'm serious, it's suprising that Sonic UNleashed, a PS2 game that was released as a wii port in 2008, doesn't compare to ICO, a game released in 2001, a year after the PS2 launched. The lighting, camera angles, animation and detail all combine to make one fantastic looking game. I spent a good amount of time stopping and staring at the game's backgrounds, and getting lost in the scenery. The music, while like the plot, is small and barley there. A majority of the time, all you'll hear is the clmaping of your sandals, wind or birds chirping. But the rare moment music does appear, it's well done. I love the saving theme music, the acoustic intro music and the main ending theme, ""You Were There"". But ICO, in my opinion, didn't really need music in it's levels. I would have much rather have the silence that the game provides me, and it works remarkably well. However, ICO isn't as perfect as I make it out to be. I already mentioned the combat, but the control feels a bit clunky, and jumps feel floaty. Its not that big of an issue though, the control is tolerable. However, the lack of replay value isn't ICO took me a good 9 hours to beat, which is a satisying length, but once you beat the game, there is no reason to ever pick it up again. There is no unlockable artwork, sound test, nothing. I probably won't pick this game up again until years later when I've forgotten most of the puzzles. Bottom line, no game has affected me more than ICO has. It touched me emotionally, and no game has ever done that before. You will be amazed.. Ico runs in the same vein as Shadow of the Colossus, all titles of the cult classic churning development team, Team Ico. The plot is subtle, yet deep, and you get the feeling as Ico - our protagonist - saves the princess in need Yorda from the evil Queen of the Castle, that you're the part of something much larger than yourself and the characters on the screen. What is this castle? What is the backstory behind Ico, Yorda, the Queen, and the mysterious people who take Ico to the is","ico is one of my keystone gaming memories . the music, the world it portrays. a truly epic masterpiece . visual pleasing but that's pretty much all there's to it ."
285.Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,"Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter was ahead of its time, and still hold up gameplay wise today. While its story is straight forward, it is from a time when Tom Clancy games were grounded in a realm of realism.. This game was the first game i had for 360, along with elder scrolls 4, and wow, what the visual masterpiece it was. The gameplay was extremely fun as well. This was full tactical on 360. Nothing short of a 9. This game was ahead of its time on console.. Still plays OK after all these years, but I found the colonialist - the-empire-is-always-right agenda of the solo campaign quite hard to swallow. And the B movie flair doesn't help at all, it just makes it more obvious and painful.. It was an OK tactical shooter when it was released, nothing special but what it did, it did it well.. What I remember about this game is that this is when Tom Clancy games Peaked. This Game was gritty, realistic, difficult and definitive of the series. The Multiplayer was very sweaty and the Story is pretty much an exactly the peak of tech in the early 2000s very cool shooter. much dope.. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter was one of best new games to come out on the 360. The best part of the game was the multiplayer that I put many hours into with my friends.. Just bought this game and I must say that this game was pretty hard for me. If you are a beginner to the GRAW series, this game is challenging. Graphics are superb and sound is awesome. Only reason I give it a 8/10 is because one headshot and you're dead.... It was one of the first next-gen game in terms of graphics and it was also a solid campaign, with classic gameplay for the Ghost Recon franchise, but I think that the fact it was ahead of its time technically hide some of its defaults and now in 2015 those defaults are a true problem to the global experience. First the IA of the allies is way under what you would expect from a tactical shooter, and they really pissed me off in hard mode. Two there was a lot of bugs in the game (screen going black for a few seconds, disappearance of the HUD, not working checkpoints, etc...). And for those two reasons my experience about the game is very mixed when your teammates doesn't screw up and you have no bug it's an enjoyable tactical shooter, but sometimes it was just a task to advance. I would advice to buy Advanced Warfighter 2 or some Rainbow Six Vegas before this game. This game had quite a few interesting ideas and mechanics but for the most part they could do with a bit of polish for example the use of support units, this makes the game seem like you can and must take a tactical approach to levels, however the limited control means that more often than not your support units do little more than cover your flank. In my opinion this campaign was all about caution and patience, two things which quickly dissipate in a (realistic) shooter game where one shot can kill. Whilst I think the game may have been a bit of fun when it was released, 7 years late I don't feel like it is worth going back too, Also I have to note I am not against tactical shooters as a whole, I played the original ghost recon on xbox and loved it.. Far from **** from horrible. It is a middle of the road shooter with all the tell-tale problems that are significantly more noticeable in FPS's. The controls are clunky and without sharp controls in an FPS, it can never be a great game. The graphics were dated and the friendly A.I. was terrible. Forcing myself to finish the single player campaign was tedious and not fun.. With its beautifully digitalized interpretation of warfare, its fairly interesting story, and that always-successful Tom Clancy seal of approval, ""Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter"" renders itself an incredibly enjoyable shooter.. TCGRAW its traditionally a perfect example of what is a tactical war-game in a way that makes you think you're intelligent and smart to carefully move and take care of your platoon. Ignoring the graphical aspect , GRAW is marvelous.. Decent game with good graphics at the time. I was disappointed with the fact that i couldn't switch between first and 3rd person camera. Great gameplay and cover system. Multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired. It is obvious that the majority of the production went into the single player mode. A lot of fun.. Great addition to the Tom Clancy series. This is the best 360 game in my opinion to date. (2011) You love it or you hate it. Loved the multiplayer, Co-op and the Singleplayer was just amazing.. When this was first released, it was one of the best games ever made, but it's been put in perspective a few years later, which is what this review is based on. I had a lot of fun playing this game, but there were so many unforgiving points that made your replay sections over and over again. The multiplayer was compelling but they removed the cover system and it also looked far worse than the singeplayer for whatever reason. It's an interesting game, but these days doesn't really hold up.","this was an OK tactical shooter when it was released, nothing special but what it did, it did it well . the multiplayer was very sweaty and the Story is pretty much an exactly the peak of tech in the early 2000s very cool shooter . if you are a beginner to the GRAW series, this game is challenging . graphics are superb and sound is awesome ."
286.World of Goo,"I would've given it 5 just because there is nothing innovative, but the price is just too high. Anything above $15 for an indie game is a scam.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A charming, physics-based puzzle game. For my taste, the constructions are sometimes too wobbly due to the movements of the Goos, so you have to try out a lot.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Time and time again I have tried to give this game my attention, but despite at least a couple dozen attempts to go through this game, I just don't find it interesting enough to dedicate the time. It's a shame, as I can tell it is well made, but it simply feels too slow and lifeless for my liking.. World of Goo is a physics based puzzle / construction game. The millions of Goo Balls that live in the beautiful World of Goo don't know that they are in a game, or that they are extremely delicious. [2D Boy]. A puzzle game where you can kind of bluff your way through. I don't think it's that good though.. Cool and wholesome artstyle and music. Creative puzzles and challenging optional achievements.. 9/10 ️ - Amazing (after completing the game several times) Incredibly fun to play. Sticking glutes together and creating structures out of them is incredibly addictive!. Cool mechanics and interesting game as fot its ganre.Totally recommend among others.. Very cute and funny. Everything is done with the mind and knowledge of their business, so it is very difficult to break away from the game. I like it.. It's a fun and well-thought-out puzzle game. The graphics are OK, and the gameplay is simple, but it's also plain and short of unique.. A great opportunity to smear yourself with glue, which acts in accordance with simplified, but still physical laws. Works perfect on Ubuntu 18.04. Notebook with Intel HD Graphics 4400 is enough.. Great game with interesting gameplay and a dark story. --------------------. The quintessential indie game. Artsy, ambitious, different, fun. I can't say anything bad about this game. Some of the levels are frustrating, but that's part of the indie charm. The music, art style, concept are all incredible. Get this game.. A unique and fun puzzle game, with an addictive gameplay and even a pretty interesting background story.. Still a pretty good and fun game in terms of mechanics, atmosphere and writing. But it didn't age well and doesn't seem to have gotten any updates in the last decade. It still works (Steam version) but everything is low and outdated resolutions and aspect ratios stretched to modern screen, the chapter screen numbers are broken and show a white outline, etc. It's really unpleasant to look at right now, and you have to sit as far away form your monitor as possible. But the game itself is still fun, and a great way to spend an afternoon.. One of the best indie puzzle game of all-time. It's highly addictive, and basically it's a must play.. I dont see any special in this game. It is almost a mini game and in comparison to other puzzle game this didnt catch me so much like Portal or The Talos Principle. Here you have no story, no intro. Just a gameplay that is even very basic in comparison to the 2 I mentioned above. In addition you dont know, how the goos will affect your construct before setting it, so you have a trial and error problem here. After few levels I deinstalled it.. 8.5 out of 10 I played the demo that only had core mechanics, sounds and nothing else and it still was good. Full game adds some actual goals, different levels, stylish cutscenes and great humor.. World of Goo is like Lemmings with goo balls and that's a good thing: the game is funny, has a pleasing soundtrack and is a decent challenge for those that aren't familiar with puzzle games in general. However, World of Goo is up against a lot of competition in the indie puzzle game market nowadays and while it may have been a rising star almost 10 years ago, it's not really the case now. Also, the unpredictable nature of the goo balls can be off-putting at times, so much so it might actually lead you astray in terms of finding solutions.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Brilliant game. When I was young, I would come home to this on my Wii and I would play it forever. My parents had to force me to get off of it. And when I beat the game, once I reset the game it was still the same fun as it was each time I played it again. And it being on steam just makes me filled with nostalgia. World of goo permanently has a place in my heart, and in my soul.. It was excellent but with the flaw that the dialogue/text from the signs were too cheesy to the point of ridiculousness, so no 10 because of that. Other than that the design of the game was stellar. The difficulty was neither too hard to become very frustrating, neither too easy to become boring, the perfect balance ,it's rare to find such perfection in difficulty balance in puzzle games, bravo.. This is just a artsy bridge builder game like the many flash based games that came before it. Where most bridge builders are designed to mimic reality, this one opts for a funny premise of trying to free goos who are stuck in pipes and such. It adds levels with obstacles and different building parts to overcome them (no different than bridge builders in that respect). Ultimately however, it is a very short and simple game with practically no replay value. I honestly had more fun with some free bridge builders on my phone especially ones that required you support trucks that have to cross. This one does have its own unique charm given the premise but that is just not enough to overcome the boredom factor for me. That said, most normal folks might find it more fun that I did and given how cheap it is now, its probably worth trying for most folks.. This game is really good. The levels are solid, the music is great and it looks beautiful. The game is a bit short but that's to be expected from an indie game. A sequel would be appreciated.. Very nice physics puzzle game. You have some sticky balls, you should build a net with them to let those balls exit the level through a tap. Some puzzles are pretty interesting, but after the first couple of worlds the game quickly becomes less interesting.. Tier 1 + Just good simple fun, pinnacle of physics construction gameplay + Offers a lot of unique mechanics and levels that gives good staying power ? Quirky world and ""story"" can get a little tiresome. PROS: (1) Nice production quality: solid animation & musical score, with humorous touches here and there. (2) Original gameplay idea, though I prefer the approach taken by ""Bridge Constructor"" for the iPad, which has similar gameplay probably inspired by this. (3) Great value: I purchased this for the price of a coffee. CONS: (1) I found success often comes down to trial-and-error, which is inevitably less satisfying. (2) Needing to build quickly before the whole structure collapses can be more frustrating than fun -- success often felt highly dependent on chance/good luck in those cases. (3) The controls can be frustratingly unreliable -- and especially frustrating when time is of the essence and you end up repeatedly selecting the wrong type of ""goo ball"" to use. CONCLUSION: Despite its high production values & originality, I can only recommend this to those who are willing to overlook the aforementioned gameplay flaws: you need to be OK with mindlessly hacking away at a problem over and over until something sticks. I need to feel that success or failure in a game is entirely dependent on my own skill level.. A vanguard work of art still rooted in old videogame conventions. The Good: Artstyle, cutscenes and music are phenomenal; sharp humor and smart twists The Bad: Controls and physics doesn't match the game's difficulty Raised upon a little physics proof-of-concept (called Tower of Goo, still available for download in the old 2D Boy's site) World of Goo was a major agent of the indie takeover 7 years ago. Much like many of its contemporaries it gets half the job astoundily well done--the artsy one--but doesn't quite nail the core gameplay content that smartly. On the bright side there's plenty to be proud of: presentation overall is plain superb--both music and graphics are a testimony of a very cohesive art direction--and everything sums up nicely to serve the plot--or at least the philosophic dialogue it proposes if we can't agree it has a proper plot. On the other hand the developers couldn't help restricting the player's resources as if it was a classic hardcore game. Physics here are way too loose to ask the player the precision and swiftness the levels so constantly demand, goo balls are often too limited in number and as they grow in variety it gets tougher to pick the right one from the crowd, and checkpoints (despite the smart ""undo"" concept) work poorly. (Using OCDs for triggering Achievements sits on top of that as well.) The game sometimes try to make up for those frustration moments by offering alternate paths in the maps but they're often useless since it eventually forces you to get back to the avoided levels before allowing you to progress anyway. World of Goo weights in the ""games as art"" debate but does so by improving the usual external assets related to that instead of improving interactivity--the main feature that makes the medium unique for exploring new forms of art.. Amazingly cute game with clever puzzles, outstanding art style and soundtrack that offers genuinely fun gameplay. Definitely a game I would recommend for young and mature gamers. I completed the game multiple times, and then went for the OCD challanges. I can't seem to get tired of this game! I'd love to see some expansion or continuation for it at some point.. World of Goo is one of those games that fill a category hole you never thought existed. ""A comedy-structure building 2D platformer? You know what, I do need that in my life!"" However, under its simple premise as a 2D puzzle-platformer, it also harbours a fantastic mix of an up-beat and atmospheric soundtrack, and great landscapes. The story is minimal, but it is relayed to you from the witty and notorious Sign Painter, who always has something to say, either about gameplay hints, or about philosophical musings of the goo-balls themselves. These goo-balls are guided by your mouse, as you pick them up and place them strategically to form beam-like structures, to be able to reach your goal (a suction pipe in a difficult to reach place, most often). You'll come across goo-balls that behave differently, in changing environments. It will test your resolution towards the later areas of the game, and there are the harder challenges in each level for the completionists out there. 8 goo balls out of 10.. This was my first ever pc game. No other pc game has ever mounted up to, or even gotten close to how awesome this game is. I love every aspect about it, and I played it until 10:00 PM to get the next level. Wow. Amazing OST, smooth gameplay, and SCREW not being able to customize it fully. It's Perfect the way it is.. I had previously reviewed the Wii version. Now that I have the PC version too, I think it's safe to say that there really isn't much of a difference. Pros: Online leaderboards and achievements Cons: No multiplayer, unlike the Wii. Still, great indie title. 8/10. I didn't enjoy it at **** was stunning for the first 2 minutes... then I realized that it wad ****'t bother it's not a game.U won't enjoy it as puzzle game. Short game, cheap game, and worth a try. Some puzzles are challenging, and require skill. The whole concept is a good idea and you'll have fun as long as it lasts.. Beautiful game. Gameplay is straightforward and fun. Art design is adorable yet stylish. Well the music ... give the atmosphere another great boost! This is the kind of game will always stay in my hard-disk. People who can't take a little challenge in a casual indie game? Well, there's a genre of games called ""interactive fiction"". This game is an old-school click-point-build game. It utilizes the ""stretchiness"" of goo to make you think about your blob placements. I would be lying if i said it wasn't strategic and thought-provoking. I bought it on Wii for the high rating about 2 years ago, and I re-purchased it on Steam sale just now. I beat it then, and I intend to beat it again (albeit Wii controller is much harder than mouse controls, aka if you are considering computer purchase, you have no reason not to buy.) This game is so good, thought-wise (physics), good music, good SFX, good concept, challenging (but not without retries), innovative, and fun. I will say it is rather bland and dark, but it is extremely rewarding in its gameplay. However I cannot give it above a 7-8 because it doesn't take more time than that to complete the game.. For an indi game its awesome and very fun. Game uses unique mechanics, giving you puzzles to solve. I reccomend this! By the way, there are discounts for it in Steam atm.. The physics are great and the prospect seems fantastic… But, I just despise it! Now don’t take that the wrong way because the game looks great (aside from the complete lack of resolution options) has an interesting objective and is a new experience for the puzzle genre… It just really annoys me beyond belief because this is too difficult and too frustrating for a puzzle greenhorn like myself! I have never really liked games that have a fundamental principal of making you think! I don’t think too good! I really can only recommend this game to puzzle game fans and those who enjoy building stable structures out of goo balls…. Best Indie Game Ever If you havent played that game so you made a great mistake of all your gaming life The music ,,the art the gameplay its a deep experience that you will never forget. It seems the general consensus for this game is ""You love it or you hate it"". I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either: World of Goo is a cute, original indie game with a good set of graphics, but it never hits the nail on the head. It's pretty, yeah, but pretty forgettable too.. You can't say you didn't have fun with this game, really, it's hard. Lovable art styles fun and challenging puzzles with a great soundtrack as well. There are also 'challenge modes' on each levels called OCDs, these are challenging and a worthy challenge. I would get this game on the pc rather than on the iPhone though. Either way, two thumbs up.. World of goo is a sweet and charming, yet a powerful and engrossing experience. The art and overall character is engaging, and the music is sublime. The story, while quite simple, works well to draw you in to the world, but never upstages the experience. The story even takes a few moments to explore some deeper issues such as beauty and ethics, if that sort of thing appeals to you. But if all you want is a simple physics puzzler, this game will also deliver. The gameplay channels some classic puzzle games, particularly lemmings, but modernized with a simple physics engine. The game while short is probably exactly as long as it needs to be while there are plenty of types of gooballs and game possibilities, any more playtime would have probably worn out the game's freshness. To split hairs, there are a few things this game could do bettter. A common complaint, and well warranted, is that when there are heaps of gooballs swarming in one area, it's sometimes hard to pick the one you need. Also, while the music is beautiful, the game could stand to have a few more tracks. Another minor criticism is that some of the animations in the cutscenes are a bit poor. Finally and this is purely subjective I very quickly got sick of building huge towers and bridges. When I've already worked out the solution to a level, I feel very frustrated if I then also have to spend 5 minutes meticulously building a structure just to make a minor error and have the whole thing collapse and force me to start again. (In my opinion, the challenge in puzzle games should be more about working out the solution than mastering the technique to pull it off) But I hate to end this on a bad note, so I will say that this is a unique, beautiful at times artistic game that should really be in everybody's game library.. Very original idea and great gameplay. I have this game on my PC and Android, which both this is fun to play :) Levels are quite difficult, just needs to be clever and fast.. This game is one of a kind. It takes thinking games to a whole new level. The only thing I did not like about the game is there were some levels that seemed impossible and I could not figure out how to get past them. I used **** for the levels that made me want to rage quit! Minus the frustration, I love the game and recommend it to any one who likes a simple yet complicated game.. Updated review: Finished game except for the bonus hard levels. Fun game. Absolutely worth playing. Original review: This is a cool physics based game. To Radio - Re the Tower of Goo Level - Don't just build straight up - come back down to the bottom to solidify your base so that it doesn't rock back and forth so much and fall. If it's shaking too much adding spokes at the bottom to stabilize helps alot. Think Pyramid instead of Obelisk (sp?). Pay attention to the balance and build away from the lean. Don't worry about building fast at first until you formulate a stable strategy. I've only played a few hours so far, but the one level ""in between"" where you're building a bridge without sagging too low or floating too high - I did find the gui to get in the way because timing does matter quite a bit there - I'd often try to grab a balloon to try to stop the bridge from falling too low, or a blob to stop it from floating too high - and grab the wrong thing. Frustrating, but they do give the back a move option that sometimes might help (not always though due to timing). Insanely good game from start to the very end. Gameplay is smooth and easy to controll and puzzles get very interesting and challenging along the way. It has just the right amount of dificulty. The soundtrack is one of the best in a sea of amazing indie game tracks. The slow story unfolding is perfectly paced and is very interesting to follow to see where it leads with an amazing ending. This is one of my favorite indie games and I have a lot.. A puzzle game, that raises the bar for all future puzzle games.. This game, is probably the most fun I've had in a long time. I can't even begin to describe the perfection of this game. Graphics and scenery are beautiful, the music is so delicate, and the gameplay is so smooth and fun to play. I would highly recommend this game.. I bought this game on steam sale for 1 dollar. And I liked World Of Goo very much! A cheap cool game, that could help you to spend some time in fun! Good physics and nice graphics with awesome gameplay- that is my choice!. Considering that basically the entire game was created by TWO PEOPLE, i can't think of anyway that this game could have been made better. Some people are complaining about price, which doesn't do the game justice in itself.. WORLD OF GOO: This is one of those games that I really like to play when got bored with my daily lives. OK... Here's World of Goo. It's a physics-based puzzle game where you construct goos so that they can made it into the end point which is the pipe. That's pretty much the whole explanation. There are various goo types as you play. There are the baloon goos (or maybe they are actual baloons), there are the removeable goos, trasparent goos, and soo many more. Even with the simple gameplay, you still need your brain right here though not fully. Maybe because you mindlessly construct goos. But this game actually requires strategy and prediction in the later levels. The overall gameplay is very fun, though it can get hard sometimes. Surprisingly this game has a very interesting personality on itself. The game is just making fun of things and not taking it too seriously. Yeah, it's maybe a little mindless, but it's still fun to play. So far, the only problem i got on this game is that it spoils how many chapters are on this game. Though, this game still can hook you up with like 30-40 hours. OVERALL: This is an awesome game. I have a fun times playing with it as a casual gamer. Puzzle game fans should definitely check it out. It's pretty cheap right now so why don't you buy it!. Oh, and it works really well on any netbook so you can bring it anywhere. [8/10] ""Awesome"". This is an Amazing game. Although it can be hard at times, it can really be satisfying to beat them. The game has great comical graphics (you don't need ultra-crysis realism to have good graphics, it just has to look good). It has funny little sounds for the goos. It is comical down to the core. The only time you will wouldn't like it is if you try the OCD.. I never though building things out of talking balls of snot would be fun but it was. World of Goo is a great mix of a beautiful scenario and sound effects. The game does get very challenging later on so it isn't exactly something just everyone can play, but all in all it was very fun. I ended up buying it for my kids but I had to help them so much I might as well had been playing it for them full time.. THE PROS: My hat is off to this game for its artwork and level design, which are interesting, original, and often adorable. The gameplay also deserves points for its originality. The basic concept of WOG is that there are these tiny goo balls squirming around in every level, and these goo balls can be picked up by the player using the mouse cursor and then dropped near other goo balls to create structures. The objective of most levels is to build a structure (or series of structures) that allows a certain number of goo balls to reach an exit pipe. The more goo balls that reach the exit, the better your score. So the challenge of the game is twofold: 1) Figuring what sort of structure you'll need to build to accomplish the level objective, as it is rarely a straight course, 2) Conquering the laws of physics by building a goo structure that not only accomplishes your goal, but is also structurally sound and unlikely to be destroyed by environmental dangers. The game does a fantastic job of creating fresh scenarios, either by introducing new environmental dangers or by introducing new goo balls with new unique abilities. The game's originality is incredibly refreshing and its character will charm you to no end. THE CONS: Interacting with the goo balls in the game is not always very user friendly, and in some situations it becomes just plain infuriating. In most levels, the goo balls start on a small, pre-built structure. As you build, the goo balls whimsically travel around the tresses of the structure you're putting together. As the game goes on and the challenges become more difficult, this actually starts to become frustrating for a number of different reasons. For example, if there are multiple types of goo balls in a particular stage (let's say regular black goo and balloon goo), you might be trying to pick up a particular kind of goo ball to accomplish a particular task. However, the one goo ball you're trying to pick up is buried beneath 60 other goo balls that you don't want. You can't just move all the unwanted goo balls aside and dig down to the goo ball you want, because all the goo balls are running around like disobedient children. The whistle the game gives you to ""call"" goo balls is no help, since it seems to only make the goo balls do what they are already doing (i.e., running around chaotically), only faster. The chaotic dog pile of goo balls also proves frustrating in time-sensitive situations, since you'll try to quickly grab a single goo ball from the writing mass of them, but instead you'll accidentally yank out a goo ball that's already been placed, causing your entire structure to collapse. The developers have kindly introduced tiny flies you can click on to flashback to an earlier point in the level, in case you make any huge blunders; however, these flies also prove frustrating since 1) the restore points they choose seem almost random, ranging anywhere from two seconds ago (letting you watch your structure fall in instant replay) to three minutes ago (causing you to rebuild a significant chunk of your structure), and 2) it is too easy to click one of these flies by accident when you don't mean to, effectively deleting GOOD progress you've made. In short, all of the problems and frustrations of world of goo boil down to one essential problem: there is too much crap on the screen at one time. It all piles on top of each other, and it can make your life hell. VERDICT: Definitely buy the game for its originality and charm, but be prepared for some unnecessary frustration.. Very realistic physics engine and the adding-on-more-to-the-game methods are both very solid. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but something about the real and illusion of physics in this game brings my score lower than what most people might agree on.... Very unique, and entertaining... A good game for almost any age, even a 3 year old! It's a game that makes you think a little more than just ""react & shoot"", and that's a Plus+ :). This game... is brilliant... It struck emotions in me that most mainstream games never can do. I found it more emotional than Heavy Rain, and the weird thing is that the story isn't really that structured. It really is just stuff happening, but I think that the music had a lot to do with it. The Sign Painter's signs are probably one of the best parts of the game too. Reading those signs always adds a bit of humor, and sometimes it even adds some bits of other emotions, like hopelessness and despair. World of Goo has solid gameplay, the levels can become a bit difficult but a calm head can get you through it. If you really can't beat a level, you can skip it and do it later. And it's not based on luck solely, there's a lot of strategy to this game.. First I would like to state that I am not a indie addict by any means (ok I just bough humble bundle 2, but thatâ. This game is beyond description, each level makes you feel brilliant, with their own twist, it has an unseen morale, and so much more! It is beyond our limited vocabulary for me to fully describe to you a minor glimpse of this game!. The concept behind this game is great. It's a physics puzzler where you build goo based structures in order to save a collection of goo balls. The problem lies in the concept's execution. The OCD challenges are what give replay value to the game but are frustrating to an incredible degree. Some of the challenges require you to finish the level within a certain amount of time but don't offer you a timer during the game. You have to wait until you finish the level to see your completion time. This means that you have to go back to the world map and then reselect the level again in order to retry. A similar frustration is that you can't retry the level after the base number of goo balls have been collected. Some of the OCD challenges require you to collect and absurd amount of goo balls compared to the amount required to complete the level on its own. In one example, the level required me to collect 8 goo balls to continue to the next area. The OCD challenge required me to collect 36 goo balls. Again, this challenge is fine but the game does you no favors. You can't (easily) retry the level after you collect the first 8 goo balls. In order to even get the menu to pop up after collecting 8 goo balls and noticing I was going to fall short, I had to click, and then read, one of the in-game signs. There is no ""retry"" button after you complete a level so if you follow through and just finish you have to go back to the world map and then reselect the level you just finished. It would also be nice here to have something that tracked the goo balls that hadn't been used. This would save a lot of time as you would know exactly how many balls were left and how many more you could use before you had to start the level all over again. The game offers an ""undo"" feature in these little time-warp bugs that generate every once in a while. Clicking on the bug steps back in time to the point where the bug was spawned. The main problem here is that it can be a pain to click on the bugs as they fly around the level, sometimes they end up right on top of my goo structure. Additionally, the bugs don't always go back to where they should, at least it seemed that way. It was common to rewind time and see my tower spasm wildly into the walls and spinning blades. Moving the goo around is also pretty frustrating. Hovering over a goo ball stops it's movement even if it's in front of different type of goo ball. There were many times where I either destroyed my structure or missed critical timing because I couldn't select the goo ball I wanted. When you pick up the goo balls, you have to maneuver them around the objects in the world, which is generally fine, but at times is incredibly frustrating. At one point I had about 15 balls fall off of my structure and I had to drag them each individually up to the structure in order to finish the level. World of Goo also has a gameplay mode that lets you build an infinitely tall tower of goo. This would be cool if you got anything for building a taller and taller structure but all it seems to do is allow you to compete with other people. The goo you collect from the ""story"" part of the game gets sent to the Corporation of Goo where you build the infinite tower. It would be nice if building a taller and taller tower unlocked something or other because otherwise there's no motivation to even use this part of the game. The art is really nice, and one of the reasons I didn't mark this as low as I had initially thought. One small problem with the art art is that, at times, it's difficult to distinguish between the level's background and things like spinning gears that will destroy your goo structure and the goo balls themselves. It's also tough to distinguish between level boundaries and walls that you can use to prop up your structure. If the tower collapses and hits a wall, part of it is destroyed. The music is good as well but there's no option to turn it off. The game lacks customization options in general and the full-screen key combination isn't even explained, I had to look it up online. To mute the music and play with my own I had to download a custom DLL that let me control the volume of the sound effects and the music - controls that should have been in the game by default. Changing the resolution required editing a config file, which is more than ridiculous for a fairly casual game like WoG. All in all, this game frustrated the hell out of me. Not because the concept was frustrating, or even the gameplay, the UI and overall system built around the gameplay is what turned me off. There are features missing that are expected in modern puzzle games and features missing that are expected in modern games in general. The fact that this is an indie title is no excuse for a lack of a sound/volume menu, or the lack of a timer when challenges require you to finish a level within a time limit.. This game **** bigtime. I love indie games, and i love puzzle games, but this is plain crap. For starters, you can't change the resolution, but neither could you on Plants vs Zombies and that game's awesome. The problem of this game is, like many have pointed out already, it's ridiculous difficulty curve. First few levels of world 1 are ok, and then you reach that ""Tower of goo"" level. I tried it 1000 times, watching ""tutorials"" on youtube and it's impossible. Well, possible it is, the problem is it's based on luck. You create a base structure which stands steady, and","""world of goo"" is a physics-based puzzle / construction game . the graphics are OK, and the gameplay is simple, but it's also plain and short of unique . a great opportunity to smear yourself with glue, which acts according to simplified, but still physical laws ."
287.Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,"The atmosphere characters humor and overall game play are all amazing this game is another absolute gem on the gba. Truly a masterpiece, this game exceeded my already pretty high expectations for it. The story and gameplay is best going in blind, which is hard to do nowadays because the game is decades old, but the story is great. Nothing amazing, but it’s funny, energetic, and full of more twists than a 5 metre strand of liquorice. This game has aged perfectly. The soundtrack, visuals, and gameplay are stellar, especially for Gameboy Advance. Final boss is a **** to fight, and there are some low points, but the quirkiness and great gameplay make this one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played. A pretty fun game, and one of the rare one that i was able to play for more than 1 hour without getting bored, aged pretty well and even holds up in therm of enjoyment to games released 2 decades later, the only inconvenience i could find is that it can be confusing at times. For being the first Mario & Luigi game, it's very amazing! The Mario brother's personalities really outstand in the games. And I love how it expands the world where they reside. It offers a big challenge, but with a great reward factor. But, there is a thing that I didn't really like that much, and that is the bosses. Sure, the whole thing about bosses is a hard and difficult fight, but there are sometimes where the way to defeat them is very unclear, but that might be a simple skill issue. In the end, It's a great game, with a great story and a good battle system. Would recommend for Mario and RPG fans to play!. Very fun game, however in some boss fights it is not clear exactly what you have to do, and the final boss is completely utterly unfair.. This is a short, fun RPG. I like the dodging and action commands, as well as using multiple characters at the same time. It's got a simple, but interesting plot with funny moments.. I loved all of its sequels, but I couldn't even play 3 hours of this game.... Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was a good game when it came out for the Super Nintendo so many years ago. Seven Stars surely takes no thunder away from Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga. The fact this game offers brother attacks and is able to be played on a handheld makes it worth getting and adds a bit of a fresh new method of playing. This game also includes the classic Super Mario Brothers game for multi-player fun. The fact this game can not be solved in a day's time proves that it will last a long while. The in-game map is huge and one would be lucky to get half way in a day. The game is fun, but the extras are not there, such as switching to other characters as with Seven Stars.. It is great! Wonderful! It's not obviously the best Mario & Luigi game,but it still serves like a fun game with good mechanices in it.. Trash game, caused my friend’s addiction. He doesn’t want to do anything anymore. He plays the game until he’s tired and then says he doesn’t want to play games anymore until he does then he plays this and gets bored again. Wash, rinse, and repeat.. I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Another Mario game that's a fun little arcade adventure with cute graphics and a real sense of humour.. When Nintendo gives a random company the Mario franchise and says, ""Go wild"", you get this absolute masterpiece. Superstar Saga is so good, I don't even know if there's anything bad about it. Superstar Saga takes the traditional turn-based RPG format and puts a creative spin on it with the action commands and Bros. Attacks which require you to press A (for Mario) or B (for Luigi) at the right moment to deal maximum damage with a jump attack, hammer swing or a burst of Fire or Lighting. As for the Bros. Attacks, pretty much you gotta press the right buttons in the right order and when you pull it off, it is so satisfying. The story is really good and holds up very well to this very day. 10/10 from Eggman Enterprises. An absolute 10/10. This game has gotta be one of the best Mario games ever made. Everything about this game is close to perfection: the music, the artstyle, the combat, etc. I really love the concept of using your own brother as a mass destruction weapon (even tho some of the advanced inputs require too much precision imo). They really nailed it with this game. I would recommend this game to anyone out there. a great start to a great side series. mario and luigi superstar saga is a truly unique take on the mario series.. This game is an absolute masterpiece! This is literally one of the best RPG games I have ever played! The graphics are really amazing, the soundtrack is wonderful, and the Bros. attacks are marvelous! Sure the final boss might have unfair difficulty, but the final boss is still awesome, and you can easily win if you will know what you are doing and if you have a badge that makes the Bros. have a good amount of DEF! Seriously, I highly recommend trying this game out!. I love it, it's my childhood, and I would have the whole world know that I love it. I had so much fun with the game and I am happy to have had that experience.. Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga is a very charming little RPG. I greatly enjoyed the interactions between characters as well as many of the new characters introduced throughout the game. And the art style in this game looks just wonderful, colorful environments and cartoony sprits give the world this vibrant feeling. On the gameplay side its not anything that great, turn based RPG mechanics where you have to time your button inputs for max damage. I enjoyed this gameplay it just got tiring by the end and I found that just spamming certain attacks was the go to strategy for most fights. And aside from a few boss fights the game wasn't very challenging however I'd say the game was just long enough before it got to be too much. There's also many small mini games most of which only appear once and I didn't care for some of them except the barrel one that one was alright. And finally the music which I feel I have to mention is really good but some of them like the battle music can get kind of old by the end. But overall I'd say its a real fun game and worth trying out for most fans of Mario or RPGs.. Though Super Mario has created a unique style of RPG game and the sword to go off the edge. There still some flaws about the balance ,playing. And as a RPG game the the story line is a bit monotonous and short. in my opinion the best Mario and luigi game besides bowser inside story, nearly everything is great about this game. This game is a brilliant rpg because the gameplay is fun but the story is written so well that if it wan't for paper mario, this probably would've been one of the best mario game stories out there.. The best in the Mario and Luigi series. Tight combat which I felt improved aspects of paper Mario in a different way, fun puzzles, hilarious story. The later entrees are very good too but they add a lot of content and the battle system can become intense with mini games and more characters to manage. This took me 20-25 hours which was perfect, while dream team was 55+ hours.. Thoroughly enjoyed it, the story was interesting and unpredictable, the jokes were hilarious, the animations and scenery vibrant, the locations and characters are so damn creative. The music, it just slaps... I can go on and on, but i'll cut it here and say this is a must-play for anyone that owns a Gameboy advance SP. One of my favourite games for the GBA of all times that I played in my childhood. What can I say about this game, well for starters it is unbelievable amazing and fun at the same time. Moreover, the mechanics, graphics and storyline are fantastic! Even till today, I look back at this game and I am instantly reminded why I fell in love with all the Mario and Luigi RPG series. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone regardless of age. Whether you're a fan or not of the game series of Mario, you won't regret picking up this game especially if you're a huge fan of RPG games.. I love this game a lot. It’s the beginning of the great Mario and Luigi series which is another neat rpg series along with Paper Mario. I give this a 9 just because there is a 3DS version that also includes a Bowser’s Minions story but this game still rocks. I loved this game so much back in my childhood that I played through it twice and it left me wanting more. It's been a while since I last played, but if my memory serves me right, my only peeve with it was that there was no NG+. The game just ends once you beat the final boss. However, now that it's spawned its own series, I'm definitely going to try playing its sequels.. My favorite game for the GBA. The best Mario RPG from the saga. I really like the character design on this game. Since I was a relative newcomer to this entry in the series, and I heard all the praise, I was excited to play it. While it didn't leave me as fulfilled as say, Bowser's Inside Story, I still found this to be a great start to the Mario and Luigi series. The Brothers are as goofy as they'll ever be, and the rest of the humor is still great. The battle system, being the oldest besides SMRPG, has a few little quirks that I could live without. Sometimes, jump height is not what I think it is, and I feel that the controls could be better. But, considering this is a GBA game, I can't complain too much. Superstar Saga was a great way to start the series, and I recommend giving this or the remake a chance.. The first in an excellent series of rpgs that feature Mario & Luigi...such great mechanics and use of characters. The perfect mix in turn-based battles, and plataforming,probably one of the strongest titles that Nintendo has made in all history. A true Mario RPG masterpiece .. Even if Mario & Luigi is my favourite RPG serie... i think that Saga Superstar has some mistakes like in the Japanese Version there is one more block feature than the other versions which makes the game **** story is **** villains and the other characters are great **** the only thing that is negative is that after Cackletta's first defeat you just complete missions in the same places which can really make u bored until getting to Bowser's Castle to strike down the Koopalings, Fawful's Final Form, and Bowletta to put an end on the story.... This game is the best game ive ever played perfect storyline we need more games like these open world type of games that just make mario stand out more.. I normally don't enjoy RPGs, but I gave Paper Mario a shot and adored it. I then played TTYD and loved every minute of it. So a friend recommended Superstar Saga. I really wanted to love this game. But it just wasn't enjoyable. The dialogue was FANTASTIC, and I loved the story. But the gameplay was far too tedious to justify playing through the game just to get to the story.. What a quality game and took me by complete surprise, Was not expecting it to be anywhere near as good as it is. One of the best games one the GBA and a must play for Mario and RPG fans.. This game is one of those games that you just want to play forever, but simply can't, because it's so stinkin' good. I'm serious, I felt sad once I had collected all the Beanstar pieces and was approaching the end of the game. It's a great RPG for people unfamiliar with the genre(including myself), and it's extremely fun. You'll be laughing out of either humor or joy the entire time while playing this. The battle system is great, allowing you to be doing something at all times, and best of all, there's no need to grind. It's a great game that's available for only $8-$9 on the Nintendo eShop for Wii U, and one people should definitely check out.. Best Game in Mario and Luigi Series, not to mention Bowser Inside Story . Very amazing RPG, one of the best GBA Games and one of the best RPG on GBA . Graphics is very good for RPG on GBA, AWESOOOME Storyline and amazing RPG Gameplay. Many moves for Mario and Luigi, Good desigh world. AWESOOOME GAAAME.. This is the first game of the original Mario & Luigi Trilogy. For me, all of them were perfect. But some users try to compare it to Paper Mario, even tough this series are a sequel for the original Mario RPG game for SNES, that's appreciable due to its combat system and the original story. This game simply started the trilogy the best it could.. This game is funny and the graphics are amazing! The gameplay is also too! I just love every second of it and this game just never gets old and I just keep playing it. PLAY IT NOW! D:. when i got this game on gba for christmas, i exploded with excitment, it was like a pixelated genie! This game was one of the best mario entries EVER!. It isn't just a game. It's an experience worth trying for once in your entire life. This game's been 12 years old right now and in 9 months and counting, it'll be 13 years old.. just wonderful. to my knowledge, this is the only time you ever see mario working as a plumber in a game. the story makes no sense at all, but in a great way. they just keep throwing bizarre scenarios at you, and you laugh hysterically. seriously, if, like me, you did not grow up on RPGs, this is a game to smooth you into the genre. it's inviting, hilarious, fun, ridiculous, satisfying. you have some platforming, some tasks you have to complete with some dexterity in real time. i'd say this and stick of truth are RPG masterpieces perfect for non-RPG players.. Incredibly funny and clever! I think this should be a must buy not only for rpg fans or Super Mario/ Nintendo fans, but also for every casual gamer searching for something new and fresh!. The game is simply incredible. If i could rate higher i would. As a kid who got the game back when it was released, i struggled with it and never got past one of the first areas. I took it out a few weeks ago after almost giving up on it.. and i can say it was an epic experience. Fast paced, colorful and hilarious.. i have never enjoyed my Game Boy advanced so much. I put over 40 hours into the game (thanks to the counter) and sometimes played for 7-8 hours a day. (thankfully it is summer) so, i can tell you it is worth actually getting this game if you like games like this. From searching for hundreds of hidden beans to make useful coffees to obtain rare items and boost your stats (yes that is an actual function, and an amazing one at that) to grinding on cool and powerful enemies to level up so you can take on the powerful Cackletta. The game is worth your money. Very worth it.. As my favourite game of my childhood i only can say, thats the best Mario and Luigi Game in my oppinion. Wonderful Desingned Charakters (Cackletta, Fawful), lovely Story, wich you could play for hours. 10 outta 10.. I've only played this game for just over and hour but so far it doesn't seem so bad. A good start to a good rpg series that's easy to pick up and play for a while.. After playing partners in time and its sequels i craved more. When i started this game i expected everything to be much worse than the more advanced bowsers inside story and dream team, i was so wrong. I would argue that this game does many things better than its sequels, all of the bro attacks are awesome and advancing them makes your feel accomplished. The use of the thunderhand and the firebrand was well implemented. The writing is very funny at times and for me was never a chore to read, same goes for the characters. My single complaint is that the bosses are either way to easy or too frustrating. But this is a great rpg that is still fun to this day and if you have a wii u or gameboy i really recommend picking it up.. M&L Superstar Saga is what made me love Mario games. There is nearly no end to the charm and fun that this game brings. The combat system is incredibly intuitive, with its action-based gameplay bringing turn-based RPGs to a whole new level. It's a comfortable and enjoyable set-up, as your actions mean more than your stats. Alongside, there is a unique world to explore with much to find. The game's plot is nothing special, but it is filled with clever writing and characters that will put a smile to your face. There is even a few twists involved. Mario and Luigi are enjoyable characters and its great to see such chemistry between them. The game also looks awesome on the GBA, with lush colors, nice animation, and great art direction. And I love, love, love the soundtrack. All the music is catchy and memorable, albeit a tad repetitive. If you want a game that features everything to love about the Mario Bros. in a near perfect RPG style, do not pass this game.. Very clever, fun, and addictive gameplay. An absolute gem **** that represents the best the GBA has to offer. Some environments can be a bit dull at times, especially as you near the end of an area. The slight monotony does almost nothing to negatively impact the extremely fun gameplay, as well as the rock solid story that keeps you on your toes throughout the entirety, and one of the most fun and intense endings that I've personally ever seen in gaming. It's mid 2013, and this game is still solid as a rock and most certainly worth picking up used or finding online. I assure you you won't regret it.. This is probably my favorite game of all time. All aspects of it are phenomenal. The combat is challenging but never so challenging that it would make you want to quit. The story and the characters are charming and hilarious.. I've never actually laughed out loud at a video game as much as I did whilst playing Superstar Saga. And there is genuinely a lot to do in this game, and a lot of items to collect and places to explore. This is an easy 10.. This is one of the first games I have ever had as a kid. I loved it to death. The game is very humorous, and I love how Luigi played the goofy, second hand hero. The turn-base combat is very fun, although I would love enemies being a bit smarter with attacks. The story itself lasted me many, many days to complete but it all paid off in the end. There are many tricky puzzles and platforming areas that you have to master, and it gives **** feeling conquering these sections. The game gives you a lot to do, and many places to explore when you don't feel like completing the objectives. The visuals match the feel and atmosphere of the game, which is perfect. It adds to the goofiness and humor in the game. To this day, I replay the game and relive the story.. Nintneod have truly outdone themselves int he RPG world. Not only are they able to diversify Mario into the realm of turn based gameplay, they manage to make them stand among the best RPG's of this generation. Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga is one of those unforgettable experiences. The game is easy to play, but difficult to complete 100%. The game still provides a decent challenge to newcomers though and you can still find yourself in a tight snitch here and there. The story is definitely something to behold and will keep you smiling the whole way through. Mario and Luigi's gameplay system is also pitch perfect. Each with there own unique abilities, the two brothers only way to stay alive is to not get seperated and work together. This craetes some very interesting sections and situations in the game and the brothers can only use their full power when performing team attacks and using these moves successfully will be the deciding factor a fight. The characters are new and fresh, with some returning roles, and the game is just simply memorable as heck. Truly a worthy gem on the game boy advance adn one of my favorite games ever! Check this game out and you won't be dissapointed.. Incredible! Absolutely incredible! While it took me almost 5 years to beat because i got the game at a very young age in which i was incapable on comprehending more than half of the English language, that doesn't matter because even after pulling through it was an incredible experience. Did i mention it was incredible? This game is incredible.. This is easily my favorite game of all time! This is probably the only 10 I'll ever give. The most acceptable RPG because you can dodge, rather than just stand there looking dopey while the enemy hits you. This game only has 2 flaws, but everything else is perfect. It is relatively easy, and there aren't enough side missions, but there are collectables everywhere so there is a good enough reason to explore. This game was amazing. One of nintendos best. Super cute and ridiculous in a good way.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A lengthy Mario themed RPG experience, A load of In-game minigames, hilarious,deep and shocking storyline, fun soundtrack, good voice acting, unique battle system, a load of sidequests, a cameo from the most overrated Square Enix owned Mario character Geno (sorry, I couldn't resist. :P), all of this and STILL enough room on the GBA cartridge for the arcade Super Mario Bros. game with multiplayer support (if you don't happen to have it on any of the Super Mario Advance remakes already). Such a great package is far worth its price and I would very much recommend a buy.","the story and gameplay is best going in blind, which is hard to do nowadays because the game is decades old, but the story is great . the soundtrack, visuals, and gameplay are stellar, especially for Gameboy Advance ."
288.Slay the Princess,"Pros Fairly fresh material. Immersive story. Scary but not scary atmosphere. Easy to play through multiple times. Cons Story is too complicated. Game requires multiple playthroughs to make sense.. This game is one of the most well-written meta narratives I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The game almost overwhelms you with options and questions regarding everything in the world that you are presented. Almost every dialogue option opens up something new, and the game doesn't hold your hand as it allows you to piece together the narrative based on your own perspective. The game doesn't trouble you with ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but rather is able to adapt based on your pre-existing beliefs and intuitions about what to do. While there are plenty of technical issues regarding dialogue and the inability to skip the parts you have already seen, this game immerses you with some of the most fascinating writing that the medium of video games has to offer.. Bro this game is straight peak, never have i experienced a visual novel as great as this, also happily ever after and thorn got the best tracks in the game imo. Well-written narrative, intriguing characters, uniquely beautiful art style, engaging gameplay and last but not least incredible soundtrack!!! This game is a masterpiece.. *Slay the Princess* is a fascinating dive into horror storytelling, where intrigue and mystery do all the heavy lifting rather than outright scares. The story itself is one of the game’s standout elements. It’s really engaging—almost addictive in how it hooks you and keeps you on the edge of your seat, eager to understand what’s happening or what might happen next. There’s a lot of psychological tension in the narrative, keeping you wondering about the motives of the narrator, the mysterious princess, and even your own **** for horror, it’s more unsettling than outright scary. If you’re looking for classic horror with jump scares or terrifying visuals, this game might not deliver what you expect. Instead, *Slay the Princess* plays with a lingering sense of dread that, while not terrifying, keeps you fully engaged because you’re constantly in the dark about what’s real and what isn’t. That unpredictability and constant uncertainty are what drive the **** voice acting is solid, too. The performances add a lot of depth and bring a strong emotional quality to each interaction, helping you feel more connected to the twisted world of the game. The narration and the princess’s dialogue feel genuine, and the actors manage to convey a lot of emotion, pulling you into each scene even **** ending, however, was a bit confusing. It left things feeling unresolved and may not satisfy players who crave a clear conclusion or a strong sense of closure. But for those who enjoy ambiguous endings that leave you thinking and trying to piece things together, it can be a **** art style—simple, black-and-white—is minimalistic but refreshing. It won’t blow you away with detail or complexity, but it fits the tone of the game. The stark, monochrome visuals add to the eerie atmosphere, even if they’re not overly polished or elaborate.Overall, *Slay the Princess* is a unique experience that mixes psychological horror with narrative depth. While it may not terrify you in the traditional horror sense, it’s worth a play for anyone interested in thought-provoking stories that mess with your expectations and keep you curious until the end.. It's really hard for me to rate this game. This is definitely a unique experience that lured me in more and more as I progressed through the story. Certainly, it's not a game for everyone. I guess it's even hard to call it a game; it's more like an interactive movie. While it's really impressive how much is possible and how every choice matters, sometimes I felt like it lacked something—like some extra spice in certain scenarios, deeper meaning, or longer endings, or maybe some quick time events. I don't know, but for me, this felt incomplete, and it was somewhat frustrating. For sure, this experience is very memorable, but I don't think it changed me at all. It didn't give me anything to make me a better person. That's why I can't reasonably rate this game. It's unique, very addictive, and clever, but it's lacking meaning and depth. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing so many positive reviews.. 9/10. This game is really amazing, but has some flaws that keep it from being a perfect 10/10. In terms of gameplay, it's a completely narrative-focused game with no traditional gameplay elements, and instead just dialogue trees and decision trees. The writing, however, is mostly spectacular. It would have gotten 10/10 for the mostly spectacular writing if it hadn't kinda jumped the shark right at the end and started talking about some nonsense that didn't even have anything to do with what had been happening so far. The writers tried to take it a different direction right at the end, and be all like ""this has really been about this other thing all along"", but right when they started talking about the ""other thing"" they decided it would be cool to be completely vague. The writers were clearly going for something deep and philosophical, but they overshot deep and philosophical and went straight into nonsensicality. I think it could have worked if they had not also been super vague at the same time as when they were trying to abruptly change the direction of the story, but the decision to be extremely vague right at the time when it was most important for them to make sense just killed it. I would still strongly recommend this game though.. I tried to give this game a chance and thought the concept would be cool but within minutes I became incredibly bored and was overwhelmed with the narrative choices. I also became very confused with the flow of the narrative. The narrator is also super annoying. The art style is kind of neat but I ultimately ended up not liking it. The game also gets quite repetitive despite subtle changes in the story as I progressed. There seems to be some glitches with the controls. There is a ton of dialog, which unfortunately, I did not enjoy at all. I ended up skipping through it all starting about halfway into the game. It made no sense to me that you die but the story continues on, multiple times. Most of the dialog is nonsensical and abstract. Good thing I only spent 2 hours of my life playing this.. Modern narrative masterpiece. A must experience indie treasure that deserves every bit of praise and acclaim it's received. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ground-breaking indie choice-making game, the story is really deep and leaves you thinking about the meaning of it long after you close it, the story is moving almost, the artistic choice of hand drawn images gives it so much more personality and realness to the game , all else i can say is you need to buy this game while its on sale, as the price tag of £17 is quite much, the devs have recently made a tweet saying you can pirate it and then buy the game later after youve seen what it is and i cant agree with that more, 10/10 game, cant wait for the pristine cut update this autumn.. Date Completed: 2024-07-01 Playtime: 3h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: It's short, weird, and interesting.. A flawless masterpiece don't know how it can get better the visual novel formula executed perfectly. One of the best if not the best game I ever personally played. This game shows the power **** with a great storytelling and the beauty of traditional art with an intriguing and well-written story with a powerful meaning, great visuals and voice acting. Slay the Princess is the first game to elicit a genuine emotional reaction from me since I played Undertale in 2015. With hundreds of lovingly handcrafted drawings and amazing voice acting, this game draws you in with its near infinite branching paths and its endearing and memorable characters.. The most beautiful game ever made, you have to play this or else you’re missing out bigtime.. Slay the Princess is an interesting visual novel with a great art style and excellent voice acting, but the short runtime (around 3 hours) does make the £15 price tag fell a little expensive, especially as the time loop structure doesn’t make repeat plays all that appealing.. Definitely a must play. After watching 1 video from ManlyBadassHero playing this game, I bought it and went in blind, and what a blast I had. Didn't expect to feel such a deep connection with a game, from the funny bickering of the characters, to the deep philosophical intrigues the endgame brings, the stunning art and the amazing voice performance of the VAs, this game for me is just pure art. If you see Slay the Princess on even a small sale, I highly recommend you giving it a shot, one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure to play. 10/10. I liked the concept. The first 30 minutes were crazy good, but after that, my interest went rapidly. After seeing some content around the plot, I felt like the script was kinda simple (interesting, but simple), and the dialogs just pretended it was complex. That bothered me a little. The art, tho, is amazing.. It is a very ineresting Game beqause its makes you relly question your choicesand the impact they are going to have.. A really interesting game with so much going on with the story to keep you intrigued with the amount of choices that you can make, a genuinely unsettling visual novel that I think more people need to check out.. Yeah, I didn't find the game that intriguing. It was overly convoluted and really unclear on the direction. Another aspect was that it wasn't what I was expecting, both in terms of quality, given the very positive reviews its gotten on Metacritic, but also in terms of composition. There wasn't a clear narrative thread that I enjoy in choice based games, and the stakes didn't seem understandable. It's even a bit difficult to write a review because the game was intentionally confusing, but as simply put, I think that STP would have benefitted greatly from some exposition.. I choose from the beginning to not go in the cabin, it seems it broke the game and finally the story have no sense XD finished in 10 minutes. This game is one of my all time favorite games. The story is amazing, and without getting into spoilers, the game absolutely surprised me at the end.. Great VN. Does what it sets out to do great. I'm also an absolute **** for flowery dialogue.. a wonderful novella: very original, stylish, with an interesting plot (and the minus of the game from my point of view is that the ending is complicated to understand but nevertheless thought-provoking), with excellent music and a charming princess (well, almost). Graphomania don't waste your time, the visual style is interesting but nothing more. 10/10 Would Slay Again. More Like 10/10 Would Save Again, Its an amazing Visual Novel and worth every penny spent. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. words cant describe how incredible this game is, it must be experienced first hand I never was a fan of visual novels, but now I am such a masterpiece!. Interesting take in Visual Novel department with great art. I'll did only one full ending, but i definetly will comeback to it.. I don't think visual novels are good video games and the story for this game was not better than most you can find in an actual video game. It was mildly interesting, but ultimately was fairly shallow, more nonsensical than I could suffer, and overall uncompelling. I think I could've enjoyed it if the writing offered something more profound, intelligent, or poignant - but it didn't, really.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very creative visual novel with beautiful and unsettling imagery. This game executes the loop concept we've seen time and time again a bit differently from other titles which is good and the music is also decent. The story is surprisingly deep and will keep you engaged. A recommended play in the VN genre.. Pretty awesome, creative, incredible stylized art, it keeps you hooked and though it may sound too simple sometimes more is less. It is great for those who like narrative adventures, it's a niche but you get what you paid for.. This game is amazing! There's not much else to say about it other than the fact that its' a must play! This game is amasterpiece, and I am simply amazed by all the work that has gone into drawing every single frame by the creators, amazing work!. Very nice game just reached 4 endings and can’t wait to finish all of the remaining ones. A literal “ Slay”.. Game of the Year. I agree with everyone here: you really do have to experience it. But without spoilers, the organic way that the game unfolds is something really beautiful.. Nice game great voice acting. Slay the Princess captivates like the idea of a woman, and contains multitudes like the reality of a woman. The first run went by so quickly, but I couldn't put it down until I got all the achievements, until I knew everything there is to know about Her.. The story was awesome. I dont like RenPy based games that much but this one is a gem.. Im not a visual novel person at all but this game is incredible. A deceptively simple premise gives way to a labyrinthine rabbit-hole of a narrative that can play out differently depending on your actions, and paired with wonderful art, voice-acting, and music, it's immensely replayable and will stick with you. It's charms will be lost on those un-used to gore and visual novel gameplay, but you can lose several hours to this game and not regret a thing~. I just finished the game, and although I'm sure there are there plenty of other scenarios, I liked my ending so much that I don't want to play anymore to experience outcomes that possibly will be worse. It was perfect for me. I won't say anything else that could ruin the game for others, this game really has to be experienced. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this, it was haunting, surreal and immensely satisfying with many highs and lows and ultimately ending perfectly. It likely will live on in my dreams. One of the best gaming experiences I have ever had despite being largely narrative. Highly recommended!!!!!. ""Slay the Princess"" is an amazing visual novel. The artwork is beautiful, and the style is unique. The story keeps you interested the whole time you're playing. I never got bored, not even for a second. The characters and voice acting are fantastic. In this new era of video games, indie games have become much better than big-budget AAA games, and ""Slay the Princess"" is one of those great indie games.","""slay the princess"" is a fascinating dive into horror storytelling . the story itself is one of the game's standout elements . there's a lot of psychological tension in the narrative ."
289.Syphon Filter,"I know this is an old game now but that doesn’t mean this isn’t a well made game. From the story, characters, level design, & stealth/action levels, this is a fantastic game. It’s definitely challenging at times but it keeps you engaged the entire time. This is definitely one of the best games I’ve ever played & definitely helped revolutionize shooter games. 8/10, points off for some difficulty issues & minor game mechanic errors.. This game is a gem of 90s that, for its time, offered an unparalleled experience. Its blend of action, stealth, and deep narrative makes it a classic that defined a generation. The smooth gameplay, precise controls, and tense atmosphere created total immersion. Mechanics like the use of the Taser and the focus on strategy were revolutionary. It wasn’t just technically impeccable, but it also left an indelible mark on those who played it, being a title that truly defined an era in gaming.. Alright,let's start the review. Level Design - I find it to be pretty good...props to Eidetic. AI in game - I find the AI in this game very challenging and top notch. Art cover and Graphics - Art wise its ok but because its a PS1 game the graphics felt very dated. Controls - The controls in this game felt very lame and tankish but the strafing kind of helped the game a bit. Soundtrack - The soundtrack of this game is brilliant and memorable,especially the main menu theme IMO. Overall,its a decent game but with flaws in mind and by the way theres a bug in the freedom memorial level on the psx emulator where if u kill girdeux the game fades to black and never progresses with voice-overs in the background continue playing.. I thought the AI to be excellent for it's time, and this game came out to rival with metal gear, the devs were even worried the game would ressemblance too much with mgs. One of my childhood friends loved this game, so we played it together for a long time. Never really liked it, but it brings good memories.. While on PS2 all the games in this series are crap this one on PS1 and the best and most fun only its controls that aged badly. A remarkable game from PS1, a revolution at that time, not repetitive at all, wish they would remake this one on new generation standards. Played this back in 2000s on PS1 of course and was one of those games that I will always remember. Looked amazing, played good, interesting story and lots of action. Now that its on PS4 n 5, I recommend highly to classic game lovers to go back and explore but be ready for adjustment needed with gameplay todat. ️. Syphon filter one of best action and stealth game i played Good graphic Brilliant gameplay. Syphon Filter is a game that even for the time it feels really outdated, this is not an early PS1 game, this is 1999. By the time, the controls and graphics were much more polished overall. The way to shoot the guns reminds me to GTA 3, if not, a bit worse for its camera, so you really know what to expect. Although the first person view was cool, and there´s a bit variety of weapons to use. But what kills this game is the level design and its checkpoint system, is so unfair at times, killing you in one hit only because you do a mistake and losing like 15 minutes or more of progress. But the enemies never are a threat, and they can shoot you from close range and i mean close range like 1 METER and they dont hit you, WHAT? The soundtrack was fine, the same with the story, but nothing spectacular. There´s also a bit of revolutionary gameplay here and there, but anything impressive in this game is drag down by the bad.. A PS1 classic that combines Metal Gear Solid with Goldeneye. The action is fast and fluid, although the controls are a little sluggish. You play as Gabriel Logan, a U.S. spy that must stop terrorists bent on unleashing a biological weapon. The story is engaging and gameplay is a mix of shooting and stealth. One big tip: master the head shot early! Metal Gear fans should enjoy this. I would rate Syphon Filter with an 8.5 out of 10. Without a doubt , the greatest game of the fifth generation of gaming. There is no shooting-action game that can match it or it's sequel.. My all time time fav series. Syphon Filter is the game that put me into a great action movie and a very good story. Gabriel Logan is my hero.. One of those games I played as a kid which I enjoyed...despite being frustrated as to how many times I died in each mission.. When Agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, special agents Gabe and Lian to are sent to find him and apprehend international terrorist Erich Rhoemer. Syphon Filter provides an entertaining mix of stealth and action orientated gameplay, and although the graphics and controls now feel very dated, it’s still pretty good fun.. SYPHON FILTER is amazing game! One of the best action game from the past! Great gameplay and Storie!. Despite the sluggish controls and awkward movement, there is a lot of fun to be had with Syphon FIlter. The large range of weapons and tools, interesting level layout and progressive mission objectives and criteria make for an intersting experience. Voice acting is surprisingly good and some of the weapons sound fantastic for the time. Boss battles are the only thing that bother me, to be honest. Enemies shooting you from beyond the draw distance is some grade A crap, but is easily subverted in the end.. It was an amazing game.Easy controls, nice missions and locations, variety in weaponary and the AI was challenging.This game had a nice story too with good characters and voice **** soundtracks were great as well.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. The best game in the series. Played this back in high school, and it's well worth a purchase if you own the system. Not quite as good as MGS but still a solid game.. Ever wanted to be a spy in a game? Then Syphon Filter on the PlayStation is the game for you. It's better than Mission Impossible and Metal Gear Solid (the most overrated game on PS). The graphics are very simple but the gameplay and action is spot on. Also the music and sound in general is good. When i was first playing this game i thought the actor who did the voice for Gabe Logan was Alec Baldwin, he has the same smooth and cool way of talking (or should I say: whispering). The shooting in this game is very satisfying, there is a lot of action but also stealth in the game. It's all very compelling and the whole game feels like you're in an action/spy movie. Of course the graphics are very dated by now and the characters look more like Playmobil toys than real persons, but the gameplay is still good and I had a lot of fun playing this game. I rate Syphon Filter 8 out of 10.. A beautifully well written game that has missions split between heavy action and stealth. The weapons were varied and it was a thrill making my way through its tense and challenging levels. Let’s hope that we receive a new Syphon Filter game in the future.. It's One Of The Best Game I Played On Play Station 1 And Great Story Lines . And The Graphics Are Good In 1999 , Really Good Game .","this game is a gem of 90s that, for its time, offered an unparalleled experience . level design - I find it to be pretty good...props to Eidetic . controls in this game felt very lame and tankish but the strafing kind of helped the game a bit ."
29.The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I have this game from the beginning. I loved BotW, and I try and try to love this one, but i can’t. It’s too boring. The crafting kill everything for me. Moving objects with the controller is not intuitive. Even though I understand the puzzles, it takes me ages to apply the solution. And so i really have the feeling to lose my time. I really don’t understand how this game could have the same score as Botw. For me, it was such such better.. I don't know but maybe the hype created expectations that could not be met. I finished BoTW but could not finish this one. It just feels.. i don't know a bit thin. When I started this game after Witcher 3 I was really disapointed. When I play a game I like the immersion. I don't want to feel like I am playing a game. But here they let you know it is a game and give you tools to exploit it. And there are like 3 types of enemies? If this was released on other consoles, they would not have a chance. The only reason for such a high score this gets is nostalgia and lack of competition. But could be fun for some. Just not for me .. This game is amazing. However, it is a sequel and comparing it to breath of the wild it just sort of lacks charachter given it is not a completely original game. Insane gameplay with Insane world, Exploring the world is sooooooo FUNNN I just love this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is Breath of the Wild but more. Thats all I really have to say. I do wish that the story was better as well as the dungeons. They did fix my boss problem.. Devastatingly uninspired retread of Breath of the Wild with a more formulaic Standard Zelda flavor. Fails as a sequel to Breath of the Wild, fails as a story, fails as a Zelda game, fails as an entry into the open world genre. It doesn't seem like the development team learned anything at all from Breath of the Wild except how to give Youtubers with too much time years' worth of budget Minecraft videos to make. There's 43 goddamn underground abandoned mines in this game and they all look the same. And this game cost $70 United States Dollars.. Masterpiece This is one of the revolutionary games, like Breath of the Wild, which influenced and provided a lesson in open-world game design. Here comes Tears of the Kingdom to offer a lesson in how to design game mechanics as well as sandbox systems A brilliant game with excellent content truly an academic material.. Best game of all time 200+ hours spent with pleasure on first walkthrough, the best time-killer and it's the type of game you can play for infinite and never get bored. I wish I could erase my memory and complete this masterpiece once again. Simply the best game of history. Doesn't need more. Who don't see it must be blind or doesn't apreciate a good game. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is not my second BotW - but it's still extremely good, even if the game gets a bit repetitive later on and ends up not being what I expected... 9,3/10. This game is just a better version of breath of the wild, I get how people have nostalgia. I do as well but this game does everything that we thought couldn’t be done better, better. I love the fuse ability and ultra hand, theSinai devices are clever and there is so much more to do with the depths and the sky islands. the final boss fight and the others are so much more engaging and not repetitive like the blights. And the armor is cool, getting the dlc and amino items from the other game is great as well.. Huge improvement over the prequel, but still not quite there to be worthy of being a new 3D Zelda adventure.. It is an extremely fascinating game that captures the sense of the series: exploration and puzzles. I love that there is no ""correct"" solution but an intended one (unintended stuff work) It is mostt fun for ages 9+ because of the importance of understanding the environment and the dialog to understand the abilities Not as good as its prequel, breath of the wild. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tears of the kingdom is one of (if not) the best zelda games ever, it greatly expands on the vast number of features of the legend of zelda breath of the wild and creates an amazing zelda game, my only complaint would be that if you hace spent hours playing the legend of zelda breath of the wild the it might feel a bit too simular as it has bassicly the same world although there is an underground layer to it as well as sky islands. overall this is an amazing game for in switch owner.. My favs are The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Relax Gaming slot Ancient Tumble and The Aviator slot, that's because I follow DiceGirl Egle, she helps a lot with slot games, I also love to play Pokemon go! I feel like Ash Ketchum with my pokemons haha. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Genuinely the best game I’ve ever played. The abilities combined with the physics create the best gameplay of any game ever. Just amazing.. I have no words how good this game is. It’s absolute masterpiece. I think everyone needs to play this game at least once. Very good game, the puzzels are fun but also challenging, the world looks good and the abilities are fun. I think it's just a better version of BOTW.. Overall a great game. I loved the controls more than the previous game. And I liked the graphics. I’ve been going for 100% and I’ve been working on korok seeds for months. Over 300 hours and I’m not done. and I was able to find workarounds for my flaws such as using a bow against the final boss because of my horrid timing. The learning curve was slow but rewarding. And honestly having sidequests to get the great fairies is more entertaining than being unable to upgrade because I’m broke and have no desire to do glitches. Awesome game. Few flaws. Fixed some issues I had with the previous game. 8/10. The most incredible gaming experience ever made by a human being, play it please. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An absolute gem ****. To me, this is the definitive edition of Breath of the Wild with more on top. For everyone who wants to experience the more modern The Legend of Zelda formula, I would suggest this game over its predecessor. Yet, for me it did not fully invoke the magical feel I had with Breath of the Wild once again due to shared mechanics and - to some extend - world.. This game is overrated. It's mid at best. Yes, it has its fun moments but its questionable, and outright bad ones bring the game down to the point where the good moments are greatly overshadowed. Let's be honest. The depths ****. It's 80km^2 of the same copy-and-paste biome, fauna, and enemies all over with the occasional, sparsely placed structures like mines that don't really have anything interesting going on. Its design is the pinnacle of bad game design, resulting in a boring, tedious, and monotonous experience and gameplay loop. People saying that the depths are good are crazy, I just don't understand them at all. The same goes for the sky. It's mostly empty with copy-and-paste shrine puzzles. The biggest and most interesting part of the sky is ironically the tutorial island, but it's over quicker than one thinks. It sets the player's expectations on a misleading path, where one thinks they will see other sky islands like it later in the game, but behold, there are no other such places. The rest, again, are just isolated small, mostly copy-paste, islands with similar puzzles. It's so disappointing, considering the sky islands literally were the game's selling point. The ultra-hand mechanics are not thought out either. They allow for massive cheese in basically every puzzle and dungeon. It feels like I was cheesing more than actually doing the puzzles properly, and most puzzles outside of shrines in the game don't even require much interesting use of the ultra-hand mechanics anyway. It's overall just a non-thought-out gimmick. The shrines are terrible too. There are way too many tutorial and blessing shrines, way way too many. And the actual shrines are mostly boring and strange too, with way too much allowance for cheese, again. Back to the sky and depths, their lack of content does NOT help at all the fact that this game basically just copies BOTW's map. They added caves sure, but they're not that interesting considering the vast majority are the same; go in, break some rocks, find a frog, and get out. There are the occasional boss and shrine caves but they don't offer much variation either after you fight the same boss for the 10th time. They all look the same, play the same, and ultimately create again a boring, monotonous experience. What else have they added to the main map? Rocks! Copy and pasted everywhere. How interesting! And that's basically it aside from some minor changes here and there. It's all the same. The fact that the depths and the sky don't offer much intriguing discovery or exploration leads to this game heavily lacking in that aspect. It cannot stand on its own feet and leeches onto BOTW in order to seem ""good"" (it really isn't). It takes the same engine, map, assets, music, enemies, mechanics, and more and adds half-baked trash on top with just a tiny sprinkle of good. This game was in development for longer than its prequel yet it feels like they barely scratched the surface on making this a good overall stand-alone experience, especially considering that they already had the foundation with the engine, map, and mechanics. It feels more like a poorly made reimagining than an actual sequel, and the fact that you go to the same 4 exact places as in the first game doesn't help either. Don't get me started on the long copy-paste cutscene played 4 times. This game is weak, poorly made, and is overall a bad game by Nintendo. I expected way more from them, especially considering the development time, but here we are I guess And it's frustrating seeing how much praise this game gets when it does NOT deserve it at all, and Nintendo does NOT deserve their enormous earnings from it.. It was the first Zelda game I personally bought it has its problems bet they are totally over shadowed by its great. It's not to hard its not too easy. it was a blast to go to the sky islands and the depths. the final boss was also great. I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games. The things that make this Zelda and not **** were present in Breath Of The Wild. Just seems like cramming too many mechanics that are popular into a Zelda game, I can’t help but feel the same way about this as I do Banjo Kazooie nuts and bolts. Temples are present for OG fans but they are short and very easy to work out. The lack of challenge to this made it seem fairly redundant after a while and adding more of the same type of collectibles adds nothing to the overall gameplay. A good try but fell flat for me. Barely makes a Zelda top 10 list.. While I get the criticisms some have issued (depths are too repetitive, the sky should have had more content)... TOTK was a joy to play, I had a blast with the crafting mechanics and with links new abilities. The story is also amazing, and I was lucky to play it in a way that it did not get 'spoiled' / I discovered it at a good pace.. I was one of the few people that enjoyed this more than BOTW, and I still do. It doesn’t quite reach the peaks of the early 2000s Zelda’s for me, but it’s still a magical experience. I think it did a fantastic job of reimagining the Hyrule of BOTW enough to not feel stagnant or boring, but there are some areas that could’ve used a bit more. At this point though, I really hope that Nintendo aims for a more focused take in the next game, and not quite as grand and open.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pretty liked it, but didn't brought me the same shock with BOTW, maybe because I'm in lack with the ability with imagination, so what I built is basically just tools for making progress, copied from other's method,. One of the greatest open world games of all time! Even more creative than BOTW.. A legitimate evolution of Breath of the Wild. The system introduced in this work is also excellent. The only thing that bothered me was the long loading time. Is it a hardware spec problem rather than a software problem?. Again, it's got a great premise, and it could be so much more. I'd probably pay $5 for it as it stands, but not $15.. This is one of my favourite games of all time. I love the world. I love the story. I love the gameplay loop and always have a great time when playing it which I do all the time.. This game is not just a game, it is a revolution. Another revolution made by Nintendo, again and again. A real masterpiece and piece of Art. Amazing in everything: music, colors, gameplay, atmosphere, entertaining etc. Zelda is still one of the best saga in the world!. A masterful follow up to the great BoTW, ToTK proves that Nintendo knows how to do open world games right. This is a very good game because there is so much to discover, the story is good and so much more... simply a very good sequel to BOTW. But there are also disadvantages (if you have already played BOTW) You no longer have that feeling of what it looks like, what is there because you already had all of that in BOTW and there are so many more but it is still a very, very good game and I had a lot of fun playing it. Highly recommended.. Never would I have thought that a game would surpass OoT as my favorite game. The ending brought it all together and this is now my favorite Zelda game, and thus, favorite of all time. Worth buying a switch just for this game and BotW!. Six years have passed since the release of BOTW. I was looking forward to seeing how far the game would evolve. It was a shame. Maps, graphics, and combat remain the same. Same as 6 years ago. Was Nintendo asleep? It's DLC.. The game is very similar to Breath of the Wild, but better. But that isn't what I care about. I care about one thing, and it's in my name. Climbing. Ice. And can you climb ice in this game? You bet your icepick you can. There are many areas with ice that you can climb up, as all you need is a wall of ice. But besides that, it's a good game. The ice can be climbed and at the end of the day that is all I care about.. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an exceptional game, though it closely mirrors its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. However, that’s not necessarily a flaw—why change a formula that was nearly perfect? The world is vast and highly immersive, with a wealth of mechanics that can easily captivate players for hours. I personally recommend, for both TOTK and BOTW, to avoid using online guides. Learning how the game’s intricate systems work on your own adds to the overall experience, and relying on guides can detract from the discovery process.While TOTK introduces some exciting new mechanics and an even more expansive and detailed world, there is one persistent issue that I find puzzling: the lack of a true endgame. Like BOTW, once you complete the main storyline, there's no open-world mode to freely explore or finish side quests. It would be wonderful if the world evolved after completing the final mission, but even without that, simply being able to continue the adventure post-credits would elevate this game to a perfect 10/10. Instead, players are forced to reload their last save before the final mission and avoid completing it to keep the experience going. This aspect significantly dampens the overall enjoyment, as you’re left with two choices: finish the game and lose the motivation to complete side quests, or never finish it at all and focus solely on everything but the main story.. A great open world, only second to the original breath of the wild. While it has some better elements like a better end boss, better story and ending, overall it provides a less fascinating experience.. This game is amazing in every way. First, you can combine items and make new ones, which can help with replayability. The story is also amazing and feels pretty fresh to the Zelda. this game also adds on from Zelda breath of the Wild which was a nine out of ten but this game brings it up to a ten.. The game is almost Perfect the only problem is the damn dungeons I needed google for alot of them. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I was so hyped up for this, and finally got to play. But I've already played the same game before. The building-mechanic is cool, but some verticality and an underground were not delivering what I thought would be a unique experience building on top of BOTW's innovation. This should've been a large expansion or DLC, not a new game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think this game is extremely overrated as it’s literally breath of the wild copy and pasted. The new abilities were cool but I felt like they were kinda pointless. I didn’t really care for the building aspect of the game. The game just seemed very empty. There wasn’t anything in the sky and the depths were a complete waste of time. It’s fun if you want to explore but not worth the 70 bucks that it cost to buy. If it was a DLC I would’ve loved it. Overall, the game is very bland compared to other games and the story had nothing to do with the main storyline which was also disappointing. They need to go back to the original format with dungeons and heart pieces. Incredible story and suspense , the music is on a whole another level. The final boss fight was something i have never seen the likes of in my whole entire life. It is an absolute masterpiece . Botw feels like a trailer for whats to come after playing this game.1000/10. A good story dlc , but yes its good cause its the same game as one of the best of all time .Yes the story is good , but bro like to repetitive 4 time the same things , with the same located dongeon as the one like why . And the new technologies Soneau is like just mid compared to the sheika one . A magnificent DLC but just a good games .. a disappointing follow up to my favorite zelda game of all time, the game is fun when just playing casually, but if your like me and you primarily used windbombs in BOTW to quickly get around, getting around on additional playthroughs is very frustrating with links walking speed too slow for me and the sages are so annoying. Amazing, top of the class regarding gameplay, I have never seen a game that let you make the staff you can do here. Lovely story and art. P.S.: Nintendo we need a more powerful console!. This game is so... perfect! I really like him, and this game is not VEEEEEEEERY big, but is alot of details, play! I recommend. Incredible, massive, enchanting game. endless exploration, discovery and adventure. Love the world expansion with the skies and depths. Enjoyed the larger character roster and Hyrule feels way more alive and brimming with life than Botw. Love the new fuse and ultra hand functions , genius. Overall one of the best games ever imo.. “Tears of the Kingdom is the best game I have ever played. The story and its opening are very intriguing, and the game’s content and character relationships are also quite deep. In this game, we can do anything freely without being limited to doing one thing before another; you can take down the final boss right away if you want. The Ultra Hand system and the creativity involved are also very interesting. I was really surprised when I encountered the ‘reverse’ mechanic; it was amazing how I could apply it in various ways during battles and in the puzzles within the game, which are quite diverse. The game world itself is very open, with adventures in the sky, on the ground, and in the air. The story, both past and present, is excellent as well. This is an amazing game.”. It offers you an introduction to Action Adventure Open Worlds. Huge nostalgic world. Epic story. Really good game!. An impressive sequel to a masterpiece, although I can't help but feel that it under delivers for what I would have wanted to see from a sequel to BOTW. This game is great from the combat to the story. but almost everything in the game is borrowed from BOTW. this includes the map, the enemies, the combat system, the items, the mechanics, and the story. this game is honestly better than BOTW, but if you have already played it, this game ****. If you have not played BOTW, then play this game, but otherwise, this game is not worth the around 60 hours it takes to complete. also, why is it 70 dollars?!?!?!?!?!. The game is an amazing masterpiece and while it does have many issues, it's still better then other zelda games with it being a bit better then *breath of the wild*, I don't think a game like this should be called the worst, cause it really isn't, it's just a really great and fun zelda game and that's why I like it despite me not playing it's prequel *breath of the wild*. BEST VIDEO GAME EVER !! A lot of possibilities, a great story, THAT IS a €70 game !. This is the best game I have ever played in my entire life. A good sequel takes what the original did, and expands upon them. TOTK only made 99% of those things better. Miss the temples BOTW took away? TOTK brought them back. While I do prefer the linear dungeons, these new ones are a big improvement from the divine beasts.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is a masterpiece i dont care if you think its just like a dlc its not this is beautiful. Great game, with excellent mechanics, good characters and a catching story. Un gran juego con excelentes mecánicas, buenos personajes y una historia atrapante.. An improvement in every way over the original Breath of The Wild. The building mechanics with the Ultra Hand were mindblowing. Dungeons were slightly improved but were still too easy to complete but included interesting bosses in comparison to Breath of The Wild's. An incredible soundtrack as expected from a Zelda game. Traversal and exploration of the changed world after the events of Breath of The Wild are incredible when using ascend and the creativity of the player to build vehicles to traverse it.. Horrible garbage even before you compare it to breath of the wild. The ONLY things it does better than breath of the wild are music and cinematics. The story is bad, the gameplay, flow, and balancing are terrible, and there is an UNBELIEVABLE amount of copy paste in this game. Like, it's absolutely absurd.. Tears of The Kingdom is perhaps better than Breath of The Wild in every possible way. On paper at least, and it is. But… the original is artistically more compelling and complete. Tears of The Kingdom is a fantastic sequel, and the end of the game is legendary.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game built upon the already existing map and features of the Masterpiece that was Breath of the Wild, added some terrific additions and variety to it. It isn't a DLC as many thought but an excellent new addition to the Zelda world. The best game the Switch has to offer.. When this game came out all I saw on twitter and youtube were people talking about how this game was a solid 9/10 game, but not as good as insert game here. I find it ridiculous that when a game (especially one as good as Totk) Comes out, we find each and every problem we have with it, and gloss over the actually good parts of the game. ""Totk isn't perfect"" ""Totk a solid 9/10"" and ""Totk is a missed opportunity"" Gamers please, shut your mouths. Tears of the Kingdom is an incredibly polished and incredible feat of Game design. You can see in Breath of the Wild and now in Totk that Nintendo's focus was to make a fun game. Not to make a 10/10 traditional Zelda, not to beat out the competition, but instead to make a fun video game. ""If the games are not fun, why bother"" -Reggie. Here's a news flash. This game is fun, incredibly fun. The Ultra hand ability alone got players to sink hours into it just experimenting with what they could build with it. But the best part is, is that there are 3 other abilities that are woven perfectly into Tears of the Kingdoms gameplay. You're stuck in a large underground cave or want to scale a mountain or ledge, but don't want to spend time climbing it? Use Ascend and literally swim through the Terrain. You accidentally dropped your vehicle or weapon off of the brand-new Sky Islands? Use Recall, and with an enormous reach to have any object you want just go back to the same position it was in before it dropped. Do you hate weapon durability and having your weapon break? Use Fuse to create weapons with the very materials that broke your weapon in the first place. Additionally, use any and every material you have to create many unique arrow types that continue to further the combat. Yes, Totk may not be perfect, but it's leagues ahead of game design than 90% of AAA games that come out.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely an improvement from Breath of the Wild. The story, the world, the mechanics, the themes... everything is just amazing. Best game I have ever played!. There are no spoilers in this review. A very good Zelda, frankly, the characters are much better written than in Botw, the lore is much more present, the side quests are much more interesting and really serve a purpose this time, plus new mechanics that enrich the gameplay, such as the powers, which are much more polished than in its predecessor, and a truly graphically clean open world that runs smoothly on the Switch. In short, this is a must-have game, one of the very best Zelda games in my opinion. the few defects are : The clichéd and rather flat main storyline, in-game slowdowns, poor VF (yes, I'm French), lack of content on this gigantic map.. Stunning gorgeous visuals (which make you forget that Nintendo’ hardware is underpowered), really intuitive and rich game play, great storyline, lovingly memorable characters, and an epic soundtrack. It is the perfect video game. Makes you wonder how can Nintendo ever follow up after this masterpiece. Wow this game is really not it. Rather boring and makes absolutely zero sense in terms of story. The mechanics ****, the dungeons ****, and most interface components absolutely ****. There are so many unanswered questions. That said the music and visuals are amazing but also such was expected as they were amazing in the last game. Overall it feels like BOTW with some ok building mechanics I don't really care about and bad story elements that make no sense. BOTW feels tainted by the lacklustre release of TOTK. This is the only Zelda game I started but have no interest in finishing. The first hours are fun but wow does it get repetitive - especially the ultrahand building mechanic and frequent gathering/cooking. The new areas above/below ground don't add enough meaningful content so it just feels like you are replaying Breath of the Wild again.. The best successor to Breath of the Wild, hours and hours of gameplay guaranteed, earns its semi-perfect 9. An improvement on BOTW in every way. A generational game and deserves to be played and replayed. Just a wonder to behold.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tears of the kingdom is by far one of my favorite games. Unlike others, I haven't played Breath of the Wild, so I came into the experience new. The Experience was suprisingly fleshed out and I really enjoyed the mechanics of the game. Overall, it is, imo the best game I have ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Why is the map here so similar to the original map? It pretty much ruins the exploration. There were not enough sky islands at all... and the depths are just a reskin of the surface, kept very dark so you don't notice how boring and empty it is. the story is genuinely horrible, I've watched SpongeBob episodes with a better plot than this game. and the dungeons in this game are pretty bad, though not as bad as in Breath of the Wild. This game also completely lacks an atmosphere of any kind. it evokes little to no emotion through a majority of the game The good stuff? I like the enemy variety and combat, and I like the fuse mechanic a lot. Some of the puzzles are pretty decent, and the sand temple almost felt like an actual dungeon with fun stuff in it. almost. Ganondorf was a good villain, and his boss sequence is one of the best in the entire Zelda series. That said, this game was a massive, massive disappointment. Nintendo needs to set their next Zelda game in a very different world, with new exploration to be done. And hopefully, it might have a decent story and atmosphere to go along with it. I recommend playing this game if you've never played Breathe of the Wild, as then the exploration will feel fresh. Otherwise, play at your own risk. Honestly, everything about this game exceeds BOTW. From quality of life changes to large scale map transformations, it is unlike anything else. It still amazes me this thing can still run in 6 year old hardware, sure there are like frame drops from time to time but it almost unnoticeable. BOTW was my second Zelda game I ever played, and I absolutely loved the adventure I had at that game along with the DLC. Now with TOTK, the game turned an already existing world into a fresher and new look, with a reworked surface world, the depths and the sky islands. Even revisiting old areas in BOTW seems to yield a quest of some sorts. And the world isn't the only thing I am praising here, the gameplay mechanics is probably what 50 percent convinced me to get the game.Just the idea of creating mass weapons of destruction, advanced vehicles, new movement ability, and time manipulation, it just amazed me. The amount of freedom you get here is immense. If you just got introduced to the Zelda series and BOTW was your first game. I recommend you try this.. A worthy successor of breath of the wild, absolutely stunning, must play for sure!. This game is amazing. However, it feels like a Breath of the Wild expansion pack. The story is amazing and the final boss is one of the best I've seen in a long time, but the story of the game is almost identical to it's predecessor. You go to four temples, defeat a few bosses, and go kill Ganon. However, the story is only accessible through side quests many players may never see or attempt. The addition of two new areas is nice, but I wish Nintendo had done more to enhance an already perfect game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is one of the best I’ve ever played. If you have a Switch, you absolutely have to try it. The beautiful music and intricate scenery will definitely leave a lasting impression on you.. This was a fantastic game andI love it to death. The only reason it isn’t perfect is that the depths were extremely formulaic, there were very little sky islands, and because it was using the same world it did feel like it was only DLC. Very very good DLC. An amazing story that again has an immersive open world, satisfying combat, and interesting mechanics. Every suit of armor and weapon has so much variety and flare that makes it never boring to get a new one. personally this just feels like a copy and paste that tries to expand but fails, the sky areas feel the same and bland, nothing about the ground changes. But the story is much better but the cons outweigh the pros sadly.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For the most part it's kind of entertaining but that's it, it's just entertaining. There's so much to do but the stuff that you're actually doing feels kinda superficial. I notice my brain switches off while playing, the same way it does while watching stuff like tiktok or other short form media because all the things you do in this game seem like short bursts of random things to ",the only reason for such a high score this gets is nostalgia and lack of competition . comparing it to breath of the wild it just sort of lacks charachter given it is not a completely original game . comparing it to breath of the wild it just sort of lacks charachter given it is not a completely original game .
290.Tony Hawk's Underground,"Absolutely fantastic, it's punk atmosphere was fascinating and exciting back then. It has so much personality it compensates for everything else.. This game is fantastic. Good plot and attractive elements. The objectives are well-planned. You won't complete this game in a single day because there is so much to accomplish.. Best game in the series no questions asked. Very fun levels and story. Some of the best secret characters in the series.. A phenomenal and ground breaking game. The addition of walking/running mechanics and various vehicles made the game feel enormous with endless possibilities. The skating was fantastic as it was in the previous game. The customization of your character made for an enthralling experience that I still revisit on my old PS2 even two decades later. This was the Tony Hawk at it's finest.. The game is totally awsome and everyone should have it cause the customization and everything to do with this game just is so awsome!!! Be sure to get the broadband adaptor and play on-line to get totally into the game. A change of breed doesn't do anything to this game but make it awesome! An extremely revamped Create-A mode setup is shown here, with the Create-A-Park mode in this game probably the best part about it. The story is no good, but the Career Mode itself is pretty magnificent. An extremely addictive game in the series, and an instant recommendation to anybody anywhere!!. This one is straight banger. I loved almost every single secong i passed with this game.. This game has been my all-time favorite for some time now. Better and more engaging story than any Marvel movie, amazing gameplay, and the graphics are good for the time. Great animation, and no major glitches. And the story is about skating this time! There is no bad part to this game, its flawless. A 90 is low for this game.. OVERALL - 87% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay Value - 8/10 Don't have the timeless punch of THPS2/3 but with I enjoyed the addition of an actual story to the gameplay. Great soundtrack as always from THUG.. Best story in a Tony Hawk game ever. More tricks that are killer, Create a Skater that is so good current sports game wish they had that **** and create a park is so good that I forgot modding levels to make them look good was a thing. U can play older levels that take some thinking to find, and the best jackass to rival u ERIC SPARROW. The only thing to complain about is that the graphics aren't the best.... but **** the graphics when the game play is just better. This may not be the most favorable for all players in general, but for hardcore Tony Hawk fans that find the series as a cult, this game is the best next to THPS2. Also **** IRON MAN. When it comes to tracking my history with video games, you can't go much further back than Tony Hawk's Underground. This was the first video game I ever loved. The first game I ever truly got excited about and one of the first video games in general that I remember playing. To me, it's the peak of the Tony Hawk series from a story standpoint and damn near the peak from a gameplay standpoint. It has some of the best levels the series has to offer, the best soundtrack in my opinion and is overall just, to me, the best full package that the series ever sold. The story mode is what most people remember and is where the game shines most. This was the first time the series went for an actual story based campaign, following your created character as they embark on a journey through all the ins and outs of being a professional skater. It's pretty realistic for a lot of it, being based on a culmination of several pro skaters actual stories, but there's definitely some completely unrealistic video game stuff in there as well. A lot of the missions are dumb and kinda make no sense but honestly, it adds to the charm for me. What isn't charming is the vehicles. Whoever thought adding vehicles to this game was a good idea should've been fired, they handle like they're on ice and the levels are not designed with them in mind. The game also has some incredibly difficult missions on the hardest difficulty so I definitely had my fair share of yelling at the TV and taking long breaks but after 16 years, I finally managed to beat the game on the hardest difficulty. That's a milestone I'm legitimately proud of. If I rated games solely on personal enjoyment, this would be an 11 out of 10 but I like to keep things a little more objective. It's one of my favorite games of all time and by far the most nostalgic game for me but I can easily say its glaring flaws. I beat this game in March of 2020 after beating it countless times before.. I decided to give it a high score not because of its story (its nice that its there, but come on), not because of its themes, but because the level design is off the charts here. It really is fantastic game to boot and every little thing from previous games combined with a possibility to get of the deck and still maintain that damn combo results in a great, complex gameplay. You can even get inside some vehicles, but the moment you do that, controls change from godlike to terrible.. Story - 7/10 (nostalgia is strong on this one) Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 (punk and hip hop parts of the soundtrack are godlike) Levels - 10/10 (manhattan and new jersey are top tier TH levels) Replay value - 10/10. da greatest thps game. therefore da greatest game. **** u eric u sparrow piece of **** !. So here I am Doing everything I can Holding on to what I am Pretending that I'm a Superman This is probably one of my most favorite game of all time. Two words, Perfect Game, Way better than any tony hawk that's Proving Ground or later.. My personal favorite in the Tony Hawk series! Tony Hawk's Underground has to be the best in the series with a fantastic career mode, fun gameplay, well designed levels, a great soundtrack, and several great customization options. The career mode follows your character starting from the underground and becoming a pro skateboarder. Also, this was the first game in the series that allowed your player to get off their board which is a very necessary refinement. The levels in this game are very well designed and flow perfectly together for massive combos. However, one of the best parts of this game has to be the customization options. There are several including Create-A-Park, Create-A-Skater, Create-A-Trick and even Create-A-Goal. This game allows so much control to the player that it makes the game very fun and awesome. Tony Hawk's Underground easily has to be the best in the Tony Hawk series.. The best Tony Hawk on PS2 . This game has got very good graphics for 2003 and funny game on two . Many different things and many skaters . This game is best game about skateboarding on PlayStation 2 . 8/10 . Interesting and Funny game .. 12 to 13 years after release and I still play this game at least once a week. From epic music from Alkaline Trio to Bracket to awesome gameplay that has no competition, this game is one of the best games out there.. The best game in the series. This game was the first in the series to have a story mode and have the ability to edit almost anything in the game along with driving and have the ability to walk, the driving is not the best but the walking really helps to get you on buildings and save your combos and the story mode tells a really good story, the levels are fun and the soundtrack has 78 songs filled with Hip Hop, Punk, and Rock which is filled with a lot of good songs. Overall this game is addicting and will keep you busy for hours.. Tony Hawk games were always **** the most part. Tony Hawk's Underground is an example **** game. This ""part"" of the series was very revolutionary, this was the first Tony Hawk game with a storyline, you and your friend Eric Sparrow want to become the greatest skater in the world. The game wasn't too long, if you ""pro"" in TH games you can do it in 6-5 hours. There was some change in the gameplay, now you can get off your board, this function made it easier to reach pepole with goals, higher places, also now you can drive cars, this function is worked horrible. The level design was great, and the Create-a- is expanded, now you can create your own deck, and the Park creator was less frustrating. If you completed the game once in beginner difficulty you've unlocked one of the most epic characters in a Tony Hawk game: Iron Man, also you can go to a KISS concert level. You can get many,many secrets, for example the Hangar level from THPS2. The controls and the graphics in this game was awesome at the time. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the soundtrack, oh my God the soundtrack;Busdriver,Supernatural,Alkaine Trio,Angry Amputees,Bad Religion. Many pepole said that after Underground the Tony Hawk games was not the same, and I kind of agree with them. Overall this game wasn't bad as it's sequel, the story and the gameplay was great, and the soundtrack is good too also the graphics were great, I've played this game many,many times. Good luck, have fun. While not my favorite game of the series, Tony Hawk's Underground is one of my favorite games of all time, and one I will be playing again and again. I love the game so much I don't even pay attention to the flaws.. A change of breed doesn't do anything to this game but make it awesome! An extremely revamped Create-A mode setup is shown here, with the Create-A-Park mode in this game probably the best part about it. The story is no good, but the Career Mode itself is pretty magnificent. An extremely addictive game in the series, and an instant recommendation to anybody anywhere!!. This game is at the same time of the first games I've ever owned myself, and also one of the best games I've ever played! I have just positive things to say about this game: A great storyline, good graphics (for a game made in 2003) and lots of unique tricks! Another big plus is that you can now edit your skater, deck, parks and even your own tricks! If you like Skate games then this is a game you should definitely get.. 9.5/10 = Incredible = The last great Tony Hawk game ever made. This game is addictive and a blast to play. It's new features allow for unlimited amounts of replay value. I loved creating new missions and levels!!",the skating was fantastic as it was in the previous game . the customization of your character made for an enthralling experience that i still revisit on my old PS2 even two decades later .
291.Ape Escape,"Brilliant and constantly fun. The base mechanic is extremely fun, and the level layout adds a layer of challenge which is quite on par even for experienced gamers. A classic of playstation history and a must have for any collector.. It was fine. For the time, it was very impressive in many ways, but i never really liked it.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. An incredibly wonderful game. Very innovative for its time, excellent graphics, very good music. The plot of the game is also interesting. Just brilliant. It is pure childhood.. The best and most rememorable thing about this game for me is the music, all the cool gadgets and monkeys along the way is a bonus. Such an amazing game! The soundtrack is the best of all time. Definitely worth visiting again.. One of the best games on PSX. If you enjoy 3D platformers, this one is a no-brainer.. Martin A. - Gatta catch them all! Ape Escape ,at the time, was revolutionary for showing me at a young age that the duel shock analog controller was not only the future of gaming, it will soon be ""a must have"" for years to come. One of the 1st games to ever require a $70 controller. I remember my father saying ""This is your birthday present."" around July, I was born in December and it was worth every penny and then some. What I hated. The graphics don't hold up but there is an HD version on the PSP called Ape Escape: On the Loose, which has cut content because of the lack of a 2nd analog stick. Most notably, a cut mini game called ""Galaxy Monkey"" which was my favorite of the three mini games. The voice actors aren't the same which is understandable. The game has an infinite jump glitch involving the sling shot, which I must point out as a negative even though in my opinion, improves the gameplay. Also, the game is too short, I wanted more than just a graphics update. What I loved. Everything. The location of the levels are imprinted in my mind. The music is on my phone today and one of them is my ringtone (Crabby Beach). Soichi Terada is the man responsible for the sound track and I'm eternally thankful. There are monkeys riding dinosaurs and doing all sorts of horsing around, almost making them come to life, as if they really do live in the game's environment. The monkey radar reveals not only where the monkeys are but their names and contains a reference to South Park. There's nothing more to say other than play it. I have to thank Susumu Takatsuka and the entire staff of the Ape Escape team for shaping my childhood and adding magic to my life. Thank you all so much! 9 out of 10.. I am nostalgic for this game so I might be a little bias, but I love this game and it's still my favorite Ape Escape game. The others tried and while there are technically better things in future games, the first one just nailed it down pretty well and really utilized all of the PS1 Duelshock controller's controls.. One of the best ps1 games and possibly one of the best platforming games ever. The gameplay and controls are solid and I love how many gadgets you can use to navigate through the levels and "" catching the monkeys "" idea made the game special and unique with some great level design and great amount of themes and locations and the levels are different from each other and it's really impressive for a ps1 game. the only problem I have is the draw distance some parts are difficult to see what's in front of you but it's just a minor issue. Ape escape is a really great game and it's extremely underrated.. It's a good game overall but I disliked the controls. I have never seen a game map a jump button to r1. This game is for dumb stupid babies. I could beat this game blindfolded while my little brother's playing. I puke every time I see this godawful excuse for a game. 1/5. I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old. 9 years later, it still holds up. Ape Escape is genuinely entertaining and well-made for its time. The combat is challenging and fun, and the levels are unique. Even the music is incredible. The story and voice acting is rather cheesy, but other than that, I would recommend this game to anyone. It can be replayed over and over without losing its spark.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. This game holds up extremely well for it being over 18 years old. Everything about this game is just brilliant, from the controls to the music. It's so campy and fun it's hard not to enjoy the weirdness of the game, I mean your going back in time to capture monkeys, that's weird. But weirdness aside I'd still play this game again and again and again. Among the finest 3D platformers to come from the good old PS1.. One of the best ps one platformers money can buy and a true icon for sony and the orginal playstation. It plays great and its orginal. The only problem is you have to either have a ps one or ps2 to play thi game and a dualschock controller since this isnt backwards compatiable on the ps3 and there has not been a PSN re release (bar the psp version). If you have a method to play the game DO IT! It is one of the best games for the ps1 and is well worth your time.. This game is just... fun, innovative, and all around just amazing. Just play it if you like platformers, the dual analog controls are just so marvelous.. the title and premise sounds goofy, but it is so much fun. basically you are trying to capture monkeys that have escaped through a time machine to take over mankind as the new dominant race by having them take over every major period in time starting from the dinosaur ages to modern day. lots of gizmos and gadgets to use, fun and interesting stages for the most part, and a very original and unique experience can be found in this game. there are a few flaws in some of the stage designs that can make the game quite frustrating at times, but doesn't subtract much from everything that is so fun from the game. the game feels like it drags on though, and although you get new items and such through out the game, it feels like your still just doing the same thing from the very first stage. Its not repetitive exactly, it just feels like that even though the environments are new, you don't feel like you moved on to the next stage. the game is definitely worth a play through for sure despite the negatives. Amongst the very first games to make full use of the PSone analogue sticks Ape Escape was simply a superb example of the 3d platformer genre that continually added new ideas and gadgets form start to finish. Its clever twist, of having the player capture monkeys rather than the usual static collectibles found in most games, only added further to its appeal. It may now look a little dated but this is one game still worth playing.. Ape Escape is a fun adventure through time. Oh and you catch monkeys, a lot of monkeys. The graphics do not hold up well, but it is still playable. The controls are unique and hard to get use to. For example the jump button is R1. Ape Escape was really the first game that used the analog sticks on the controller. One stick is used to move Spike and the other is used to control your gadget. The story moves along and sets up the monkey madness well. Ape Escape is fun, uses the new controls well, and the story sets up all the monkey capturing mayhem.. One of the most memorable platformers on PSX, and for a console that was overflowing with great platformers that's truly saying something. The apes themselves beat most of Nintendo's staple characters in both personality and quirkiness (with blue being my personal fave). Gameplay-wise, it has everything a true platformer should have. Great level design? Check. Multiple gadgets? Check. Brain teasing puzzles? Check. Awesome graphics? Check! It's a shame the PS2 sequels weren't as good as the first one, but oh well.. WHERE IS NUMBER 4??? This game series is loved, sells good and such. But this is so far the last made. What is sony thinking? They made this year ape escape move which is a horrible game. Where is number 4??? i would buy it in a heart beat!","""ape escape"" is a classic of playstation history and a must have for any collector . for the time, it was very impressive in many ways, but i never really liked it . the soundtrack is the best of all time . if you enjoy 3D platformers, this is a no-brainer ."
292.Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story,"What is there to say that hasn’t been said already? This is one of if not the best Mario RPG. Play it if you can. Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is truly a masterclass of the DS era. Replaying to this game: I found it enjoyable, but it was an average difficulty. The soundtrack and linear yet effective storytelling are fascinating. While many may argue that the story isn't perfect the RPG element of grinding to rainbow rank is tedious, and the bros' moves are broken (i.e.: Magic Window and Falling Star are just delete buttons) It's the price of how much SP you need and the way you get it a late game makes the difficulty consistent. Plus the dual mode of controlling Bowser then Mario & Luigi is unique and paces nicely so it's not always on one or the other too much; It's like Plot A and Plot B where you have two stories in one, which makes the gameplay less stale then other Mario & Luigi RPG's. Overall, this masterclass has so many elements for the perfect game. The final thing I'd like to mention. The Final Boss Music, and the Boss Arena post-game, add a cherry on top to this game that I dare say is a masterpiece.. It's just Fun. The Characters, the Story and the Gameplay! It's the perfect Mario und Luigi in my opinion.. Excellent game in every way and the best in the series, works perfectly for the Nintendo DS.. The best of the best in RPGs of this genre. Super easy for anyone to grasp with fun levels and fun worlds. It has an amazing soundtrack especially for a DS game. The ability to play as Bowser as well is such a unique twist. This game has so much replay value just purely from the unique experience alone and the extras they have included in the game. This is a must have for DS owners.. Peak rpg the levels, battles, music, bosses, and story are incredible and it is one of the most hilarious games I've played with the best final boss theme ever. Perfect. This game was clearly made with love. From the music, the combat, to the creativity in the story and events. So perfect. If there is a game I will put my life on the line to defend it is this one. I will say it again, perfect.. Sublime, that's the word I use to define this game, how it improves the mechanics of past games and adapts to the narrative is incredible, everything that the saga could improve, it improved for this game. It's incredible how it makes the RPG genre less boring, this saga makes playing RPG not just about pounding the ""A"" and looking at statistics, in this game your skill as a player counts and that's great.. It is a game so perfectly beautiful that I dare say it is the best RPG in the series. As a child I preferred Companions In Time but the mastery of this game won over nostalgia. The narrative is sublime and innovates many mechanics.. One of the best RPGS of all time, and the best Mario & Luigi game for sure, must play!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Mario RPG no contest! Best music! Yoko shimomura went insane on the ost! The environments are beautiful!. Amazing plot and characters. The game is quite hard during boss fights and minigames.. By far one of the best RPG's in the Mario series. Very fun story and great gameplay. Bowser is funny and the final boss is cool.. this game is the best RPG, i love how you actually are inside bowser, its such a cool feature. This game is just not worth playing. They overstuffed everything and it feels so bloated. The minigames were painful, the giant battles were mediocre, the soundtrack is just OK, and the humor is very dry. If you want to play an RPG title on a DS, try Partners in Time, because this one... No, just no.. One of the best games ever made, the ost, the story, the combat sistem, one of the best childhood games for sure. This game is so incredible. The systems have been fine tuned with a far better implementation of the bros. items. The story is great, play as bowser is fun, starlow is way better than that suitcase **** I only have 2 problems. The first is that the use of the microphone is quite intense and makes it less accessible. The second is this game probably introduced children to vore 2/10. 9/10 #nowplaying The New CALassic by Cal Chuchesta feat. Filthy Frank, Pink Guy, 3PAC, FrankJavCee, John Sakars, D. Respect, Dom Rabrun, NMESH via @audiomack ****/calchuchesta/album/the-new-calassic. Very similar to its predecessor Partners in time but with added 2D levels and the chance to play as Bowser. A solid little arcade adventure and slightly better than the first game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is a fantastic game that is sure to please both casual and hardcore gamers alike. The game is a perfect mix of classic Mario platforming, role-playing, and puzzle-solving that results in a truly unique and engaging experience. The gameplay itself is top-notch, The battle system is intuitive and engaging between all 3 of our main characters. The game's presentation is simply outstanding. The graphics are bright and colorful, capturing the whimsical spirit of the Mario franchise perfectly. The music similarly excellent, providing a delightful audio backdrop to the game as a whole. As a longtime fan of Mario and Luigi games, I can confidently say that Bowser's Inside Story on the Nintendo DS is one of the best in the series. And what makes this game even better? BOWSER. Playing as Bowser in a Mario game is a refreshing change of pace. In previous games, he was always the big baddie to defeat. But here? you play as him and experience his perspective, thoughts, and abilities which overshadow the brothers. His personality and humor make him a standout char, with his constant grumbling and the hilarious dialogue between him and the world. The Story of the game is fantastic, it's got ""Story"" in its name for a reason, any game where you have such a unique scenario of the hero's and villain teaming up to defeat a greater evil is gonna be flames. Bowser's Inside Story is an excellent game that showcases why Bowser is such a beloved character in the Mario universe. His unique abilities and humorous personality add a new dimension to the game, and the game as a whole from top to bottom is top notch for the DS. PLAY THE GAME, SHOWTIME!. im just wasting characters to put this joke................. v o r e. 10/10. A very good and different Mario game. The story was very smart and the gameplay was good but did get a bit tedious at times. The boss fights were very fun as they all felt different. Controlling bowser and then Mario and Luigi was also really fun. The main villain of the wizard was also quite cool and the fight where big bowser fights the castle was also very cool.. I love playing as bowser but as mario i dont like it i would pref it if i could only play as bowser and luigi. It is a very good but sometimes drags on but it’s really good for the time.. Great RPG. A must buy for the DS. Superstar Saga is better but this title stands on its own. It's good.. Le game good. The combat is enertaining for both charcters hitting an excellent on bowser is extremly satisfying and playing as the bros is just as good. The dialoge and story is funny, logical and unique. The overworld is also a joy to explore as both charcters even though sometimes its a bit confusing of how to get somewhere as a different character but thats probably just me. The music is amazing just like all the mario and luigi games. One thing i dislike is that theres only one combat song and only one boss song (other than the one for the final boss) which was kinda dissapointing, but since they're so catchy i'll let it slide. The gimick where you make bowser huge and fight giant things is great and doesn't overstay its welcome. In general this is a must play for ds users.. WHAT A GREAT GAME. the concept with Bowser Is Good,The Music Is Good,The bosses are Good but the giant battles are the weakest part of the game.Still a game i love like Dream team and the past games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. MARIO & LUIGI: BOWSER'S INSIDE STORY One of the best games I've played in my life, having charismatic characters, an addictive combat and experience system and an entertaining story that goes beyond the standards of the main Mario games.. A masterpiece ****, had so much good memories of this game :) really wanted a remake/port to the switch with all the potencial it deserves. this is the best mario and luigi game. if you're going to play one game in this series, make it this one. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. To me, this is the second to best Mario RPG of all time! It comes close to topping Thousand Year Door for how fun it is!. I found playing this to be incredibly stressful and not rewarding. The characters and graphics are the most charming part.. It's a great game that go's on far too long. I enjoyed my time with it but within 8 hours I was losing it for a 20 hour game which made me start to lose interest.. This game is great. It's not just the best Mario & Luigi game, it's the best Mario RPG game. Do yourself a favor and play this as soon as possible.. The best Mario RPG. You think TTYD is perfect? Get ready for a rude awakening.. This game is perfect in its format. For me it’s one of the best games on nintendo ds.. Great RPG game. Gameplay is as fun as ever while story remains interesting enough to keep the player engaged.. You get a decent story with Bowser and his minions coupled with engaging mechanics this time. Truly unique experience.. One of my most favorite NIntendo DS games. I remember having real fun with the title and like the graphics until this day.. Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is the best Nintendo DS game ever made.. Bowser’s Inside Story is a delightful RPG that’s definitely a must-play Nintendo DS title. This game is definitely the best Mario & Luigi game. (Doing this for you Alphadream, now defunct, R.I.P). Take one of the villains from Superstar Saga leading to this game’s plot. The plot is pretty great and Bowser as being one of the playable main characters is really surprising, no wonder I love this game. The gameplay definitely improved from Partners in Time, the giant boss battles were an immersive thrill. Although, few of the mini-Games were quite frustrating (that CARROT game). The visuals were really great, even for the giant boss battles. Lastly but not least, the outstanding music (composed by the legendary Yoko Shimomura, who composed Kingdom Hearts and others RPGs). Especially, the music for the final boss, it’s quite incredible and downright memorable! Right? Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story was a pleasurable and memorable experience for me. The humor, the gameplay, the music and lots of things that made this game very great (but still, few of the mini games were frustrating). This RPG is a must-play for Nintendo fans, Mario fans and maybe RPG fans. I’ll give this score a... 9.4! (10). My favorite game on the DS. It's writing is humorous, the gameplay is smooth and refined, the graphics have a charming cartoon style to them, the music is great, and it's one of the few RPGs (that isn't Pokemon) that I'm willing to play over and over.. I love this game. It’s absolutely stunning in both story and gameplay. It isn’t perfect though. For example, the carrot minigame. If you’re not familiar with this game, then it’s extremely challenging. Then the muscle minigame. It just gets annoying after a while. I’d still recommend this to a friend, though.. One of the best games ever and the best Mario game in my opinion. Nothing else to say. One of my favorite games of all time. Brilliantly mixing the charming and addicting action command based RPG battles with the best music and 2D sprite work seen in video games. The story is fantastic, it never slows down, and the characterization of Bowser, Fawful, Midbus, and others is amazing. Every boss fight in this game is absolutely bonkers, and the music for the boss fights is immaculate. As a fan of weirdness, 2d sprite work, and Mario RPGs, this is a game that feels like it was made specifically for me. 10/10 MasterPiece.. Fantastic RPG. I didn't expect it to be so darn fun, but it was. A great story, fun minigames, great use of the DS's features, fun combat and exploration, great art style, and hilarious writing. Definitely a DS essential.. This game is a masterpiece. I am reviewing the original game the day the remake came out, and the game has aged as well as any game can. The story is hilarious, the characters and super creative and memorable, the graphics look outstanding for a DS game and probably are the best graphics on the system that definitely stand the test of time as beautiful 32-bit pixel art bliss, and the soundtrack and the sound in general is godlike. It literally almost sounds CD-quality instead of compressed DS MIDI. This game is just simply timeless, and should be considered the best game in the series. Hell, this game is almost totally flawless, so I would think it would be considered among the greatest video games of all time.. Bowser's Inside Story is one of my favorite video games of all time, and easily the best of every Mario RPG. The story is great, the characters are great, the music is great, the humor is great, and FAWFUL IS THE BEST! Bowser being an actual main character was a blast to play as. He brings so much charm to the game. With the remake coming out next year, I'm excited to see if Nintendo can improve BiS even further with the addition of Bowser Jr's Journey. But it will be hard to top my nostalgia for this masterpiece.. I love this game, it’s got a near perfect story for a Mario game, and the gameplay is at some of its best. Fawful for life!. I haven't really finished the game, mostly because I lost it, but I have some REALLY good memories with it. Pros: + Combat: I loved the turn-based combat in M&L:BIS. Unlike Pokemon, it gets pretty interactive even when it isn't your turn. + Playing as Bowser: While I prefer Odyssey's Bowser segments over this game's playable Bowser, I still enjoyed playing as him and beating down baddies as him. + 2D Platforming with Mario and Luigi: While inside of Bowser, I enjoyed the little puzzles that were placed for Mario and Luigi. + Soundtrack: Pretty great. Cons: - Some of the Puzzles/Minigames: Honestly the Carrot minigame **** badly. Overall, Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is an amazing RPG that I hope to play again soon and finish. Therefore, it warrants a 9.5/10 from me.. This game is honestly a great game. The story is great. The level design is excellent and the boss battles are epic. The music is meh, but I like it either way. Now, my biggest problem with this game is the fact that Mario and Luigi are getting eaten by Bowser. ReaLLY, that concept bothers me.. Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is super fantastic and is a lovely game to play. Although I like Dream Team more, I like this one a lot, too.. Fantastic game, I love it! The story is very good and original, just like the fantastic soundtrack. It has fantastic characters (very, very good) and lots of humour. The game is not too hard, but sometimes, battles can take you by surprise and take you 10 times to beat. The game is long, and did I say that the characters and story were great already? A big world with lots of areas, and going inside Bowser's body to power certain parts of his body or cure him is really original. Fantastic game!. Usually you'd approach an RPG expecting a dramatic storylines and a complex combat system. But the Mario & Luigi games come to the genre like a breath of fresh air, offering the same quality gameplay you woud expect from a great RPG (although in a more simplistic fashion), but taking itself less seriously and offering straightforward fun and a lot of silliness and charm. Bowser's Inside Story is a simple but well done JRPG, perfect for a handheld console, and ideally suited for short sessions after playing more serious and complex RPGs. The gameplay follows the same formula than the previous Mario & Luig titles, but overall, it feels like a more straightforward experience compared to Superstar Saga. It is a bit shorter, and a bit more linear. However, the game doesn't feel shallow at all because of this. Around halfway through the story is when the game truly starts to open up all of its possibilities: The world starts to feel more like a world, and less like a collection of isolated levels, there is more optional stuff to do, and you already have a good amount of options when it comes to combat. Overall, the second half of the game gives you more of the freedom that I felt while playing Superstar Saga, and thus it becomes more enjoyable. The story is silly as always, and the characters are all hilarious. Bowser being a lovable *sshole, Luigi with his usual clumsiness, Fawful and his ridiculous way of speaking... This is a genuinely humorous game. I find it surprising how reluctant videogames are to embrace humor as a main theme. But Mario & Luigi does it, and it excels at doing it. It is clearly one of the most funny and lighthearted experiences you can have with games. The combat system is, like the game itself, simple and straightforward. But fun, addictive and charming at the same time. The Mario & Luigi series stands out among turn-based RPGS for being fast-paced and requiring a lot of player input. Basically, every attack or defense you perform is a minigame in itself. This prevents the combats from feeling dull and monotonous, as it constantly demands your attention. On top of that, add some special attacks that are very fun and satisfying to perform, and the overall charm of the visuals and music, and you have very enjoyable battles ahead of you. The game's big twist is being able to play as Bowser. On the overworld, Bowser has its advantages and its limitations compared to the Bros, and the same is true for the combat. Overall, I felt like playing as Bowser was a little less fun that playing with Mario & Luigi, but it's nothing really serious. The giant Bowser battles are ok, but the mic sometimes failed to me when trying to do a flame attack. The game is overall a bit annoying when it tries to use the touch screen, but once again, it's nothing too serious. I'd say that Bowser's Inside Story's biggest flaw is being a bit too annoying when it comes to tutorials. The game is well packed with content. Playing on a casual way, with a good bunch of side stuff done, It took me around 25 hours to beat the final boss. The presentation is colorful and silly, and the game is very fluid at all times. Music is great, with some really memorable tracks like the regular boss theme. That one always manages to get me pumped up for combat. On another note, Mario's and Luigi's ""voice acting"" is just so good. Bowser's Inside Story is a great choice if you're looking for a fun, fast-paced JRPG for your DS. For the type of game it tries to be, I'd say that it strikes the right balance between simplicity and depth, offering some real challenge at times, but overall being a fluid and straightforward experience. There are times where it feels a bit too simplistic, but like I said previously, the pacing gets better in the second half. Humor is top-notch, and the presentation is colorful and charming. All in all, one of the greatest titles for the Nintendo DS. Score: 8.6. From the amazingly cheesy humor that is familiar to the Mario franchise to the enticing storyline, Bowser's Inside Story is an amazing edition to the Mario and Luigi game series. If you are a long time fan of Nintendo RPG's or want to try one, I highly recommend you try this game!. Bowser's Inside Story is the third game in the Mario&Luigi series of RPG games. This time around, you can play as Bowser. He comes with his own set of moves, and adds a new type of gameplay experience. The cartoonish art style matches the goofy humor of the game, and allows for a lot of varying colors to decorate the different levels. Learning new moves is entertaining, and using special moves, even more so. The ability to alternate between Mario&Luigi and Bowser allows for the gameplay to vary, such as Mario&Luigi being able to jump, but limited to movement on a 2D plane, and Bowser not being able to jump, but can move in all axis. This keeps the game feeling fresh and allows it to be creative, as some sections will mean that you will have to figure out who you will need to play as to move through. It's a great game, that solidifies the Mario&Luigi RPG series as one of the best and most creative RPG series out there.. When i first heard about Bowser Inside Story coming out...i believed that surely the villain would be Elder Princess Shroob or something related to Shroobs cause in the finale of Mario and Luigi 2 Elder Princess Shroob afraid of her death made a time hole and put in it Shroob **** **** Mario and Luigi 3 Fawful makes his final come back thirsty for revenge and ruling and hungry for the **** of Bowser's doom!Its really amazing...probably the BEST one of the Five parts!. If your a huge Bowser fan, this is the game for you. Despite Mario Luigi's names appearing on the box, its Bowser that gets the most spotlight, as he is the main star in this hilarious, action packed, RPG exclusively on Nintendo DS. The game's plot consists of Fawful's revenge plan to take over the Mushroom Kingdom by having Bowser ingest a ""Vaccuum Shroom"", then let him inhale Mario, Luigi and almost everyone in the Kingdom right into his body. Then, with Bowser passing out of exhaustion, Fawful takes advantage of this and brainwashes the Koopa King's minions to serve him. So now it's up to big, bad Bowser to save the day, along with Mario & Luigi inside his gut to power him up along the way. Playing as Bowser is as simple as it is fun. Bowser can't jump or use hammers like the Mario Bros., intsead, he must rely on things he does best, such as punching and breathing fire, to complete each and every level to reach his castle. You go about your business, punching and burning everything in your way, defeating your brain-washed enemies and such, but occasionally, Bowser gets in a pinch, and he reluctantly leaves it to Mario and Luigi to do something in his body to solve the situation. From lifting objects to digesting food, or even just letting out a sneeze, Mario & Luigi must accomplish these little minigames inorder to progress through the game. Most of these minigames are touch-based controls (That means don't lose your stylus). Some of them can be fun, but for me I found these some of the worst moments in the game. To be fair though, they are unique and are fairly short. But as for the levels go in Bowser's body, it's nothing but 2D platforming levels. ""Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story"" is worth buying, whether you're a fan or a beginner, if your really into RPGs (or Bowser), this the game for you!. This game is AMAZING! By far the best game in the Mario & Luigi saga and one of the DS' best games. I have played this game for 37 hours in order to level up Mario and Luigi. The gameplay is excellent: you can play as Mario and Luigi, and Bowser, everyone has wanted to play as Bowser before, well now you can! The boss battles and puzzles in this game are excellent, I have never gotten tired of this game and it was well worth the time. This is Nintendo's best RPG and the graphics are some of the best on DS. Fawful is a great antagonist as well. This game is extremely entertaining and I highly recommend it.. Truly my favorite game of all time with fun battles and good humor, giant bowser battles make good use of the touch screen and the final boss theme is amazing. I would enter the fight and just sit there doing nothing to listen to that awesome theme.. finished the game last week, 10/10 game, a story and innovative gameplay, a battle with bowser and battling giant robots that's great, luigi is so funny character , final battle music is so epic, best mario and luigi rpg music ever, best mario and luigi rpg game,Nintendo you are the best .. Not only is this a perfect Mario RPG, but it is a perfect RPG period. It builds upon the amazing Partners In Time by adding new concepts. The battles with Mario and Luigi are much the same (which is a good thing as it was flawless already), but on top of that you can also now play as Bowser, who has a completely unique moveset, including being unable to jump. This means that traversing the same areas twice as the different characters does not feel repetitive at all, nor even fighting the same enemies. The transitions between the plumbers and Bowser work seemlessly into the deep story and don't feel like simply changing character to get through a particular area. The game also features some unique puzzles and minigames that complement the story and actually make sense as part of it. A lot of these involve Mario and Luigi healing body issues Bowser picks up during the events of the game. As Mario and Luigi are inside Bowser after being inhaled by use of a vacuum shroom, there are unique areas and enemies that are unlike any seen before in the Mario franchise, keeping it fresh. It also must be said that this is one of the most humorous games of all time. There are so many laugh out loud moments, the majority of which are delivered by the hilarious villain Fawful. Seriously, this game is so well-written and is worth playing for this alone, not to mention sublime boss battles, including giant Bowser battles controlled using the touchscreen, and the stellar soundtrack, particularly 'In the Final', the final boss theme. This game does almost everything right and it's actually very hard to fault it. Rating: 9.6. I am currently replaying this game for the second or third time, and this game is still AMAZING (I mean Partners in Time and Superstar Saga will always a place in our hearts). The plot is really strong, great idea of what might be inside Bowser and the changes to his body when he does something, and I like the idea of Bowser finally having the chance the take the spotlight as a playable character. Just buy this game, what are you doing seating on your chair?1 Go buy the game!!!. This is very amazing Mario RPG . Graphics isnt very good, but this is not matter in RPG . This is best RPG about Mario (in my opinion), storyline in this game was very amazing and I think this one of the best Mario Game and best Mario and Luigi Game . Awesome Game . Gameplay is very good .. This is the final game of the original Mario & Luigi Trilogy. For me, all of them were perfect. But some users try to compare it to Paper Mario, even tough this series are a sequel for the original Mario RPG game for SNES, that's appreciable due to its combat system and the original story. This game simply ended the trilogy the best it could.. This game is a plethora of amazing gameplay and amazing gameplay! The game has good music and the game is addicting with a good story. I love this game!. I remember playing this game when i was only 10 years old and being so excited about every event that happened in the game. Not only did it make me smile but it made me really engaged with the story. It felt so great and this game is something my family truly remembers. For me, it revolutionized how I viewed the mario rpg games and made me feel so grateful to ever figure out what they were. This game was a big part of my childhood and still to this day i sometimes go back and play it.. This game - one of the best RPG game of Mario. Cool music, maybe not so good grapics (but no matter), this game have wonderful and crazy storyline. And omigosh, this game have wonderful and crazy villain - Fawful, for this guy i liked this game)). Another Mario & Luigi game. Only difference? Bowser's playable so it'll change the entire gameplay. Mario and Luigi are back once more on their newest adventure. Stay off, Mario! Bowser's taking over this game for now!. This game is AMAZING probably the best mario rpg EVER and one of my favourite games! Its at the same quality as the classic super mario **** must buy it for your ds even for your 3DS. I played this game on my Nintendo DS, and I loved it: I love the story, the bosses, the attacks, the musics. I think that it is the best RPG game that I've ever played.. AlphaDream once again delivers a solid, entertaining, and enjoyable experience in the form of Bowser's Inside Story. Mario and Luigi must go into Bowser's body (not as gross as it sounds, don't worry) and tell Bowser what to do as you take control of the Koopa King to defeat the famous Fawful from Superstar Saga. The puns are real in this one! You'll be fighting a lot in this game so it's a good thing that the combat is probably some of the best I've ever seen. The items system as well as the special attacks are easy enough to do while still somehow remaining in-depth and effective. The plot takes many turns, the characters are unique, the dialogue is hilarious, and Bowser's Inside Story is amazing.. Recently replaying this game before I start on the 3DS sequel. This is an essential addition to your collection, and an absolute must-play. For those unfamiliar with the series, you will do perfectly well to jump in here. You don't need former series knowledge - although some story elements hark back to the earlier games, you will be able to enjoy this without playing the first two. But you SHOULD play them ALL! Bowser's Inside Story often breaks the forth wall, riffing on the strained relationships between various characters in the Mushroom Kingdom. Particularly amusing is the sidelining of Luigi - often referred to as ""the green mustachioed one"" or similarly dismissive names. As suggested by the title, you will spend a lot of time inside of Bowser's body, as Mario and Luigi. Bowser stomps around the world map, while M&L must visit various power centres of Bowser's insides and complete mini games to, for example, increase Bowser's muscle mass, or otherwise aid him in overcoming obstacles. This mechanic also comes into play during battles - Bowser can inhale some enemies, shrinking them down and taking them into his body and brining M&L into the fight. This is a great way to ensure that all three controllable characters can level up consistently. The story is great, with a funny script and interesting twists and turns. Really the only weak point of this game is the linearity and repetitive nature of the mini games. This is really a trait of the entire series, which might be labelled as ""RPG-lite"", so if you want something hardcore and intense look elsewhere. If you want fun, laughter, and a great cast then you've found your game. Pick up the first two (the first is on GBA, the second on DS like Inside Story), they are all very good games.. This is one of the first RPGs I've ever played and this is easily my favorite of them all. With this being the third instalment in the Mario & Luigi series this does not disappoint. The dialogue is hilarious as ever with plenty of memorable characters. The gameplay is fantastic too and it's very different from your usual RPG. Most of these games have teams take turns in battles with each side dealing damage automatically with random effects. In this series you have to time your button presses for dealing maximum damage and taking minimal damage. This really changes the gameplay with relying on raw skill instead of the random elements in usual RPGs. Also, no random encounters. THANK GOD. My personal favorite part about this game is how they present Bowser. His combat system is very intuitive and fun, his pixel art is very smooth, and he becomes an overpowered tyrant of destruction! He does a lot of crazy stuff in this game too, like pulling an island with a single strand of rope, pushing a boat by friggin' sneezing, and growing to sizes that Godzilla would be jealous of. His dialogue is pure comedy gold and can even compete with Fawful's quirky personality. This game is absolutely fantastic! If you love the Mario franchis",this is one of if not the best Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story . the soundtrack and linear yet effective storytelling are fascinating . the final boss theme is one of the most hilarious games i've played .
