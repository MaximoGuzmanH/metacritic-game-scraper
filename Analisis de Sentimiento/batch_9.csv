34.Portal: Companion Collection,"Portal one and two are some of my First and Most enjoyable puzzle games. These two games are Brilliant in quality and this is an absolute bargain when on sale. I got this collection for 3.50 and it was worth every penny. BUY THIS GAME FOR SWITCH!. 2 fantastic games in one amazing package. The gameplay feels as great as ever, especially in Portal 2. Some of the most funny games ever made, with amazing mechanics, great puzzles and a deep lore of people to explore in Aperture Science.. If you're into puzzles and post apocalyoptic environments, this is for you. Best game on Switch for me and its an old game. Says a lot. And yes, better than Zelda games which only masochists who are into grind would enjoy.. As of typing out this review, I have finally completed two of the greatest video games of all time, Portal and Portal 2. Conceptually, having these games on the Switch is a no-brainer, since they are seemingly simple puzzlers with oftentimes a cozy and satisfying feel. It's hard to say anything about Portal that hasn't already been said, but the narrative sweeping through both games is phenomenal, the characters are perfectly voiced and written, the music is fittingly atmospheric, and I haven't even touched on the gameplay. I wish I was smart enough to have run through both titles without any online help but when given enough time and peace of mind, I would recommend completing as much blind as possible. My mind was consistently blown by clever puzzles and meta-game design, and the humor throughout is genuinely hilarious. Must-plays for all gamers; with my favorite credits sequence of all time as a little bonus.. Played on switch OLED and the game ran perfectly. Absolute classic gem ****. Still funny and enjoyable to this day.. It'sa great bundle, especially whenit'sat sale, the both are 10/10 games Highly recommended forPepole that like puzzles and poetals. theas to games are amazing I have both of theas games on my computer and my swich amazing games recomendid. I had a great experience with this game from start to finish. I can see why it has been popular for so long and didn't realize there are user-created levels on PC. The possibilities are endless on what fun puzzles can be made with this concept.. Best puzzle game ever released. It is close to perfection. The only thing i can critisize is that Portal 1 is too short and feels like a demo.. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. Portal companion cured my depression It Â´ s so good It reminded me of the orange Box Very Good Game. Amazing, absolutely genius and brilliant from start to finish!!! A must have, especially on the Nintendo Switch.. Good ports of two masterpieces. I haven't played the original Portal games, so this was my first experience with these two games within the collection. I really enjoyed the interesting puzzles. Certain aspects of the game are a bit outdated, but it's still fun to play.","two of the greatest video games of all time, portal and portal 2, are brilliant in quality . theas to games are amazing I had a great experience with this game from start to finish . it's a great bundle, especially when on sale ."
340.Okami HD,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolutely fantastic. Designs, musics, gameplay, atmosphere, lore, world-building... Absolutely gorgeous. Not perfect, too much repetitivity in the boss fights and the end seems rushed a little bit. But it's still one of the best games ever made.. The game has the player controlling the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, or sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series,. The art beyond this game is superb, you can easily immerse yourself in there. It was an masterpiece for me.. Pretty much, the closest thing a PlayStation gamer will get to Legend of Zelda game. Yet Okami does a little more with its artistic focus on its Japanese roots. The paintbrush mechanics are brilliant, but watered down if you are using a controller only. A beautiful game that deserves all of the high praise it gets. Only drawback, those damn character voices, they're SUPER annoying.. Simply the most beautiful video game I have ever played. 52 hours to Platinum and after finishing it I feel strangely empty and a little sad. Okami is a wonderful journey like nothing you have played before. Just play it. Play the whole magnificent thing.. The game is beautiful. I wanted to love it. But it gets really repetitive really fast. I put in about 10 hours and ultimately couldn't muster the desire to keep going. Due to the art style, most of the world looks exactly the same, and it makes you feel like you've already visited a place before, even if it's the first time you've been there.. Okami is quite popular among the critics, generally considered as one of the best game of the playstation 2, let's see if the game meets the expectations. Technically the game is gorgeous (for a PS2 title) and could have passed as an early PS3 game wit a lot of effects and details, no framerate issues, no glitches, everything is perfect and the excellent art design will really transport you in medieval/legend Japan. Concerning the gameplay we have a perfect example of a successful mix (like The Legend of Zelda games), we've got platforming, action (the director of the game now works at Platinum Games if it helps you figuring the style), and role playing with lots of items, side quests and an open world. You'll progress dungeon after dungeon each one bringing its own gameplay and offering a great boss fight at the end. The story is a mix of japanese legends (with its own touch of course) that will blow your mind with its twists and lovely characters, I would have preferred if they had real voice overs (this is one of those game that would have been perfect to play with japanese voices). It should last around 40 hours of pure perfection. They could have easily cut the game in two or three and still manage to propose great games. In conclusion Okami is an unique game worthy of the hall of fame of gaming, its atmosphere, its story , its gameplay, they nailed it all to create one of my new favorite games of all time. I advise it to every body and maybe one day we will have the joy to have a sequel. In conclusion. For the price it's OK but nothing more. I played for one hour but I won't play more, maybe my kids will like it. The game has a lot of lines of text you need to read but no voice-over ... it's annoying. It's not a bad game, it just looks too old, too boring and too childish for me.. Alright, here's the story: Long ago the world was blessed by the Celestial Gods residing on the Celestial Plain. Everything was at rest and everyone was having a good time, but then some eight-headed jerk-off of a serpent named Orochi decides to bring down the Celestial Plain and spread his darkness all over the place. Orochi eventually took over the world and started a tradition where he demands a sacrifice from a local rural village. Every month during a full moon, a silver arrow appears and flies to the house that is to provide a maiden as a sacrifice. At the same time a white wolf named Shiranui stands by and watches all of this. The villagers assume Shiranui is a familiar of Orochi's so they always try to shoo her away. After the 100th time an unfortunate mistress was called to be sacrificed, a man named Nagi boasted that he would slay Orochi. Nagi makes his way to Orochi's lair and begins to do battle with the beast! Poor Nagi... despite his self-proclaimed title of ""Greatest Warrior Who Ever Lived,"" he just plain **** at fighting. Then Shiranui shows up and assists Nagi with a strange ancient power. After the long fight, Nagi dealt the finishing blow and sealed Orochi up in his lair forever. Shiranui was too weak to stand after the fight and eventually collapsed, drifted to sleep and never woke up. Now the whole village is sad like their dog just died and they erect a statue for Shiranui and a statue for Nagi. NOW everybody's happy again! Jump 100 years later (or in this case, 18 minutes after the introduction which CANNOT BE SKIPPED) there is a celebration for the 100th Anniversary of Orochi's defeat. The statue of Shiranui glows and the wolf comes to life! However, this wolf looks slightly different. Still white as snow, this wolf has brighter red markings and seems to be a bit clueless. This is not Shiranui, but the wolf you as the player control, the Goddess Okami Amaterasu, Mother to everything! First thing I notice is that this game plays an awful lot like Legend of Zelda. No seriously, the maps are designed similar to the ones in a Zelda game, dungeons require a bit of puzzle solving, the NPCs are memorable for having unique characteristics, you unlock new weapons, and there is even a world to save! No princess though. Main aspect of gameplay is the Celestial Brush. What is so great about a divinely named painting tool? Well, Ammy (her nickname given by her bouncing friend Issun) is a goddess over everything... including reality. This brush allows the user to alter reality. You want to make trees bloom with flower despite the poor sap being dead for a long time? Draw a circle on the branches and cherry blossoms will bloom! Turn night into day? Draw a circle in the sky and make your own sun! Wood fence in the way? Draw a line through it and slice it in two! Can't swim because you only know how to dog paddle? Draw a circle in the water and make a lily pad! Combat is a bit like Twilight Princess when Link is in wolf form. Every fight takes place in an enclosed space created by demons, but you have the option to break out if you can find a seam and rip it open. You've got three weapon groups that suit players based on their skill. Reflectors, the default weapon, do short and quick combos and do moderate damage, Rosaries dishing out quick, multi-hit attacks that do small damage, but add up considerably, and Glaives that require a charge before bringing the pain and destruction of Amaterasu's wrath! And let's not forget those boss fights. Each fight is a memorable encounter. One fight in particular has Ammy facing up against a fox. The Demon Fox Ninetails (not the Pokemon) fights aggressively, jumps allover the place, can't be hit, and can even use brush techniques just like Ammy! The music played fits the mood perfectly while still keeping the theme of the game intact. Not just some awesome track that goes with any game with a fight like this, but to this fight and this fight only! This boss gave me a run for my money, but it was worth every penny (and minute, of course). I think I'm running out of room, but I should be able to squeeze in one more paragraph. The soundtrack overall is gorgeous and the graphics are in the style of traditional Japanese paintings. Well, close to those types of paintings, but it just looks so smooth and flawless! This game captures Japanese culture so well that I can't think of any new adjectives to describe it! This is one of those games you just have to play before you die, so just stick this somewhere on your bucket list and try it out sometime. For the ultimate experience, use FAQs as little as possible. This is a game that feels just magical when you discover something by yourself.. This is deifnitely one of the best gaing experiences I have ever had. The beautiful, hand drawn graphics assault the eyes with euphoric wonder. The characters are wonderful and memorable (Kamiki Village's Elder being one of my favorites, wait til you see his dance moves) and the quests are fun and engaging. The puzzles are fairly simple but make great use of the abilities the game doles out and lend to one or two 'Aha!' moments. It follows the Legend of Zelda formula of having areas being inaccessible without certain abilities and a long first act that leads to a world-traversing adventure. All in all, just completely enjoyable.. Do you want to know if you should buy Okami? Buy it. Now. Seriously, go. The art direction is stellar with its ""ancient japanese painting"" style and the ""stages"" are beautiful, varied and imaginative. The gameplay is solid and offers a lot of possibilities with its ""brush mode"", wich allows you to do all sort of things- making the Sun rise, slashing something in two, making trees bloom, making wind blow... The plot is fairly simple but surelty it's not bad and the characters range from epic to cute to hilarious. The music is fantastic if you dig its ""ancient japanese music"" style. The game is also long and offers challenges, mini-games and collectibles. The only problem is that it's a bit too on the easy side. Oh, and the game hasn't been dubbed, so if you don't like reading, well... it's one of those games.. Amazing gameplay, gorgeous art style and graphics and a beautiful story. There is no better way to summarize this game. The only downside is that this game is just a tiny bit to long and doesn't have the song 'reset' the original PS2 version has (it does have the 'thank you' version of this song). Despite that this is the definitive version of this near perfect game.. A beautifully stunning, overlooked classic in Capcom's case, Okami gets the HD re-release on the PS3 console -- since it originally came out during the PS2's final hours, it's been longingly deserved -- and it's aged marvelously well. Pros? The HD art design and cel-shaded graphics are as stunning as ever; Japanese folklore influences; incorporation of Zelda-esque action-adventure, platforming, and action-RPG elements; epic humor; epic quest; epic soundtrack; epic use of a paintbrush ever used in a video game; epic, well, everything. Cons? The combat can often become easy and repetitive; some minor camera issues; this is a neglected franchise.. I played okami back in the day on the ps2 but for some reason i never finished it. But when the hd version was announced it was time to finish what i started. I had a great time with the game. Exploring the world was fun especialy because of the great art style. The puzzles where unique because of the brush mechanic. The combat was enjoyable but was never challenging and got quite repetitive in the later parts of the game.. A bit underwhelming. The graphics are beautiful but the story is long and slow. And the gameplay is actually not that special, it's really quite traditional even though you use the paint brush. I never truly felt part off the world, but that's me. I give it a 7 because objectively, there's nothing really bad I can say, it's just not as special as people say and not as special as it looks. And I defenitely felt it was a PS2 game, these games were not as fluid as they are now.. This is everything a video game is supposed to be. Gorgeous visuals, beautiful music, compelling story, immersive atmosphere, tight controls, & unique gameplay. If you enjoy ARPGs this is a must-play. The only knock against this game I can think of (and Iâm reaching, here) is that the camera frequently shifts into âclose upâ view automatically. Most of the time I prefer to have it set to âdistanceâ view as it makes navigation & combat easier, but certain things will shift it back into close up mode which means Iâm constantly having to shift it back. A very minor gripe, though, as they at least have another option to switch to (something Kingdom Hearts, for example, would have benefited from). This is a long game & a deep game that is chock full of secrets. Best of all, there is no level grinding. Instead of gaining levels in a traditional way, you improve various stats by earning âpraiseâ from completing tasks or performing certain actions. You get to choose what to upgrade and when, which is nice. In addition, there are different weapons to find, gold dust items that upgrade each weapon, and also special abilities that can be learned from dojos. On top of all these are the brush techniques, which can be used for combat, exploration, altering the environment, and triggering plot events. Combat often requires a combination of regular weapon attacks & brush techniques to win, especially some of the epic boss fights. And every fight, even with the lowliest enemy, gives you a score based on how fast you finished & how much damage you took and will give you a cash reward accordingly. And instead of farming certain enemies for certain rare item drops, every enemy can be forced to drop the same item which is used as a special currency to buy rare items from a special vendor. The HD version is one that is much deserved for a game that looked beautiful even on PS2. It looks stunning on PS3. The addition of trophies is a nice touch, too. If youâre looking for something fun, unique & engaging to play, I canât recommend this one enough. Be prepared to sink some time into it, though!. I've heard many good things about Okami and how its aesthetic, visual quality and rewarding gameplay defined it as its own, standing out from other games like a flower in a dead field. I've decided to purchase Okami HD on PSN. While Okami is definitely interesting looking, coming off as having a very old-age artistic Japanese-stylized painting, the game wears itself out in other areas and overstays its welcome. Gameplay: With an incredible 40+ hours of gameplay that feels a lot longer than it should, I found myself being worn out more quickly than I'd have liked. At first the game's functions are delightful. These functions involve being able to use a Celestial Brush to restore order and life to a demon-ravaged world and engaging in combat with demonic foes while using said Brush as a piece of your arsenal in battle. The first ten hours or so of the game are really nice, but then I realized something: There was hardly any changing or real satisfying variety going on. You get new Brush techniques from different gods you awaken and free through constellations and you get new weapons for Ammy, but beyond that extent there is nothing much else and everything feels like an immense and tiring drag. There are your platforming sections scattered around many different places and you also have the option to do sidequests. Normally I love sidequests in games, but in a game where the GAMEPLAY is wearing out on me, I found myself eventually trying to skip everything just to carry on with the story. You also have mini-games to play, and this is a plausible effort to freshen up the gameplay, but it doesn't last, as you'll be playing these mini-games over and over. Once you get the gist of Okami's gameplay and learn the basics, the game doesn't branch out far from these basics. It becomes way too easy and I could not stay engaged for very long. Story/Narrative: The story of the game is a combination of many different elements of Japanese folklores, but everything meshes together pretty well to deliver a relatively simple story and objective. You must save the beauty and order of the world as sun god, Amaterasu, taken the form of a wolf. I have no issues with the story, but a big issue the game had was how much it dragged it along. There is plentious filler stuffed into many different segments and this has greatly contributed to my lack of interest. Another complaint that I have is that cutscenes are quite irritating, not just to sit through, but also to LISTEN to. At first the little mumbling voices were cute, but when you have to hear them for fourty hours, it really crosses the line. Not only that, but cutscenes could have been greatly improved by not making the player have to press a button to move forward to the next bit of dialogue. While I see this is good for slower individuals, it asks for me to stay involved and yet doesn't give me the option to quick-scroll like you can do outside of more major cutscenes. Music/Sound: I've already mentioned the annoying mumbling ""vocals"" above, so I'll strike that out. The music and sound in this game is pretty fantastic. The music has a very oriental touch which compliments the atmosphere wonderfully. The sounds are really nice, especially in fights. I actually got goosebumps from some of the awesome sound effects in the game. This and the aesthetics are clearly the strongest points of the game. Aesthetics/Graphics: Okami, as mentioned above, has its own unique artistic style. At first it is very well presented and quite pleasing to look at. It's clearly a breath of fresh air from the common graphic styles we see in games today. Okami's flair in the graphics department is hardly matched by others, not necessarily in realism, but in sheer style, and I can greatly respect the game for this. The locales and environments, however, tend to not have a very distinctive style to their construction and geography when compared to other areas in-game. Despite the very nice style the game has going on, it doesn't seem like there has been much effort applied to simple attention to detail and having the game's areas stand out from each other. There are definitely certain areas that are unique, but it is expected since they are meant to house more important events/battles/scenes. Overall, Okami has not lived up to the hype, in my opinion. The game is heavily drawn out by filler and its gimmicks in gameplay only last for so long before becoming absolutely thoughtless. Its narrative is irritating and oftentimes longer than it needs to be. I'm usually not one to complain about game length, but this game really needed to put more effort into keeping the gameplay fresh to keep my attention for so long. Despite these shortcomings, the game's art style and audio really impressed me and left me breathless in some moments; it's definitely where the game shines most.. I decided to play this game because I wanted to relax after finishing Hitman Absolution. It's part of my PlayStation Plus so I got it for free. But to be honest I won't buy it because it's not my type of games that I would enjoy. the game is fun and sweet. Cool story. But I hate the long conversations in cut scenes and other situations. Just too long and get boring. Also these conversations sometimes contain important information about your quest. So skipping them my result of returning to them later to understand what you should do. I'm enjoying the game play and the story. The graphics are so sweet. Characters are fun. But those long conversations and you have to follow and to move next you have to tab X is really annoying. This is 7 for me. I was right when I picked this one for a relax mode.. A lovely, gorgeous remake of a fantastic game. Okami really is one of the greatest and most unique games ever made and it is nearly flawless, which is evident when the only negative thing people can say about it is ""READING IS HARD!!!!"". There is only one word to describe this game and it's MASTERPIECE. Amazing story with beautiful and incredible characters with an amazing personality. The art design is just sublime in every aspect. The monsters that appear during the entire game are unique. The combat system is very good, the boss battle are epic, the gameplay is very good. The soundtrack is magical and never tiring. The only thing that might be a bit annoying is the voice of all characters in the entire game, for me it wasn't but we are not all the same.. Okami in full hd is perhaps the most beautiful game ever. All those details that were lost in the original pops out of the picture to form an artistic masterpiece. On top of that Okami is filled with interesting characters, excitement and humor. The game lack challange (you will never die) but it has more soul than most games out there.. Okami HD is Okami, but than HD. I didn't like the first game, so i didn't like this one either. I was expecting just a little more for what i spent.. mixed with hack/slash and RPG element with 1080p, this game is awesome. the plot is also very good and long. This is one of the best games of all time but the sales is disappointment. Played this years back on the Wii and it looked great but could not play it do to the aweful Wii controlls. Now we get a HD version for the PS3 that was well worth the wait The game is just fantastic Its alot like Zelda but i think even more fun. The game has a fantastic Art style and and just looks wonderful even today. The puzzles are well done and the combat is alot of fun. The game is very long you will clock in any where from 40-60 hours depending on side quests. The story is also pretty entertaining Every thing about this game was just done so well and only leaves me wanting more Okami games for the future and not on the DS!!! or any portable! make them for the **** yo are a RPG fan and never got around to playing this or like me got turned off by the ii version and you have a PS3 then okami HD is a must buy it plays so much better ith a REAL controller.. If I could, I'd rate this game 9.6, but I rounded up. From the lush environments and your ability to rebuild them all the way to a fun, humorous, and usually compelling story, you can easily immerse yourself in this masterpiece of video game art. There is a reason that it's featured in video game museums. Only two elements hold this game back from being perfect: its combat is regularly too easy, and it features far too much sexism from Issun about various princesses and priestesses. Okami's combat is almost never challenging; once in a while, you'll have to consider your tactics with a boss or mini-boss, but you won't die in the process. With regard to sexism, the whole ""rescue the princess"" trope was already tiresome well before Okami (thank you Donkey Kong, Mario, and Zelda!), so the developers could've chosen something less banal and annoying. Granted, Amaterasu is the character who's rescuing the princesses, etc., but Issun is the sexist and vapidly shallow mouthpiece that won't stop objectifying them--over and over and over again. We get hints that Issun is over 100 years old, and, in that case, he's a 100+-year-old man-boy. Once in a while, Issun seems to mature through the narrative, but not whatsoever with regard to women.. You shouldn't be reading this if you haven't played the game and instead go and play it now. For those of you who played the PS2 version, you'll be happy to know that it looks and sounds amazing and the hd makeover really makes it worth the price of admission. The move controller is a must to get the most out of this version, a match made in heaven. Ninetails won't see what's coming, much better than the wii version which wasn't bad but the wii remote acts up from time to time.. This game has a LOT of lines of text you need to read, but has no voice-overs. I also feel it drags on for way too long. The story could've been told in 20 hours, and it's only 40+ hours long because of the 'filler' material.. I never heard of this title until I came here. I picked it up from PSN and WOW!!! What a fun game! The art is beautiful! Only one thing that bothered me was the Zelda-esque bleep voice. Other than that it is stunning, fun, and defines what games should be like!. This game is absolutely amazing. A perfect mix of fun gameplay, side missions, many secrets, and a beautiful story that can bring you to tears at it's climax. Okami is a game that nobody should miss out on, and now that it's in stunning HD you don't have an excuse anymore. Diving into the world of Okami is an experience you'll never forget.. Everything great about video games in one package; Okami truly is a game that shows the artistic potential of what the gaming medium can be when designers are passionate about their product and are willing to step outside the box. From the beautiful art-style, to the atmospheric music, to the fantastic Zelda-esque gameplay; everything about Okami is near-perfect. Okami HD is the definitive version of Okami, and is a must play.. are There is no doubt that Okami is one of the best, if not the best, game in its genre. The art style, character development, and sheer extent of the adventure, must be played to be believed. I reviewed this game years ago when I was still playing the PS2, and my thoughts haven't changed - this game should be considered among the best of the decade. My only problem is that this is a direct port, albeit in HD, but there are just a few **** quirks that could have been remedied but were not. Unskippable cut scenes, long sections of nonsense dialogue, and the persistent interuprions from your companion could have bee eliminated to make this a smoother ride. Minor quibbles aside, this game rivals the best - im talking bioshock, zelda, AC, batman - this game is better. Can we have a sequel please?. Gorgeous graphics, beautiful colors, great story, the best conversion of game to HD that I've ever seen. The fact that the dialogs are just some babbling with subtitles can be annoying sometimes, but it's just a minor detail that won't spoil an awesome gaming experience.. A game that had pretty graphics and great music when is released on the PS2 in 2006. It was beautiful on the Wii in 2008. And now with stunning HD graphics on PS3. The game always had good controls ( well not so much on the Wii ) awesome gameplay and most of all epic story and very lovable characters although the brush mechanics can get a little repetitive and annoying and there are many typos in the dialogue it is a great game. 9/10 for simple and obvious reasons. If you don't know them already, you have missed out on this gem. Okami used to look decent and be enjoyable gameplay-wise as well as in the story, which wraps up most major eastern legends and tales into a compelling story. Used to. Reborn as Okami HD, it's also very pleasing to the eye - of course not like a new release AAA title, but notably better. Fighting monsters, doing collection-quests as well as some others, acquiring new techniques to reach new places with and do new things with, it's much like the Playstaion-Zelda. The story is well-designed and -told, revolving around eastern mythology, bringing it's characters into an interesting adventure that will last any gamer with casual time-investment for quite a while. Definitely a purchase that can't be entirely wrong - if you don't love it, you'll at least enjoy it for once.. as you can see from other user reviews, the game is a hands down masterpiece. the graphics and art is unsurpassable. nothing like you will ever see in your life. the controls are unsurpassable as well. i've never played anything like this.. A breathtaking work of art, that t'ill this day, never ceases to amaze me.. Having played the Wii version, this re-release was a great way to relive one of the best games I have ever played. 6 years old and still at the top of its genre. You owe it to yourself to get this game.. I missed out on the Ps2 copy of this game and boy did i miss out! One word to describe this game is that it's a "" Masterpiece "". I'm speechless of what to say about this game. The gameplay is impressive. I adore the boss fights and love the bestiary- battles that this game has to offer. You can choose to fight the demon scrolls whenever you want to so the game isn't forcibly trying to force repetitiveness down you're throat. It gives off this classical feel that you have to become stronger to progress through the game, even though you really don't unless you want to tackle the demon gates later on in this game. The game gives us different unique weapons every-time you defeat an important boss of the story and if you have enough money to dish out to buy some other unique weapons. The storyline is where you start to notice that ""Hey this game is kick ass!"" You take control of this canine-god Amaterasu or better known as ""furball or Ammy"" and embark on a journey to cleanse the lands of darkness with her celestial envoy, Issun. Throughout the journey you get ""praise"" to level up you're attributes such as the ink pot, health bar, astral pouch and gain money to learn new techniques to overcome puzzles, defeat monsters or just finish those darn side quests. And to top it off you can use the celestial brush to harm enemies, solve problems, create miscellaneous weather and/or earthly objects, help the citizens in certain cities and gradually make people take notice that you are a god. There's so much that i haven't gone over so my review doesn't pay respect to the game one bit. The man whoï»¿ created Okami was a huge legend of zelda fan, so was there any doubt that this game would be bad? I think not. This game is the kind of game i would dish out 59.99 for! It's so much better then the mediocre games that are out now and it's only 19.99! and that's a bargain for over a 30-40 hours of a pure classical Japanese tail that is Okami. Buy the game, you won't miss out on the adventure of the year.. This is the game I consider being the most beautiful and artistically stylish of all time, and HexaDrive did a hell of a job translating it to glorious Full-HD. It's simple, actually: if you're a fan of adventure games, this is a must-buy. If not, this is a must-buy. In other words, an experience that is timeless and you can't be allowed to miss.. Original, epic, and unique worth the money anyday, after hearing about this from the Wii version, i knew it would be worth waiting for the HD transition.. Many re-released games do not stand up to their own legacy, fans loving them with the clouded eyes of nostalgia. Okami is not one of those games. Not only is it still one of the most beautiful, complex, and well designed action-adventure games of the last generation, the re-release is probably the best of this generation as well. When it came out seven years ago, many (myself included) dismissed it as a Zelda clone and left it at that. The truth is, the Zelda franchise has been slowly trying to capture the magic of ""Ocarina of Time"" without ever quite succeeding, tacking on more and more unnecessary gimmicks to hide its reliance on decades old franchise tropes. This does not mean Zelda is not still fun, but it certainly hasn't broke any new ground since 1996. ""Okami"" does not have this bogged down attachment to old tropes like a musical instrument, previous boss battles, set number of dungeons, creakily familiar plotlines. Every system is fresh from the ground up, from combat to level layout to world design. It is also surprisingly large for an action-adventure game, clocking in (for me, a side quest aficionado) at around 60 hours. Yet the game is so tightly woven -- nothing, absolutely nothing is worthless busywork (coming out of AC3, this feels pretty great). Every little collectible quest will actually give players tangible rewards, not just a worthless trophy. And it's easy to say a game is pretty to look at, but it's another to say the game's artistic direction actually matches the tone of the story and enhances it. Everything in this package belongs there, works together, and most importantly, feels fun. This is the first ","the game has the player controlling the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment . the paintbrush mechanics are brilliant, but watered down if you are using a controller only . Okami is quite popular among the critics, generally considered as one of the best game of the playstation 2 ."

Many reviewers like to get a âfeelâ for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no âhalfâ or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a âfeature quotaâ. Games that excel in both areas of a section donât receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the âwildcardâ section. This section is for how the reviewer âfeelsâ about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. Cannot hope much anymore ****: Addictive, fun, creative and **** point down of the game: no online play with friends. This is one of the best title that one can find on XBLA. Go get it, just worth time and money. Years on and I still come back to this compelling and highly addictive game. The improvements form the original are vast with multiple modes offering differing challenges. Easy to pick up and impossible to put down sums this game up as you lose hours in a blink of an eye either chasing your friends high scores or your own. This very much is a skill game and once you pick up your tactics your going to go far!. This game is very addictive and fun. I wish it had online multiplayer though.. One of the most original, groundbreaking, and entertaining arcade games to be released in a good decade or two, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 is powerful and like none other. The high octane, frantic gameplay, the most colorful HD arcade game to ever be released, the incredible soundtrack it brings to the table, there is nothing Geometry Wars does not have and offer. I find myself so addicted to this game as to where I can't physically put the controller down and walk away. This game has it all with little to build on. New modes, HD, new soundtrack, this is all coming from an already successful game on the arcade marketplace. There are few games with the kind of energy Geometry Wars brings and I can't think of one other arcade game that comes close to this one. I will never be able to get enough of Geometry Wars, if your into video games at all this is a game that is a no brainer must have.","many reviewers like to get a âfeelâ for a game, and arbitrarily give it a score that they believe it deserves . this guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently . the review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal ."
342.Sid Meier's Civilization V,"I call this game a ""Time Warp"" game, because you can start playing it at the crack of dawn, look out the window and think ""Huh - the sun has been rising for awhile now"", only to realize that it's the sun setting instead. Most of the complaints I've ever heard of this game stem from beggaring over how there should be more RTS style micro-managing, or how OP certain systems are for certain objectives, but I'm convinced that these work in the game's favor, **** V is a blast, it's a great experience seeing your nation flourish and grow, nurturing your people from disjointed bronze-era peasants at the bottom of the leaderboard, to a technological master-race at the top of the world.There's lots of work for personal lore here too, which I love. You can name a city and specialize it how you want - make one city the ""trade center"" and another a ""military"" city; which can actually be a solid strategy in the long run.There's so much fun to be had here in single player alone. With mods, you can put even more aspects of the game to the test - or try out dream civilizations in strange scenarios of your own design. Or, you can hop online and slug it out with human nations - which is always good fun. Allying yourself a nation knowing that they're your actual friend - or getting betrayed by your IRL buddies and not seeing it coming, they're all amazing additions to the experience.I love this game, but my only problem is with the Jannisary. My advice - kill the Ottomans ASAP because once they learn how to use gunpowder - they can easily wipe the board in the mid-game. So... yes. There are a few balance issues here and there - and getting rolled over late game after pouring several hours into a playthrough is crushing in many aspects. But that's a part of the overall experience - and that experience is too good to pass up, in my opinion. Seriously, if you don't own this game, what are you waiting for??. Sid Meier's Civilization V wonderfully applies a toned, polished and consistent theme that goes well with the simple but detailed mechanics; overall leading to an amazing experience that is sure to attract strategy fans into a long night of conquering rival nations through any means possible.. This is a deep game, but it takes too long. A ""quick"" match takes around 8 hours. Then there's the fact that there doesn't feel like there's enough variability to justify spending multiple games in a single Civilization. The four win conditions are relatively close to each other--you will always need good science and a good military (because the AI like to prioritize warmongering)--which in turn requires good culture to get good production, all tying back to getting food. And the thing is, the tutorial doesn't teach you the application of what you're doing, so you have to turn to outside resources to learn what exactly you're doing. My verdict is that this is a fun and a well-designed game, but I strongly believe that there are better alternatives in the same genre for your time. I will not be trying future entries of these games.. Good part of the Civilization serie. Do you like strategy games? You must play one of the Sid Meier's worlds.. A good game, provides lots of fun, a more diverse experience in terms of civilisations compared to Civ4, however many important civlisations such as the Spanish are locked behind DLC which you must own (though not as bad as Civ6). The Mac version does not support as many mods as the Windows version and requires hoops to even be able to enable them and there are fewer mods in general compared to civ4. The Mac version in general is rather buggy and crashes a lot and takes a long time to loead with the expansions and DLC even though I am still on Mojave . The gameplay style also changed a lot even things like stacking units, which was a big element of Civ4 is not allowed in Civ5. The number of units and buildings in the base game even with some of the DLC is rather limited. I kinda like Civ4 a bit more but like both of their playstyles in there own way. The lack of stacking makes the game in some ways less tedious and makes it require more strategy and requires you to expand more, the war diplomatic consequences though make this undesirable causing issues and the diplomacy is a bit more basic compared to Civ4 without vassals or permanent alliances or tech trading. Cities being able to defend themselves was a good decision though as it makes sense that a single warrior would not be able to overrun a whole city, seige weapons are also much more useful compared to Civ4. There is an earth map, but the civilisations are not places in their historic locations and the resources are rather poorly spread on it. But in general pretty fun.. Probably the best and the most balanced Civilization game of all, in the line with Civilization 2. And it is surely much better then Civilization 6. I wish developer adds more content for Civilization 5, some more DLCs because thousands of people like me still play it.. I played this game too much to rate it poorly (even if it deserves it). I loved this game so I love this game.. perfect 4x game great replayability. systems work really well togther and it is a really tight nit game. I really like this game. Besides annoying long wait times between rounds, the game is really fun. Building youre own empire, exploring the world, exploring science, trading with other empires and fighting other empires is a great mix and requires much strategic thinking, but not too much.. The best turn based strategy game to date, and that says a lot. It still has a couple of issues, and while the graphics are still passable for today's standards, the game itself still feels a little old and dated. Although the modding of the game makes up for this. The multiplayer is fine, but not incredible, for me this is more of a single player experience. Extremely awesome game.. The most addicting and fun game to play with friends. The unique atmosphere of this game is still unforgettable. It splendidly and wonderfully satisfies the demands of history enthusiasts. It's still a great game even for those not interested in history.. The best strategy game ever made, my friend. I played this game for exactly 672 hours and I can still play it. Great balance, great gameplay, great civilization choices, and also Genghis Khan and horse fetish :). From 2010-2014 I lived to play this game, and also in 2020. Do not recommend this game to others.. The new concept, with hexes in lieu of square grids and with no unit stacks brings a more tactical component and a little more fresh to the saga... But overall is not better game than previous civs. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. The decision to remove unit stacking is absolutely genius and makes the civ franchise 100 times better. With Vox Populi this game becomes a 7 or an 8. Without it the AI is bad and the game is unbalanced and simple so 6.. Great strategy game. Emphasizes nonviolent victory options through religion and diplomacy that can be very useful even when military. Very replayable and fun to nationbuild in.. I do not like stratagy games but civilization 5 is something different for me. I enjoy every moment i play.. The best version in my view, togehter with Civ IV: the unit system is better in my view, than stacking them all in one field. The social politic system is great, because detailed. The idea of neutral city state is nice also.. One of the best strategy games ever made. It is easy to learn for people who are unfamiliar with this type of game, but can still provide adequate challenge as there are 8 difficulty levels to choose from. Doing multiplayer with your friends can be even more fun. This is the first game I would recommend to anyone looking to get into turn based strategy games or just strategy games in general. A flawless masterpiece.. Being my first real taste of the civilization games it started off bittersweet for the first 50 or so hours. I didn't fully understand what I was getting into and how it was ""supposed"" to be played. It took me around 150 hours before it clicked, and the fast addiction to the game had begun. The systems of Civ 5 are by far the most simple we have seen in the series (Even when compared to the newest Civ 6) and can easily be picked up. Although there are still issues, specifically with the AI and some of the choices (Or lack of choosing a choice) it can make. From suddenly being an ally to some minor political move making them an enemy and suddenly the world congress wants to embargo you from the world. Crippling your economy over a singular turn. To the AI declaring war when you far outnumber them and as soon as they are able to offer a peace deal for YOUR cities. Then on top of it all the game has a massive snowball effect in terms of science the high level Ais may do and just spiral out of control for you the player to deal with. Which can lead to you losing a game before it's begun but you don't realize it till it's way too late. Oh, and once you play online multiplayer this ""AI"" breaks completely, making any online game nearly feel hollow as it's just you and your few friends playing together as the AI sits and does mostly nothing the entire time Now, despite these flaws, this is still one of my favorite strategy games of all time, I continue to come back this game every few months and do a few day binge of it. With mod support it has you can make nearly limitless amount of possible civs, strategies, and even full conversion mods that can turn this game into a HARDCORE strategy game to the finest details. A game I will continue to recommend to my friends especially if they ask for a good strategy game!. i played this for roughly 4 hours in one sitting and then quit but it was pretty dope. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now I hardly play any. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I play on every platform but prefer PlayStation. I just like playing god in this game and commanding forces. I spend way too much time on this game sometimes. Just one more turn.. I only played 1000 hours, and still think it's a pretty nice game. Liked it more that Civ 6.. Sid Meier's Civilization V is a 4X video game in the Civilization series developed by Firaxis Games. In Civilization V, the player leads a civilization from prehistoric times into the future on a procedurally generated map, attempting to achieve one of a number of different victory conditions through research, exploration, diplomacy, expansion, economic development, government and military conquest. The game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games in the series. Many elements from Civilization IV and its expansion packs have been removed or changed, such as religion and espionage (although these were reintroduced in its subsequent expansions). The combat system has been overhauled, by removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies. In addition, the maps contain computer-controlled city-states and non-player characters that are available for trade, diplomacy and conquest. A civilization's borders also expand one tile at a time, favoring more productive tiles, and roads now have a maintenance cost, making them much less common. The game features community, modding, and multiplayer elements.. Perhaps THE BEST Civilization game in the whole series! You start out with a band of settlers and (usually) an armed escort, from which you build your civilization's first city. As time goes on, you micro-manage the activities of your cities, citizens, armies, industrial and agricultural output, and where you go from there is up to you: take over the world through violence, charm your opponents into submission, explore the stars, or hoard the wealth of the whole planet. The whole Civilization series is quite remarkable, but Civilization V is the perfect blend of action, management, diplomacy, and city building that always makes me want to come back and try again and again to see how successful my next game will be... or not. Tremendous fun. You may (no, you WILL) unwittingly stay up countless nights as you get lost in the gameplay.. the best game in the series fun for up to hundreds of hours .. I'm glad to see Civ V get some love on Metacritic. I enjoyed both it and Civ VI and consider them to be some of my favorite games. I have over 500 hours in this game according to Steam which is amazing to me but also makes sense considering how immersive it is. As Online Co-Op games go, this is a top pick.. Having been a Civilization addict for about 5 to 6 years I feel like I can give an unbiased review. First off, as of 2 days after the release of the game I have logged 16 hours of play time. About 12 of them on 2 to 4 player multiplayer games and the rest on single player.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 83 IIIIIIIIII====================. Civilization V engages and gives a lot of satisfaction, great music, great challenges and curiosity what the new gameplay will bring. The only drawback is AI. A very good strategy game.. Great game for those who like siv games. Not terribly challenging but fun for those that like to build.. An incredibly in depth and detailed game, Sid Meier's Civilization V is a masterpiece. I have been a civ player for nearly 9 years now, playing almost every game in the franchise, and there is not a doubt in my mind that Civ V is the best of them all. It is beautifully looking, with a moving soundtrack. Each civilization has a wonderfully unique playstyle that results in much replayability. The possibilities of how to achieve victory are endless. The game is balanced both for singleplayer and multiplayer, so you can play alone or with friends, each providing a special sense of fun. The mechanics are deep and intricate, yet easily learned. The progression of this game is satisfying like none other. To watch your civilization grow with such detail and precision is rewarding like nothing else in a game. If you have yet to try this game, all I can say is it will be well worth your time.. The upgraded 4'th Civ. A lot of new mechanics, some of which are not that great. The game is inaccessible. I had at one point felt flow while playing though.. For me on of best strategy games, Game play is very satisfying, One bad thing is units' auto move, they don't know which way should go. Different options in difficult always do good job.. Things i hate the most: Gambling, drug and alcohol addiction and soulless addictive games like WoW, Candy Crush and so on.. This game falls under the soulless addictive games category. Most people do the ""MUST PRESS NEXT TURN"", I however didnt feel that it was fun pressing next turn, i felt dread every time i pressed next turn because nothing would happen for 20+ turns and every time something happened it was very slow. This game isnt the fun type of addicting, its the ALCOHOL type of addicting, every time you press next turn its like ""just one more shot and im going home"". I personally didnt fall for the **** ""gameplay"" of this ""game"". I played Civ 3, Civ5 and Civ 6 Civ3 was a great 4x strategy game that required thinking and real strategy, this and civ 6 dont require any brains, its a pure **** ****.. You know, those unnecessary panels in strategy games. This game does not have them. Because you don't need it. It tells you what to do next and you make the choice. So it does not tire you, but you determine the events. In short, it is a game that even those who don't like strategy / can't manage should play.. Spent many hours playing, multiplayer is well done. The game is full of interesting content and mechanics.. The only game in this series that I played, and although it's not my kind ****, I enjoyed it very much. It's extremely addicting, so behave or ""just one more round"" syndrome. The music in the main menu is beautiful.. Best Civ in my opinion, although I find it hard to compare this with Civ II (especially the Test of Time), which was awesome at its time. To get everything out of this game, you absolutely have to have the DLCs, which combined are not too cheap. Diplomacy could have a bit more depth and there could be more varied victory conditions, and also the civ bonuses and social policies should be better balanced (can be fixed with mods1), but still it's a great game.. Civilization V is a very addictively fun strategy game. The fun historical facts thrown in, along with the personalities that have related bonuses for having that said leader make this game more challenging and increases the replayability. Having it on random is not nearly as fun, as you do not get to line up the bonuses with the map that you will play, but it does add to the difficulty, if you, for instance, get Queen Elizabeth I on a map that isn't good for naval combat, which is her biggest bonuses. The fun with Civilization V that keeps me coming back, is it is fun to build, fun to be diplomatic, though the computer controlled players are very unpredictable and will hate you no matter what in the end. For instance, I was in a position of being friends with a map of 15 other civilizations, when just after declaring our friendship, 3 declared war on me. I took their lands and that set me to dominating the map, so I cannot complain too much. I ended up winning through culture in that match, which brings up another thing that absolutely love about this game. Victory is not any one thing. You can win by being diplomatic and convincing other civilizations to vote you as world leader; you can win by decimating your foes and taking their starting capitals (or all cities if changed in the options); you can win what I find as the easiest way to win, via the culture victory; and you can win via science, and launching a space shuttle into space, leading to the next game which I will be playing soon. The combat is also fun to watch, and after playing for quite some time, and when you are going for a faster match, you can turn off the combat animations and have it instantly display the health changed and results. While you have the animations on, however, you can see each troop do their own specific type of attack or defense. The naval combat is my favorite thing to focus on, as having a good naval fleet is very powerful in this game. There is nothing like having an aircraft carrier, a couple of missile cruisers and a couple of nuclear submarines loaded along the shore of your next target. It takes a little bit to get built up that powerful, so you have to be diplomatic to start, especially if you try to hold off making too many troops up to that point. If you do not like naval combat and prefer ground troups, you will love the giant death robots, which obliterate their enemies. Strategy of using them is important, as you can easily lose your strongest troops if you do not plan your attacks well. The maps you choose also make a huge impact on the flow of the game, and your play style within it. Whether you are militaristic, diplomatic, scientific, or a builder of culture, religion and/or trade, this game has a path for you to take for victory. I definitely recommend Civilization V for strategy gamers, and all gamers who might be on the fence. I personally am not impressed with Civilization VI, and will be enjoying this game a while longer, until Civilization VII finds its way about.. a man goes to the doctor. says he's depressed. he says life seems harsh and cruel. says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. the doctor says ""the treatment is simple. the great clown pagliacci is in town tonight. go and see him, that should pick you up."" the man bursts into tears. he says ""but doctor... i am pagliacci."". Addictive game... One more turn... Sleepless nights. Hundred hours played. Lots of fun if you are determine to explore the rules.. This is a nice game, but comparing to CIV IV, it is not as good. 8 out of 10.. This is my frist Civ game. It's a fun turn based game, giving us a wide array of people (commanders/countries) to play as. It has some interesting ways of winning, as culture and getting to space first. Again, this is my first game, so I'm not sure if these have been implemented prior. Also, ****. I didn't realize he was a warmonger, until I looked up why he was. However, the AI tends to take the hardest way possible or walk back and forth when multiple units are together. Example: Early game, I'll order a unit and next to him there's a hill and plains. He could make the 2 grid move through the plains, but he'll go over the hill and lose a turn. It's annoying, especially when turns count for war. Not much I can say. I got about 50 hours on it.. This game is easily one of the best strategy games ever created, and it's beautifully crafted. With the power to **** you in for hours on end, beautiful graphics, and endless gameplay possibilities, Civ V will always leave you wanting more. This game forces you to simultaneously plan ahead, strategize in innovative ways, and think on your feet, all at the same time. Truly a masterpiece within it's genre.. I have no word on how good this game is. I can understand why some people doesn't like it but it's one of my favorite game.. A good strategy for playing a party, with many varieties of victory, good dls, but a poor device for online games. Chilli game. Of the minuses, a long one, they never played out to the end.. One of the best strategic games created ever. I have over 2000 hours played in this game. I love playing it when im traveling on train for hours and hours. Every game you play is different. It still looks good. I actually love it more than VI. 9/10. The latest instalment of the long running series continues the evolution of the ultimate strategy game. Starting with a single band of settlers at the dawn of man-kind the goal is to create the ultimate civilization to eclipse all rivals. Whether you do this by colonising the stars, waging war on your enemies or marvelling all comers with your sophisticated culture is completely up to you. Forgoing the usual campaign mode Civilization instead allows players to create a world of their own devising and jump right into it either by themselves or with others in multiplayer. Customisation has always been key to the series and before each game players can choose the makeup of their world such as the balance of ocean to land or the scarcity of natural resources. Continuing its turned based, rather than real time, gameplay this new edition does make a few changes from the previous instalment. For the first time it ditches the square based tiles and replaces them with hexagons allowing for more realistic terrain movement. The ability to stack multiple units on single tiles is also removed. This prevents the 'stack of dooms' seen in previous titles that made battles dull wars of attrition at later stages of the game. As would be expected new technologies and units are also added to the mix and a few features, such as religion, have been removed although most impact positively on the gameplay. In the end whether you are successful or not the Civilization series has always been about creating your own stories and yet again it succeeds.. Too much like the old games, but then without the previous DLCs, bad AI, easy to game, showing its age. Civilization V or Civil 5 I call it!.... I give this game a 9.0 out of 10 rating because this game is absolutely by far the most anticipated strategy game I have ever played even though this came out in 2010. Civilization V is one of the first 4X strategy type of games I have ever played in my entire life except for Civilization IV but I never stuck to it because it didn't interested me back then. However this game has been one of the most creative, intricate, analytic and diplomatic game I have ever played. So many Gold stars I just want to give it lol. A game that allows different Victories for example Domination, Cultural, Science, Diplomatic and Time. I love all the different civilizations I can be including the Added DLC packs and expansion packs of this game. I love that you can chose a large number of teams of AI or players added to the map where as other RTS games only allow 6-8 but here you can have more playing simultaneously. The maps are huge and small which gives a variety of ways to play. I also love how you take turns for each player because it reminds of board games I use to play, and always have to come up with different strategies and Ideas to counter or to interact with other players. Civ 5 does just that. I also love the fact that you can come up with different ideas every turn and solving problems and coming up with solutions for example; when to attack, should I trade, should I ask city states to help me declare war on and many more. This game has thousands of options to chose for. This was the first game I had to write a review because it was too good to not say anything about it. This game is definitely a 9/10 for and has so many Pros to offer. There are cons in this game. Warmonger I almost won in turn 70 but I didn't like how AI can Guard themselves because its a bit unfair because in late game, like Turn 200, they were too hard to compete even though I was declining every friendship they wanted with me. I wish Warmonger penalties weren't that harsh, I mean I came up with a strategy of a large force to take them out in a few turns. Lucky last Positive Religion and Culture is a great feature for me to change from War fighting destruction sort of style a play and actually focused on converting enemy kingdoms to accept my religion. Thats a bonus score added to this game. Well done 2K Games you have made me come back from playing no games for years into playing something that can be a bit too addictive .. the amount of crap necessary to install the game is ridiculous. from steaming pile of dogcrap to the game itself. This review is for Civ V complete, with the Gods & Kings and Brave New World expansions. The ""vanilla"" game is a stripped down version that offers very little game play. Fortunately for you, the game is so old that the complete edition is super cheap. Civ V is a delicacy. The game is missing core features from old civ games but adds a lot of great features for fans of strategy games. The good: the hex based strategic combat feels smart for the first time in civ history. No more stacking units to take a city or facing a stack of doom from the computer. You can win wars by playing smart. The bad: the game rewards only a few styles of play and does not offer a risk-reward for player choices. On that bad part, the game punishes the player for building an empire. Ever new city increases unhappiness to the point that any amount of cities greater than 4 leads to happiness problems in the early game. Conquering enemy cities generates even more unhappiness, and many a campaign of conquest ended with a peace treaty because of it. The notion of happiness if fine, but the execution is terrible. The result is that most players stick with civilizations that reward small empires. More on the bad. While some choices are essential, such as choosing to focus on a few cities to preserve happiness, others are inconsequential. For example, you can choose the Patronage social policy tree to lower the cost of gold needed to bribe city states. Or you can choose a policy tree that increases you gold earnings. Later on, you can choose the Freedom ideology to increase the generation of great people by 25%. Or you can choose Order and to increase the generation of great people by 25%. None of these choices have a drawback. Choosing Patronage will not hamper you ability to generate money or increase science. The same goes for Rationalism, which increases science with no extra cost to your civilization in happiness, culture, or gold generation. Every choice you make is a winner, which makes the choices extremely boring. A little side note on city states: you can buy their allegiance or do some very gamified quests to gain their allegiance. There is little nuance, and for the most part, the city states do little to enhance the game. For the most part, I used the city states as shields in the early game and then as a source of votes in the late game for a diplomatic victory. Overall, though, I think they clutter the map and are a sink for gold in the diplomatic game. I often half the number of city states or leave them out of the game entirely. Civ V has a great mod support from the community. If you are on PC. On Mac, you have access to many mods, but not the most game changing mods that fix all of the problems I mentioned above. On PC, you want to go with the Steam version (even though I find it bothersome to have to launch Steam to play a game) and find the Vox Populi mod. I would have preferred if the developer opened up the game to tweaking by the user as old civ games did. (For example, I edited some text files in Civ II to increase gold per turn so I wouldn't have to bother moving caravans. Fortunately Civ V automates caravans.) At least the mods add some life to the game. Mult-player still works and people do play it. Head over to the Civ V reddit page if you are looking to find people still playing. I would love to score this game higher as Civ is my favorite game series of all time (though I hated, hated, Civ III). Maybe if I would love the game more if had a PC instead of a Mac, and ran the Vox Populi mod. But I don't, and after hundreds of hours of gameplay, I can safely say this game has much less to offer than it seems, which is kind of sad.. Lots of strategic fun. Late game turns can take forever though. I usually try not to build too many cities.. Lovely game, even better than 6. 6 looks like a mobile game with some improvements.. one of my favorite games ever. i always come back to it it so fun i play it for hours at a time. i never played strategic turn based games before but i loved this game its a great entry point into these types of games. easy to understand hard to master. the game has lots of options on how to play many civs to choose from and with mods being so easy to use it doesn't lose any replay-ability once you've played the first time.. It's a boring copycat of previous games. The graphics is adequate, the gameplay too. The Civ cant get any fresh idea.. One of the best strategies of all time. Play interesting,the game has a large number of countries and many ways to win. I liked the fifth part more than the others. But one game lasts a very long time, you can sit and play all day,if not more.. With all the DLC installed, this game is so definitively amazing that I really don't think I'll ever buy another Civ game--which, is probably, not the intent by 2k games in making this. Sincerely though, if you have not ever played Civ but have a bit of interest, wait for a Steam Sale and buy this with all DLC. Totally worth it. I have played this game for hundreds of hours. I've had it since it came out originally when I was in college, and now I play whenever I just want to kill time but don't want something that's going to need as much immediate attention like an FPS. If you love history and adventure, this game is it! If you love strategy-based war games, this is it!. gameplay is very good but sometimes it can be boring gameplay because it repeats itself.graphic enough for a strategy game.. It is an entertaining, a little addictive, but it can be boring once you have won a couple of games because by then the game will be easy for you. At first glance it seems a complex game","sid meier's ""civilization v"" is a ""time warp"" game . it's a great experience seeing your nation flourish and grow . there's so much fun to be had here in single player alone ."
343.Super Mario 3D Land,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's just really good Mario. It's a bunch of short levels with fun new power ups which is great for a handheld console. I do find it quite forgettable but replaying it is always fun.. It's great and fun with cool level design and great replayability, but it's not really memorable or the best in its field still an awesome game though. Super Mario 3D Land was always a childhood favorite of mine, and having the pleasure of playing through this game as an adult to acquire a full sense of what makes this game everything it is, is very satisfying. When the Wii came out and Mario Galaxy was the newest Mario 3D platformer title, it was amazing, as we all know. As a child at the time though, I didn't have a Wii of my own. My time on Mario Galaxy was limited. So when they released a much similar game on the 3DS 4 years later, a console that I could call my own, it felt magical. I could play it whenever I wanted, wherever I wanted. Let's admit though, If you took Mario Galaxy and removed the outer-space aesthetic, Mario 3D Land would pretty much be a compact 3DS version of Mario Galaxy. From level style to textures to sound design. I played this game entirely in 3D. Whilst I'm 100% completing my library, I'd quite like to get the full intended experience while I'm at it. However, even with 3D mode enabled, I was still occasionally having trouble comprehending depth perception through motions that moved toward or away from the given perspective. I would get it eventually but only through muscle memory and a few attempts at the troubling section. Not sure if this is a game thing, a console thing, or a me thing. A key thing I noticed quite far into the Luigi levels was that the themes and patterns were all very similar to each other and a little repetitive. Now, I know reusing textures and enemies is probably a key sacrifice in creating such an experience on a small handheld such as the (near) 14 year old 3DS, but it definitely didn't go unnoticed. Unfortunately, the game was much easier than I remember it being. I sort of found myself rushing through the levels as I knew there wasn't going to be any real challenge or any preparation required at any point. That was until I started the Luigi levels. Throughout the whole underground experience, the levels were of a difficulty that kept me interested from start to finish. It's rare that a game re-peaks my interest so late into a playthrough but honestly, the fun started all over again. I completed this game in December 2024, not far from 14 years after this game came out. I can say with the utmost confidence that this game is, and will forever be, utterly timeless. The game does not feel 14 years old in the slightest. I mean, it's 3D for Pete's sake. Whilst admittedly a gimmick, it really puts you in the game and is still amazing to this day. Let's not gloss over the soundtrack either. Is there yet to be a Mario game without a soundtrack that makes a player bop? I think not. Super Mario 3D Land is no exception. My favorite tracks are the ones that play in the desert type areas. All in all, the overall experience was not quite as enjoyable as I remember it being, but that doesn't take away from what the game is. It has variety in terms of challenges and difficulty, despite its lack of variety in enemies, textures, and themes. It's simple, but later proves challenging for more experienced players who are willing to get that far. It's generally charming to say the least. I'd recommend to anybody with a 3DS just to experience what a 3D Mario game looks and feels like when in true 3D. (Completed with 5 shiny star profile).. The perfect Mario jump n`run for the 3Ds. Short, engaging and well designed levels. A great mix of 3D and 2D Mario games. 9,3/10. It is a very special game, especially because I had the opportunity to meet in person Charles Martinet on game launching (in Brazil). This game has a very nice level design, soundtrack, gameplay and a good usage of 3D capabilities of 3DS. The best Mario game for a Nintendo handheld system.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. as Child, I wasa Big Fan of the Game, due to being always a Nintendo Child, So, My Parents Got it me to Christmas, Together with my First Hand Held, The Nintendo 2DS. I tried for Hours to Play all the Levels, and My Biggest Highlight were the Items, like the Tanuki-leaf, and the Levels also were new And Unique, so i Give the Game a 9, due to also the Levels being a Bit too hard to me.. I love this game, it's a mix between the classic 2D Super Mario with the mechanics of 3D Mario. The only negative thing is its secondary story, which is somewhat bland.. Now, sometimes the Nintendo 3DS can feel like a portable Wii U And this is what it felt like super Mario 3-D World for the 3DS And itâs great I meanThis was one of the best selling 3DS games in the Mario franchise well of course except Mario Kart 7. The game is cool, Mario is easy to handle and a pleasure to hold. What I like about the game is the post-game where you go into 8 bonus levels where you have to collect as many stars as possible to progress. A fun game.. The best game. Just best. Phenomenal. Pioneer. Console saver. good gameplay and good use of 3D. This game singlehandedly saved the 3ds, and for that it deserves the world, a very good platformer.. The 3D effect makes my eyes want to claw their way out of my head FIRST MARIO GAME TO DO THAT, AND THEY SAID THIS GAME ISNT ORIGINAL!??. The perfect Mario game, this is for sure my favourite casual game out there, I can just put this in my 3ds and play it for a little while whenever I feel like it. Beautifull.. I only have beautiful and fun memories with this game as a kid, my old blue 3ds was really my best time i had and this game stayed in my memory forever and forever will. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm glad 3D land was more than just a quick cash cow **** for Nintendo and gamers alike. It's a game that may borrow heavily from past Mario games, but it still creates a unique experience that is very much on the go, and it's riddled with plenty of content for those that want a little more bang for your buck. It may have some issues with camera angles and controls, but it's a good game in its own right.. A very advanced game and surprisingly good for a portable console. If this game it's so good imagine it's Wii U continuation 3D World, really one of the best Mario games out there.. It's good but not quite as good as its Wii U counterpart, which is confusingly similarly called ""Super Mario 3d World"". This one has some interesting level design but it lacks variety at times. There is only one character (Mario) and there isn't multiplayer. Aside from that I did enjoy playing this game, but I do like Super Mario 3d World better.. Really great game, the first video game I ever got, one of the best games on the 3ds.. An excellent Super Mario game, especially on the 3DS. Makes good use of 3D.. This game is pretty great! It's the original 2D Mario games in a 3D form where you carefully platform to the flagpole! The level design is great and both Mario & Luigi are very fun to play as! The only issues I have with this game is that some of the star coins are pretty annoying to get, there are no level themes so all the levels are just random which means after you play a level you don't really remember what you just played and you move on, the cutscenes between worlds are annoying and repetitive, the levels start to feel bland and the same in the middle of the game, and having to play every level + the special world as Mario AND Luigi just to unlock special 8 crown is absurd. Other than those issues this game is a must play!. Even if I played it a little bit, and a standard Mario game as usual, on 3DS it is very very impressive for 2011 players who had a 3DS at the time. The levels are unique, the power ups are varied especially the invisibility leaf, and overall for a 3DS game in 2011, it is fantastic for its time.. When I was younger I was obsessed with studying Super Mario 3D Land. Back when I had Nintendo Channel on the Wii, I used to watch trailers, tips and trick videos, the works. But I never actually had the desire to play the physical game. And now after finally sitting down and playing it from start to finish, I began to see why. With its sequel Super Mario 3D World now available on the Nintendo Switch, there isn't any reason to play this game anymore. Of course being on more powerful hardware, 3D World has the obvious advantage in graphics, extra content, and overall freedom. But at the time, 3D Land was the only method of experiencing this type of Super Mario gameplay style on the go. And now that we have the deluxe version of 3D world, I don't have much reason to play this game. And that wouldn't be a problem if the game had a stand out theme, but the only stand set pieces are already present in other core series Mario games. The advertising hypes it up as a recreation of Super Mario Bros 3, but it's lot closer to the original Super Mario Bros. Each world is a linear path of at least four levels, all the castle levels contain a clash with either Fake Bowser or regular Bowser where you have to destroy the bridge to win, and Luigi is the only extra playable character. Sure, about everything has a tail in this game to reference the original game, but it's more of a topping than a batch of ingredients. The adventure theme is also quite generic. Peach is **** everything has a tail to give Mario trouble. It's not Peach is kidnapped and Bowser has turned her castle into a world of portals, polluting an archipelago, or taking over an entire galaxy. It's something we've all seen done to death in the New Super Mario Bros series. No added flavor no new **** level designs are quite imaginative and there are a few fun new obstacles here and there. But the motivation for going on this quest feels lost due to the uninteresting adventure format. And it doesn't help that many of the bosses are reused. And I know they did this 3D World too, but the difference here is that it's nine different types of bosses compared to a measly four. Two of which are just Bowser and the bridge and final boss Bowser. And even if you're still enjoying yourself despite these issues, the annoying motion controls linked with the cannon can really kill your adrenaline especially if you're playing this game in a moving vehicle. This not a bad or broken game by any means, but more so a pointless adventure. A prototype with little to no substance to entertain future players, thanks to a much more powerful sequel overshadowing its once acclaimed success.. Super Mario 3D Land is without a doubt one of the highlights of the 3DS, but nowadays there isn't really much of a reason to go back to it. My main complaints with this game are it's lack of memorability and the fact that it's a little slow at times. It also doesn't help that this 3D platformer is on the 3DS, making it a little more difficult to play. I still really like this game and think it's a great experience, but compared to other 3D Mario games it falls a little short.. Kept up with Mario 64 and Galaxy, did a 100% of the game and had so much fun, great music of course and very pretty for a handheld game.. This game isn't bad, a 6/10 means slightly above average, still, there are so many better Mario titles compared to this. It's just very repetitive and brings nothing new to the table, which makes it boring. It's also pretty mid gameplay-wise, since the 3d is bad. Still, I liked most of the level design and the final fight against Bowser was fun as well.. It's an alright, decent game and one of the better titles for the 3Ds but there's nothing really about it that sticks out to me or sets it apart from other generic Mario games, I much rather prefer its Wii U/Switch counterpart Super Mario 3D World over this game. One of the best Mario games I have ever played. Its level design and level variety was amazing. From deserts to Lava areas there was so many different types of levels and enemies to get pass. There were also a lot of fun power ups to utilise. The Bowser was also a great final boss with him chasing you as a massive monster was very tense. Overall an amazing DS game.. A must-have for any 3DS owners, classic 3D Mario gameplay is more unique and refined than ever with level after level of creativity, especially concerning the use of the 3D feature.. i would like to say that the gameplay is great and is a mustplay because of that, but there is barely a story.. The best praise I can offer Super Mario 3D Land is that it is a perfectly serviceable Mario game. However, I find that this franchise's hallmarks are beginning to wear thin on me. 3D Land offers no multiple characters (as 3D World did), none of the 3D exploration opportunities that games like Odyssey had, and very little that felt truly innovative to me. I believe that 3D Land is engaging, perfectly functional and at a level of overall quality that is expected of a Mario game. In the same breath, however, I feel that much like the Zelda (before Breath of the Wild, at least) and Pokemon franchises, Mario games seem to somehow manage to ride the coattails of their predecessors while receiving undue critical praise for even the slightest gameplay innovations. I personally believe that upon its release, this game needed to be far more innovative than it was to properly hold my attention, which it unfortunately failed to do for long.. This game is basically a miniature version Super Mario Galaxy 2 and is also basically Super Mario Bros. 3D. It includes the standard mario design of mario shrinking as he gets hit and requring a super mushroom to become ""Super"" Mario again. Unlike the other 3D games, this game has a more mario-ish vibe to it and includes regular mario enemies from super mario bros and New Super Mario bros while adding new things that were never seen in the previous games before.. Great remake **** classic, a short but strategic game, for how small it is it is effective.. Solid game however I feel that the bonus worlds would be much better if they were linear. One of my favorite 3d mario games! Unlike the previous ones, 3d land and world sticks to the traditional 2d mario game level types, rather then have objectives, like sm64, sunshine, etc. I think I like both this and sm64 level types. This review also is the same for sm3dw. The best game on 3ds. It is a pity that the next part came out only on Nintendo Switch. Super Mario 3D Land is a really good little platformer but it's hardly about to knock your socks of, the game has good level design a interesting throwback to Mario 3 in the Tanooki suit which grants him the ability to stall his landing, but I do think the game does market itself a bit too much of of this. This game is a fairly generic Mario game, not New Super Mario Brothers U generic but not Super Mario Sunshine unique. Your general Mario Enemies are all here such as Goombas and Piranha Plants and any original enemies are all most likely variations of these pre-established Mario staples. The camera can be a bit awkward sometimes but not very often from my experience. So yeah it's hardly reinventing the wheel. But the games positives far outweigh the negatives in my opinion, such as the fact the game feels amazing play as you only have 12 directions to turn and considering the linear level design this works perfectly as it is quick and simple. The game is clearly inspired by the Mario Galaxy series which we can see through the linear level design and the star coin collectable being taken directly from Super Mario Galaxy 2. The level design is amazing! The game offers loads of bite sized levels instead of only a few massive levels which works perfectly for the 3DS's pick up and play nature. There is a twist at the end where it reveals that you are only half way through the game and that there is a lot more that the game has to offer. The second half serves as a harder version of the first half with remixed levels and ideas reworked to increase the difficulty and this is still a walk in the park for Mario veterans but I can definitely see someone struggling with this if they were less experienced. The game is one of the only games on the 3DS to use the 3D feature well as it can be useful for bonus rooms and judging the distance of things in game. This game is a hidden gem and it doesn't get talked about nearly enough. I would highly recommend this game to someone who wants a nice relaxing game to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i want to smash boom boom so bad omg he is so hot i cant even describe how much. This game is quite good as it fits the 3ds perfectly. The level designs are simple and short which is perfect for portable game-play. The graphics are also great as it is among the best looking 3ds games. The only problems i have with this game is the skill, the game feels a slight bit to easy but that just be my opinion. Overall one of the best 3ds games.. for me this is the best mario game in 3d. I am a player who is not trying to collect all the stars and get all the content from the game, but this game is addictive. Many interesting situations, beautiful locations, nice music.. I remember, that i played it in my childhood. But itâs gettinâ harder and harder. (but u know this ig.). Can't belive mario is in 3D now. Been waiting for this since 1996. Thank you sakuri.. The best 3D Mario game imo, though it's practically tied with 64 and Galaxy 1/2 too. Wonderful use of 3D and outstanding level creativity.. This game is a lot of fun. It's not fancy at all. On the surface, it is a standard 3D platformer, pretty much the original Mario game in 3D. But it's executed in such a charming and polished way that you'll get hooked. It's like a simple hamburger with fries, but the best possible version of that meal. It's a shame that the game is only about five hours long, I'd like to play it much longer.. Back when i was a kid, it was my fav. Mario Game. I Love everything about it. Its cute and has everything you want. this game is way overrated! i give this a 6/10 max! boiling down to a thing: DISGUSTING camera angles! and dont let people fool you talking about how the 3d mechanic makes up for it, IT DOES NOT! how would it when the console doesnt even output it properly? 3d on the console does NOT work its trash wich was this game's whole gimmick! stupid game even has autoscrolling camera stages as if it wasnt bad enough good luck dying because of bad camera! but dont worry, the game grants you an invincibility item when the camera kills you too much... this game is way overrated. Really good platformer. Easy to pick and play. Some levels are repetitive and boring especially at the end of the game. But anyway game is pretty solid.. Solid plattformer, without the quality thad made the series great, and without any innovations or especially well gameplay, level design, graphics or 3D. Pretty much feels like New Super Mario Bros in small 3D environments, which definitely isnt a bad thing, and i can certainly see people having fun with thi. Pretty enjoyable but, like 3D World, not a patch on the ""true"" 3D games. Still worth a play though.. This Game is Fun, Pick up and play, goodness, offering tight controls, memorable levels and set pieces, and nice music. The Main game is easy, but the post game picks up the challenge for more experienced players. With 16 full worlds to explore, Any 3DS owner need this game in their collection. Its a Must Buy!. Mario 3D land was the best game from my childhood. Something about it just felt right it was a great game and I would play it again it was just. so. fun.. This was the first game that I played on the N3DS, and still it is one of my favorite game on the N3DS. I recommend to play this game if you have a brand new N3DS.. I bought this game for Â£10 in 2021, knowing that there was something good to this game. For that price, this was an incredible get. Fun and moreish with levels that are a breeze to complete. The main game is short and digestible to complete, but if you want more, the post-game is essentially a whole new game's worth of levels! Plus, you can unlock Luigi after Special World 1! If you want a really fun, bite-sized Mario experience that's more about light-hearted platforming than challenge, whether it be to binge or to play a few levels of on the go, this game is for you!. Easily a 10. Not even a discussion. 16 total worlds, all of them awesome. Level design near flawless, 3d feature amazing, and the challenge really comes later in the special worlds with shadow Mario. Man that was a pain sometimes, which made collecting all the star coins that much more rewarding. This is one of the best Mario games ever, and easily the best handheld Mario ever. What a gem. To give this game less than a9.5 is criminal. Great game, but not too memorable. The 3D is a cool effect, and you know exactly where your jumps are gonna land, and if you don't like the 3D, turn it off, your only disadvantage of playing in 2D is missing your jumps every now and then. Music is real catchy. My only problem is like I said, this game isn't too memorable. The levels seem the same in every way except level design. Nothing wrong with that, but I like seeing something different one in a while, this is something that 3D world fixed.. If you've only played 3D World, you're honestly not missing much. Just a fun, handheld version of that game.. A beautiful, charming, exquisite game that begs itâs self to be played in 3d. The levels are unique and colourful. The amount of levels in the actual game is quite impressive and the items are fun and creative. I love this 3d mario game so much, itâs the only one that I 100% because it is very addictive and easy. Overall, just a joy to play!. Despite it is way too easy globally, this is a really nice Mario experience with one of the most acute level design of the series from my point of view. Be aware it's gone through in about 6 hours.. This game is the definition of perfect, almost every level is fun and special, Most of them are really easy but there are some challenging ones. The bosses aren't really good and not hard enough except some of the bosses at the end of the game. This is the best 3d Mario game after sm64 and the best game avaliable on the 3ds.. It's great mario platforming, but the levels are very short and not very memorable. For the 3DS they managed to make good but something that doesn't match the likes of the traditional 3D Mario games.. A fun and charming platformer, but can be tedious to complete. Pros - The 3D effect is very well implemented. There is a great use of obstacles to take advantage of this 3D effect. For example, at one part, there is a thick spear that shoots out towards you. With the 3D effect it looks amazing. - The platforming is classic with new twists incorporated from previous Mario titles. - There are various types of power ups you can attain, which include takooni Mario, fireball Mario, and invincibility Mario. - There are pipes that lead to coins and other goodies taken from Super Mario bros. - The game positions the camera at different angles in certain levels to enhance the 3D experience. For example, in a level, the camera is positioned at the top so things appear to bounce up in front of you. - You get to play as Luigi after main quest completion, he can jump higher. - 8 full worlds with a higher difficulty (which the game really needed) after main quest completion. Cons: - At some points, it is difficult to tell exactly where you will land from a jump because of the 3D effect. This can be troublesome when facing enemies or platforms that move around - The game is very easy. The only challenge given, is the special levels you get after you beat the game. The special levels should have been the difficulty for the first part of the game. - The game offers unlimited invincibility if you happen to fail a level too many times. I disagree with this feature. The developers should let the player learn from their mistakes and overcome the obstacles on their own. Since the main quest is really easy already. - Having the game make you hunt for star coins near the end is more tedious than fun, since some of the star coins are hidden in ridiculous places. Not only that, but you must reach the end of the level again in order for the star coins to register after you have collected it. - Too much revisiting the same places. First you complete the 8 worlds, then you complete 8 ""special"" worlds, which is the same as the first 8 worlds with more obstacles and enemies. Then finally, you have to revisit and beat almost all of the worlds in order to obtain enough star coins to unlock the last level.. This game is just what people need in their lives- a bit more Mario! itâs structured like a New Super Mario Bros. game but with an extra axis, and a lot like the Wii Uâs Super Mario 3D World (all the way down to the title), which can both serve as turn-offs or turn-ons depending on how basic marioâed out you are. Marioâs move-set is a more scaled back version of the typical 3D control, and can only move in 8 directions. The difficulty curve is just right, and itâs a very pleasant surprise to find out that there are 8 more worlds after you beat the main campaign and then to unlock Luigi shortly after. The graphics are quite good for 3DS standards. The game can be very basic throughout, and if you want a more fleshed out and unique Mario game then try sunshine or one of the galaxy games, but this is a must for your 3DS collection sooner or later.. The title that put the 3DS on the map. The game had some nice level design and fun powerups, but felt too short for how much it costs, even with the added special worlds.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my least favorite Mario Game. I am not biased against the series, I am a huge Mario fan, but this game mostly just annoyed me by only being able to move in 8 directions. I also wasn't a fan a being forced to use 3d. I personally think 3d World is better in pretty much every way, so if you have a WiiU, get that. If you don't, I'd recommend New Super Mario Bros.. this game is amazing and one of the best 3d mario game on handheld nintendo console and the gameplay is really fun.. Mario 3D Land is a fun Mario game. It isn't particularly memorable, but it's a fun game nonetheless. I mean it's 3D Mario, how can you mess it up? It's also in actual 3D which is kind of cool. The 3D function on the 3DS was always kind of cool, but who cares? Anyway, one thing every 3D Mario gets right every time is the controls. They always feel so flued and satisfying, and it's no different here. There really isn't even that one level that sticks with you though. I mean none of them are bad but none of them are great. Even though It may be forgettable I never felt it dragged, I mean I beat it in 2 days but, I definitely had fun. Even though this is probably the worst 3D Mario, I prefer this over the majority of 2D Mario. I give Mario 3D Land a 8/10 and a B+.. The best platformer on the 3DS that was released during the time of hot garbage like Asphalt 3D. Gameplay is great, but the story is the same thing we have seen before. With massive replay-ability, this, ladies and gentleman, is the game that has saved the Nintendo 3DS.. Super Mario 3D Land is both one of the most fun Mario games I have ever played while being one of the most dissapointing. A 2 1/2D Enviornment (Not fully 3D) is super fun to play on and mess around with. The game feels like a natural evolution to the 2D Mario formula that I hope they continue to improve on. My main issue with the game is that is lacks content and has annoying and excessive padding. The game, without filler, is about 3.5-5 hours long. To make up for this, is is required of you to go back to levels you have already beaten, each level multiple times over, to gather collectible to progress. As fun as the levels are, playing the same levels over and over in a short period of time is super annoying and tedious. I don't know if I would reccomend this game - if you want a really fun Mario game and don't mind the tedious grind, I would pick this game up. Otherwise, I would probably stay away from this title.. An absolute must have for the 3ds. This is 3d effect made perfection. I can't imagine playing this one on a 2ds cause it won't be the same at all. this have to be experienced with the 3d effect on. Great platformer, the best on the system. Not very challenging but really really fun!!. Graphic: 10 Music: 10 Control: 10 Variety: 10 Degree of Difficulty: 10 Fun: 10 Story: 7 Multiplayer: / Content: 10 Long-term Motivation: 10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario 3D Land was my first 3DS game I played and have to say, game is great! If you are looking for an open sandbox game or a side scroller, this is not it, its in-between .I feel this was a nice idea and innovative on the franchise. The game is a little easy the main campaign but getting the star coins and the bonus world is rewarding as it unlocks bonus levels. The level design has great variety and should be commended. This game has great value and would recommended.. It's a very nice Handheld 3D Platformer and the perfect Game for Players who never Played a Mario Jump'n Run. This is the perfect Mario game for on the go. With its quick and fun pacing, this is probably one of the finest 3ds games.. This can be surely defined as one of the best 3DS games of all time. It shows the full potential of the 3D function of the console, and the gameplay is not boring at all. Definitely worth playing 100% :D. This game is not worth your 20 dollars. This game is boring but it does look cool. Its just plain boring but fun if your bored. Like really bored. This games does have 8 worlds with 4 levels each. So if you play for like 6 hours you will finish the game. This game is just not worth it.. One of the best 3Ds games. Good levels, the 3D mode is very Good used, a fair 100% and a fantastic final boss. The soundtrack is okay, but the bossbattles in World 2,3,4,6 and 7 are trash. They arenât bad, but they are all the same with more less difficult new features. I rate this game with a 10, because itâs a perfect 3D Jumpâ run for a handheld console.. this is the game that convinced people to buy a 3DS. well, this and pokemon. 3D land is the type of Mario game that you play and wonder ""why didn't they do anything like this sooner?"". Its a beautiful game, it has amazing graphics, cool power-ups and a great soundtrack but there way too much repetitive gameplay in the special worlds. This game is alright for the system that it is on. It presents many things and brings back power-ups that are awesome in this game.. Absolutely must play on 3DS, very charming world design and adequately challenging difficulty. We need more games like this. I played this game on 2019, and still find it very good. Timeless design and fun gameplay are always the things Nintendo do best.. It's obvious that Nintendo played it fairly safe for Mario's first 3DS outing â something that will likely make the game seem like a bit of a step backwards from the brilliance of the Super Mario Galaxy series â but it's impossible not to be impressed by the vast number of classic Super Mario elements that have been squeezed into the package, especially given how fresh they all look and feel in their new 3D presentation. If you've been looking for a reason to pick up a 3DS, you've just found it.. It's obvious that Nintendo played it fairly safe for Mario's first 3DS outing â something that will likely make the game seem like a bit of a step backwards from the brilliance of the Super Mario",i played this game entirely in 3D . the themes and patterns were all very similar to each other and a little repetitive . the game was much easier than i thought it would be .
344.Mario Kart 8 DLC Pack 2,"It's more fun Mario Kart 8 with new characters including some we've never seen in the franchise before. It does have some faults, for instance, I find some of the tracks to be somewhat thrown together and not that well thought out like a community mod. I have also been wanting Kirby in these games for forever and his absence from new characters added was very disappointing.. absolute traash, should not deserve being better than fh1, i hope they remove this from racing games,. This does not deserve to be in the Metacritic scores because it's just a DLC it is not an actual game therefore it shouldn't be seen as better than a full-fledged game especially Gran Turismo and Forza. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the worst game in history of racing game !!!!! I love DustinEden !!!. This doesn't belong in the ""racing game"" category, it's just a DLC ffs. This can't be better than the full game lol.. This is a nice DLC and all, but in no way should it be this high up on the racing game list over far more deserving games.. doesn't deserve to be above the actual game, the deluxe edition and in the top 20 list. really overpriced nintendo products are very nice, but they're terribly overpriced.. DLC pack 2 is a little dull; I mean, it's great that we received Animal Crossing Villager and Isabelle, but I still like the first DLC pack.. More courses, but the single-player offering still remains weak. Let's see what 9 brings.... the carts are dricing like they are on rails and i still not get it why sometimes i loose and sometimes i am first . mario kart doubledash is for pros and skilled ppl. DLC Pack 2 is (somewhat) better than the first one, making for an essential purchase for Mario Kart 8 owners. Villager, Isabelle, and Dry Bowser are welcome additions to the roster, and like the first pack, there's a variety of customisation options and tracks included. Personally, I hate Baby Park, but that's just my personal opinion, and it's only one track anyway. I love the rest (including tracks from Animal Crossing and F-Zero). Overall, it's even better value for money than the first pack, hence I give it a rating of 10.. With cross-over to Animal Crossing and F-Zero it's hard not to fawn over how completely awesome the Big Blue is while cute all of the Animal Crossing content is and while that might be enough to bring in the inexpensive DLC price there's much 8 more tracks to entice your visuals. This is what DLC should be 107/100, bonus points for bringing in the nostalgia.. There's enough content in the two DLC packs together to be half **** in and of themselves. I'm not so interested in the addition of more characters and colors, but I love all the new tracks.. This is an awesome DLC Pack! The thing I like is that they brought back my two favorite courses from Mario Kart: Super Circuit: Ribbon Road, and Cheese Land!. I hate DLC packs and, as a general rule, never purchase them. But this one is EXCELLENT and is TOTALLY WORTH THE COST. The new characters and maps are great.. Nintendo knows how to do quality DLC with very reasonable prices. The first pack with the Legend of Zelda track was great, but the second pack with Animal Crossing is off the charts fun. Of course, being an Animal Crossing fan, I would naturally gravitate towards this set, but it really is visually stunning with its changing seasons and graphics as well as original music compositions to match them. The other tracks, including another one based on F-Zero, are good but its the AC stuff that I keep going back to.. Well I'm only giving this a 9 out of 10 because I like anything to do w Mario Kart I am fanatically good at the game and virtually unbeatable in this game under any situation I don't think though you need a DLC for Mario Kart its good game for me as is because I can endlessly beat the computers and everyone else at this game. Although currently I'm working on fighting games because I'm EVEN more interested in those and because Mario Kart gets repetitive after a while. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I like animal crossing..... alot. So as you could imagine i love this dlc pack. And honestly there's not one thing i don't like about it. First there's a beetle car. If that doesn't convince you, then nothing will. Characters are great (although why is Dry Bowser in a AC pack?) and the courses are amazing. You can now race in a land made out of cheese In anti-gravity, what more could you ask for?. And this guys, is how to make a good DLC, serioulsy, first time that Nintendo tries with DLC and they do it right, the 1st one was good but this one is excellent. The 2nd DLC pack is WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the 1st one in my opinion. It has better tracks (Yes, even GCN Baby Park!!!), better vehicles (looking at you P-Wing), and better characters (I never cared about characters but DRY BOWSER'S UPGRADES AND HIS BLUE FIRE BREATH OMG!!!!!)! BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!. How can you go wrong with paying 8 dollars for 25% more content? It's not incomplete without it, so it's your call. Get it if it seems worth it to you.. Great value for This DLC, it feels like we are having a new game again, extremely cheap price in comparisson with other DLCs, also the courses are pretty beautiful.. It was fun for a while, but because I couldn't actually get the dlc stuff I can only rate for what I have and that it's fun, but I do feel a little limited so I can't give a full rating.. ONE WORD: PERFECTION! Mario Kart 8 and both DLC Packs deserve to be in your video game library. It's a masterpiece and one of the most magnificent games Nintendo has ever released. It will stand the test of time. This DLC is so perfect and so fun that I am addicted but refuse to get help.. Let me begin by saying I hate DLCs. Mainly because of price, so when I saw the low price of this DLC I excepted little from it. But I was blown away, these are the best maps yet. I just wished they would make more :(.. The circuits are simply fantastic, new characters, new cars and car equipments and the update of 200cc has revolutionized MarioKarts. Good, nice and cheap Nintendo had make a geniality again. Just a wonderful content for Mario Kart 8, with colorfuls tracks followed by a magnificent sound track. Bringing back to life the (GCN) Baby Park track is great, because it fits perfectly with the 200cc mode, the same goes for the Big Blue track. But the Animal Crossing track, with out no doubt, is the best track of the pack, because every season you play, looks like a different with a marvelous soundtrack.. dlc not worth the price everyone should be against this dlc policy, independent counsel of the company. This is a mercenary market. game is already done with these intentions. I can't review this without being a raving fan boy. Rarely does DLC deliver so much goodness and new life into a game. Not only are the new tracks some of the best in the game, with Big Blue and Ribbon Road coming to mind, and not only are the new characters fun and fresh after what felt like retreads outside of Link from pack 1 and not only are the karts awesome but it's all that, plus 200cc mode that brake/changes the game in amazing ways. It's an insane amount of content that would be $20 on its own easy from any other company, and they give you BOTH packs for so cheap. This is how DLC should be! I am back to spending hours perfecting course runs, getting all the starts in 200cc and the new tracks and I love it. Even online is full and exciting again! I hope this is by far the last DLC we will see for MK8.. This is probably the only time I'll rate this 10. This dlc is prefect, The tracks choices were good. (Especially the retro tracks.) The new characters were a good addition and the kart as well. I have no problem with this dlc hence why it gets a prefect score. Every company who is making dlc should take note of this dlc because this is how dlcs should be made.. They have finally fixed everything that in my original review I said was wrong with the game. So for that it gets a 10. But also gets a ten for the addition of 200cc racing for free for everyone!!! This game just keeps paying off. Cheap DLC and huge amounts of bonus content. Great Job Nintendo!!. Holy crap! Best DLC EVER!!!!! The tracks are awesome. I especially loved Big Blue, Super Bell Subway, Animal Crossing, and more. The characters are cool, especially Dry Bowser whom I really liked in Mario Kart Wii. This is a VERY GREAT DLC pack and You should get it. If you hate DLC Pack 1/2, and the game itself (mk8) , you're silly as J Bieber.. the best dlc put there all the tracks are amazing specially ribon road, 200 c is also awesome and way to caotic and all the characters and vehicles they put in are cute and useful. Here is just a quick rundown of all the tracks in the game, as well as the characters and vehicles to help give people who are unsure a solid overview. Baby Park: Still very hectic and crazy as ever, especially when you set it to frantic mode or 200cc! It 's all about items and drifting like in the original, but the anti gravity here is great to let you quickly boost ahead of everyone! Still pretty awesome! Cheese Land: Pretty standard stuff, but very focused on small speed boosts. There's a lot of sharp turns for drifting, bumps for doing tricks, and half of it is in anti-gravity. Plus, there's a really cool glider shortcut, and some great music as well. Pretty good honestly. Ribbon road: THE PRESENTATION OF THIS TRACK IS PERFECT! Everything is set in a little kid's toy room, and they play it up so well! Other than that, there's a lot of really cool shortcuts that don't require mushrooms to access, which is always great for a little bit of risk vs. reward. Amazing! Neo Bowser city: again, pretty standard stuff, but the presentation and music are spot on, and there's some areas on the track where you can definitely fall off easily, even if you're drifting. It's pretty fun just because of that little touch, because everything feels a little more frantic when playing with friends. Animal crossing: Again, perfect presentation with some AMAZING attention to detail! There's tons of references to Animal crossing games, like the money rock, trees dropping apples for speed boosts, coins being replaced with bells, and even changing seasons that affect the gameplay! Because of all the little details, this track really feels like you're racing through Animal Crossing, and that's awesome! Wild Woods: Presentation is really good once again, Amanda the track design makes good use of nearly EVERY MECHANIC! There's a lot of anti gravity for speed boosts, but they can also launch you off the edge! There's an abundance of ramps, a glider section, a water slide and boost pad section, and really cool drifts! Because of all this, the track feels really fast, and that makes it really fun! Super Bell Subway: Presentation mimics a subway station that connects nearly all the tracks, with tons of attention to detail, and really cool references! This track is all about branching paths, and as a result, it feels really different every time! There's riding along the tracks, or above them to the left or right. It's very drifty, features a lot of bumps and boost pads, and the train is a really big obstacle, but also functions as a shortcut for the higher tracks! It feels like the toad's turnpike done much better than in the retro rendition here, and that's really awesome! Big Blue: This is possibly the best track in the entire game, if not the entire series! I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's truly epic, unique, and exhilarating! The song in the background is awesome, the presentation is great for displaying the twisty effect of anti gravity, and this track is FAST. Even on 50cc, it's blistering speeds all the way. There's tons of drifts and bumps, conveyer belts, water slides, and boost pads galore. Add that on top of some epic anti gravity that wraps around the entire course, and a huge Mt. Wario lap structure, and you've got an amazing track on your hands! Finally, Vehicles and Characters: Isabelle and the villager are both really adorable with all their tricks and karts, dry bowser and his bone bike is a really menacing character, and the p-wing is a great speedster car! Well, that's about it! I hope this helps you if you were wondering whether to purchase this or not. Either way, for $8, or $12 is you wanted the other pack, which is also pretty good, this is definitely worth your time!. 8 new tracks, 4 new vehicles, 3 new characters for cheap price. Plus update that includes 9 new mii amiibo outfits & 200 cc mode? Nintendo continues to make mario kart 8 experience awesome. Not every new track perfect but so much detail put into every one. From the room full of things from karts from game to yarn yoshi on Ribbon road. The flying jets on Big Blue. Super Bell Subway have signs to other tracks in the game. Animal Crossing track changing seasons. Hope nintendo gives more love for this game in the future with more dlc packs.. The first DLC for this game was a superb effort. The second is even better. 8 fantastic tracks. 3 great characters. 4 good vehicles (as well as a nice set of tyres and a glider). All of this for a very nice price (In Britain Â£7 for the individual pack or Â£11 for the two DLC together, and you'd be crazy not to take the latter option). For this price this is an awful lot of content. The key addition here is the set of 8 new tracks. Unlike the first DLC, where in my opinion there were tracks that were merely ok, in my opinion all 8 of these rank amongst the better tracks in the game. The highlights include the superb Animal Crossing track, which has a completely different atmosphere depending on the randomly chosen season it happens to be while playing it, and the immensely challenging point-to-point track Big Blue inspired by F-Zero. Though not strictly part of this pack I feel that the free update that coincided with its release that included a new 200cc mode deserves a mention. It's simply a wonderful addition to the game that really does make you play it completely differently, requiring frequent use of the brakes (and it is now possible to brake while drifting to assist with this, which is a great addition). This along with the new DLC pushes the entire package of Mario Kart 8 over the top. If Mario Kart 8 wasn't one of the games of the generation when it came out, it surely is now. I hope Nintendo don't stop with it here, I feel like this game has a lot of life left in it still.. Simply spectacular! Somehow, Nintendo managed to top Zelda x Mario Kart 8 with their latest pack focused on Animal Crossing. Three brand new characters (all of which are great choices, unlike the last pack's Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach), eight new tracks (all of which are amazing, unlike the last pack's Ice Ice Outpost), and four new vehicles which I'll find myself constantly using. Baby Park is a chaotic thrill ride that lasts seven laps. It's always great fun. Cheese Land is a unique and at times challenging coaster through a maze of dairy products. Wild Woods is a beautiful and fast-paced climb up to the treetops and through river rapids. Animal Crossing is a nostalgic course that can change seasons, giving it great replay value. Neo Bowser City is a difficult, twisty rainy nighttime course that really tests your skills. Ribbon Road is nonstop eye candy filled with references; not to mention it's simply an amazing course. Super Bell Subway is a creative ride through the underground. Avoid the subway trains! Big Blue is an F-Zero course (3 sections; not 3 laps) that is speedy, beautiful, challenging, and stellar. Have I already given the pack enough praise?. Incredible, I played and I am just amazed. In my opinion it is one of the best DLCs ever created... The tracks are incredible and the new vehicles are very good.. Better than DLC Pack 1. The tracks are awesome. I especially love Super Bell Subway! And Neo Bowser City is awesome. Also we had at least 1 good character this time (Dry Bowser). Mario Kart 8 DLC Pack 2 is great and I would recommend it for the amazing tracks.. This is a DLC how it should be. Just some euro and we get 8 tracks, 3 characters and 4 cars, that's amazing. the other DLC had boring characters, except Link, this time around are more well made. The Best DLC of these months.",i find some of the tracks to be somewhat thrown together and not that well thought out like a community mod . i have also been wanting Kirby in these games for forever and his absence from new characters added was very disappointing . this doesn't deserve to be in the metacritic scores because it's just a DLC .
346.The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Who knew a walking simulator could be so fun? This game is a brilliant microcosm of the gaming world providing laughs and never taking itself too seriously along the way. And besides, thereâs a very special bucket in there and once you have that bucket, youâll never leaveâ¦. Been 2 years since I played it, and I have a fond memory of this game. It instigated my curiosity real hard and touched my completionist heart, so much that I was striving to see every ending and explore all ramifications of the story even though not all of them give you an achievement or an in game item. Just pure curiosity. This game is amazing.. I cant even describe this, sometimes its funny, and other times it makes you think for serious things. I really loved this game, it really follows the insticts of the player, and has prepared any dialogue for anything you do.. Honestly i cant really describe the game, its a fun experience, it makes you think, sometimes profound things, and question human nature, sometimes it makes you think, thats funny. Its enjoyable and made with care, polished and doesnt waste your time, for what it tries to be, its some of the best. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. have no idea how long I've been waiting for a new adventure with Narrator. i Really enjoyed playing. one of my favorite games I've played in recent memory, such a creative **** game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my personal favorite games. I loved this game and wish I could play it for the first time again. I really enjoy the narrator's dialogue; he makes me feel like I am Stanley and draws me deeply into the world of the game.. It is one of the best meta-games I've ever played. Strongly recommended for everyone.. Nothing, and I mean nothing, will ever make me feel how I did playing The Stanley Parable. Recommended.. Played the mac version, The 4th wall doesn't exist. and that's what I like about it. the amount of ending you can get is really good and the idea of a timeloop is good alone but add a funny narrator and It's almost perfect.. The humour wasnât really to be my taste. I may have enjoyed it more when I was younger.. The Stanley Parable, a surreal and thought-provoking game, owes a debt to the cinematic vision of Charlie Kaufman, renowned for his exploration of existential crisis, free will, and the absurdity of human experience. The game's narrative structure, branching paths, and satirical commentary on choice and consequence evoke the spirit of Kaufman's films, such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John **** The Stanley Parable, the protagonist's journey through a maze-like office building mirrors the labyrinthine narratives of Kaufman's films, where characters struggle to find meaning and purpose in a seemingly arbitrary world. The game's omniscient narrator, with his wry commentary and multiple endings, recalls the self-aware, meta-fictional storytelling found in Kaufman's **** Stanley Parable's exploration of choice and consequence, where the player's decisions lead to multiple, often contradictory outcomes, resonates with Kaufman's exploration of the human condition. Both the game and Kaufman's films suggest that our choices, though seemingly important, may ultimately be illusory, and that the search for meaning and control in a chaotic world is inherently futile.Through its clever writing, clever use of meta-gameplay, and Kaufman-esque themes, The Stanley Parable creates a thought-provoking experience that challenges players to question the nature of choice, free will, and the human experience.. ""The Stanley Parable"": Confusing, tedious, and utterly unenjoyable experience.. A unique experience of gaming Davey and william just created a masterpice .. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe isn't like most games. It doesn't include fighting monsters, playing minigames, talking to NPC's or doing parcour. Still, TSPUD is one of the most fun experiences you'll ever have in a game. The narrator has a wonderfull personality, the bucket adds to an unexpected twist for all of the endings, which are so unbelievable many. As of April 2024, there are more than 50 endings, yet it could still come an update that will add more. If you have a few dollars on your steam account and don't have any games to play, I highly suggest trying out this game.. That was very intereting The bucket is something)) Great game but to short((. A great hommage to a groundbreaking game. The only issue is that the while the original stanley parable was a great game in a genre only it resided in, Ultra Deluxe is a great game is a genre packed to the brim with impeccable games. A walking simulator that isn't extremely funny or unique. It just feels like a fan project that you play for half an hour rather than an actually realized game. For actual humor, go play Portal 2 or Jazzpunk.. the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never. Beginning was really interesting and fun, but later on it became a little bit worse. Still it is an interesting experience for few hours and it works well on Steam Deck.. I have played the original ""The Stanley Parable"" back when it came out in 2013 and I really enjoyed that game though I can't really say that I expected a sequel or a ""reboot"" to come out. This one feel more like a DLC to the original game rather then a whole new experience so it feels kind of strange rating it because by doing so I'm also in part rating the original The Stanley Parable game. The game just like it's previous iteration is filled with the narrators various witty commentary both about video games, the nature of video games but also life in general. I really fell in love with this narrative back in 2013 and obviously it still holds strong to this day. As for the gameplay, it isn't much, you go around various rooms, pressing buttons and experiencing the many endings this game has in store for you, always starting over from the same place. There are a few ""secrets"" in the game to discover as well, but this is not a puzzle game so don't expect that coming into it. If this were the original, I'd probably give it a much higher rating, but from my own standpoint I'm not a big fan of companies re-cycling and re-releasing the same games they already made 10 years ago, with a little extra content and maybe slight improvements on top. I said the same for Skyrim, and I'm going to say the same for this game whilst it is a masterpiece of it's time and it's genre, I would have rather had an original game instead of one that I've already played.. The game is similar to Portal in terms of the narrator-player relationship. Only you can make no or very few decisions, which has little or no effect and at best changes the narrator's monologues... sometimes. A terribly lame game within which you can almost feel the developers holding their stomachs laughing, especially when they started poking fun at the new ""Ultra Deluxe"" and handing the player a satisfaction bucket to give him something to do for all the money they've shoveled by publishing this pointless game. You can hold the bucket, more isn't to do for you in that place. Very little can be done in the game in general. In most cases, the best you can do is decide whether to go left or right. You can close a few doors, sometimes press a button. But as I said, that changes almost nothing. And you will be reborn in the effectively same situation over and over again, no matter what you did last time.. The narrator is back, and we got bucket too now compared to Stanley parable we got many endings and choices I won't stop playing over and over again. The Narrator had me laughing constantly! It's also nice that there are so many endings to try!. I never played the game, but based off the playthrough I saw, it is comedic genius, a wonderful commentary on choices in video games, and generally a wonderful game to see were it goes next, because it's full of surprises. AND HOLY GOD IS THIS THING META. Go check out special edd on youtube to see the playthrough I watched.. Perfect game, funny commentary, unexpected turnings of events and it feels as if there is unlimited content with new ways and endings lurking around every corner. It gives you a lot of way to explore the map as well as the story.. The hardest I've ever laughed while playing a videogame.. Good new content. 6.5/10 overall. This game is literally a joke in itself that is my conclusion after playing the Epilogue and almost every ending in this game. The gameplay is basically you controlling an empty character named Stanley and going walking while the narrator tells the things you should do, then you have to decide if you obey or not and based on the player's choice we go to one of the dozens of endings this game has. The narrator is crazy and things can turn out to be all crazy ways, for instance in one ending the narrator explodes the entire office (and he trolls making you press buttons to stop the countdown), another is revealed that Stanley is hallucinating all things, another the narrator gets lost and resets the game. In conclusion, there is no story, you can't deduce what is happening, it is all a joke. The part that I liked the most was ""the new content and sequel saga"", at least, these parts had some meaning, they joke about how the game industry sells games with little to no new content at full prices. The game is very creative, yes, but it is meaningless, some jokes are fun, and I had some surprises playing the game but some parts were kind of tiresome. Also, this game is danm too short, I've finished it (mostly without help) in just 3-4 hours. 6.5/10 overall. The best game what made humanity . And bucket is the best character in games. This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee #427. Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.. This game i a masterpiece, and the new content is really good too, when i finnish it i wanted more. If you haven't played this game pls do, you wont regret it (unless you don't like ""walking simulator games""). I would have appreciated some sort of way to skip the narration, as it takes forever for him to finish speaking. That being said, there were some legitimately amusing bits.. Best game in all the time Employee 427 The end is never The end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is neverThe end is never. I did not find the game to be funny at all. It was boring, pointless and felt like a demo. Exploring the mysterious office building was about the only interesting thing.. Truly one of a kind game that I would recommend anyone who is familiar with the narrative and structure of Videogames.. One of the funniest games I have ever played. Some of these endings are absolutely hilarious. Would highly recommend playing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The definitive version of The Stanley Parable. Had a blast from start to finish.. i havent even played the original AND THIS ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER I got to the Epilouge Recently And i LOVED IT RECCOMEND 100% BY A PRO JUDGER. Personal Standup Amm it's not a game, it's a show / performance / standup, soooo you need to know about it. I don't understand why it's in games section and why it's so overrated. So I don't want to use ordinary game scoring like visual, gameplay, story etc., but describe my feelings. So, I like the idea, but it is such a boring performance. To be honest I waste about 3-4 hours on this and every time I thought that yeah narrator tell some funny ""gamers insights"" buuut I don't want to play in THIS, just to check some ""easter eggs"". Because it's totaly not working for me IMHO. Many moments are very obvios. So instead of 4 hours game, I will preffer to watch standup or show on the same theme. All in all I definetely can not reccomend to PLAY in this game, but you can check stream on youtube and don't lose anything. In new era of streaming when I can watch all story-based games on youtube Stanley Parable: UD feels very archaic.. Absolutely brilliant. every single ending gave me an existential crisis or just left me laughing. The writing for the narrator is as good as the original game maybe even better! The best parts were the overall message of the game and the little Easter eggs that I fell in love with.. insanely funny. almost every ending is interesting and funny. it takes the original game which was already great and creates double the content and endings. a unique gaming experience you cant get anywhere else. The Stanley Parable was a tonic to modern game design, full of well-written dialogue that genuinely led you to question not only your actions in that game, but in all games. Is the narrator reliable? Should you blindly follow what your told? And what are the consequences if you don't? The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe builds on this by subverting modern game design in a whole new way. If you haven't played the original - or even if you have - go play this game. No spoilers - you just need to play and experience this game. The Stanley Parable isn't a dumb game, but neither is it a very smart game. This is an issue because it very clearly believes itself to be the most clever game ever made. There is little, if any, substance behind the swagger. It's quaint to imagine a time when a game like this was novel, but that time has long, long since past.. Itâs creative, great writing, funny and totally unexpectable. just amazing.. This is a game that is filled with references, jokes, and incredible endings. Oh, and make sure to get the bucket.. it was fun and interesting, but not enough. it could be so much better with more mysteries and interactive objects and world-shifting choices. i liked the game and because of that i expected more.. a life changing experience, and even more if you start thinking and reading about it.. Really nice and intriguing game. The mechanics implied here are pretty clever. I didn't play the original, I discovered it only after the remake was released.. Come on, I almost have the go outside achievement, now I can't play for 10 years XD. Quite funny and clever game. Really meta. Nothing else to say really. You should try it sometimes.. 10/10 Game that wants you begging for more, and there's always more. so many ending so many different pieces of dialogue just as you think you've done everything it throws something new at you making you want to do it even more.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent work porting the game from Source to Unity such that you could easily miss the engine change completely. The new content has some wonderful art design, music, and of course excellent writing brilliantly brought to life by all the voice actors. Overall, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe beautifully expands on the original Stanley Parable remake with new ideas that feel like they were always part of the older game.. A masterpiece. Perfect sequel to the first game. Funny, artistic, and brilliant engineering 10/10.. Didn't like the ULTRA DELUXE content, they ruined the CLASSIC game that was The Stanley Parable, but the bucket is so good it deserves a 10.. This is Good for somebody who has never played the Stanley Parable but as someone who as played all of the original game I feel like a **** for even buying this is this the new content? at first I thought I was being punked or something I thought surely there must be more to the new content than wandering around the same hallways from the last game with this bucket and seeing mostly the same endings too but no its like the whole game is just making fun of you for wasting money it this should have been a free update to the original not a sequel or whatever this is supposed to be but why release anything for free when you can just milk your fans instead if there ever is another Stanley Parable game ill save money and just pirate it. this game very gud, buy 4 me pls. oh man, if i could only find a girlfriend.... TLDR: Its new and better Stanley. If you haven't played the original, just play UD. Its bigger and better. If you want more info, I won't give you since all of it are spoilers (; I'm not 5 I can read: Stanley Parable is a game of its kind. Of course, we are talking about Ultra Deluxe, and simply, its MUCH better version of original Stanley. Other than 2 new endings, about 1,5h of new content, and, well, 2x more new endings after completing ""New Content"" it adds really important Epilogue, and everything after it. Well, I just said what adds UD, but here is a question: What is Stanley Parable? Stanley Parable is a game about choices. It's a game about a person named Stanley. Its a game about Narrator and him being scared his work won't be loved. And most importantly: It's a story about control. But from gameplay perspective, its a game about exploring office, and making choices that have different endings. Narrator talks straightforward with Stanley and/or player, and breaks the 4th wall many, many times. Its really funny, it's really creative, it's really good. You should play it. I finished in about 8h, but there are people with much more on their timer (like 14-6h), and even I can find some new content (as a guy who played the original). So, umm, I hope you liked the review, its my first ""big one"". Buy the game, Have good time, And see you later. edit: I readed some negative steam reviews. I'm suprised because some of them have a really good point (some, most are just saying ""too little new things"" after 0,5h, or too expensive), And I wanted to address those reviews. So, all of them are from fans of the original. That is very important. They criticize two things: The new content is just worse old content without a soul, and that its a bad satire. As to the first argument: It's just wrong. The new content is as good as the old one, sometimes even better. Like, half of my favorite ending are from UD and half from Original. Simply: Nostalgia is powerful. And the second argument, is, more complicated. I am a person who, apart from PS4 Exclusives (and mgs/r) doesn't play a lot of typical AAA. And with that I'm not good with answering the question: What makes a good sequel. There are many games that have another parts same as old ones with new settings and minor changes in gameplay (Ubisoft moment), and some others with super big changes, like fighing games. (just look at Guilty Gear). So overall, this may be an argument, but imo it's not a reason to say that game is bad. Well, that was long, and nobody will read it, sadly, so umm, Have a good day!. I am doney with the funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Man that was fking ****. the narrator just keeps blabbering for the sake of blabbering with no direction, intent or wit. I gained nothing playing the sequel, and will not recommend it. just play the original.. True beauty never fades, you just need to be reminded of it every once in a while.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Provides a great expansion upon the original game that feels true to the content that fans love while also covering new ground and exploring distinctly different ideas, all while presenting consistently comedic metacommentary on the nature of sequels in many video game franchises. The balance between absurdist humour and somewhat philosophical metacommentary that this game lands sets it apart from other games of the style by always knowing when to swap between serious monologue and outlandish comedy video. This game perfectly encapsulates everything that a mature comedic game can accomplish, even if a few elements (namely the invisible walls which seem to affect the decision making that the game directly criticises) don't seem entirely ironed out over the development process. Definitely worth the experience even if you've already played through the original game.. such a great improvement in the store of the characters, the new endings are awesome. the new CONTENT is the best part of all. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. admirable [ ad-mer-uh-buhl ] adjective worthy of admiration; inspiring approval, reverence, or affection.. As someone who absolutely adored the original, this game is literally that, but even more. What's not to love? Not only did they remake the entire game in Unity, but expanded with new endings that still carried the brilliant commentary on video games the original had (if more explicit now with a couple). Every step I took into the new content I was surprised by the game by how much more it does than I expected. While most of the old endings remain the same, I am happy that way, and it really shows how faithful and passionate they were, and yet still dedicated to not disappoint the player, providing delight and awe. A must-play if you have not played the Stanley Parable before, but an even more must-play if you already have.. this is a game for geniuses what could be better than a talking bucket and a mockery of everything that is. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Absolute breathtaking. As someone who enjoyed the original Stanley Parable, I was excited for the new content that would come from this remake. And it truly surprised me in more ways than one. The Stanley Parable 59: The Cursed Closet Room was my fav sequel.. i like the bucket. good bucket. mm. bucket. so calming. so tranquil. you musn't go now. give me the bucket.. [TLDR: Itâs a really interesting and satisfying experience. There is stuff that repeats intentionally. Youâll have about 5-10 hours of very enjoyable playtime if you donât care about 100%. If you try to 100% this game without a guide/walkthrough expect a lot of repetition with trial and error after 3-4 hours playtime. Itâs very much worth it though. I highly recommend this game!] Iâve put 15 hours into this game (didnât play the original game before) to do pretty much everything there is to do, yet other people seem to only have needed around 7-8 hours to manage 100% completion. This means after the first 3-4 hours into the game youâll probably run around trying to reach new places and interact with everything that seems even remotely plausible which is fun, but can get tedious, because you could end up with a lot of repetition. But thatâs the price of discovering things for yourself without a guide I guess. I was incredibly happy every time I discovered something new and it was such an amazing, interesting and satisfying experience overall. In hindsight I would suggest to play the first 4-5 hours without a guide and then look for hints online. I definitely recommend everyone to play this game!. 10/10 game and a perfect expansion of the original Stanley Parable, highly recommend","i really loved this game, it really follows the insticts of the player, and has prepared any dialogue for anything you do . i really enjoy the narrator's dialogue; he makes me feel like i am Stanley and draws me deeply into the world of the game ."
347.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption,"This game was like a nightmare, but not in a haunting way, it was rather inspiring because this game is purely good entertainment and a very solid endnot for this trilogy that makes me long for more. Surely Metroid Prime 4 will come out this year, surely.. Adapted for the Wii the game feels great. Aiming with the remote feels intuitive and smooth. The great level of design and world-building is still present. The music still is amazing. Just a great game to finish this incredible trilogy.. I never played a Metroid game before and a friend gifted me Corruption. And this is one of the best fps games I've ever played. I will definitely come back to this franchise. Overall rating: 9.3.. The best Prime game. Energy Cells and finale ruined my fun, but overall it's wonderful game. Clap-clap.. Another good entry in the Metroid franchise that employs the Wii control method better than most - although it still nettles that there are no alternatives. Good looking, atmospheric and it thankfully corrects the previous Metroid Prime mistake and provides a decent number of strategically placed save points.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably my favourite game, no game has immersed me more. The world is incredibly detailed and so much fun to explore. Walking through Bryyo had me looking at the big stone golems, staring at the beautiful skybox and dreaming about the history of the planet to the awe inspiring music. Skytown's steampunk pods were so cool and the music sounds like you've arrived in heaven with bells and angels singing. I really cannot praise the worldbuilding, music and art of this game enough, absolute masterpiece. i know the game has some flaws, the combat is a bit weird, most enemies are bullet sponges unless you use the game breaking hypermode. For me though, i dont mind the combat, atleast you can breeze through the game feeling powerful so you can explore.. Definetely the worst of the Prime Trilogy. But this is at all a bad game. It is still really good and you should still play it. Definitivamente el peor juego de la Trilogia Prime. Pero este juego es para nada malo. Es muy bueno y deberias jugarlo.. its so bad you cant even watch a lets play of it on youtube much less subject yourself playing it. Despite being certainly lesser than both of it's predecessors due to it's often very constricting linearity, Prime 3 is still a blast in it's own right. Featuring the Prime series' best combat and boss quality yet all while still accompanied by interesting lore and a great soundtrack.. How could ANYONE have thought his was a good game. Even for 2007 the game is trash. There's ridiculous time lag on the stupid grapple. There's a lot of pointless backtracking through areas required. There are a lot of boss battles where you have to suspend any real life knowledge and try out different things. Oh maybe this explosive rocket will do damage? oh no that can't be it. The Hyperbeam or whatever mode? Nope. It's actually actually a little starting mine from the morph ball. etc. etc. etc. Dodging? It's barely a thing. A lot of it just **** down energy tanks and killing the bosses before they kill you. Then there's general progression. You're stuck and nothing left to do in the room. What are you supposed to do? You're supposed to send your ship to attack ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS. How stupid does Samus need to be to send her ship to get blown up by attacking anti-aircraft guns. It tells you 2 or 3 times even before you decide to be **** that those are big guns and you need to disable them first. So. Stupid. What makes me absolutely. ABSOLUTELY. Hate this game is the fact that you can go into a timed corruption mode and STRAIGHT UP GAME OVER in states where you can't stop it in time. Like during a morph ball in the middle of an area you cannot unmorph. CAUSING YOU TO LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS. It wouldn't be so bad if the progress didn't involve me wrestling with the controls for 20 minutes. Staring at the stupid grapple point waving my nunchuk like a madperson and Samus doing **** all is absolutely infuriating. Everyone who told me this was a good game for the last 13 years lied to me.. + Awesome Visuals Story Voices Controls Amazing Graphics for Wii Boss fights Soundtrack - Sometimes you don't know what to do.. ok after the small dissapointment of the sequel, this is better, however I miss that ""I am alone"" feeling. A good game, just sin to pretend to be just as free as the others being a little more linear than the others but just as fully enjoyable and giving you the freedom to go wherever you want. Sadly the hyper mode is completely OP, I recommend not taking full advantage of it but in high difficulties it is almost mandatory that you learn to master it.. I was very excited to play this, my first metroid game, following the reviews but it's really quite awful. Janky gameplay, TERRIBLE motion controls that make a first person shooter feel like you are constantly controlling a drunk chimp. Bad sound effects.... could be useful as a sleeping aid.. Playing this on the Metroid Prime: Trilogy has shown me how good the Metroid series is. It is the latest we have in terms of new console Metroid games, and it holds up amazingly, This game has some of the best sense of atmosphere ever, and it has an incredibly designed Metroidvania world and fun FPS combat. This game is simple and makes you happy as you solve puzzles, fight monsters, and discover more and more of this interconnected world. I have no idea why I thought this game was weird when I was younger. After recently playing through the game, I found that this was one of the Wii gems that people will talk about as one of the most successful games on the console. There's only two problems I have. The first, is that the Gamecube controlled much better for first person games. The controls for the Wii remote are much too sensitive, and pointing towards the sensor for so long tires out your arm. My second issue with the game is how easy to get lost. The game is so much fun, and the exploration is never ending, unless you get lost. In an exciting Nintendo action game such as this one, the only filler between action is usually puzzles. Well this one holds true to that, with the exception of walking around aimlessly until you just look up the walkthrough. Don't let these issues deter you from the game though, as they are very minor as to how much fun and satisfaction this game provides with its action shooting and optional item searching. I only highlighted the two issues as most of my review as warning of what to be weary about, so you can enjoy this fantastic throwback game without interruption.. Now, I will admit I am somewhat Bias, as I grew up on the Prime Games, and so they hold a lot of nostalgia for me. That being said, I didnât fall in love with them for nothing, they are absolute MASTERPIECES, Corruption being no exception. My âfavoriteâ in the Trilogy has changed and flip flopped a lot over the years, and that is because they all have their own charm, and each game is unique and canât really be compared to the other 2. Prime 1 is respectable because of itâs impact and how impressive of a feat it was to translate a previously 2D franchise into a 3D game. Prime 2: Echoes is respectable for its challenge and originality, including so many mechanics absent from the first game you simply canât compare them, they really are two different games, not just slightly varied parallels. As for Prime 3:Corruption, well... this one is on a whole new level. That doesnât mean itâs better in every way however, as there are small aspects it doesnât quite nail the way the first two did, but those are really just nitpicks, and it does just about everything else better than the first two, so just because it isnât perfect doesnât mean it isnât a 10/10 game, because it is. The only complaints about this game I can really agree with (and even then theyâre extremely nit-picky) are that the music isnât as immersive and âMetroidyâ and the cinematic cutscenes and voice acting take away from the experience slightly. While I do agree with the music-related opinions (although I do like Bryyoâs Music quite a lot, and Bryyo in general as well), I personally like the cinematics, and I think they are part of what makes this game unique in a trilogy where core-gameplay is generally the same. This game feels big, like a finale to a grand show thatâs garnered millions of watchers and is now writing a love letter to its fans, while also accommodating its new-comers. Prime 3 is interesting because it was made for everyone. Yes, this was the Metroid game made for everyone (despite what itâs rating says), because itâs just easy enough for new players but hard enough for old-time fans, not too easy like Prime 1 (which isnât an easy game, but is undeniably the least difficult in the trilogy), not too hard like Prime 2 (which to this day has been known to be excessively hard but incredibly rewarding), but just right. Also, like the reviews have all said already, the Wii Remote aiming system is a stroke of genius! The aiming in this game is so fluid (even more so if you turn on the âadvanced sensitivityâ setting which allows for an even more immersive experience), and using the Wii Remote to aim makes you really feel like YOU ARE the bounty hunter (not that the first two didnât, but the GameCube controls more often than not at least make ME feel like Iâm controlling Samus and not like I am her). Iâm trying to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible for a 12 year old game, but even without spoiling the plot or upgrades you acquire, or any of the games exclusive mechanics, there is so much to talk about itâs incredible! Thereâs an Impressive slew of new weapons and (not a spoiler but) some old ones return, and the games creativity is off the charts, fully taking advantage of itâs new hardware and doing things the other games couldnât even if they wanted to. Prime 2 is NOT, I repeat NOT, a clone of Prime 1, but it was released only 2 years after its predecessor, so they had to keep some things the same. It still doesnât remotely feel like the first game, but there are similarities, like missiles looking the same (which doesnât matter), the arm cannon animations look the same (again, doesnât matter), and some enemies are given different names but are identical to enemies in the first installment (meh.. might matter slightly, but it doesnât take away from the experience). Why do I bring this up? Well, to show you how much of a re-imagining Prime 3 is of the original formula. Graphically the game is a major step up (and this series is already known for having incredible graphics in the first place, Prime looking like a PS2.5 level game but being a GameCube exclusive) from the others, and honestly anything after it as well (for the most part, admittedly Other M shines with its Human-Models in a way the Prime games never learned how), with stunning visuals and incredibly smooth animations. I could go on and on, but I donât wanna ruin it for you, Just go play the game! Or if you want the full story, play them in order for a truly grueling but insanely memorable and epic experience unlike anything todayâs games have to offer. The Prime Trilogy is gaming at its finest, and you can take that to the bank.. Compared to Metroid Prime 2, the score of 9 is maintained. New controls balance the saturation factor and once again great music and planetary artistic style.. 8.8 - Still another really good sequel, but the environments were not as varied like Prime 1 and 2. Also, the soundtrack could have been better, but the bosses, enemies, and level designs were still on par.. Metroid Prime 3 takes the franchise in some bad directions and not only includes much more character interaction but makes the dialogue infantile and stupid. I can see how 3 might be seen as paving the way for Other M. But it's still worth a play for Metroid fans. (copied from my trilogy review). Without a doubt my favorite of the trilogy with prime 1 coming in very close at second. I found the motion controls very easy to get used to and the story was fantastic. An absolutely great way to end the prime trilogy.. This game is a very rare gem indeed. It is not often I play a game that is basically without flaws, but this one comes close to perfection. I honestly can't think of a single negative aspect about it. The graphics are mind-blowing, Retro Studios used an extremely clever art-style that just doesn't seem to age at all. The game-play is just pure bliss, everything from the clever level-design & puzzles, to the amazing boss-battles and sense of exploration. Well done Retro Studios & NIntendo, you've released a very rare gem.. Super buggy. I've never had a Nintendo game I had to reset as many times as this one just because scripted events failed to start, or doors that are locked when they shouldn't be. Controls: There is no reason this game couldn't have gamecube controller support like the previous two. I absolutely hate the motion-controlled aiming. The game also suffers from forced motion control gimmicks, with plenty of switches that require you to do unnecessary movements with the controller. Why let the player just press A to activate a switch when we can make them rotate the controller for no reason a few times instead?. Controls are fantastic. Another one knocked out of the park for the greatest video game franchise of all time. It's a shame I don't give 10s. This is a 9.5, though.. Good third part which was developed for the Wii. The control is optimal and the graphics just fine. A good conclusion to the trilogy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------. Easily one of the best games on the Wii and also one of the best looking ones by far. While not the most open world Prime game, this game has a great soundtrack, a good story, amazing visuals for the Wii, an almost unparalleled atmosphere of being alone in space and very clever puzzles. While not perfect, it's a must buy for any Wii owner as it's one of the best games on the system.. Metroid Prime 3 Corruption is the best Wii game. It is incredibly atmospheric and immersive, with well designed areas that make for amazing exploration. It is filled with lore that is interesting to read, ups the replay value and makes the series universe more interesting. The boss fights are a definite high point as they are all challenging but not frustrating and are just plain fun. This game is a must-have for all Wii owners.. It takes back what the original made so great, since Prime 2 was a bit slower and weird, and adds great and unique controls. This is a gem only possible on Wii. Level design and concept is awesome. Boss battle and missions are memorable. If you had this game, you're a lucky gamer.. Metroid Prime 3 is one of the best games both the wii and the Metroid series has to offer. The game takes full advantage of the wii's motion controls and it works like a charm. The gameplay is your standard explore and investigate the planet Prime game. Except this time, the game has much more emphasis on shooting things and hyper- mode. Hyper mode is a state where Samus can use her Phazon tanks to make her self much more powerful. This game also has three planets for you to explore, each one playing and feeling different. The games graphics are what you would expect from the prime series, amazing. The look of the P.E.D. suit looks very nice and the planets, especially Elysia are breathtaking. The story is that Samus must destroy these meteors called Leviathan seeds on each planet. It's a basic story but it is in no way bad. Overall though the games highlight is the gameplay. Scanning and exploring with the wii remote feels so much more immersive than a gamecube controller, and that is really saying something because the first two games were incredibly immersive. The only problem with this game is hyper mode, which makes the game to easy. This game is perfect if you are looking to get into the Metroid series and is a perfect game to start out with.. Metroid Prime 3 is one of the few reasons I'm glad I owned a Wii, what a breath taking experience. The Boss battles are definitely the set piece for this game and where some of the most fun I have had in a long time. Metroid Prime 3 is a great game to end of the Prime Trilogy. The graphics are slick and detailed, the planets are all unique and well designed, and the new control scheme is very intuitive. This is one of the few games that shows of the wii-mote's capabilities successfully, allowing for a point a shoot style of gameplay that works very well. One very cool addition in the game was the inclusion of voice acting. It helps make the various characters you interact with more interesting while not intruding on the personality of Samus, as she still remains silent (cough cough OTHER M cough cough). This really is a fantastic FPS and an excellent Metroid game. It's worth every penny.. This is a fantastic conclusion to the Metroid Prime series. Excellent gameplay, loveable new hunters and an intriguing story. This game even gives us creepy atmosphere almost like what Dead Space tried to do. Love this game, however I think it could've been a bit longer. Otherwise this game is a must play.. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is the best game in the Metroid Prime Series in terms of graphics, controls and music. And the story line is a very good way to end the Metroid Prime series. This is a must own, especially with Metroid fans.. Just for the record i have no CoD or BF cause I hate fps but Metroid Prime makes me happy where i play **** looks perfect has great controls and such a Good story. the final part of the metroid story comes to a close and classy looking style on the wii that is about the only thing that they have got right about this game, it is very pretty as the landscapes and space stations morph and shimmer around you it is a very encompassing FPS, and the soundtrack just oozes atmosphere but that us where the good stops and the annoying takes over. the control system althought quite logical is infuriating to use,there isnt enough things to shoot at for long phases of the game and then they dump an entire levels worth of aliens on you in one go and wonder why you die the map screens are hopeless and almost completely useless annd the puzzle sections are more like point and click stlye games where there is no logic to them its more a case of try everything that you have got until one of them works hopelessly overated,terribley annoying to play,avoid at all costs. Given that I'm only allowed to rate games by increments of one, I gave this a 10 because it is closer to a 10 than a 9 IMO(I would personally give it around a 9.6 or so). Metroid Prime 3 is an incredible experience from start to finish, combining the series' signature elements of exploration and adventure with an easier to follow plot structure and some new characters. One of my favorite parts of Corruption is that it has several plot lines for you to follow. There is the main one, that concerns Dark Samus and her attempt to overrun the galaxy with Phazon, but there are also side stories that one can discover by the same scanning mechanic that was included in Prime and Echoes which allows for people to learn about planets that one visits and and the civilizations that lived there. You are given the choice as to whether you want to explore and find out more about these civilizations without missing out on the main plot of the game, which works very well. Moving onto the gameplay, the Wii controls work wonders. While a lack of some extra buttons are noticeable at times, particularly in the selecting visors department, being able to point, aim, shoot, and turn so effortlessly is a dream come true. There is a learning curve to this, and you may wish that you had the old GC controls back for a while, but in the end, it works very well. Hypermode is the other new addition to the game, and it allows for a lot of experimentation with gameplay. Particularly in the higher difficulties, you will have to learn how to manipulate its invincibility and corrupted states in order to survive, which allows for an added layer of strategy onto an already very cerebral adventure game. Exploration and adventure are still out in front in this game, which means if you didn't like the original Prime, you won't like this one, either. If you did, or if you haven't played Prime but like games such as Okami, Zelda, or Darksiders, you'll definitely enjoy this.. Wow, do I ever love this game! The art design is transcendent, transporting the player to beautiful, wondrous worlds that feel truly alien and unique.Combat is awesome---- strategic, precise, and deep. Oh, those boss fights!! As you progress, scanning lore deepens a compelling story that unfolds in unexpected and unforgettable ways.Finally and maybe most importantly, I really like the refreshingly cerebral quality of this game; it constantly challenges you to think, analyze, and solve its myriad puzzles and mysteries. One of my all-time favorites. Retro, you gotta make another one!. This game is awesome, good controls, good graphics and plot, but is not perfect like the first prime game. The new thing in this game is voice acting: some charachters voice are good, but others ****. The new space ship is awesome and the new hyper-mode is nice.. great game i love metroid games........i also love metroid fusion,prime two echoes, prime hunters, and other m........people say that the wii **** whats with that honestly....i think the wii has a chance against the xbox360 **** wii though is liked a lot though.......people normally says that the wii doesnt have as great **** sometimes that is true but they habe good graphics thereal games nintendo makes themselves or the games they own.....also people complain how tje wii has poor shooting **** there ok with a classic controller.....also unlike xbox360 and ps3 you can move **** sadly the wii isnt better then the **** the wii has gamecube on it for people who like to use regular **** last reason why everyone sys the wii **** is because they dont have enough good games?!?......THATS A **** your one of the xbox360 owners you have no room to talk you may have some of the greatest games but you only have halo games, fable trilogy, and call of duty games........here are some of the greatest games for the wii in my opinion......metroid prime 3 corruption...metroid other m...zelda twilight princess....mario kart....mario super sluggers....mario and sonic at tje winter olympics.....kirby retirn to dreamland....kirbys epic yarn....metroid prime 2 echoes....metroid prime....star fox assault....star fox adventures....metal gear the twin snakes....super smash bros brawl and melee....super mario bros **** the mario party **** the mario galaxy games....donkey kong country return....thse are only my favorite tiles and they already out gun what the xbox360 has to **** know what i can say to you xbpx people that hate the wii here is some obvious compareing to do with these two **** xbox360 breaks easly and heats **** the wii doesnt break as easily proof ive had my wii for almost four years and ive had zero pronlems and my wii still works lome brand **** also what you get on the wii you have to pay for on the xbox 360 such as the internet use the online connection **** wii and the xbox360 both hve downlodablw games however the wii offers gamecube to back it up as **** opinion of **** its fun and worht the **** some games are not childish just look at the game im rating....long live nintendo long live nintendo long live nintendo.....either ways im giving this game a 9 because i find myself bored fter beating this game a couple times........long live nintendo long live nintendo long live nintendo...... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ah Metroid, what an amazing series. Ever since the SNES days, I have loved this franchise and when I found out that Metroid was going 3-D with a new ""Prime"" printed afterwards, I was excited. And sure enough they managed to pull it off. Even things like the grappling hook which I initially thought they would butcher, they did perfectly. Truly one of the best video game franchises in the market. I have played and enjoyed Metroid Prime and Prime 2: Echoes a lot. And now, this is my review of Metroid Prime 3: Gameplay: Amazing. It follows the same Metroid formula where you're in a first-person mode with you gun pointing out and pressing A to shoot. But with motion controls, the experience is better. With the Wii Remote, you can move the gun around in circles or in any other direction. It's as if the Wii Remote IS the gun itself and your Samus Aran shooting the pirates. It's a great experience. You can also go in your ship and play around with some of the features in it. However I just find myself going from one point to another with it. You can't control the ship, but it's still nice to see what's inside. The bosses are very challenging and very engaging. If you're new to the series, you will be in for one challenging adventure. Even me, being a veteran, found this game to be a tad difficult on easy mode. And on ****'s just good luck since this difficulty level really tests your skills. VERY challenging game. Throughout the game you get power-ups like the grappling hook and various different guns, and using these new power-ups is fun. 9.7/10 Story: Great. Quoted from **** ""After the events of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, the Galactic Federation contacts Samus Aran to investigate a malfunctioning network computer known as the Aurora Unit. The Federation believes the Space Pirates have infected the Aurora Unit with a virus. Subsequently, the Space Pirates attack one of the Federation's bases and begin to overrun the Federation's defenses. Samus, along with Bounty Hunters Ghor, Rundas, and Gandrayda, must work together to stop the siege, repair the Aurora Unit, and defeat enemies from the past game."" The story is engaging and it's interesting listening to the dialog of the characters. 9/10 Music: Beautiful. Like the previous Prime games, the music will not disappoint. It is very well done and fits in with each scenario. The boss battles, like Rundas's theme or the classic Ridley theme, are truly breathtaking and make you want to slow down when fighting the bosses, just to hear these scores. My personal favorite track in this game is the Skytown music. Sometimes I find myself just turning the game on, flying to that place, and just relaxing as the music plays. The music gets a 10/10 Graphics: Amazing, especially for Wii standards. By improving the Prime 1 and 2 graphics a bit, Nintendo has created worlds that are beautiful and breathtaking. The cutscenes are nice and the overall look to the game is very inviting. 10/10 Characters and Voice acting: I liked the characters. The three other bounty hunters look very cool and have their own, unique powers. They accompany you on Norion to stop a meteorite from collapsing and then are later turned against you and gone to different locations because of Dark Samus. The fights with the other bounty hunters are amazing and challenging. And it is really sad to see them die at the hands of Dark Samus after you have defeated them. The aurora unit is a nice character that tells you what to do. But the one character that I cannot stand is Admiral Dane. His voice bugs me to no end. Yes, they have voice acting in this game, and for the most part it's not bad, but when it comes to Admiral Dane, it's just annoying. I don't know why, but I just can't stand him. 9/10 Overall, this game is marvelous. I recommend it to any gamer out there who is up for a first-person action/adventure game. Metroid fans will not be disappointed.. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy, the graphics are among the best on the console, and the point and shoot gameplay is mostly perfect, although this game won't soot everybody, and it lacks replay value, I suggest you buy this game.. Honestly, it doesn't feel as polished as 2 and 1 were, but it's still very fun to play. Some areas are definitely boring, and the game could do without voice acting. New hunters are very cool, story is also good. Controls are top notch again, feel very precise. Graphically, it pushes the Wii very far, it's one of those games that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to be visually impressive. (Unlike The Conduit.) Lore is a bit weaker, but it's still very interesting. Definitely a good closeup for the Prime series. Has more pros than cons, so it get's a 9. No less, no more.. Metroid Prime stunned audiences back in 2002 with some of the best visuals the gamecube had to offer, excellent gameplay, and an amazing story all in one bundle. Probably the best game for the gamecube. Metroid Prime 2 came out sometime thereafter and was good, but not nearly as good because the story just didn't quite fit. Now we have Metroid Prime 3: Corruption which has changed the MP formula a lot (both good and bad ways). So this review will probably take a little longer to plow through. Story wise, MP3 is back to form, in a way. It's not MP1 material (i.e. story takes a back seat setting up the scene and let's you figure it out as you go along). But it isn't bad. This game comes with its own cutscenes and I want to say this is the first game to include voice acting in the series. So Retro and Nintendo are really experimenting with the brand to see what sticks and what doesn't. While I'm not turned off by the voice acting addition, I feel like maybe they're trying to make Metroid more cinematic than it really needs to be. Why can't it be more akin to Half-Life where you stay in first person when the cutscenes take place, or is that asking for too much? But the story isn't bad. It takes elements from the first two games and explains them all so you know what the real problem has always been. You also have bounty hunter allies who, obviously, will turn on you later in the game. Which, I feel, is a bit short sighted on Nintendo's part. They could have been useful for universe expanding in future titles or multiplayer modes. Instead, they are just redshirts and nothing more. I especially liked Ghor's ability to meld with machinery because that's something I don't see every day. Metroid's and pirates play a much later role in this game than before (especially the pirates as you get to visit their homeworld). Ridley is back with a vengeance, making Samus reconsider the idea of a restraining order. And even Dark Samus is back because why the hell not? A lot is going on and you are the only phazon corrupted bounty hunter who doesn't go insane, so you have to do it all. Game play is different from previous games as this is on the Wii. and I feel like this is probably (to this day) the best FPS game the wii has to offer in terms of controls. It feels like a mouse-keyboard setup and that's probably the best way to have your FPS feel like so you can be more accurate. However, I feel like this game didn't try hard enough to challenge me. Unlike Prime 1 or 2, it took me only a weekend to beat it and I was on vacation with the family. If I found enough free time to pull it off then and still beat it, then the game is just too easy. But then I'm back to my MP1 complaint about the lack of a hard-mode from the get-go. The environments look better than ever and the variety of enemies (ranging from pirates, to lizards, to machines, to golems, and to other hunters) really gives the gameplay a lot of variety and also just makes it look far more appealing than shooting the same three or four dudes and bugs for three hours. I'd say that this isn't better than the first, but it overtakes the second. Metroid Prime 3 is probably one of the better games for the Wii and one of the better games overall. Worth buying it if you haven't yet.. This had got to be the best wii game in terms of graphi",Adapted for the Wii the game feels great. Aiming with the remote feels intuitive and smooth . the great level of design and world-building is still present . the music still is amazing. just a great game to finish this incredible trilogy .
348.Flight Simulator 2002,"This is the game that introduced me to flight simulation in the first place. It's where I learned to taxi, takeoff, and land, and the realism of this game stands up well to other flight simulators, even today. Although I've since migrated to FSX, I still come back to play this one every so often simply because of the realism factor, and of course, nostalgia. It has also aged relatively well compared to other games from the time, and if that's not good enough there's still a great selection of addons to choose from that add new aircraft, airports, and scenery, among other things. If you can't afford to purchase Flight Simulator X, I'd say use this version.","if you can't afford to purchase Flight Simulator X, I'd say use this one . there's still a great selection of addons to choose from that add new aircraft, airports, and scenery ."
349.Monster Hunter: World,"Finally a next gen Monster hunter. Brings everything we were craving for, better maps, no loading between zones, new monsters and top notch graphics. All the interaction with monsters are also a great improvement. worst game of all time, its insane how they make a game this bad. i cant believe it. This was my introduction to the Monster Hunter franchise .Though I do see some glaring flaws in certain aspects of the design, it is still one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had from a franchise in which I had more recently discovered. Very excited for MH Wilds.. The game falls short in many areas but fails, most notably due to the poorly implemented cooperative feature. The game designers clearly do not understand how to create a proper cooperative experience in modern gaming. Itâs a frustrating experience to spend countless hours navigating an overloaded tutorial only to find a lackluster and cumbersome cooperative mode. The game focuses on a single-player experience, while the collaborative aspect is an afterthought.. This was my introduction to the Monster Hunter franchise other than a demo I played on the Nintendo DS years and tears ago. Though I do see some glaring flaws in certain aspects of the design, it is still one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had from a franchise in which I had more recently discovered. Very excited for MH Wilds.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. really boring compare to mhgenu,im not really sure what caused it,maybe the combat/monster/map or overall gameplay,its just not that enjoyable,30 hours and never want to go back again,(i spent 200 hours on mhgenu). The best entry in the Monster Hunter series, fixing the shortcomings of the older entries, and very friendly to new players as well. I really need to stop myself from playing these kind of rpg games. I can never wrap my head around the mechanics, and there's always too much information to cram into my pea brain. Graphics are great, every design is unique and spectacular, and palicos are the best thing to grace this planet. However, gameplay falls a bit flat in my opinion. It basically just feels like chipping away at something, running after it, then repeating the cycle about three times. It makes the experience feel slightly hollow. It's a critically acclaimed game, so i do reccomend it, but know what you're getting into first.. Monster Hunters: World is a game of dream for me personally, and here's why: 1. It's not too easy. You need skills for at least ONE weapon to finish the story, but that's not the end. 2. You barely touch the core of the game, if you don't want any specific gears or want to master a few more weapons JUST FOR FUN! 3. Costumes and weapons are amazing to get. You can finish story with only Defender set to get to Icebourne quickly, but you'll miss the beauty of this game. The depth of each maps are BEAST! I'm now farming for specific weapons just because it's beautiful and gonna be fun to use. Believe it or not, regular gamers are still there both new comers and repeaters. I guess tens of thousands daily including Iceborne players, they're really loving the game. (Imagine they're all coming together at it's peak, hundred of thousands) Don't be afraid to LINGER in this game, people still do that single-handedly or with friends/strangers. MHW is a MMORPG with the quality players behind. It used to be expensive, but not anymore. Ps. I'm not in a hurry to skip everything to Iceborne, as there are some costumes I would love to get (and it's hard hahaha). Slow-comers are welcome, it's not a pay to win game.. It's fun to take down mobs in co-op, it's fun to take down mobs while struggling alone, and it's fun to farm one mob well to take down the next.. the core gameplay loop is extremely fun to the point that it made me want to do side missions which i rarely do. i really enjoyed playing the game solo in the first half of the game, after a point the monsters became more complex so they were enjoyable from the skill challenge but the raw HP and time needed to kill them made it a slog, so I invited people through the SOS group gameplay of up to 4 people, that turned out to be extremely fun too, reminded me of the borderlands/last remnant type of game play. there are many janky moments which can cause lots of frustration but the positives of being in such a magical yet realistic feeling world taking down progressively bigger and badder monsters, and using their gear to get stronger, is an experience that cant be understood unless you have gotten into the loop. the story is straight-up awful but this game isnt about the story, the story is just an engine to introduce you to this world of distinct monsters with their own personalities and traits.. Great game! The best Monster Hunter game, and none of the review bombing will change that!. Monster Hunter: World, developed and published by Capcom, stands as a monumental achievement in the action role-playing genre. As the fifth mainline installment in the series, this game redefined what it means to hunt formidable monsters in a vast, interconnected **** game transports players to the ""New World,"" an untamed land brimming with monstrous creatures. You assume the role of a Hunter, tasked with studying and subduing these beasts. The gameplay revolves around preparing for and engaging in thrilling hunts, where success yields valuable loot for crafting powerful weapons and armor.What sets World apart is its accessibility without compromising the series' core mechanics. Capcom masterfully leveraged modern console capabilities to create a visually stunning environment teeming with life. The graphics are a standout feature, pushing the boundaries of what fans expected from a Monster Hunter title.Gameplay is where Monster Hunter: World truly shines. The combat mechanics are deep and engaging, allowing for varied playstyles through a diverse arsenal of weapons. Each weapon type feels distinct, offering a wealth of strategic options. The progression loop of crafting gear from monster parts to tackle tougher challenges is addictive, rewarding players for their **** notable aspect is the introduction of new monsters, showcasing impressive design and behavior. These creatures are the stars of the show, each presenting unique challenges and memorable encounters. The thrill of facing off against these behemoths is unmatched in the series.While the story may not be the game's strongest suit, the captivating gameplay and breathtaking visuals compensate for any narrative shortcomings. The multiplayer experience is also commendable, with seamless online play that enhances cooperative hunting.However, one blemish in an otherwise stellar experience is the handler character, who can be polarizing due to her personality and role within the game. Despite this minor flaw, Monster Hunter: World remains a must-play title for action RPG **** summary, Monster Hunter: World is a triumph, successfully bridging the gap between appealing to a broader audience while satisfying longtime fans. Its blend of engaging gameplay, impressive graphics, and exhilarating monster encounters make it a standout entry in the Monster Hunter series and a standout title in modern gaming.. Very good game even in 2024. Good graphic, music, boss fight, mechanic I.e.. This is the worst game I've ever played. Absolute pile of steaming garbage. Every mechanic is designed to intentionally annoy the heck out of the player. I've never seen a game go out of its way to be so obnoxious before. 8 hours of actual gameplay with 40 hours of padding making you chase 1 enemy around for 30 minutes that has an obscene amount of health. Don't waste your time with this trash.. I hated most Monster Hunter games, but World is actually pretty solid. This game does a better job of easing new players into it compared to other titles, and combat has weight behind it. Visually, this game is stunning. The world design is solid, though it does suffer from being too samey with game modes/mission variety, and some performance issues.. My favorite game with an animal cruelty simulator attached to it. PETA is seething right now and I can feel it.. Better than expected! It can be a lot getting into monster hunter for the first time, the franchise has its quirks. But it was 100% worth it to learn, and i will be playing the next generation of mhw games. Side note: Capcom did a good job with sf6 too. Generally a quality company for games.. Great game, but performance suffers on PS4. If you have a PC and can play at 60fps, go for that instead. Still, the gameplay loop and graphics is good on console, and I recommend getting Iceborne DLC to add much more replayablity.. After years of outdated visuals on rather underperforming hardware, I was really excited when sequel of my favorite video game franchise had been anounced for modern hardware and boy did it deliver. Monster Hunter is not for everybody, but I just loved every second of this game. The visuals, the soundtrack, improved gameplay and the amount of content make it absolutely worth its money for fans of the series.. This game is one of the best ps4 games for sure. If you want to start MH serie, start with this !.

Best MH game ever. Best maps, best controls, best graphics. Congratz Capcom and Ryozo Tsujimoto. Although it's not my usual cup of tea, I enjoyed Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii but despite the upgraded visuals, I found this instalment uninvolving and repetitive. Explore, gather loot, kill a boss monster, rinse and repeat. And repeat. And repeat. Without a coherent narrative it just feels like an endless level grind.. Amazing game, sensational and very well done. It was a lot of fun to play... This game is just not for me. I don't like how hard you need to grind for the most smallest of upgrades. Just makes the game progress way too slow for me, at which point it's no longer fun for me to continue playing.. Riveting moment-to-moment gameplay, from quiet stalking to action-packed hunting, is ultimately held back by a ton of grinding. I had fun for a while but ultimately burnt out on progressing.. I love this game and amazing story and excellent graphic and lot action and good day. Very beautiful graphics, great gameplay and a lot of things to discover. Tons of fun!. That was my firsts experience playing a MH and it catch in a few minutes, a wonderful world with amazing creatures in a beautiful environment, each hour that I spent playing that game was remarkable. 20 minutes into playing a game and it's still not able to play the game. Super slow tutorial and way too much unskippable dialogue. Games that don't let you skip cutscenes should be illegal and banned. If I want to watch a movie, I'll go watch a movie. If I want to play a game, I want to play a game. Don't make me watch a movie instead of playing my game. And don't stop me from playing a game by making me watch a movie.. Monsters are too hard. Equipment is too weak. They move too slowly. Collecting materials and traces is a hassle.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was my first Monster Hunter Game, and I really enjoyed it. It is a good game to play with your friends, is entertaiting to grow together and capture all the monsters that are spread on the world. There are a few that are amazing, have a good movements and allow you to enjoy while killing them. A nice game to play with your friends.. The gameplay is very entertaining and you have quite a handful of weapons to choose from if you feel bored of playing with one, the music and graphics are good, there's a lot of good content specially in the post game, but during the main misions the game sometimes forces you to boring investigation missions. The story is rather bad and boring, but even with this flaws it still is very enjoyable game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a great game to begin with but its weaker than MHGU for me. Well from graphical stand point, it's no doubt to be that good and it's quite dense and big as well for only 1 map. Yes, the map is dense but that makes exploring the world quite confusing, so many vegetations and other thing that obstruct how you view the world (not the map). Well, you'll memorize it by the end of it but it's easier to explore around in GU dan in World. And, any herbs, honey, etc. is hardly noticeable because they blend in with the world which is a great one but I hardly collect enough because I keep missing it. Yes, you got the help from scoutfly to locate each one of them but there comes another problem which is lighting of the game is not consistent which mostly makes me lost track of the scoutfly that locate certain object. Speaking of map, the icon of the map seems washed out. I don't know if I can mess around about it in the setting but so far, I didn't find any solution for this. That icon really helpful thou to locate certain object to collect for your Quest. The palico also rarely help you when you get stunned or electrified but they did heal you a lot in battle. Well, I still do prefer to get smacked by my palico when I'm stunned or electrified. Last, it's my preferences but MHW seems to weakened most of their monsters. Like I met Rathalos on GU when I unlock the 5 stars village Quest and I got stun a lot as well as burned. In MHW, I encounter him when I'm on a mission to hunt down Pukei-Pukei (the 3rd Quest I believe). I kinda of hesitant but decided to engage in combat. Turns out, I'm winning without even healing at all. Cutting tail also way easier in MHW than GU. To be honest, this affects the satisfaction kind of feel that I hardly get from World. Overall I do enjoy the game but GU still a better game in my opinion which makes me keep coming back to GU more than World.. The game seems dog **** in my early impressions of it, but the main problem here is that it cannot be paused, even when playing solo. I envy people who have such a lack of responsibility that they can commit to playing games without interruption that regularly, but sadly I have a life and need to be able to pause games from time to time.. A great game. Beautiful world filled with different environments. Great mechanics and monsters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Beautiful game and beautiful world and design not bog not lag not crash .... If your a die hard monster hunter fan you will probably love this game. If not you will still enjoy it. My Experience with this game was that I enjoyed it for a short while. Fun gameplay well designed map, the story was fairly intriguing. The monsters themselves were incredibly fun to fight. If it had kept going this way it would easily be a 9-10 game. BUT the **** GRINDING completely ruined this game. Fighting the same monster 50 times just so you donât get 1 shot is just tedious and made me put the game down.. Way too good to describe here, but it gets Extremely hard and unfun in the dlc This games skill curve is so high, but it is a good game I wouldn't recommend it, but i also do. this is truly worth playing All the monsters, i love them, my spiky boy is the best, and always will be. Nergigante makes this game memorable But that stupid underbite dragon ruined it. and so i kind of quit. Iceborne is a cool distraction. You got the number one is back home lol but it was not meant in your life too lol I love that it doesnât. I love this game this was my first Monster Hunter title but its just so catchy and has such good lore. All i can say from what i have seen and played it's the best Monster Hunter tite that was released. I think there could have beenn some more older monster from earlier games thats why im only giving it a 9/10 but its just amazing.. Lot of thing to hate in this game but after putting 100+ hours in it i can understand why it is loved.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. No other game had ever kept me playing beyond 100 hours since Pokemon when I was a kid and Skyrim, but the latter never past the 200 hours point, and even at 350 hours I still want to enjoy this game more. I can only describe it as a perfect game which achieves its goals flawlessly.. What a journey this game is. Is a game with lots of complicated mechanics, with very good and different weapons that are very hard to master, but once you get it, it gets really addictive. Beautiful and very distinctive environments and exceptional monster design. And it is as good to play solo, as coop. Thanks Capcom for a master piece!. MHW is disapponiting from the prospective of a fan. The game feels like a proof of concept honestly, sure its pretty, but it lacks what made the previous games good, substance. You know how disappointed i was playing the game after the MASTERPIECE that was MH4 a few years earlier? The answer is very disappointed. New designs range from mediocre to excellent, on one hand you have fights like bazelguese and vaal hazak, on the other you have radobaan... The roaster is also pretty mediocre and repetitive Weapon designs are bad, straight up bad. Like, really? We go from a **** DRILL HAMMER to a bit of a monster slapped on a bene weapon. The combat is excellent as always. The endgame is ok, pretty boring. Good game, but pretty lacking in some areas. Starting this review with a disclaimer that this game is clearly not for me. It is not a bad game by any means, and seems most who enjoy the game are fans of the series. However, as much as I wanted to like this game, I could not get into it. The combat felt clunky and the grind felt repetitive (which I don't mind in some games, like Nioh or Diablo, when I am into the combat system). Additionally, the co-op felt poorly implemented for playing story content with friends -- seems like co-op is better left for post-story content. The world felt living and impressive but there were too many quirks to the game that took me out of the game and I couldn't fully enjoy the experience because of it.. Good lord what a trash game. Thereâs absolutely no story line the story itself is not engaging at all its boring. The combat is clunky and flawed you lose stamina in battle and cant move so you just get hit or you get knocked down and hit repeatedly by the monster so you cant even get up to heal because youâre staggered. The entire game is just either hunting or capturing a monster and donât even get me started on how lame the capture mode is. The maps are tiny lame boring like everything else in this game everything felt so lazy. Save your moneu and your time i quit within a few days of playing because i kept feeling like i was wasting my time and getting frustrated with literally everything. TRASH. Best game I have ever played. The difficulty is balanced, and it's a very long game, which is a positive. Never gets boring, I can play this game for hours without breaks. Amazing graphics and breathtaking gameplay. You just feel such satisfaction when finally slaying a monster, and you feel like such a badass when you wear its bones and skin as armor. Each weapon feels different, each monster has a different weakness and every piece of armor has a different look and effect. What a special videogame this is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Awesome game with RPG gameplay optimized for multiplayer, my first monster hunter and it's definitely not going to be the last it got me good couldn't stop playing until I platinumed it very addictive from does games that can easily become your only game and the fact that its multiplayer makes it even better.. Capcom went in a different direction with this game, and it paid off. The more realistic style of the game really brought my attention to it, since I thought it fit more with this type of game than the overly cartoony style of the older games. The gameplay is great, many people call it clunky not realising that it's part of it, it's a way of punishing the player for making bad decisions and not having enough control of their skills and character movement. People don't complain about this with Dark Souls and such, why should they about Monster Hunter? The gameplay is satisfying, especially with friends, you have an enormous amount of monsters to fight, quests to do, and trophies to acquire. There's base decoration and endemic life collection which you can display, which was one of the must fun surprises I had with this game, some of the music can be quite nice, and while the story is passable, improving your gear and making different builds for monsters is super fun. I was going to say that I hoped Capcom would maybe make World a ""home console and PC"" spin-off and continue the main series on Nintendo portable consoles, but after seeing MH Rise... ehh please bring back World and stick to it, thank you.. Best game ever. I spent much more than 200 hours on it already. I just LOVE it. My first Monster Hunter game, was really looking forward to it (90 on metacritic! Damn, must be unreal!)...gave up after 4-5 hours. Just a convoluted mess. Menu, inventory and crafting system from hell. Gameplay was bland, nonsensical and not in the slightest bit interesting. Obviously just for Monster Hunter fans only. Only slightly less annoying than Vampyr, which was an absolute travesty.. While travelling to the âNew Worldâ, the Fifth Fleet is attacked by a huge Elder Dragon. After being rescued, and arriving at the base camp, the player fulfils their role as a Hunter defeating a variety of creatures whilst trying to find out more about the beast that attacked their fleet. Despite this being the fifth mainline instalment in the Monster Hunter series, it is the first Iâve played as Iâm generally not a fan of these types of loot based RPGs. With this being âfreeâ as part of the PlayStation collection I thought Iâd give it a go, but there was very little I enjoyed here. The game's core loop of crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down more difficult monsters is always going to be repetitive by its very nature, but if the gameplay is enjoyable enough this need not be any issue. Unfortunately however the combat is just as repetitive and, regardless of the monster youâve been tasked to kill, youâll spend an age hacking away until it runs and you have to chase it before hacking away again. Patience rather than skill seems to be all that is required... Of course, games like this are all about teaming up with other people, but Monster Hunter World is a let down in this regard as well. Having required the use **** to finally work out how to team up with a family member, we were still unable to play any of the story missions together because (for some inexplicable reason) you canât join each others game until youâve started a mission and watched any associated cut scenes! After this you can quit and restart the mission with other people, but itâs so time consuming I couldnât be bothered to do it most of the time. When all is said and done I realise this simply isnât the sort of game I enjoy, but based on this evidence, that wonât change any time soon.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Combat is pure clunky garbage, maybe it was good in 2004 or whatever. Uninstalled after 2 hours . Good thing it is free on ps5. Never gonna get near this franchise again.. Monster Hunter: World is by far the most polished and approachable entry in the Monster Hunter franchise. We can only hope the series stays this course. I would highly recommend Monster Hunter: World.. I remember playing Monster Hunter Tri on the Nintendo Wii when I was younger but I didn't know how to play the game, so I never got into the game/series. Monster Hunter: World is my first Monster Hunter game in a sense and it was an interesting experience, even though I didn't finish the story; it wasn't engaging at all and it's not an important part of the game anyway. The gameplay is fun though; there's a wide variety of different weapons, armor, items and playstyles to keep the gameplay loop - Hunt a monster -> Gather materials -> Craft new gear -> Repeat - stay exhilarating and deep. It can get a bit repetitive at times but it's very fun when you're hunting unique monsters; the highlight of Monster Hunter: World. The monsters are amazing! From their spectacular designs to the suspenseful confrontations, it's worth playing this game just for the monsters alone. The graphics are beautiful and the environments are absolutely stunning! Monster Hunter: World has some of the best looking environments I've seen in a videogame. Also, there's a lot of content in this game despite the grinding. Unfortunately for the gameplay though, the combat system and the controls are quite clunky. Pros: + Exciting and deep gameplay loop + Gorgeous environments and visuals + A lot of content + Monsters Cons: - Dated combat system & controls - Hunting monsters can get a bit repetitive in some instances Narrative: ?/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Content: 8/10 Characters: ?/10 Music: ?/10 Graphics/Audio: 9/10 Final Rating: 7.5/10 - Very Good - On one hand, Monster Hunter: World is a very enjoyable videogame experience; on the other hand, it feels like a chore to play. Overall, I'd say Monster Hunter: World is a good game, especially for fans of the series, however, it won't be everyone's cup of tea. Do I recommend it?: For fans, Monster Hunter: World is a must-play. For newcomers, it's not easy to get into the game but it's worth a try.. i have 1500 hours in Monster Hunter World absolute masterpiece Capcom has done great service to the fans with tons of free content the gameplay the combat the weapons it's all a masterpiece. Beautiful and rich maps Glorious monsters with superb animation Nice music A lot of armor sets and weapons Amazing game, the only con i can think is that it become a bit grindy with all the Low or High Rank stuff. It starts off with a trashy opening, and then after that 20 minutes things start looking really good! A jungle playground with fun and beautiful twists and turns, hunting a beast that runs away a couple times. It seems like the most alive game you've ever played! Then it starts showing it's MMO style seams, it starts to loose it's magic, and it makes you do the dumbest ""boss fight"" sequence you've ever done in a video game. The next area is beautiful, the coral area is very visually stunning, but actually getting around in it is annoying, just a bunch of loops, and by that time the MMO style has gotten to you. By this time I was getting mad that my weapon was better than even other ones I was upgrading a lot, and it turns out it's a special sword given to new players, along with your armor, that completely ruins the progression of leveling up your gear that the entire game is built on, who made this mind numbing decision really **** up! Seriously, if you can borrow a copy from a friend, play through the initial jungle area, it's level design feels next-gen, just not any other part of the game. Didn't like it at first cause I didn't get it. Got the game free with ps5 but o my word. Once I got it one of the best games I ever played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pcmr won .now cry you portable wierdoss Game is good its a raw improvement over older games and the weebs sould stop complain. those who say that the games was challenging or whatever.just no it wasn't it was just limited by developer budget and **** hardware. Thanks for the continuous update. But the more you progress, the more tired you get. I am not satisfied with the play that demands high control rather than the fun of destroying the enemy into the environment.. After playing 1300 hours and getting 100% ( platinum trophy). I can definitely say this is one of the best capcom games I have ever invested in. This game is definitely worth 60$ for tons of content it offers and it's very enjoyable with friends too.. It's overly long at times, and that's the biggest problem. I encount","the game falls short in many areas but fails, most notably due to the poorly implemented cooperative feature . it's a frustrating experience to spend countless hours navigating an overloaded tutorial only to find a lackluster and cumbersome cooperative mode . the best entry in the Monster Hunter series, fixing the shortcomings of the older entries, and very friendly to new players as well ."
35.Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn,"Aside from its gameplay and tech problems, Baldur's Gate 2 also misses the mark with its story. It feels all over the place, with flat characters and boring dialogue that don't make you care. The plot just doesn't have the depth or vibe of the original Baldur's Gate games, leaving you feeling disconnected from the world and its people. This game is a CRPG masterpiece that set the bar decades ago and still hasnât been topped! Itâs a love letter to D&D fans, created by a team who understood the source material perfectly. Avoid the ""enhanced"" edition - it dilutes the original charm with clunky additions and changes that miss the mark.. A very good game with a complex combat, deep story and interesting charackters. Do not let you held back by old looking graphics, you will no longer notecing it a few hours in.. This is the best game ever made. Frankly, it doesn't get any better than this and never will. This game is the perfect distillation of the efforts of a team of passionate and driven developers who understand and love the D&D and Forgotten Realms source materials. The collision of incredible writers, developers, musicians, voice actors and artists who made this game will likely never be achieved again. I keep coming back to this game over and over again after decades of playing other RPGs and finding nothing which ever comes close to this experience. If you purchase it now, try to find the non-""enhanced"" version, since Beamdog actually made the game worse in their efforts to ""enhance"" it by adding ""modern"" conveniences like unneeded quest markers and new companions which stick out like a sore thumb due to how poorly they were written. They also damaged the audio design by rearranging and deleting audio tracks, damaging the original ambiance of the game.. I feel a pang of sadness for the people who never got to experience this game when it was first released. The textbook definition of lightning in a bottle. It became the defining moment for western RPG's and set the bar going forward as it delivered on high quality voice acting, a stunning soundtrack, a large cast of party members, each with their own unique quirks and conflicts, and an insane amount of side quests and magic items. I spent more time replaying this game than I'd care to admit, but it's a banger through and through.. Top best heroic and high fantasy EVER MADE. Best companion of all series. Yes, BG2>BG3. BG2 have more cool companion than overrated BG3.. An absolute must-play, still an absolute highlight even after all these years.. Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn remains a timeless masterpiece in the realm of classic RPGs, delivering an unparalleled experience that continues to captivate players even years after its release. Developed by BioWare and released in 2000, this game set a standard for narrative depth, engaging gameplay, and intricate world-building that few titles have matched **** someone who fell in love with this game during my teenage years, I can attest to its enduring appeal. The story is nothing short of epic, weaving a complex tale of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism within the richly detailed Forgotten Realms setting. Every character, from companions to adversaries, is fleshed out with depth and personality, making interactions and choices feel meaningful and **** magic and combat systems in Baldur's Gate II are masterfully crafted. The spellcasting mechanics are deep and rewarding, allowing for a wide range of strategic options in battles. Whether unleashing devastating spells or coordinating party tactics, every encounter feels dynamic and challenging. The character development and progression system also contribute significantly to the game's longevity, offering players the freedom to customize their party members and **** of the game's standout qualities is its sheer scope. Baldur's Gate II is a massive adventure that demands time and dedication. Exploring the sprawling city of Athkatla and its surrounding regions feels like embarking on a true odyssey, filled with hidden treasures, memorable quests, and unexpected twists. The sense of accomplishment upon completing this epic journey is **** its time, Baldur's Gate II was groundbreaking, and its influence on the RPG genre is undeniable. Even today, it remains a benchmark for storytelling, character development, and immersive gameplay. For me, it's a definitive 10 out of 10, reflecting not just its quality at release but also its enduring impact on gaming culture. If you appreciate deep, narrative-driven RPGs, Baldur's Gate II: Shadow. This is one of the best CRPG-s ever made. I wish I could play it again for the first time.. Even I played at 2024, I think it is still quite playable and an iconic game for all times.. In addition to its technical and gameplay shortcomings, Baldur's Gate 2 also struggles to deliver a compelling narrative that resonates with players. The story feels disjointed and unfocused, with poorly developed characters and lackluster dialogue that fail to evoke any emotional investment from the player. The narrative lacks the depth and complexity that defined the original Baldur's Gate games, leaving players feeling disconnected from the world and its inhabitants.. Arghh why does the pacing of CRPGs need to be so goddamn glacial. Not my cup of tea... I never understood how ppl can play these games again and again and again for 100s of hours.. when it comes to ADND games BG2 is one of the best ever made with 100+ hours of gameplay and some of the best written stories bioware have ever done it is a must buy for every RPG fan. An absolute masterpiece, a huge milestone in cRPG and a game that even over 20 years later is still thrilling and amazing to go back to!. I clocked Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 thanks to a tight pause and quick save routine. **** like BG can do the isometric platform justice than all the better for it.. All time favourite rpg, it has everythingyou would ever wish for in that era, and it is still beautiful today.. One of the best RPGs ever made, it was genre standard, with a great immersive world, interesting companions, and Quests.. The best game of always. Superior in all aspects than the spectacular original BG. The characters are absolutely incredible, I'll always remember them.. A timeless RPG masterpiece, where captivating story meets deep gameplay. Characters you'll love, hate, be indifferent to, or find annoying, all with engaging dialogues that enrich your journey.. Excellent! Completed numerous times and spent hours playing with different characters! Polish dubbing was perfect at that times and is known to current days!. Personally, I liked BG1 :-) more than two but that is not to say BG2 isn't amazing as BG1. I really think that together they are an epic pair of games that are still unsurpassed in many ways. I liked the relatively straight-forward main story with the many supporting stories around it. I like how the world feels and behaves and how well grounded it is. you can get lost in it without being reminded you're playing a game (story-wise). The graphics and visual style of this game are very similar but improved over BG1. as with BG1 I think they hold up very well due to their design how they are presented. this true for sound as well. I love BG2 for all the reasons I loved BG1. it's a deep RPG with great mechanics and implementation. it's not held back by trying to say something about modern times or trying to echo present day issues in the game. the story and world takes priority and it shows. I love it. It's a legendary game any RP fan should play. *I use RP liberally as I like most RP games whether they are D&D based on things like Disco Elysium. The only reason this doesn't get a 10 is having to deal with 2nd edition dnd's quirks in a high level campaign, so they get way more exaggerated than the first game. Still great as I did a playthrough in 2023 and had a ton of fun.. The sequel to the great game, that does better almost everything that made the first game so great. Your companions feel more alive, the story goes global into the heroic tones of fighting half-gods and saving the world. The combat mechanics are still a little enigmatic as there are a lot of dice rolling behind your back and stats are not helping if you are not familiar with AD&D system. This can get overwhelming especially when you need to level up your character. But the story and the atmosphere of classic dungeoning is what makes this game great. You will be visiting big cities, discover dark secrets and completing quests for characters that seem to fit just right into this world. There is a lot of reading and the combat is hard to figure out but it is worth it. Update after fresh playthrough in 2023: Still the great game but some solutions seems dated. I love the freedom of exploring the first 3 chapters, but the the quests are not connected to world or each other and are quite fetchquesty. With almost every of them, it looks like the designers had one solution in mind (combat usually). It is visible when we compare old quests to the ones added in enhanced edition, as they are usually better. What is more, after playing modern games like Divinity: Original Sin 2 or Solasta, the combat and leveling in BG2 is significantly worse. I quickly resorted to lower difficulty with auto combat. Also, managing equipment is a pain.. The sense of immersion in the game has increased sixfold by directly controlling a number of jobs, not playing one main character. Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a masterpiece **** and is the best RPG I have played so I give it a score of 10. One of the best RPGs of all time. Great story. Great combat. Finished the game with a Paladin, a Wizard and a Rogue. The combat changes a lot and its allways fresh. The complexity of the wizard character is amazing. Very weak and protected at the beginning and develops into the most powerfull character easily. Besides.. Go back to a era were adventuring were free of woke messagesm and annatural genders, and racial psychosis. A must.. Really cool game because it was fun and the story was really interesting. Dialogues were in my native language so it was an amazing experience back when the game was released.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 9.. Baldur's Gate 2 will always be a masterpiece. It was the pinnacle of D&D Black Isle games, and a true adventure. A game I can't stop playing over the years because it is full of secrets, different ways of resolving a problem, a GOAT villain, a lot of quests, loads of spells with cool looking effects (outdated, but iconic), a very good plot with very charismatic characters and different classes to choose from. Replayability with this game is off the charts. Maybe you forgot to steal from that seemingly powerful mage and maybe he had a scroll you could use. Maybe you haven't explored under every rock where someone could have lost his ring. Or maybe this time you want to have an evil party. Or maybe you just want to try a new class, or kill that dragon. Baldur's Gate 2 will always be a classic. Maybe those who didn't play it back in the day or the new generations won't understand, but Baldur's Gate 2 is, and was a wonderful game that achieved everything you could ask for. A fantasy, pen and paper, D&D world where you can be whoever you want to be. The plot will do the rest.. Minx and boo. Loved this game. Best story telling and exploration at the time. Had so much fun building classes, DnD vibes are spot on.. A quintessential gaming experience. This is one of the most definitive RPGs ever made. D&D come to life in a manner that simply hasn't been recreated all these years later. Buy a copy and let your dreams come true!. By far the best rpg story-wise and for adnd (2n ed.). A legend for its genre and for pc gaming overall.. This is my favorite game of all times. An example how to make the perfect RPG. The Story is great, with tons of secondary and meaningful things to do. There are several characters that team up with you and their personalities and background stories are top notch. One of the things I love is that every time I played, my game was different. You have a real impact on the story and the world. The relationships in the party feel real, your group is not there to cheer you, they have their own thoughts and feelings, they would even disagree with each other.. It's best RPG for me. Unique quests, unique enemies, unique companions, every thing is unique in this beautiful game. Hard to play but, Baldur's Gate serie makes some good memories for me. Sorry for my English, i'm Turkish and its not my main language.. Hands down the best computer RPG game ever created if you like the AD&D. I got this game when it was released and I have played this through at least once a year since then.. A Fabulous Role playing game, I love everything about it. And The Humor and story. It was one of my first crpg's and I love it to this day. A masterpiece of storytelling, wit, challenge, balance. Possibly the best RPG of all time. I played it to completion when first released and I've replayed it many years later with the same joy and immersion. THX.. I can think of no finer way to waste your days than sidequesting your way through the Forgotten Realms. This game is immense, and doesn't punish you for doing it your way. Incredible.. I just can't find anything bad about that game. Everything is great: the storyline, the lore, the characters who have their own feelings and ways to grasp the world they're living in (they're not just bland npcs who will blindly follow you, far from it...) , the incredibly deep gameplay mechanics, the side quests that are not just a list of ridiculous and repetitive tasks to complete like in most RPGs, but actual stories which enhance the whole experience and even, sometimes, make you forget about the main plot (this litterally blew my mind)... The replayability is insane, because the developpers flawlessly transcribe the original D&D II core mechanics, with every single spell and ability (which means... a lot). The amount of work they put in that game is truly insane ( I genuinely can't find a better word ). And I'm not even talking about the art and graphics, at the time of release (still great today, and even better with the Enhanced Edition!)... This game is not only a game: it's an experience, it's a journey. And I urge anyone who haven't experienced it to do so. The only negative: you will find most RPG really dull, after playing this one... And I have the sad feeling this will still be true in 10 years, or maybe more... And yes, I've played both Pillars of Eternity and Divinity, which are great, but still can't compete. Also played Planescape (impressive story, but almost no replayability), and the Icewind Dale Saga (very poor, in comparison, this one...). Not to mention The Elder Scrolls, from Arena to Skyrim from a different point of view, though, centered to the player only. No, really... I'm still waiting for the student who will surpass the master.. Story, companions, fights.. the world of game feels alive. Best games every made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game... come on. Its not hard, but it is envolving, i guess not for the kids these days, reading more than 5 words is too complicated and this game have a LOT of dialog and if you dont pay any attention to it you will screw big time.. One of the best games every made. Not many RPG's have gotten anywhere near this level. Great characters a good plot and an enormous amount of side quests.. What can I say? From the writing, to the combat, to the characters this the pinnacle of the genre.. It has been 20 years since the release of Baldur's Gate 2. I can now grow a full beard, operate a motor vehicle and apply for a sub-prime mortgage. Many things in the world have changed but for me, there has always been one constant: Baldurs Gate 2: Shadows of Amn is the greatest game of all time. It is perfect. Long after human civilization has ended, Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn will be looked upon as an early 21st century Mona Lisa. Baldur's Gate 2 is statuesque. I created an account on this website just to do my part in getting this game as close to it's truly deserved 10/10 rating as possible. This is not a review - more of a love letter, or a thank-you note to a dear old friend... The story is one of the most immersive Iâve played. The characters are memorable and charismatic. The music and the art is magnificent. The art style is beautiful and will never fade. As a fan of DnD I love the gameplay. This is a masterpiece in everyway.. One of the best RPGs of all time. It is still the gold standard that I compare all new RPGs with. It has the most memorable cast in video game history, great story, an amazing world and lots of side quest. The characters are not only well written but also interact with each other. I always enjoy their dialogue. Also if you make decisions that go against their believes you will lose them or worse they will attack you. The side quest are interesting and deepen the connection to the lore and world. Each class gets its on base within the game and unique follow up quest. All characters have their side quest and character development. Also it is amazing how well the graphic still looks today (Yes it is outdated but look at the newer Neverwinter Nights for comparison). The Music is still good. The best part is the D&D part. You can develop your character in many ways and abuse some mechanics. The tactical potential is endless and there are no hard enemies if you know how to fight them. The different character classes give also lots of replayability (I used a Monk, Mage, Fighter / Thief combo and more). The villain is also really good. He started a typical stereotype but that's only a facade. I almost fell pity for him at the end of the story. This is a must play and deserves all the praise. I also recommended the Throne of Bhaal expansion which conclude the story in a satisfying way.. I have this game since its release back at 2000. When I first played it, I had a cultural shock ! ... I ended it with different characters, a Paladin (found Carsomyr +5 sword), a sorcerer (amazing class) among others ... played for many years. 19 years have passed and several other good games played (Deus X both original and Human revolution, Mass Effect trilogy, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Oblivion and Skyrim, the 1st Dragon Age) Last week I found my original BG 2 DVD, in a shelf, dusted but functional. I installed in my modern Window 10 PC, installed patches and run without problems !! (really cool for a 19 years old game) I created a multi-class elf fighter/mage ... the games still shines like new ... nothing has faded. Yesterday I stayed up til 5 o'clock AM ... I had to solve the Bridge district murders quest.... Shadows over Amn is a love letter to a paradigm: ""Content is King."" Measured against its production values, this game provides the player with an amount of quality content unmatched, I believe, in any other RPG. The diversity of encounters, spells, quests and, well, just about everything, is staggering, and most of it has a satisfying conclusion with a great piece of loot and a cool fight at the end. Baldur's Gate 2 checks nearly every content-box of an RPG flawlessly: a multitude of quests, vast amounts of unique and interesting loot, a myriad of monsters to fight, and a story which, while not exactly Shakespeare material, is quite solid and has one of video gaming's most memorable villains, voiced by an actor giving the performance of his career. Its sole, lackluster aspect is its mediocre character customization, but even in this it gets more mileage out of AD&D than most games. BG2 might have been the start of Bioware's decline with its angsty, teenage romanceable companions, but it is also the mid era RPG at its pinnacle, filled with so much stuff in so many flavours you'll never get bored. Add to this the multitude of mods available for free through fan sites, and this content-brimming titan turns into an exquisite personalized experience as well.. My personal rating for ""Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn"" (PC): 9,7/10 - Masterpiece Gameplay: 10 Video: 8,5 Audio: 9,5 Scope: 10 Balance: 10 Story: 9,5. After 17 years of waiting, at last, a game can match with brilliant Baldur's Gate 2 (Divinity 2). After BG2, I looked for a game which can provide the same level of joy. It took 17 years for a company to accomplish this. That basically shows how good Baldur's Gate 2 is.. This game builds upon dozen of dozens of really well made quest that will keep you on you toes and into the game. There is simply so many ways to play the game that you could play it for years without end, whether it is new choices, classes or multiplayer, this game got what every real RPG needs. Its not for nothing this game is known as the Grand Father of All RPGs, the game that resurrected the PC RPG game genre !. Probably the best RPG to date. The sheer scope of it, the characters, the combat, the story, it's all there.. An immortal game. You can play any time any age for various reasons. You can actually live in the story. I felt really sad when i live my gang and listen their further stories at the end of the game.. Even after playing the first game in the series and experiencing the story, the strong writing and the atmosphere, it is still hard to understand the fullness of BGII. The experience, the characters. Loving your companions, being betrayed, truly hating your antagonists. Feeling lost, like you have been dealt the killing blow, like you have been left alone in a labyrinth with no way out. There are still some random insta-death evens which I would rather not have in any game. There were still some difficulty spikes because, with so much customization it's obviously impossible to really balance a game. Encounters which took 2-3 minutes in game time but took me 40-60 minutes in actual time due to the excessive amount of pausing and running for my life trying to keep away from insta-death spells etc. I would rather have this game without these (and I assume it would have been commercially a bigger success) but I wouldn't change the world, the characters, the atmosphere, for all the AAA games in the world.. Like the first Baldur's Gate, this one is every bit as good (if not better). The storyline is probably one of the most engrossing I have ever had the pleasure of following. And the characters have there own personalities and feelings on most of the choices you make. I have lost count of the amount of times I have played this game. The simple fact is they don't make games like this now days. Masterpiece is the best word to describe this game.. game system is very difficult and battle has so slow tempo, it's boring. also story is not fun to me. so I don't like this game.. Been gaming 30+ years. This game provided me with some of the most memorable moments I've ever experienced as a gamer!. When a transcendent level of BOTH Quantity AND Quality collide, you get Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, the great Magnum Opus of our time. One of the most revolutionary video-game series of all time, and THE most ground-breaking RPG saga ever. A perfect rendition of Dungeons and Dragons and one of the best gameplay designs in gaming history. A High fantasy setting and tale that rivals The Lord of the Rings. The template for every open world game that came after. Games that you thought were revolutionary, like TES Morrowind or GTA 3, were literally just 3D renditions of Baldurâs Gate 2âs world designed with perfect content-density. In this game, a sword features more character development and better voice acting than the entire Elder Scrolls series. -Captured by Mind Flayers -Find out What Happened to Montaron -Find Proof of Mae'Var's Treachery -Gain the Services of Sir Sarles for the Temple -Inside the Planar Sphere -Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless -Investigate the Deaths in the Umar Hills -Rescue Gerran's Child from Firkraag -Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the Planar Prison -Seek Out and Investigate the Fallen Paladins -Solve the Riddle in the Sewers -Solve the 'skinner' Murders in the Bridge District The above would be among the best RPG main stories ever, but they aren't, they are SIDE quests! All for one game, one game that still stands in 2018 with a game world of unparalleled scope, atmosphere, and intrigue. Each of the above-mentioned quests takes hours, and there are dozens more that I didn't even mention, but there's always more to do, even after you finish them. The massive scope of Baldur's Gate 2 is decorated with mostly text-based dialogue (though the main story line is almost fully, and fabulously, voice acted). Despite featuring the best side-content in all of gaming's history, the main story is still the best part of the game. Dialogue that represents the best writing the gaming industry has to offer. BioWare's storytelling in this game hasn't been matched for 17 years. Baldur's Gate is not a story about saving the world, like countless other RPGs. Instead, it is a personal story about your character's struggles with his own evil inheritance and corrupted lineage that has led to the people around him suffering because of your tainted blood. But it features everything else we all love about the best BioWare games. BG2 Probably still stands as the best cast BioWare has written. 20 deep and intriguing, well developed characters make up the cast of NPCs you get to choose from to form your party of 6. Each of those party members will banter with each other, and will question your decisions, and sometimes your decisions will lead to them leaving you, or even trying to kill you. And if you manage to keep them all there's a classic BioWare style quest that is unique to each companion, and will ultimately shape your relationship with them, for good or for bad. There's plenty complex gameplay that overlays a massive adventure here. 7 races, dozens of classes, and HUNDREDS of abilities and spells are all yours to experiment with as you clash with HUNDREDS of different kinds of enemies and monsters that represent some of the coolest beasts in Dungeons and Dragons, who all possess abilities and spells of the same complexity. Decorated with a fantastic inventory UI, THOUSANDS of epic weapons and other equipment to customize your party with, visually stunning spell effects and surprisingly immersive sound effects, this game still boasts the most epic RPG fights in the history of gaming. There's always something new to learn about the combat, so this gameplay will never cease to engage and interest you. The main quest features many more well-written characters besides the 20 NPCs that you get to choose. A quest that will take you on unforgettable adventures, not only through the Forgotten Realms, but through human emotion. Torture, imprisonment, war, death, suffering, betrayal, deceit, love, redemption, and atonement are all features in this wonderfully dark and gripping tale. The mage Jon Irenicus, the best videogame villain of all time, tries to strip you of your powers, tortures you, and interrogates you on your abominable and inhuman nature. These atrocities will linger with you for the entire game, and often come up in strangely philosophical nightmares whenever you rest. He takes your friends from you, and he steals your very soul, and leads you on the most enthralling fantasy adventure that has ever been crafted, as you chase him through Elven forests, Catacombs full of vampires, alternate planes of existence, cities below the Ocean, Mage Asylums, Islands ruled by barbaric Pirates, treetop Elven cities, The Underdark, Drow cities, Beholder lairs, Mind Flayer cities, a lair of Dragon Demi-Gods, a city besieged by an army of Fire Giants, Gnomish Cities, the ancient prison of the Prince of Demons, and even to the Deepest circle of Hell.. Still my best game of all time with Dark Souls 1 tailing it. There's nothing else like Baldur's Gate 2, especially nowadays. and I feel that it's highly overlooked by many, possibly due to its genre. The level of customisation and deep character and NPC interactions, the variety of play styles, classes, spells, abilities, enemies, bosses and the epic story with fantastic, rewarding, and compelling side quests to partake in. The amount of spells to play with as a mage alone go into the hundreds, with all of them being unique and many of them having new added effects when you level. They simply don't make games like this any more, and with this level of complexity. Pillars of Eternity is a decent effort but I think there's going to have to be a far greater attempt to dethrone this game.. That's what I call the pinnacle of RPG genre. Every character has it's depth, the story is immersive, there's a lot of side quests and locations. Romance options, different approaches, a lot of tactic options. Novadays, triple A games don't even have a quarter of what Baldur's Gate 2 had to offer back in the day. This game just puts those to shame. Absolute must-play.. Baldur's Gate 2 is by far the best rpg made. It's baffling just how much dialogue, sidequests, actual quests and quality you could include in 4 cds... If you're wondering, BG2 and ToB are a single package for me. When I see my nephews play fotm, and skip this... It makes me very, very sad. For it is a timeless masterpiece wihtout comparison.. As an amid RPG fan, I always knew something will be missing as long as I did not finish Baldurâs Gate 2, the best computer RPG ever made, according to many. As a fan of the first game, I did play this one when it came out but could not beat it due to a problem with my save files. I have finally decided it was time to beat this and get it out of the way and yes, I do agree this is among the best cRPGs ever made. First, let me start with some small criticism. Firstly, the open environment sandbox/exploration feeling of the first game is missing in the sequel. Adventuring in BG2 means mostly dungeons and things feel more linear than the first game. Second small drawback is the fact that some chapters are quite overwhelming, in the sense that you obtain dozens of long quests which can at times lead to confusion. That being said, the effort that has been put into making this game is absolutely mind blowing. Baldurâs Gate 2 is as much dialogue heavy as Planescape Torment and as much combat focused as Icewind Dale. It perfected both dialogues and combat and mixed them beautifully into a single game. Each quest can be completed differently, usually by choices depending your alignment be it good, neutral or evil. We get to see some of the familiar faces from the first game, yet it is perfectly possible to enjoy it without playing Baldurâs Gate, since the story is not tightly related. I would say the quests are usually more interesting than the main story, which in my opinion was lacking in comparison to the first game. Notwithstanding the small criticisms, Baldurâs Gate II by all means is a masterpiece. With its epic soundtrack, awesome NPCs, party interaction and immersive atmosphere, it is a very deep 150 hours journey. It is not noob friendly and applies hardcore D&D 2nd edition mechanics, but once you can familiarize himself with the ruleset, you will find an unforgettable gaming experience.. Real power is eternity, and one who agrees for less, in fact has nothing ... Almost above my predecessor in everything. (Still one of the best RPG of the old school).. I bought this game new as a teenager and dumped many hours into this game. I am now 32 and found myself bored with current video games thinking about the Baldur's gate and icewind dale series. I discovered the enhanced editions and have been playing both ever since. I am really hoping they make icewind 2 EE. Baldurs gate 2 is the best of the series. Deep story, quests for days, and, massive maps.. I played ma","baldur's gate 2 is a CRPG masterpiece that set the bar decades ago . it's a love letter to D&D fans, created by a team who understood the source material perfectly . avoid the ""enhanced"" edition - it dilutes the original charm with clunky additions and changes that miss the mark ."
350.Dota 2,"The game itself is very beautiful and what a wonderful strategy. But the behavior evaluation system is the meanest and most unfair of all online games on Earth. It was created so that players playing Dota 2 were always nervous and aggressive. It is easy to ask any healthy person one question: if the game has the ability to block or mute a player, then why was the option to report a player for unsatisfactory behavior in the game created? If I do not want to listen to a player, I can muted a player and why should I report him. No, Gaben and in particular the developers of Valva created a special system to disrupt the nervous system of children and develop snitching. This is simply terrible, because it is so intellectually dull and mean.. no, it is not free the price is your soul your time and your whole being will make you suffer more than the death of a loved one and in time you will stop feeling pleasure when winning you will only feel something when you lose I guess I recommend it 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is good, especially its entourage and graphics. But I cannot accept the game pace, it's too slow for me, supports are vulnerable and weak af and so on... In short, the game has lotta stuffy things that spoil my opinion.. Throughout history, there have been numerous moments where discoveries embody the ""perfect formula"" principle, whether it's fire, the wheel, electricity, Coca-Cola... All of these discoveries or inventions are inherently part of a continuum of refinement driven by civilization's evolving needs through time and space. For example, Chess was played thousands of years ago with unlimited time per move, each piece had very different movement rules and overall rules differed significantly from modern ****, the ""perfect formula"" of Chess itself remains unchanged and will likely endure as long as our cognitive 'modus operandi' remains as it is. To put it more illustratively, these ""perfect formula"" discoveries and objects resonate with us much like corners resonate with spiders or trees and rivers resonate with beavers. Our minds are wired to engage with these perfect circuits in all their brilliance, because the human mind is a brilliant invention of evolutionary processes and this engagement is simply enjoyable wallowing in our own **** such perfect circuit, among many others in different fields, is Dota 2. This game is flawless in its **** course, you would make a logical mistake in qualitatively comparing Chess with the wheel, or fire with Coca-Cola, or electricity with Dota 2, or even Chess with Dota 2 - which is usually the case. Each of these phenomena holds its own utility field, and their disparate, incommensurable states should be considered within their own contexts and frameworks. Chess and Dota 2 may have superficial similarities, but they are fundamentally different, like ""original Cola"" VS ""DIY Fanta"" different, the only similarity might be the carbonated bubbles in both drinks, which metaphorically could resemble your mental engagement through all aspects of being tricky, witty, or cunning in strategizing and anticipating moves of your opponent in Chess, or timing your spells in Dota 2 either alone or in synergy with your... ****, yes, THE TEAM. Damn. This sounds like it's always the same team and holy f, it actually is. The game has SO MANY players and has been out there for so long that it has crystallized a distinct pattern of mentality, which could literally be captured by the term ""Team of Dota 2"" with its own hypostatized face. The community in this game deserves special attention; it is a phenomenon that needs a separate review. Actually, it deserves a psycho-pathological study. It's no joke. It's unlike anything I've encountered in any online game before and I'm not using now personal experience (or lack thereof) as a validating instrument for this opinion - it's an objective fact, especially in recent times where its collective mind has reached its peak form.Anyway, back to the game, some surrounding aspects: I've seen many people discredit it, saying things like, ""Damn, that game seems complex and time-consuming; I don't have the energy to invest in it."" Yet they proceed to play Sudoku or Chess 24/7, others invest time in watching bare-bottom TV shows, some work and provide for their families, others gamble, others read books, etc... Everyone is occupied with something, but the 'rational' fear of this game persists, as if it's a virus that will devour their life like nothing else already does. This perception is completely distorted and based on faulty assumptions. As I said, the game is perfect in its core, and that ""perfect formula"" allows you to enjoy it endlessly...HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you should sacrifice your personality, abandon your character and dreams just to immerse yourself in this sinkhole. I mean, if you're confused about your priorities and lack essential personal values, that's your own weakness and fault. It's not the game's fault if you're inclined to start compensating for that weakness with a dominance-at-all-costs attitude in the game - initially just trying to win every match, and later becoming hyper-toxic towards others. Would you blame a beer company for your careless driving while drunk, or a casino for losing enormous amounts of money? If you are already individually dissociated and dissolved into the crystallized Dota 2 mentality, of course you would. Noob. FK UR MOM CNCER TO UR FAMIL RIPORT. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 7/10 Good game well played. Torture your mental beware...................... Let's say, this game is good, but the community really horrible. I'd like to play this game sometimes, but after one or two matches, I really get bored of it. Also, some minor patches in this game, can make one character is too strong.. Great game, but too hard and chaotic for me. I liked Dota 2. Itâs mechanics, variation and tension is a unique concept and I enjoyed it very much. I especially liked itâs balance. In Dota 2, two teams, each up to 10 players, battle it out on a map. Their goal is to destroy the âAncientâ of the other team. This is a large, bulky structure. Each team can choose their own unique hero, 4 skills and choose if they want to play a support character or an attack character. The attack character specializes in damage and destruction, while the support character focusses on healing, buffs and utilizations. At the start of each match, a little time is given to the players in the team to discuss tactics. Along the way to the enemy base, various monsters spawn on the road. This monsters do not attack until you do first. They drop currency, which a player can use to buy items in the various little shops around the map. There are also some boss monsters, which drop special items, some of which can increase damage, allow a resurrection and much more. The graphics in Dota 2 are nice and colorful. The environments on the maps are detailed and full of life and although simple, it has a certain charm. The only problem for me with the graphics, are the various effects of magic, explosions, hits, elemental attacks that blast in your screen during heavy combat, making me lose overview of the situation sometimes. The sound and ambient music is great and adds to the experience. When **** hits the fan, it can be a little chaotic, but overall, nothing to complain here. The mechanics, menuâs and action bars are a little confusing and need some time to get used to. The learning curve is a little steep here, and some training matches are certainly recommended. The way the game is supposed to be played (with the right tactics that is), takes even longer and in the beginning, many noob mistakes will be made. Certain items are used in the wrong moment, certain skills have been used too early, that kind of stuff. Like mentioned, the best part of Dota 2, is its balance. Every player has equal chance of winning. If a player is stronger than you, or kills you with two hits, it is probably because they risked their lives while getting some unique items from monsters on the road. The magic attacks drain mana, which recharges over time. This way, the game prevents spamming the same attack multiple times, keeping it fair. I liked Dota 2 and itâs mechanics a lot better than League of Legends. There is more balanced gameplay, more tactics (in my opinion) and, because you play in teams, there is more coordination and teamwork. The only problem, and reason, I stopped playing, is (once again) my lack of skill with this kinds of games. I do like them, and surely want to try them out, however, this kind of intense, fast and âprofessionalâ games are not for some hours of relaxation. So in the end, I just cherished the few happy memories I had with this game and moved on. In terms of gameplay, mechanics and overall feel however, I would certainly recommend this game.. Tbh this game is greate i really used to love to play it, but as much as you play the much it getting worse) zero perspectives with community that is terrible, stopped to play it 3 years ago and it was bad back then but now is terrible. The best game I've ever played. The only game that I could play for 8 hours a day for the rest of my life without feeling bored. In fact, I had to stop playing because this game is so fun that it overshadowed everything else in my life. If that is not a concern to you (or if your self-control is better than mine), this can be the last game you ever play.. Literally worse than LoL and i didnt know you can be that bad.Graphics is bad, community is horrible, gameplay is ****. There is no other point playing it than trolling other idiot players. Game was fantastic in the early days, I used to spend 100, 200 usd monthly in cosmetics, amazing experience... till they changed MMR, from a sudden facing all sorts of awful players. Now the patch 7.33 it's the final nail in Dota 2 coffin.. Ah, Dota 2, that shining beacon of strategic perfection in the online gaming world, where each match is like a musical symphony of plans and tactics. Indeed, it is a game that immensely delights me, melting in the mouth like the culinary creation of a Michelin-starred chef. And the AI incorporated into it? Well, I must admit, its sophistication always astounds me when it pairs me and my ""certainly"" English-speaking teammates **** is quite astonishing that in this era of technological marvel, which Dota 2 undeniably represents, artificial intelligence has still not found a way to interpret the ""Western Europe"" and ""English"" filters so that the outcome matches these settings. As I nobly select these options, I expect to immerse myself in an English-speaking utopia, where each match becomes an oasis of British etiquette and Shakespearean exchange of courtesies. Instead, I often find myself as an unintended guest at a Cyrillic party, where communication is composed of mysterious runes and enigmatic pictograms.I cannot help but wonder if my client is inadvertently a window for the expansion of Russian influence, where every keyboard, regardless of chosen language preferences, is secretly programmed to convert everything into the letters of the Cyrillic alphabet. And I think to myself, oh, how charming, how insightful of Valve to provide me with cultural enrichment without my explicit consent. Indeed, how far can free education go?What an amazing school of patience and interpersonal skills, when this game guides me to mumble phrases in Russian that I've learned amidst the waves of ""cyka blyat"". Dota 2 is not just a game, but also a language course and a social experiment that broadens my horizons far beyond the usual limits. In its boundless kindness and education, Valve continuously contributes to my personal development. And for that, my endless gratitude.. Its gameplay intricacies make it a standout choice for those craving engaging multiplayer challenges.. Great game. Unfortunately I have a high pitched voice and many of the other players get strange af on mic when I talk lol. Great game. Truely. The community doesn't match.. match takes too long, move pacing is too slow, honestly the game is just boring to learn.. Best game ive ever played, altho kind of rough learning curve. They say until you play at least 10k hours you are still noob. Also very time consuming. I play it on and off since its release, and its getting only better.. last update - dislike You deprive the players of interaction! 6000 - to write to the chat, 8000 - to talk - it's too much! Players on a low rating throw reports just for fun - and as a result, people simply do not have the opportunity to raise decency! Together with the introduction of such a system, it was necessary to at least reset the decency indicator! My decency is 5700 - although I am not a toxic player and try to play normally. You're just killing the game on a low rating and a mid-level rating. Terrible update! Fat dislike! it kills the desire to play! a few of my friends have drop Dota 2 after this patch. back to mute by default, so that the player decides - unlock teammate or not!. dota balance is total **** how can you put a player with 100 matches vs players who have 1000-5000 matches played, all the time? fkn idiots. Dota 2 was great game but i dont like it anymore sadly. it feels like a huge chunk of mess that you dont know where to put. I like what Dota 2 has become after 10 Years, a well polished game that still retain interest. Huge thanks to the community who kept posting about game's issues.. I've got a solid couple thousand hours, here's what I would say after watching the game over the last decade or so. Visuals: Game looks great and performs great, even today its visuals are actually pretty rock solid! Sound: Music is fantastic, sound effects are also spot on! Voiced characters sound great. Gameplay: If you can put in the time, and have enough friends to play with, this can be one of the greatest gaming experiences available! The downside, it takes an immense amount of time to know whats going on and the characters, even after hundreds of hours its a constant stream of learning and adapting. Even if you get to know all the characters the game changes and gets updated all the time, so its hard if you're not current. Overall some good and bad here, one they have a dev that looks out after the game. But some might say they've made way too many changes and maybe have focused too much on a massive hero pool. It's definitely one of the more daunting games to get into if you're new. If you are competitive and like team-based strategy that requires communication this is elite. Again, some of the best possible gaming experience you can have here. Buttttttt...... also some of the worst, as it goes with MOBAS, the community is toxic. People get frustrated, specially if you're new. A game can take from 30-60 minutes id say 45 is pretty typical, so people get mad. You can mute all you want but the game is not the same without a team and comms. It's best if you got a 5 stack of friends to play with. While it does have some great moments, it also is bogged down by a toxic community and wildly steep learning curve.. This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the game play is as intense and as rewarding as DOTA1. I know a lot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA2 and I think it will help new comers. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that can not be compared. Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free .. I hate MOBA, Arts style games. But it's Valve game, so i played it. Very hard game i must admit, like i said it's not my style, graphics is great for this kind of game, many things to learn, also a little bit of boring just like league of legends. But still way better than that kiddo ugly graphics, unbalanced Trash.. Dota 2, to me, stands as the best, most complex, addicting, rewarding, and polished MOBA out there. However, my relationship with the game has been tumultuous due to its community, prompting me to quit in 2014-2015 (after Techies' hero launch). Recently, in 2022, I decided to give it another shot and returned to the battlefield, totaling around 4k hours across my accounts. The game itself is a masterpiece, boasting intricate mechanics and well-crafted gameplay. Yet, it is plagued by one significant drawbackâthe Dota 2 community. Within its player base, you'll find individuals who refuse to communicate in English, spammers, and those who feed intentionally due to petty disagreements about lane assignments. Toxicity is a common occurrence, particularly in unranked matches, although ranked play varies depending on your rank. Before diving into Dota 2, it's crucial to consider this aspect of the community. However, if you can endure the toxic encounters, you'll discover a game that truly shines with its skill-dependent gameplay. Mastering Dota 2 takes time and dedication, and new players will likely feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge to absorb. Yet, with perseverance, you'll grasp the intricacies and improve over time. One of the game's standout features is its excellent free-to-play business model. All gameplay content, including heroes, modes, and the arcade, is accessible for free. However, Dota 2 monetizes through cosmetics and battle passes, which offer a plethora of cosmetics and rewards earned through grinding. It's important to exercise caution here; while cosmetics add a nice touch to the game, excessive spending on them can quickly escalate. To get the most value for your money, consider purchasing cosmetics from the marketplace rather than opening chests. One particular feature that I find bothersome is the Dota Plus subscription. While it offers some helpful in-game suggestions, it veers into the territory of pay-to-win elements, which detracts from the game's competitive integrity. Moreover, they lock player progression behind the subscription, stopping heroes' progression to level 5 for non-subscribers. Progression is a fundamental aspect of gaming, and gating it behind a subscription is an unnecessary inconvenience. Despite these drawbacks, Dota 2 remains an exceptional game at its core, offering an unparalleled MOBA experience. Just be prepared to face the challenges presented by its community, and you'll find a deeply rewarding and engaging gaming journey ahead.. Mechanically speaking, this game is a 10. The community however, is a 0. Absolutely the most toxic people I have ever encountered. It eventually turns you toxic to survive/continue playing. Honestly wish I would have never played.. In my opinion, this game is one of the best games made by Valve Of course, I must say that it has a strong ban system. Dota had its pinnacle with Dota 2 Source 1, then came Reborn and Valves wish to sell more stuff such as terrain tile sets, it came with a lot of bugs and player base took a major hit, but it was still Dota so people slowly started to come back to this uglier version. However it seams Valve wasn't happy with Dota`s loyal fan base giving them a lot of $, so directors decided they need to attract hots and lol players. Thus came patch 7.00 ruining Dota forever. Now Dota 2 is no longer Dota. All competitive factors are lost and its greatness is lost due to greed. Small example; player HUD used to be same size for all heroes, now it changes from hero to hero covering more or less screen space thus making it unequal. Entire patch was made to decrees skill needed to play aka pro plays are less rewarding. I don`t blame Icefrog I guess he got tricked. Rip Dota, it was safer in Blizzards hands.... I love and hate this game. Still my favorite game with a lot opportunities. And a lot of game ruiners. Thanks Gabe.. My favorite of all time. Let's just ennunciate a timeless fact: dota is not for the noobies lol. Defense of the Ancients (DOTA) in Warcraft III is the best and greatest MOBA game, no doubt. DOTA 2 is the next generation and a standalone version that is kept updated. I don't suggest anyone who never played DOTA to play it unless you have some really nice friends to play with you. This game is like WoW, if you were lucky to play it when it just came out and you keep playing it, you will absolutely love it. But it is not a game that you can play it now without any basic concept. It is just too overwhelming for newbies. It is not your fault it is also not the game's fault. It is just bad timing, like many other bad timings in your life.. i play form 2020 it fun and my skills grow and i have 2000 hours fun but that upade make it worst. 20.04 hype new is coming is out play 10+ matches its no more fun, you want play with toixic dudes a not Balanced lol play dota 2/3. i delete it.. DotA 2 proves itself a faithful, albeit ambitious sequel to the original World of Warcraft III fan created mod Defense of the Ancients. With a deeper level of mechanical depth and a fairer business model to its competitors, DotA 2 continues to enjoy a highly active community. Unfortunately, as with all MOBA titles, DotA 2 suffers from a steep learning curve, and an experience ultimately determined less by the quality of the application--and more by the current players in each lobby. As a result, the mileage and enjoyment of individual users may vary. Mechanically sound, well optimized, and constantly updated, DotA 2 remains as a major force in the current gaming industry; however, its genre and playerbase leave the game short of perfection.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Before I played Dota 2 i was a kind person and had a big wee wee, lots of friends, awesome girlfriend and absolutely a lot of will to live. All of these things i lost, now i'm toxic racist little man sitting home alone and hating everyone but the game is pretty good. KekL. This game is a timeless classic. The fact that it is a decade old and continues to be one of the most popular titles on Twitch by viewership speaks for itself. If you are into PvP MobA action, Dota 2 is the perfect game for you. Valve keeps the game consistently fresh and updated so the replayability is endless. One of the best competitive online games in the world. It is very hard to inroduce new players in it because of that number of mechanics and possible plays that you can do. You may not like the genre but this is single-handedly the best MOBA out there. The community is really bad and toxic and the dev team working on it could use some more people but there's nothing to lose here from a free game.. Started like DOTA in 2012. Every year closer and closer to LOL, and after all, even HON. Especially, some changes were copied from HON to DOTA2 and reversed. After years, it is turned into a colorful Chinese circus, not so far from LOL. All is schematized, predictable and gameplay is alot about farming. Fighting is more similar to LOL. More burst, heroes with more active spells (Drow Ranger, Bloodseeker, Dazzle, Crobelus etc.), in general, more quicker gameplay like ""competitive"" scene need and wanted, especially China ""competitive"" scene. The community around the game is snobbish, and arrogant, convinced of their perfection because they play DOTA2. Because it is DOTA - hard and elite, not at all. Far easier than DOTA. DOTA+ is a pay-to-play program. Which gives those paying ""clients"" what they deserve. Backslapping games full of ""owning"" those players, which aren't so good. To boost their ego. There is no reason to waste time with this crap. Until competitive pro-players do not care about fair-play, which they never do, they are only circus apes of Valve. Valve bought it to have at least one MOBA game, especially a fanbase that mindlessly adores them, because they make DOTA like they want, which does not mean, how DOTA needs to be. Gameplay is farming, sometimes fighting and denying. Boring. Valve is printing users of this game by adding it to every library of every user. What a garbage!. Graphics - 6/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Controls - 5/10 Detail control - 8/10 Optimisation - 6/10 Interesity - 7/10 Personal taste - 2/10 Sound - 8/10 Physics - 3/10 Mechanics - 4/10 Getting bored quickly - -2/-10 Bugs - -1/-10 Balance - 2/10 Community - 2/10 Players - 5/10 Servers - 5/10. Worst game in the history of the universe. I do not advise anyone to play.. probably one of the finest balanced games of all times. with tons of options for every type of play style.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not Recommended 679.2 hrs at review time Multiplayer Gameplay 3/10 Music and sound 5/10 Screenplay 4/10 Technical 5/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The authors don't care about the players. Each update does not add anything new.. Dota 2 is a free-to-play game that is actually paid with your mental health. Stay away from this game and enjoy life.. I tried to give this game a chance but League of Legends was more appealing to me. I remember playing custom WC3 maps tho and yet this game isn't to my liking.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 5.. Dota 2 features the characters and factions from the original Defense of the Ancients title with new features.. Dota 2 is one of the worst games in MOBA history, it went from the most fundamental game into unconditional absolute chaos. Somehow, Dota 2 do not care about its player base and teaches them where to lane or what a ""carry"" is and making the game time-consuming and stressful to play because you couldn't dodge, abandon without getting punished, avoid a match or have unlimited avoid reports, and a way to stop other players from being too dense or untrusted. Once a great game, ruined by a terrible company that leaches on other companies to thrive.. Martin A. - All hero's are ready to play right out of the box. This game is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) with over 123 characters, there's bond to be at least a handful that are right for you! Each hero also has alternate designs that can mix and match. It's amazing that not 1 game is ever the same. What I hated, the players expect you to know all the buzz words and gameplay. This can't be avoided because not knowing can be game ending. I highly recommend looking up videos about how to play your hero because if you miss click or don't get to fire off, there is no redo or pause button because the entire game is live with ten people. Meaning that if the restroom is needed, 9 people will be waiting for a return and they aren't patient because anyone can resume the game after 30 seconds. There is no campaign here, so, all that is needed to know is how to play. Once you know your hero, the next step is to learn all the items that can extend your abilities. With over 208 items. It will never get boring. What I love. The cosmetics have a market and the prices can go to the moon and back. A player can spend on cosmetics, return in 3 years and get their return and then some. Do you want invisibility? Well there's an item for that. Do you want regeneration? There a item for that. Do you want to shock your enemy with a dragon stick? Well it's on sale! No friends? No problem. There is a match finder and it takes about 3 minutes on average to find a game. Gamer be ware because each game is on minimum 35 minutes and I'm not joking. The glory of winning in team is nothing short of incredible. Tournaments for this game are in the millions every year. It's amazing that they are able to book arenas for just one game. 9/10. This game is quite solid, albeit a bit too involved and needlessly complex for my taste. Has all the good things of the mobas along with some of the worst, but its actually very fun to play with friends. One of the best MOBA that I ever played. This game is so addictive and I want to play it again.. I have never played a single game in my life as much as DotA. This is my biggest timekiller ever. I have so many stories and memories associated with this game. There were many friends and acquaintances. I visited so many events that are related to DotA. Tournaments, pubstomps, and he himself held many tournaments. But at the same time, this is a game that destroyed a lot of nerve cells in me. I have never been so nervous anywhere as in this game. The community is the biggest downside. This game makes me better and worse at the same time. Better for dating, and worse as a person on the brink of a nervous breakdown.. I only have 8000 hours in this game, it looks ok. Still in beta though, when this officially releases it will be great !. I recommend avoid this game. Awful ranked system. No motivation. No rewards. Terrible game for new players. Worst Community ever. Smurf accounts. Boosters every f* game. Hope this game will have died soon.... best game to waste time best game to waste time best game to waste time best game to waste time. Sold my soul to play this game, thanks to Valve for the masterpiece also delete techies from the game pls ""I secretly enjoy playing techies"". Rate a game for the actual game, not anything else. You can make a comment about the rest but we are reviewing the actual game here. For me Dota was the game that begun all the trend and the second title was the best.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game I ever played for genre MOBA game. The Hero, The Arena and another are the best idea from the developer. good job Valve.. Worst community ever. The developing process has became really slow, but the worst thing is that they REFUSE to communicate with the community.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. where is my battle pass? omg ""In the meantime, we are almost finished with the next Battle Pass, which will be released in the coming weeks. We are preparing a special puzzle for you that we can't wait to share."" 24 nov 14 dec ""in the coming weeks"" 0/10. One of the most horrible yet addictive games of them all. But don't be delusional, it's for kids with scripts, bug and glitch users. Terrible community, p2w mechanics in half of custom maps, ppl smurfing to have fun while you can't raise your rating. Basically, its the same as LoL nowadays, just with more toxic mechanics and slower gameplay. Both games have shifted to burst meta, like almost any other game today. I would never recommend anyone starting playing it, because you'll waste all your nerves for nothing. P.S. 2600 hours played. a game wÄ±th endless play tÄ±me every match different from each other good lores good responses of heroes. DONT EVEN **** THINK ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME. but if you already began, DONT PICK **** PUDGE. and if you dont pick pudge and ruin all games, welcome to dota. Dota 2 has a very rich and long history, a very steep learning curve and a huge and creative community. Dota 2 is an E-sport, so you don't even have to play it to enjoy it. Dota 2 is a team game, thus playing with friends is advised. It consumes a lot of time if your aim is to get to the top of the ranking system. Be aware that too much of Dota can be harmful for your health.. Best MOBA of all times, complex, fun, community could be better and the development from Valve could be faster.. why should i play every patch with imbalanced heroes like Marcy? the game was awesome until vALVE touched it. The game is done very well, but the community and ambiguous updates, which often make very weak heroes out of very strong and weak ones too strong interfere with the gameplay, as they force you to take those heroes who are in the meta, rather than those you really want to play on. The game at different ratings is played in completely different ways","dota 2's behavior evaluation system is meanest and most unfair of all online games on earth . the game itself is very beautiful and what a wonderful strategy . but the game has lotta stuffy things that spoil my opinion, says tom charity . the game is good, especially its entourage and graphics ."
351.TimeSplitters 2,"It's very good game I love it very much and I advise everyone to play this very beautiful game.. Great game but NOTHING compared to Timesplitters Future Perfect so I don't get why it is higherrated than the better one. Great campaign, great AI, great multiplayer. Humor, stories, characters are so great. Highly recommend.. A good friend of mine back then bought the game and, i guess, beat the main story. I never did that... but we played this game (as 4 players) so many hours, you would not believe it. It was one of those few perfect multiplayer games, with so many characters and weapons.... just unbelievable. Sequel to the fun first person shooter that has larger levels, more complex missions and improved graphics making it even better than what was already a great game.. Gameplay was unbelievable, a monumental change from other games at the time. If only this game could be remade WELL with modern features and a lack of predatory monetization. Probably a top 5 fps game of all time. Wow! This is quality I was not expecting and is definitely a game I wish I had played when I was younger. It is the best example on how to improve on top of games that came before it. All the elements of Golden Eye and Perfect Dark can be seen in this game just like it's predecessor. But as the first Timersplitters was more of a trial concept. Timesplitters 2 puts everything together in a complete package. The visuals are some of the best I have seen on the PS2, the cartoony vibe just adds to the fun. And that fun can be found in how solid the game-play is. The controls are smooth and responsive, the shooting has weight behind it and the difficulty is just right depending on which setting you choose. Not to mention the little cut-scenes at the start of each mission creates a light hearted tone that sets the mood for each level. I can't recommend this enough! It might not have brought anything new to this generation. But it sure did show how good FPS can be on a console.. A must-play classic made by some of the former Rare developers that made Goldeneye and Perfect Dark. Enough said.. A great shooter that's still one of the most original gaming experiences I've ever had. Can't wait for a sequel! (someday!). This game is just awesome. Don't believe the reviews saying that this is overrated, it's good for a reason and it has stood the test of time. It just has so much content in it that I've never found myself bored a single second. In 2002 this game had: - A campaign taking place in different time periods, some might argue that the story is lackluster and they're right, you'll not find a deep narrative in it like Halo or COD but this is all about gameplay and the experience. -66 challenges which further add to the game, in them you can unlock extra content, like more characters, weapons, game modes or maps. Some are really fun and I've spent time trying to make new records. - Over 16 game modes, 16 maps, 31 weapons and 126 playable characters to choose from, each with different stats that spice the gameplay a little bit. - You can create your own matches in arcade custom! You can change the bots you'll be playing with, the gamemode, weapons, the map and even the music. -Lastly, you can build maps with the mapmaker, it offers a lot of tools to make your map unique and flashy. You can edit the spawns, weapon pickups and powerups you'll be using in your map, you can even make a story level. There's some negative stuff I have to say about the game like: - The aiming system ****, the way they made you aim ingame is terrible, the crosshair goes to the center of the screen everytime you let go of your analog stick. It's specially hard to aim shots in areas where you need stealth to pass. -Camera movement is rather slow, it fails you when you need to turn around real quick. -The game is really difficult and punishing at times, some challenges and story missions are just outright unfair, that really troubles you when trying to 100% the game. The positives outweight the negatives by a lot, this game is by far the most complete FPS i've ever played.. A game I can not enjoy , This is a game that I have tried to get through so many times every time I lose interest Because I get too bored by the missions and can find the way through the levels and objective , You may ask why am I trying to enjoy this game and play it again and again if I don't like it that is because I love the original TIMESPLITTERS and Future perfect is the best FPS ever, The problem is that it doesn't have there's straightforward level production like the original TimeSplitters when the only thing you have to get is the objective and then out of it And it doesn't have the gripping story and Smooth gameplay future perfect have , It's not a game for me but I'm glad somebody enjoy it. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 10/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay Value - 10/10 So many memories. The time travel story allowed the creators use an endless well of creativity when designing levels and characters. The story is funny and the time periods nailed thanks to memorable maps, music and characters. There was also so many challenges to get through that felt more rewarding to perform well in as unlocking and collecting characters became addictive. The multiplayer was also incredible. MAKE TIMESPLITTERS 3 FOR THE NEXT GEN PLEASE!!!. This game is the best FPS I have played! I don't really have anything else to say. I'm not usually into FPS games but I really liked this game. I beat it with my friend and it was really great! One of the best PS2 games ever!. A rare and amazing gem that still holds up to this day. Campaign was great, stupid comedy and a nice and easy story. Mapmaker was such a great feature for the time of release. Overall I wish games were this good again.... The best Timesplitters game and one of the best FPS for PS2. The developers of Goldeneye worked on this and you'll notice similarities in the gameplay and amazing multiplayer modes.. Cant even discribe how much i miss TS2 one of the best Playstation2 Shooter game Absoloutley random funny and so much fun gameplay Amazing story Mapmaker like wich FPS made you create your own map and own story ? amazing soundtracks who made them desrve a gold medal !! I hope we will se more of TS in future !. One of the first great games I had for my PS2. Brilliant fun, and, along with TS: Future Perfect, it was my childhood. I do have to say that if you are going to get a Timesplitters game now, go with Future Perfect. The aiming mechanic is much easier, and the same as most modern games!! 9/10. The most fun FPS game around, bar none. After years of waiting for a better FPS, nothing has quite compared. Modern Warfare came close, but this game focuses on the real videogame experience without trying to be anything other than a game that can be enjoyed by anybody. There are at least 30 hours of content here if you just want to complete it all. But for those who really love the game, the massive amount of customisation will last a life time. All the above applies to the single player experience, however multiplayer is even more fun than that. Buy this game used. Nintendo Wii, 2 controllers, Gamecube memory card and TS2 (Gamecube) from ebay is the best Â£60 you will ever spend.. Easily my favourite shooter of all time. TimeSplitters 2 takes all the pre-conceived notions of the first-person shooter genre and turns it on it's head! You could be a US Military trooper with an AK-47, trying to save hostages from armed terrorists OR you could be a monkey in a tie, throwing bricks at a man dressed entirely in cardboard boxes with a raygun while a Cyborg hostage with an AK-47 terrorises a military trooper. It was total insanity and it's gameplay reflected this. It was incredibly fast-paced and relied more on reaction times and simply keeping your cool more than precise skill. It was a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish, with a truly unique and captivating art style, and incredible musical score provided by the brilliant Graeme Norgate and more imagination and creativity than you could fit in to the rest of the entire genre combined because I guarantee you, it parodied every one of those games at least once!. TimeSplitters 2 is one of the best shooters ever created. It's unique, challenging, packed full of content, and just incredibly fun to play either solo or with friends. Thanks to its robust selection of game modes, levels, and characters, it stays refreshing after hours upon hours of play. The graphics are still visually pleasing after all these years, the controls are snappy and responsive, and the audio is some of the best and most memorable I've ever heard in a game. Games like TimeSplitters 2 are the reason I feel glad to be someone who plays video games and feel sorry for those who don't. Simply put, your PS2 library is worthless without this game. Get it.. This game is one of the most complete, amazing, hardcore, intense, random, and most awesomest shooters you will ever play. Campaign: I really have never seen this type of campaign before. The missions are very fun to do and are even more fun with a partner. It has splitscreen co-op (only 2 players) and the difficulty system is unique. DO NOT JUST PLAY THE CAMPAIGN ON EASY! On easy difficulty for the campaign, it is very linear. Each mission will take about 15-20 minutes to do and there are aprox. 10 missions. On the other difficulty settings though (medium and hard), if you interact with cetain things in the enviroment, you will be given extra missions. Like on a mission on easy mode, I have 1-4 objectives and about 2-3 other side missions. On medium or hard difficulty, you will have just about the same amount of objectives but up to 3-5 side missions. You can choose to do the side missions for (I think) extra content. Challenges: This is the big playground. In challenges mode, you can do certain challenges for certain modes to unlock new modes and multiplayer characters. You can only have one player doing this, though. Arcade: This mode is where this game shoves it up modern game hineys so hard. This mode is separated in to two parts: Arcade Custom and Arcade League. Arcade League is just like challenge mode except that it has pre-made multiplayer battles. Again, only one play can do this. Arcade Custom is the beauty of the game. You can customize literally EVERYTHING (I mean it too)! Up to 4-player splitscreen can experience chaotic, awesome multiplayer battles on the same screen. What makes this mode so fun is that you can customize: what weapons you can have on the map the characters you want to fight against the map; game modes You will have mode fun with this mode than any othe game you will play in your entire life. You can have up to 14 player on one map (up to 10 bots and splitscreen). The bot A.I. actually reacts to the difficulty, and half the time you are fighting, you feel like you are in a actual war. Rating: I really wish I could rate this game higher. If I could it would be a 25/10. Here's why: No game ever in my life have I had this much fun with my family, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game deserves to be in a Hall Of Fame, because it is a landmark of what so many modern shooters are not today. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal Of Honor. These games are nothing compared to this. If you have a PS2, Origional XBOX, or a GameCube, buy this game. This game will show you why so many FPS's are failing today. I can get bored of Call of Duty in about 3 years. I'm still not bored of this game and it's been out for over 10 years. Follow my advice. Buy this game.. The only game that deserves a 10 for me is none other than TimeSplitters 2. It may be an old game, but it way a true gem! way ahead of its time even for graphics. It's design and concept is fantastic, it's gameplay is second to none. There's nothing quite like it really, it's a mix of Golden Eye and Perfect Dark mixed into one with it's own ingredients sprinkled on-top. The basic premises of the story mode is to collect time crystals from various points of time, wheather it be fighting your way through a dark zombie infested cathedral or fighting aliens on Planet X, it never lets you down! the story mode is only a small part of the mass amount of fun to be had with this game tho! each difficulty from the story mode allows you to unlock new characters for use in Arcade Multiplayer. You can setup bot matches and have wars against zombie, alien, robots and mutants with your friends 4 player! ontop of that are challenge modes to unlock even more crazy characters! and if that wasn't enough, the game throws in a mapmaker to build your own story or multiplayer levels! if your in the market looking for some old great PS2 games to play, then please do yourself a favor and pick this diamond up!. The original Timesplitters game was a decent Playstation 2 launch title that clearly demonstrated Free Radicals technical wizardry when it comes to creating a first person shooter. With extra development time this sequel improved upon virtually aspect of its predecessor. The addictive multiplayer of course remains with modes varying from your standard deathmatches to variants on capture the flag. Every game can be customised allowing the player to choose the weapons that can be used, number of kills required, time limits and even an option to turn on one hit kills. Up to four players can take part via split screen (an option now sadly lost in most modern FPS games) or system link if two Playstations and TVs are available. The majority of the maps are very well designed offering the chance for close or long range combat. An expanded single player mode is now included taking in a short(ish) story mode as well as a number of entertaining challenges. The story mode allows two players to play co-operatively and there is a nice variety of levels in which different tactics and weapons need to be employed. A few uneven difficulty spikes can be frustrating but for the most part these levels are fun to play, particularly with a friend in tow. The challenges offer time and skill based scoring and provide a huge amount of variety. One level sees the player tasked with destroying all the windows of a Siberian outpost as quickly as possible and the next tasks them with surviving for as long as possible against an endless horde of giant hands (yes hands!) armed with machine guns. Overall Timesplitters 2 is certainly the best multiplayer shooter available on the Playstation 2 and at its bargain price still worth picking up even in a world now dominated by Call of Duty.. A brilliant shooter. Tons of content and unlimited fun. Although I do prefer the 3rd installment Future Perfect. 9.5/10:BRUTAL!!! But because it's a formidable series, I will give it a meta score of a 10/10.. This was such a fabulous game that gets little recognition. The CO/OP story and the MP modes were just fun as hell to play. Plus the had a level creator that was fun and easy to use. Played a monay hours of this with my buddy.. This game was my childhood. Over 150 playable characters including but not limited to, the gingerbread man, calamari, a Duck, a snow man, and a gold fish controlling a robots body. There are weapons from many eras in this game, from bricks to laser rifles. If 150 playable characters and an amazing map editor were possible in 2002 then why hasn't any game broken the record for most playable characters since then? Make Timesplitters 4 already or at least have an HD remake of this classic current gen consoles. TimeSplitters 2 is the king of First Person Shooters, and it still is! The game may look repetitive, but the hours of gameplay will make it worthwhile. TimeSplitters 2 makes you imagine your type of action and relive it your way! This game is truly the pinnacle of shooters!. This game is amazing. It's been too long since I played this game. It's just a great game. Timesplitters 2 9.0/10",a must-play classic made by former Rare developers that made Goldeneye and Perfect Dark . visuals are some of the best I have seen on the PS2 . a great shooter that's still one of the most original gaming experiences i've ever played .
352.Guild Wars 2,"The only remaining game-adversary of WoW. Awesome! Graphics, lore, physics, gameplay, events, and no such thing, as ""old content"" you can find players anywhere around, despite specific content age, awesome PvP and WvW. Best mmorpg graphics.. Guild Wars 2 is a masterpiece thatâs kept me hooked since launch. The world is beautifully crafted, the music is hauntingly memorable, and every update feels like it's made with the player in mind. ArenaNetâs dedication to the community is clearâthey always listen, innovate, and prioritize quality-of-life improvements. Itâs rare to find an MMO that feels this alive and dynamic. I canât wait to see what ArenaNet does with Guild Wars 3; I'll be there to support it every step of the way.. I love this game. It respects your time and unlike other mmos there is a lot of things you can do in open world. Action combat is amazing. used to be good, but last few years, content has been eviscerated and now everything that comes out is low quality / budget. budget legendaries, budget expansions, zero new content for WVW, super long/slow development cycles. it's basically just a cash shop with some (pretty tired) gameplayon the side now.. Guild Wars 2 is a testament to what an MMORPG can beâimmersive, dynamic, and endlessly enjoyable. With its player-driven world, engaging combat, and fair approach to microtransactions, it stands out as a must-play title in the genre. Whether you're a seasoned MMO veteran or a newcomer looking for a game that breaks the mold, Guild Wars 2 is worth your time.. don't play if you play from southeast asia or australia. worst ping ever, 4k ping, game will be unplayable, and worst, anet cs will told you its your isp problem, they will deny their **** server, specially won't help asian player, i take it they are racist as **** for that. they only care money, money. with so many asia and aus player, still no megaserver for both, what a mess up, they only want asian and aus money. dont care if they can play or not. I enjoyed quite a few amazing quests here, love the cinematic, but could never understand the guild/community. Too complex in contrast to WoW, I frequently return to GW2 still, as it's amazing in terms of storylines.. This was once a great game, however cost cutting measures have had a negative impact on it. Language-Servers had been merged resulting in very silent player chats, it's plagued by a pay-2-win cash shop (you can buy ingame gold for real world money which in turn can buy you almost anything), content releases got progressively worse in quantity and quality and the customer service is atrocious. Any kind of criticism gets immediately censored, to retain the facade that all is well but let's be honest here: Guild Wars 2 is hobbling on its last leg, trying to milk as much out of its players as it can before the eventual collapse.. It's one of the best MMO's on the market right now, I just think the combat is not really that great. Story - B+ Lore - A Combat - A+ Class design - A Open world content - A+ Endgame instanced content - B Payment model - A Quality of life systems - C The game is fantastic for the price, especially for casual players. But the game lacks polish and also lacks a lot of ease of use featuresyou may find in other MMOs such as a queue system for dungeons and raids.. If you love MMORPGS, don't wait. Guild wars 2 is one of the best MMORPG's ever created. But be aware, there is no grind to it..... Only exploration, questing but not what you would expect, and an amazing story and a welcoming community.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is everything I thought it would be. It has no subscription which is just outright amazing for the quality of the game! Easy 8/10! Great MMO!. Best MMO nowadays as far as I'm concerned, and maybe the one that respects the most the money you invest. There really nothing wrong with Guild Wars 2, and it amuses me that a good game like that had come from NCSoft.. The game is dying, it used to be great but not now. Pros: * It's casual and ""poor"" friendly - If you want to play an mmorpg while working full time, this is the best, and if you can't afford a monthly sub, this is it! * Till Living World Season 4 - It has best features and story is alright. * New player friendly - New players can get to high levels easily now, plus free to play players could also experience a lot of good contents. Cons: * Story - It went real bad after lws4, I don't understand how another country's political problems are a concern for a foreigner(Us), We discover a new land and somehow got involved into their politics (EoD). Apart from story, the scripts have gone bad too, it felt like written by teenagers, the story plots weren't as immersing as it was for PoF. * Content - Not being a monthly sub game, it finally took a toll on them, since there aren't much (or any) new content to put out, they can't sell their expansions like before. EoD is an example of how they tried to sell what little they had. Now they changed to mini expansions (5 bucks less). * Politics - I don't want to get into details, but like any other American entertainment industry, they went political. Funny thing, they sold a ""political inclusion"" and didn't make it look like one, but lately it's changed. Is it worth to buy/play it? Short term - Yes! Go for it. It's worth every penny (till lws4). Long term - Probably not, unless they bring good story later on then go for it (maybe new features too).. Guild Wars 2 (including all of its improvements and expansions) has really turned out to be a wonderful game, one that in many ways has been better than WoW for quite a few years now. When it first came out, I had a hard time getting into the look of the game (coming from WoW) but I came back after a few years and really fell in love with almost everything about it. And since you only pay for expansions and stuff you actually want, it's always there waiting for me to drop in for a few hours.. It's great for the first 100-200 hours or so. You're out in a massive well-crafted world exploring, helping people, and slaying various creatures. The maps are large and detailed and they feel alive due to the living world system. Then, suddenly you reach max level, and it simply starts to get old - and not for a good reason. The tasks simply become far too repetitive and formulaic. Endless thinly-veiled fetch quests, move from point A to point B, click this button here, talk to this guy there. In addition to that, there is artificial difficulty in the form of things simply taking TOO DAMN LONG! What should be a regular mid-boss ends up having a health bar that takes 7 whole minutes to slowly whittle down using the repetitive button-mashy combat wherein you simply cycle through all your abilities without much thought. And yes, I am using the meta DPS build and rotations. It feels like **** I understand its an MMO, but it feels like an absolute slog to play at times. Other games keep longer harder boss fights engaging by having good mechanics and satisfying combat. Multiple phases, skill checks, etc. With GW2? Yeah let's just make this boss ""harder"" by giving him 5x the health he should have. Forget good mechanics, forget satisfying gameplay.. An ACTUAL MmoRPG, and not just some Themepark game like FF14 and WoW, in this game your Legendary Items actually matter, even when crafted almost 10 years ago. This is a real RPG, and the MMO part is also the best ive seen. There are Meta Map Events, which require like 30-50 players doing mechanics correctly, there is no better feeling than actually beating an event because everyone played well. This game deserves better.. Get with the times, and add native controller support. I shouldn't have to rely on the community or steam's overlay. Which is still janky because this game was designed for KB&M only,. Proof that a whole genere can be defined differently. Imo greatest MMO ever.. Nice game from racists... I bought the game with addons and now they just removed it from store.. dirty fascists fight against players for the sake of the west, spanish shame. what kind of racism against Russian players? why did you block access, and even my account, which I didnât log in for 2 years? you guys are nasty **** clowns, i spit on you and laugh out loud. Probably one of the best MMOs on the market right now and i wish that it changed the industry to be more like it. unfortunately the ability to convert in-game currency into premium currency made players that have reached endgame irrelevant to the microtransaction based monetization system and caused the game to have no good endgame content releases for over half a decade and a balance patch timeline of 9 months that usually make the meta worse. Guild wars 2 helped me stay sane during the pandemic. The community is very friendly and mature. The game has the best gameplay of all MMO out there. Fights feels very dynamic and your skills will make the difference not your stats. The game is very generous and quite cheap compared to others. No subs is amazing. You need the expansion for the best specs in game but they come on sale half price frequently but honestly support the devs as they are a smallish studio with great vision.. This is really fun. It's my favorite game. But it is not Korean. So I'm sad.. The game WAS fun until i went in WvW. Theres lots of cheaters. Using the report tool ingame do nothing because they are still there after months, reporting in the forum end in a ban but not of the cheater, you get a ban for something called ""name and shame"". Asking why you get a ban and the cheater not end in a ban because ""you cant talk about anet decisions"". Any post with proof of cheating and expoiting get deleted (videos and screenshots). I did bit of search in google and ive found that the same cheats are there from 10 years ago. rofl.. Just reviewing the story missions of the base game here. This is one of the worst story experiences I've ever had. Mediocre voice acting; a lot of the minor actors sound like they just wandered into the studio. Very strange mechanics, like turret sections where you have to press the number keys to move and shoot the turret, or escort missions where you have to stand right next to but also slightly ahead of the NPC at all times to get them to move. TERRIBLE story progression. All that happens is you meet a few new characters, they die or betray you, and the other characters (most of whom have no personality beyond their fantasy race) are surprised. Then you beat the main boss by hopping on a turret and spamming 1 for 5 minutes straight. After peaking ahead at some story content for the ""Path of Fire"" expansion, it does seem like their writing ability and use of mechanics gets better over time. But the base game is so atrocious and skippable, please do yourself a favor and just skip all the cutscenes. You don't need to know anything besides the Jolly Green Giant guy is the main hero for apparently no reason. That's it.. This MMO need to be standard for all others MMO's. Simple adjusted for hardcore and casual games.. The best MMO out there! It respects your time. It's free to play. Have the best mount system. A lot of cosmetics, the game's second name is Fashion Wars after all... It have dye channels for every single armor, mount, glider, backpiece. You can gather everything. Everything you do in the game gives you experience which means you can level up however you want. The zones are breathtaking and with the implementation of dx11 they are even better now. There is fishing now and is one of the best fishing games in MMO I have seen. The raids, fractals, dungions, strikes are very challenging and fun. The PvP (5v5) and WvW (80vs80vs80) are great way for you to compete with others. There is no boring questing where you need to talk to someone and then go back to return the quest, you just do your thing in the open world and you get rewarded via the mail when you help the guy in that specific area. The friendliest community I have ever seen. Everywhere you go there are waypoints that when you unlock them you can travel to them from the map whenever you are. The loot system is not shared, everyone gets what he deserves, the drop is personal. The experience is personal, The kills are personal. Everyone helps one another because they win from helping you. There is a downed system, where you fight for your life. The crafting system is awesome. Everyone can res everyone. Everyone can heal everyone. The profession class you choose depends only from your play-style and nothing more. There are 12 mounts in the game and every mount does its own thing that helps you traverse the terain and they feel awesome! The best gear you get can take few weeks to get but after that you can use it forever because there is no gear treadmill. Max level is 80 and after you level up you just have fun. Do your thing. Explore, fight, gather, craft, fill objectives, command a squad, help people, roleplay, etc. The options are limitless and some people are afraid of that. Legendaries are a long term goal that for a single legendary it can take months or a year even. Legendaries can be armors, weapons, trinkets, backitems, sigils, runes. They are quality of life items that enables you to swap stats or change visual effect of the item without the need of transmutation charge. The gem store is the way that the game can get some cash from the player but you can buy everything from the gem store, converting gold to gems from the shop. At some point because the game doesn't have fee, you'll feel guilty for playing so much without giving money, so you'll start buying stuff just because of gratitude. Only the expansions are payed but buying Path of Fire, gives you free Heart of Thorns expansion. End of Dragons expansion just released and is super strong, everyone loves it. 10/10. This is a very well made MMORPG, easily one of the best. The world and combat design is top stuff and exploration is the best on offer. It's amazing how much quality content you get without a monthly fee. It's still a bustling game, very active and PVP is a lot of fun. Get it. You've nothing to lose and all to gain.. This game has so much content without a monthly price tag. The world is huge and the quest design so well done. The story is fantastic and even the end game is full of things to so. I loved the multiplayer aspects. I spent hundreds of hours in this game.. Guild Wars 2 is one of the best MMO-RPG at the moment and in the future. With new Updates like ""End of Fire"" you see the developer still love this Game.. zero for this trash. **** buy the game yet are subtly forced ingame to buy more bags, storage, convenience items etc etc through the most imaginative ways. 2. game engine is obsolete. You would think they would do something with all the money they get. NOPE 3. zero QoL updates. Absolutely zero for a game that is out 11 years now. Finished a quest? you need to go back to deliver it. In other mmos you get your reward and continue playing, not here. here you must go back to deliver your quest and go back to wherever you were. nice 4. Mounts are the worst i ever seen. So heavy and cumbersome 5. said mounts are in steps. The first mount runs, the second jumps a bit higher, the third hovers on water, the fourth glides, and the fifth flies a bit better :D see what they did here? 6. No option to hide other peoples magic effects-cosmetics etc. obviously this game was not done for raiding, the term wow rejects has some basis here 7.Progress is horizontal, this means that if you play 3 years and go back to starter areas you are still weak. This has led to expansion areas being empty. Good luck finding help to kill x-y-z boss or anyone to help you qith quests. Everyone is at tyria, no one at expansions **** game is structured in such a way that you make zero gold to be forced to pay to buy gold. 9. If you want to raid you must play specidif builds. No matter what they tell you. If you dont do enough dps you dont raid. simple as that 10. Classes are boring and weird. Rogue with staff? mage with sword? ranger with double daggers? And a ton of other fails i could mention here but dont take my word, go play the free version and make up your mind. Imma head back to wow, the true king. Other mmos should copy what wow does if they want money. the skyscale collection is the most frustrating quest i face in a videogame, it is almost impossible to do this quest without a group in cetain point, to make the matter worse it is not good for the business since guild wars if filed with cosmetics in game purchases.. My favorite mmo. It takes and fixes almost everyting that is wrong with wow. And the new things it presents are very solid at worst.. Guild Wars 2 could be the best game in the world, but there is no Russian localization. Arena net is the most greedy company in the world. They sell the game, they sell skins in the game, but they can't find 3 cents for Russian localization. This is discrimination against the ru-community.. -Clunky ui - you CANT hide other peoples effects, enjoy your epilepsy in raids - want to craft something? does that something need 9 prerequisites? do you have the mats? enjoy crafting 9 items before the one you want as opposed to making right away the item you need -you cant patry to finish quests quick, you need to kill 10 wolves by yourself :D the game doesnt want you to party -only centaurs as enemies, and bandits sometimes -complicated store system -millions of currencies wtf? -mediocre story -more centaurs to kill, maybe join them? They don't seem to end -you can have 2 professions only, you have to BUY to have more and THEN PAY to swap active professions or crafting disciplines as they call it to differ from competition xD -no fishing............................ lmao -people pay money on this game for years now yet i fail to see how all this money was invested in the game, if at all -centaurs centaurs centaurs. I got tired of killing centaurs. once i killed a stray rabbit. felt good mon, to break the monotony you know -sold a ton of items in my bag of 8 slots(dont be dense son you got to pay to get big bags here) and i got 30 rupees. Used a teleport payed 54 rupees............................................ -end game dungeons are boring af - community 60% toxic 40% pretty nice people -more centaurs to kill wtf man - missing or losing your target, only to retarget something else that has full energy to come and kill you wtf? -ranger pet...... if you played ranger in wow, try something else here, thank me later. -leveling is extremely slow. Only gets decent when you get some xp boosters. otherwise 10% from food on 50exp is nothing -saved the best for last. You pay? you get good gear. You don't pay? Wat u doin here son? go play some **** stopped as soon as i hit 80 just to see if endgame it got better. It didn't :D If you like a good Mmo either try wow, or its f2p dying clone Rift. GW2 has failed miserably. NCSOFT, when you see that name just move on, simple as that. This game hasnt seen new content or raids in over 2 years and if the coming expansion doesn't deliver many more will quit playing. The game's not perfect, but it's pretty close to that. The features in this game stand out so much, that you will have a hard time finding something similar. From World vs World to Competitive PvP, to World Exploration and Living Story, or even end game PvE like Fractals and Raids, there is something from everyone. The mount system is one of it's kind, the hybrid action/tab targeting combat is insanely deep not to mention the friendliest community in any MMO.. The phrase ""never play on patch.-day"" never fitted any game better then guild wars 2. Well and from patch-day I went to patch-week to patch-month, because not only are patches released incredibly buggy - they stay bugged for SEVERAL months if not years. Overall the storytelling is ok-ish. I've seen better, I've seen worse. The quality of the patches got worse and worse with every release. The content feels like the same thing over and over again. Most things you do ingame are not rewarding at all. For players that spend a longer time ingame there is simply not enough to do. What do I mean by that? Let me tell you what my playtime looks like: Mondays I jump in the game, just to do the weekly raid reclears in like 2 hours (raids, that have been in the game for years. The release of the last raidwing is more than a year ago...) Some evenings I do a quick fractal run which cant keep my group entertained for more than 30 minutes. Farming at this point is pointless - you cant progress gear and I dont want to build duplicate legendaries. But Arenanet stated - against what players want - that there will be no more dungeons and as far as I know no more raids. Content draught which gets me to stop playing. And lastly the cashshop: What started off as some nice cosmetic rewards got a dump of putting new stuff in every other week just to earn more and more money. This isnt bad in itself, but selling CHAIRS? The shop got quite ridicculous... TL;DR So all in all: A game that started off good a while ago, but cant deliver any content that keeps you playing. To top all of this off the content that is currently in the game is severely bugged. Content in the game keeps you doing stuff for max ~4h/week if you clear all of it.. First off just let me say that for the era this game came out in, the visuals were second to none. It had breathtaking and imaginative landscapes. This was further expanded on with vistas on the map being interactable showing what was probably the art team's vision of certain maps. The in game soundtrack also has songs I've actually looked for and listened to as background music when I was studying or doing other hobby work. The characters and voice acting does a stellar job of immersing yourself in the world(albeit the main VA's do a lot of background characters so sometimes it can break immersion). The B2P model in this game seems fair although I wish there was incentive to buy larger quantities of credits as there is no bonus for buying larger credit bundles.. that's just my take on it though, the dye does seem TOO pricey though. I also really like the story and got invested into it more than most MMO's. I personally really liked having Rytlock, Canach, and Taimi around. PoF was a breath of fresh air from this game. I tried it out on a whim and it really sold me on the game when the initial release was so underwhelming.. and HoT(Heart of Thorns) didn't garner any interest whatsoever. Honestly it's a stroke of genius the way they handle leveling and expansions. You have a max level and afterwards there are masteries for the content, think of them as additional benefits that give you utility and survivability in the expansions. The way they handled mounts is also great, I really love this system. There's also dynamic map events that are really cool, I've participated in the ones in the HoT area and would recommend people check out. So after all this I imagine most people are wondering ""Well, why the low score?"" and to that the answer is simple. At the end of the day this game is an MMORPG and it should play like one. I've always HATED the combat. A lot of people defend it saying it's the best of the genre. Imagine doing world quests in WoW, killing the mobs you need, then afterwards when you go to loot the mobs your character decides to auto attack another pack when you're at low hp and then you die. Idk why your character queues up auto attacks when your current target is dead, this is a huge oversight. Also unlike WoW where your character can auto target nearby hostile or only auto attacks mobs that are targeted, this one will just auto target mobs like 80 yds away. It seems like these people and myself are playing 2 entirely different games. There are monsters that fall into normal, bronze, silver, gold, and then boss quality. Some of the mobs in the game are normal(looking at you LWS2&3 and HoT mobs) that are as difficult as silver quality mobs. Silver quality mobs are like impossible for the normal person to solo. I feel like this game has a lot of BS moments where there was nothing I could do in the fight to guarantee my survival.. and I mean vs regular mobs, not even special boss mobs. Unlike in WoW where you fight a group of mobs, and it's uncommon for a group to chain CC you.. in this game you pull a group, every one of them is going to CC you and YOU WILL DIE. I know it makes the game ""more challenging"" but it also amounts to having a very poor player experience. The combat in the game is very janky overall, very akin to the trash combat in ESO.. GW2 is one of those buy once, play whenever MMOs. Which would be nice, except, if you only buy the base game you are terribly limited, but at least you can figure out whether you want to spend more money on this garbage. If you want all the classes, the minimum amount of character slots, all the playable territories at least a small amount of Quality of Life features, then you'll need to spend over 200 EUR on the game, and then you didn't spend any of lootboxes, cosmetics, gold, or other items. That's just the bare minimum you should spend, if you want to play this game ""seriously"". Yes, you can buy gold. You can choose to grind days for a legendary item, or... You can deliver pizzas IRL for a few hours and spend some EUR to buy said legendary item. You can spend money in the game, so you have to play the game less! And you should. As the economy is, and always was, and will be, in complete shambles. Meaning, that 99.9% of all items are sold for vendor price on the auction house. Professions are really boring, and besides their forced and stale ""legendary and ascended item crafting"" ""feature"" there is nothing interesting about them. Items in general are ridiculously bland and dumb. There is almost no gear progression. Once you hit lvl80 (and you should not grind 1-80, just pay around 30 EUR for a lvl80 boost!) you can buy the second best gear for only a few gold. After that you may get a legendary or ascended gear, which is only a few percent stronger than the starting gear. In other words: LOOT IS MEANINGLESS in this game, as you'll never ever find equipment that is an upgrade for you. The world might seem big, but - and I am NOT exaggerating - they are pretty much the same area copy pasted on each other with the same textures and layout. Almost all areas contain the exact same mobs, doing the exact same thing (mostly nothing, really). The developers have less creativity than a 3 year old. The game is ugly, even for a 9 year old MMO. If you spend some money on the cash shop you can look alright, and some boss monsters look nice, but generally the whole world and the enemies your fight and the loot you wear is U-G-L-Y. The game is not new player friendly AT ALL. If you start to play this game then for the first hundred or so hours will be spent googling and reading wikis, as the game doesn't teach you anything at all. Classes are really boring and badly designed except for a small handful of specs. Abilities are pathetic and you only have a tiny few of them. There is no balance either. Everyone, even PvPers agree that PvP is one of the worst in all MMOs. The game mode is pretty much abandoned by the devs and also by the players - population is really, really stow. There are bots, afkers, win traders in almost all games. The meta is stale, and the class imbalance is nowhere close this big in other MMOs. The matchmaker mixes together everyone from all rank brackets. PvP has a big brother called Realm vs Realm. Think Alterac Valley just bigger and dumber and abandoned by the devs. The reward loops are super awful in the game. If you are looking for some of the MMORPG looops, GW2 has almost none of them. The game incentivises one player having multiple accounts. The community is quite anti-social and autistic. The developers don't care, they never did, and never had any talent to make MMORPGs. Two things are nice in this game: Fractals (a sort of PvE dungeons) Music -> The composer, Jeremy Soule was metood from the company, so you will not hear from him again.. This game is exactly having everything that the MMO game needed!!! I played this game for 4 years and it doesnât make me feel boring at all. Guild Wars 2 is a game with a very large Open World map that players can feel free. The maps in the game are very complex, which makes me consider this game to be the best game map compared to any game I have ever played. If you thought it would be boring to adventure on this large map, you are wrong!! Because in this game, when you reach a certain level, you can complete quests that will gives you a riding animal called that makes your adventure is very amazing. For example, griffins that can fly you through the vast world of the game, raptors that bring you to walk around with high-speed and the stingray that in this game are called skimmer that can bring you adventure underwater. Collecting level in this game for me is a lot of fun because it has a unique leveling system unlike any other game and very freedom. If you feel that doing quests in other games that quests will have the same loop and same pattern, that is something that will never happen in Guild Wars 2 for sure, cause this game has many quests for players to choose. The monsters in the game have different habitats according to the map and there are many different types of them, which will make your quest and your adventures more wonderful. Battles are more tactical, skillful, and very fun than any other MMO too. The interesting thing about this game is not just the gameplay but also the story of the game. Playing this game for me is no different from watching a good movie because the story is rich and interesting. So, if you are looking for a MMO game to play, you shouldn't miss out on Guild Wars 2!!!. Whoever thought of making the underwater quest maps should be FIRED ON THE SPOT. I really try to like the game. I even have 600h hours played in it. Byt playing ONE OF THE **** WATER QUESTS makes me want to commit suicide, or at least delete the game. Thing that should take 15 minutes and be a Ipeace of cake tool 90 minutes because of **** up level design. I kept going back to the same spot time after time again. I really want to love GW2, but being forced to play those mentally **** quests makes me want to puke, and throw the laptop into the wall... This ""quest"" was made 8 years ago. They had 8 years to make it reasonable. They could not be bothered to fix it... That is why I have to give it low score. Shame, but it has to be done. For the future of the game itself. If they can't fix one thing for years, then you cant trust them with anything.. Absolutely horrific customer service. 5,000 hours into the game and forgot my password. I have 10 or 12 characters fully leveled and spent a couple thousand dollars on the game over the years. I'm trying to reset my password and the customer service is no help at all. It's almost like they enjoy it. I told them two character names on my account and then they wanted more. I tried really hard all day long to remember and came up with two more character names. I described their class, race, sex and dye colors. I told them how many hours I had in playtime, the last time I played. They just keep saying ""Nope. We need the information on file."" So vague about it. I couldn't remember my address from 8 and a half years ago. Then I remembered it and told them. ""Nope."" It's very simple why they won't give me a password reset. They want me (like so many others they've forced) to repurchase the game and DLC's. I wouldn't buy an ANET game if it was 90% off and I was using someone else's money. The EA Games of MMOS. It's the only MMO that has been able to have me more than a week. I'm not a great fan of the genre but i think it has cool mechanics and a very interes","the world is beautifully crafted, the music is hauntingly memorable, and every update feels like it's made with the player in mind . with its player-driven world, engaging combat, and fair approach to microtransactions, it stands out as a must-play title in the genre . with so many asia and aus player, still no megaserver for both ."
353.Forza Motorsport 2,"The game is heaven, i can play it day and night, the graphics are good and the same with physics, i just love this game. It was my childhood game.. One of the best racing games of all time, only losing to it's sucessors, FM is a 10/10 franchise and this game is one of the reasons, Gran turismo is not even close.. They deceived me with Gran Turismo. I was his biggest fan and now I hate the saga for deceiving me by hiding this jewel that surpasses him in everything. He kicks Gran Turismo lying fanboys. Very much in the Gran Turismo school of racing games, its format is very similar with challenges grouped by car performance, driver experience etc. Technically very well done, but like Gran Turismo success seems to depend far more on how many upgrades you've made to your car rather than your skill behind the wheel. Not as anal as its ""inspiration"" though, and rather more fun to play as a result.. This is in my opinion the second best Motorsport game and also the one that started it all.. Truly one of the best racing games of all time. Still holds up nowadays, easily, in all factors, from gameplay to graphics ect. While some aspects of the game can be punishing, the career mode really is just very good game design.. The layout is just so simple and brilliant, I still play this in 2021! Cars are quality Tracks are solid Graphics top notch. Barebones, unpolished full price demo of a racing game. Why there is so many good reviews? I don't get it, lol. I have only one rule for a racing game: if driving isn't satisfying - the game is bad, and I don't mean just ""it ****"" or else like it. The only difference between cars in FM2 is just drive wheels and I mean that's almost it. There's no feel to weight, power in a class of cars, speed, handling - nothing of it. It's just 4WD, FWD or MR. This is just pathetic.. The best racing simulator i have ever played. The gameplay is perfect, the sound is amazing, and the graphics are stunning. No other Forza (with the possible exception of Motorsport 4) even comes close to this one.. a very good racing game and also a good coaster. the turning is a bit stiff though. This is an excellent racer, it has lot's of customisation for vehicles, great races that are balanced. Car roster is excellent & physics & sound are spot on. In 2018 this racer is great.. Graphics: 8.5 Sound: 8.5 Gameplay: 8.0 Fun/Story: 8.5 A good and solid game but not as good as some reviews said. Graphics are a little clear, good but not much detailed.. I have spent a stupid number of hours playing this game, which says it all for it's gameplay and graphics, the amount of cars is massive and the game only misses out on a 10 by not having enough tracks but saying that there were enough to entertain me for years and I only picked up Forza 3 recently because it was Â£3. What more can be said it's a racing/driving simulator and it works better than others on the market.. Review on the single player: PRESENTATION: - Graphics are good even today. The cars are authentic and detailed, you can tell it's a high quality production. The environment and maps are realistic yet a bit boring, especially after seeing the same scenery over and over. Also note that car decals look grubby. Still a good looking game. - The music is good electronic music in the menu's, but apart from that there aren't any good memorable original Forza songs. Sound effects of the cars are pretty realistic but nothing to write home about. GAMEPLAY: - There is no story, expected from a racer, but the game feels very dead. There's no one talking to you, it's just select a race and drive, nothing else. - Driving feels authentic and realistic and still maintains to be fun and addictive. It has loads of cars with tons of authentic customisation options. Being a realistic racer though, it comes with some pacing issues. It starts off slow with bad cars. Once you get the hang of it you'll start unlocking good cars and the game really starts to pick up. Once you get into the Race class (after the supercars) though the game is tedious: a single cup will take you about 60 mins because you're doing about 8 laps per race. The first two laps are always fun but after that it's 95% of the time already determined if you're going to win or lose. The game gives you the options to make it as hard or as easy as you want it to be, but since you don't want to spend 15 mins to do one race over again you want to start a race knowing you can win. Finding a good balance is hard and the game leaves it up to you to find it. VERDICT: It's great as a realistic racer, but as a game gets a bit tedious after a while + tons of real cars with authentic customisation + fun and realistic driving mechanics - it feels a bit dead with the same scenery over and over and little overall variation - it gets very tedious further in the game as you're spending so much time doing one race 7.4/10. Continuing on from the very impressive debut of Forza on the original Xbox, this iteration is a solid sequel on the new console, albeit not being revolutionary as the first one. The game mechanics is once again excellent and is backed up by a large pool of cars. Graphics are good but not as spectacular as some of the others, such as PGR3. Thankfully, it isn't going to detract you from the actual racing experience that much so it isn't that big of a problem. There are three different modes: Career, Exhibition and Multiplayer. Exhibition is a selection of time trials and quick races, in which you can unlock cars for multiplayer and quick races (unfortunately not for career races). Multiplayer not only includes the usual 8-player races (both online and split-screen), but also a Auction House for you to trade cars with other players online. This is a very welcome addition as some user-created paint jobs are simply awesome. These cars can be used for any game mode, and thus is pretty useful for obtaining high-end cars which you may not have unlocked yet in career mode. As expected, Career Mode forms the main bulk of the game, with 90 events and more than 300 races. These are separated into 9 tiers and gives you a good sense of progression throughout the game. You start with lowly D-Class cars before slowly working up the ladder with some truly awesome R1 prototype race cars. However, the spectacular game mechanics and wide range of cars are not quite backed up the limited variety of tracks. There are only around 15 different race locations (excluding reverses and variations) and unfortunately, as you progress through the game, this can get quite repetitive and tiring, and can be a bit **** from there onwards. I find myself having to switch between different events simultaneously to keep my interest going. Overall, this is a very worthy addition for every racing gamer out there. Actual racing is brilliant, selection of cars is fantastic, graphics are solid, but limited number of tracks lowers the fun factor a little bit. I would give it a 9 for its actual gameplay, but its slight repetitiveness makes it an overall 8 for me.. God, racing simulators are boring. If I wanted to drive a car, then I'd drive a car. I don't play games to experience simulations of reality. I'd go outside if I wanted that.. This was the first racing game I have ever played - and was it a treat!! Hours of my life were killed playing this game - and I don't regret it for even a second. I've tried other racing games since I first played this one - and none compare to this one (at least on the Xbox 360). You have to invest some serious time into this game (and tuning the car properly has a serious learning curve) - but the overall experience is just pure joy. One of the best 360 games EVER!!. The best driving game available on the Xbox 360, but with enough flaws to show that there. It's got to be a THE benchmark for any non-arcadish racing game. For 2007, this game was all you could ever want from a racing game. Realistic, endless customisation and not over-saturated number of events like in Forza 3. Multiplayer is good too. What does **** is the highly outdated graphics. The graphics for the cars are more like 2004 than 2007. When I first played this game I simply could not believe the amount of conetent. Precision tuning and easy-to-understand painting. There's no piece of art that can't be recreated on Forza 2. You can literally make any design with ease. The tuning includes explanations and you can save set-ups. The auction house allows you to buy and sell cars. The multiplayer lets you choose everything- especially the restrictions, such as the power limit, wight limit, car class, tuning setup, upgrades etc. Although the only thing in the career is just circuits with different cars, the arcade mode has pre-set challenges. You are given the car, the track and time to beat. With a wide variety of cars- everything from Rabbit GTi and Toyota 2000GT to the Hennessey Dodge Viper and Chrysler ME Four-Twelve. The tracks are impressive too. The only issue is that the cars are often just the same car copied and pasted but with different sponsor logos. Other than that, they all feel different to drive. The difficulty is wide-ranging too. Having never played a simulator or a console racing game before this, I was able to jump on and pick up playing with no assists. So it's user-friendly and you do get rewarded with more XP and money for playing on a harder difficulty. This game does everything well, and even if there's something you don't like, the complete package as a whole is almost perfect for its time of release.. All right, Forza Motorsport 2 is the best Forza Motorsport game so far. Forza Motorsport 3 doesn't stack up to Forza 2, the only problem is that you have to do the same tracks over and over, and it gets boring. But other than that, this still gets a 9 out of 10.. Forza Motorsport 2 is a great simulation racer; there are loads of cars and lots of tracks, with in depth customisation and almost too many events in which to race, you will spend many, many hours trying to complete and perfect each one. 3/5.. This was my favorite racing sim before FM3 came out. Lacking single players, but multiplayer and customization were king. This game was better than any GT before GT5.. I bought this game way after its release whenever it was because it was cheep and I just bought a 360. I almost knew that i would be dissapointed but I booted it up and I found a very good game. The car selection was good. They have all the good racing cars and even some just regulaur cars like a 2004 punch buggy the courses are good but the first levels of races are all one one track that keeps switchiing it up a bit but the enviroments start to ger bland. The racing is very hard and the diffuculty is good the car cusitmation is good and it is my favorite place to spend my time. Buy this game it is on of mty forite games.. After playing GT5 reciently, I came to the conclusion that Forza 3 has become the one to beat. The people at Turn 10 do everything better, its like they had GT5 on a dart board in their offices. I have to say, that at first I took this game for granted, but after playing every other car sim on the market, this is the one to own. If you like realistic physics, car models, and sounds, this is a must own!!!!. This game is pretty good. It's addictive and there are a lot of cars. The multiplayer was interesting too, though most of the time it boiled down to drag races on the tracks that could support it. What really brought it down for me was the graphics, which are downright bland AND have horrible (I mean awful) aliasing problems. Thankfully FM3 came out and corrected all of the weird problems I mentioned here.. Very underrated, and very cheap. I loved this game back in the day. It has really good visuals and a awesome customize car set up. I really did enjoy this forza game this is definitely one of my favorite racing game. The only thing wrong is that you cant drift as good as forza 3. But I like this game better than the 3rd one. It just has something really awesome about it. Must Buy. I would rate this as a 9.2.. This game is very awsome!The only thing that bothers me is that they seem to have made this in a ****'s like a very shiny version of forza 1.They have added additions and things but with such a great game like Forza 1 they didn't have to come out with this so fast just to show there idea's and the 360 power.Gran turismo takes around 5 years in between making there games because they make a great product that will last that long even though there games are very boring.Forza company is a million times better but they don't have to rush and make a game every 2 **** me 5 is to long also,I would say every 3-4 years because Forza is something special and it has replay value beyond that and it doesn't get **** I have to knock a point off because of that.Forza 3 is amazing and all but a perfect **** original Forza was all but a perfect game in 2005, but for Forza 2 I have to give it a 9.. This is a good game, but it's tricky. The cars can be difficult to handle which can lead to some very annoying moments!!!! But it is good, the graphics are great, it's fun to customise your car (and to smash it up!!), and it does come reccomended.","the best racing simulator i have ever played . the gameplay is perfect, the sound is amazing, and the graphics are stunning . the only difference between cars in FM2 is just drive wheels ."
354.Pushmo,"Super simple game but it's really fun and addictive. The characters are also really cute and nice graphics. Think of Pushmo as a cuter, easier Catherine. It's an addictive game of block pushing to the top to get to the goal. While Pushmo can be a bit tedious at times, especially considering the tutorial; Pushmo always manages to challenge the brain enough to make you want to solve more and more puzzles. When you add this in with creating your pictures that can be turned into puzzles to, it makes for a very addictive experience that any puzzle fan would love to have. Pushmo is a gem of puzzles. Colorful, beautiful and extremely enjoyable, this game is a must-own on 3DS.. A good puzzler, inventive while not too challenging until late on. Recommended.. Pushmo is one of the worst games on the eshop. The level design is so boring and it's always really similar. The characters are pretty boring too and all look the same. Masterpiece! this game is awesome of most intelligent and fun for 3ds! I really like the serie of Pushmo, Stretchmo and Crashmo. The games is beauty, simple and very fun! Awesome! Thank you Nintendo for make games really fun and intelligent!!. A clever, well-executed puzzle game. The basic premise and controls mean that this is a puzzle game that anyone can play, with the game introducing the basic game-play concepts through a number of very easy early levels. The trickiness increases as levels progress in just the right amounts to keep the game engaging, and later levels introduce additional elements to increase the trickiness further. There's obviously a finite number of puzzles, but the ability to create and play your own puzzles and play puzzles created by others will keep the game going well after you've completed it. It's a well made, well presented game and, as puzzle games go, it's right up there.. One of my favorite puzzle games! Pros: + challenging + pick up and play + fun characters + level designer + level sharing = infinite puzzles + great value for price Cons: - puzzles didn't get challenging until later in game - can get repetitive. A must have! beautifully made with crazy ideas and addictive gameplay and full advantage of the 3D ability the handheld got. hands down to this puzzler masterpiece. A delightful puzzler that belongs on every 3DS. Loads of charm and a steady challenge. Make sure you try the sequels ""Crashmo"" and ""Pushmo World"", too!. Very good game; maybe great. It lacks a bit of depth and you end up expecting more of each of the following: -game elements (achievements, '3 star system'); -diversity, like game modes, although the 'make your own levels' thing help; -difficulty, found the game a bit easy. its simplicity ends up backfiring. Besides that it is worth your time and money. Fun game in the end.. Easily one of the most unique puzzlers I have played in a long time. Puzzle games are my favorite, and this game doesn't disappoint. The puzzles never got too hard, but I did get some that stumped for a good long while. My only complaint about the game is the replay ability. I don't really care to go back to those puzzles, but I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game so thoroughly. Totally worth my 7 bucks.. I have never been big on puzzlers. So maybe that's why I didn't enjoy Pushmo (Or Pullblox as its called in Europe) as much most others seemed to. At the start of the game, the puzzles are simple and very fun to solve. Naturally as you progress they become more challenging. One confusing thing I have noticed is that the way they rank difficulty on the puzzles is very inconsistent as some ones labeled as difficult can be rather easy and vice versa. Anyhow, that is but a minor detail in the game. What I find stops me from giving the game a higher grade and buying the sequel is the fact that I just didn't have that much fun playing it. The graphics are good, the dialouge is funny, the puzzle mechanics are very original. But I just simply didn't have very fun with it, and had to force myself to grind through the end of it just because I wanted to finish it all. Maybe its like I mentioned, I'm simply not big on puzzlers. I do recommend this game for people who like puzzle games and solving tricky things. If you are like me, and arent a big fan of puzzle games, then youre probably better off getting something else. 6 of 10 in my book.. Sometimes the simplest ideas work best, which is the case in Pullblox, the best puzzle game on e-shop. The aim of each level is to reach the flag by pulling out the colourful, differently-shaped blocks to be able to get your cute sumo wrestler guy Mallo to the goal. He can walk, jump, and pull blocks, thatâs it. I know it sounds weird and unappealing (especially when explained by me), but actually itâs a fresh, innovative and addictive game. The levels get exceedingly difficult and leaves you wondering how the hell you do it. If youâre stuck for long enough, it allows you to skip to the next level, but I think a super guide would have been better. Halfway through the game, pullout switches are adde. These, if stepped on by Mallo, trigger every block that is the same colour as the switch to come out all the way. There are also manholes, which Mallo climbs down to appear in a different place on the level. These thoughtful additions make Pullblox more complicated, but not too complex as to ruin the core idea. The levels are often surprisingly tiny yet could still tax for an hour or more. If done right of course, you could complete them in half a minute. Which brings up another thing: there are no enemies at all- just you, and the blocks. For an e-shop download, Pullblox holds you for ages and ages, with tonnes of levels, many being murals that look like objects, and famous 8-bit Nintendo characters. You can also design your own levels. This is a massive replay opportunity that makes Pullblox yet better. You can then turn the level into a QR code and another 3DS can then hover over it and download it. I wouldâve preferred an online sharing system instead though, like in Mario and Donkey Kong. Pullblox is the first game you should download from the e-shop.. Essential 3DS game to own and play. Great visuals and content, catchy music and adorable characters. Great puzzle gameplay with the option to create your own puzzles and download more that others have made over the net by QR codes.. Pushmo is an enjoyable puzzle game with nice visuals, and I really enjoyed it. I'm not the greatest at creating my own puzzles, but some of the ones I downloaded from other users were impressive. A great game overall, definitely what the eShop needs.. This is a pretty interesting take on 3D puzzle design. I think I've grown a little tired of it at this point after buying it back in early 2012. It's not my favorite type of puzzle game, but it gives a decent challenge and the content is virtually endless since players can create and share their own levels. You'll never run out of content, but you might run out of interest after playing most of the levels available just in the core game alone. It just depends on your personal taste and worth the money to give it a shot either way. It's main idea is executed very well and will probably be something I return to play every so often when I'm bored.. I don't see how so many people can enjoy this game... I'm not criticising any of you, but this game is not for me. I was excited about the prospect of this game and especially when seeing such a high user score, but i was generally disappointed.. Honestly, I can't usually get into puzzle games. But this one is just so cool and fun. Simple yet deep. Yes, the first few dozen puzzles are very easier, but they're still fun and get you used to the concepts. ANd the difficulty does ramp up. I'm on puzzle 71 now out of 250. It is addictive. I also find the 3D effect super helpful in this game. It really does serve a purpose and make the puzzles easier to visualize and solve. Also, being able to get new puzzles online is super easy. Websites have already collected some very cool user-made versions and you just scan that weird looking code right off the website with your 3DS camera and it instantly downloads the puzzle. Super easy. Lastly, I'll just say for me, I love how your character controls. He's the roly poly little character you move around and he has this wonderful sense of lightness to him, but also weight. Not sure how else to explain it. But this game is a treat. And for $7, money very well spent. And with the fantastic 3D effect, a great way to feel like this is a game that wouldn't be half as much fun on any other system.. I've had many, many hours of fun with this thing. Gameplay consists of pushing and pulling platforms in an effort to create a path for yourself to get to the top (typically) of a structure. That description might not make anyone jones to try the game, but I assure you, it winds up being pretty dang fun. Some later puzzles get a bit aggravating, especially when you get to the point where your only option is to reset the level and try again. All in all, lots of hours of puzzle-platform'y fun.. The gameplay in Pushmo is very fun and addictive, but very simple. The simple puzzles can range from very easy to extremely dificult. The mural levels all have a distinct feel as they all represent a pixelized image. However, the regular levels get boring after a while as they all have the same colors, and sometimes even the same structure types or **** Lasting Appeal is greatly boosted due to being able to create custom levels as well as download levels with a QR code. There is a problem with this though. There is no online sharing for QR codes so I had to go on the internet and look up Pushmo QR codes on google. The potential isn't reached and I think it would've been better if they made sharing online, maybe with leaderboards and maybe a top 25 downloaded.. Absolutely a must buy for every 3ds owner! In my opinion it is somehow better than tetris but of course we cannot deny the fact that tetris is a legend in this genre of games. Nevertheless, I know many will agree with me that this game is worth buying than tetris.. This game is purely fun and enjoyable. At first it kinda dragged because of the simpleness, but after the 18 tutorial stages it gets harder and harder and the levels begin to look more interesting. This also comes with a stage creator (Which I am obsessed with) and you can scan QR Codes from the internet or with friends to swap creations! This game is definitely worth $7.00 (actually I would've paid more XD). GET THIS GAME :) 10/10 :D. This game one the best original 3DS puzzle game to date. The puzzles are extremely clever making you feel smarter every time you solve one. This is a certain must buy for the 3DS.. Pushmo (also known as Pullblox in other regions) is a puzzle game for 3DSWare. Although the game's visuals and audio are nothing special, it shines at it brightest in gameplay. The game in a nutshell is rearranging sets of blocks to get from Point A to Point B, although it starts out fairly simple and easy (and a bit tedious in all honesty) in the beginning, later into the game more features such as ladders and buttons get added to the mix along with bigger structures to make the experience far more difficult and complex. The satisfaction you get from completing the later levels after being stuck for awhile feels truly rewarding and satisfying. The game also comes with a level editor with gains more features and tools the further you make it though the story campaign and custom level sharing is done through scanning QR codes. With well over 200+ story mode puzzles and 100+ save slots for the level editor stages you create yourself or scan from others, you can get a surprising amount of replayability out of the game overall. I would easily recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games.. This game is pure diabolic. The gameplay is extremely simple but sadistically addictive, the puzzles are ingeniously clever and it is suitable by and playable to anyone. At the price of Â£5.00, Pushmo/Pullblox is one of the best downloadable games on the 3DS. I would've given it a 10 if it had multiplayer because as I played through puzzle after puzzle, it was begging for co-op. Buy this. Let it consume you.. pushmo is sorta fun but when it comes to takeing and doing levels it's hard but what I have seen so far it looks cool. I wish people would think of making a cooler game than anyother game.. Can't recommend buying this game any quicker. It's addictive, original, and pretty. If you like puzzle games at all it's a must-buy, and if you don't I would still say to give it a try, because I think it will convert you. If you get bored of the built-in levels, you can create your own and share them with friends via QR codes - a great feature that I wish Nintendo would implement more of. The only reason the game doesn't get a 10 from me is because the tutorials seemed to drag on unnecessarily. The first several levels were pretty easy with a few random head-scratchers thrown in, but the difficulty ramps up at a pretty steep pace further into the game. I would have liked it if it had been more gradual, because by the time you get to the real challenges, you are a little spoiled with easier levels and the gameplay isn't as fresh. Overall, the cute visuals, addicting gameplay, nostalgic chiptunes, and the ability to share puzzles makes this a must-have for 3DS owners, and it's a bargain for $7.. Pushmo is a huge leap in the world of puzzle games. Not only is it perfect in almost every way, the replay value is jaw-dropping, since there are over 100 pre-installed puzzles, plus you can create your own puzzles and share your levels via QR codes. One look at others levels and you can tell Pushmo is a fantastic game with a fantasticly simple level creator.. I admit this game is addictive.... BUT, there's really no challenge here whatsoever til you get past stage 50! THEN, switches and tubes are introduced and goes back to 1 and 2star difficulty for another40 levels or so. Just now starting to enjoy the game. I can't rate it higher than a 6 for this reason. 20 good stages, and with most at about 1 minute a piece isn't that great a deal. I give this game a 10 not because it's the greatest thing ever made, but because not only it is one of the most original puzzle experiences on the market (for a killer price tag), but also because it is one of the very few games that justify the existence of stereoscopic 3D in gaming. On top of that, the user generated content enhances the experience tremendously. So yeah, if you have a 3DS, it's a must buy, an AAA game, a system seller, a killer app, or whatever you want to call it.. I made an account just to recommend this game. Pushmo is absolutely amazing. The main game is fun but making your own puzzles is an absolute blast! You can either try to make a puzzle or make a drawing and they try to TURN it into a puzzle. I cannot tell you how fun it is to try to solve your own drawing and then have to add different blocks/pipes/pull outs just to make it solvable. Then, after you finally do, try it again. You may still have a difficult time and YOU MADE IT! After you solve it once, you can make a QR code for it and post it online (So that means ANY puzzle you find can be solved) and others can then try to solve it. I can't wait till my next plane or car trip with friends. Making puzzles then handing it over and seeing how long/who can solve them will be such a time killer. If Pushmo just came with the main 200+ levels it would be worth $7. If Pushmo came with 200+ levels and downloadable levels that you maybe even had to pay for it would be worth the $7 If Pushmo came with 200+ levels and then you could create your own, it'd be worth the $30-$40 we pay for a cartridge game. But no, Pushmo comes with 200+ levels, you can create your own levels, then you can share them and download other people's creations FOR FREE using QR codes and it only costs $6.99!!! If you have paid $249 when the 3DS came out or $169 when it was discounted and you do not pay $6.99 for Pushmo, you are only screwing yourself. There is a reason this is the highest rated 3DS game on Metacritic, and it's low price is only a little part of that reason. Absolutely amazing game.. One of the most interesting puzzle games I've played in quite a while. From the charming visuals, to the adorable music, the head scratching puzzles, and very long adventure, for $6.99, this game is one of the best downloadable titles out there.. This game is totatilly great!!! this is the first great game from the eshop for nintendo 3ds. The puzzles are great and you can make yours and share it, very interesting. Maybe it's to simple, but you have arround 250 puzzles and more. people are crazy with their puzzles! I recomend this game for only 6 euros.. Awesome game. It is really different and interesting. I love the fact that one can make your own puzzles. It is challenging at times, but I am still early in the game but I don't see how this game can get any worse. It just always seems to get better. It is a interesting puzzle game and uses the 3D effect of the 3DS very well. A must own for 3DS users.. Absolutely fantastic. It reminds me of the best Zelda puzzles, mixed with Mario, mixed with Tetris. Actually, there is nothing else quite like it, which is why it is so good. It's hard to explain how great this game is until you're working on your 100th level. A must own, 10/10.. PullBlox (Pushmo) is a bargain. For a very small price, you'll get one of the best puzzle game since a while. Bravo to intelligent System for bringing us such an enjoyable and addictive game.. Excellent game, wonderfully designed for on-the-go gaming. Makes great use of the 3D effect and is an excellent addition to the eShop. Once you get past the initial ""tutorial"" levels, things start to really heat up. You can be looking at a puzzle for 10 minutes before you see the answer. Great game, puzzle fans won't be disappointed!. This chraming puzzle game is absolutely brimming with content. Over 200 splendid puzzles are here to occupy your time, and a healthy majority are delightfully challenging, and only for $7! On top of the great amount of content, the game also lets you build your own stages, which is fun to experiment with and share. This is probably the first game on the eshop that I recommend buying without hesitation. What are you waiting for? :). Brilliant game. The only thing it lacks is sending QR codes to friends somehow. Oh well :] This is the best game on the eShop by far. Plus, it's only $7.00!. If you are a fan of puzzle games (especially Catherine), and own a Nintendo 3DS system, this is a must-own. Also, I believe this is the best bargain game of the year. For a measly 6.99, you will be entertained ( and sometimes joyfully frustrated) for hours with the original game mode, and endless hours more with the level creator. Great bargain, great game, just do it already.. Get this game! It is the most enjoyable game I've played on my 3DS so far, and for a mere $7.00, it's a great deal! It includes 250 puzzles and the capability to add or download even more!. The only negative is the early levels are extremely easy and present almost no challenge. Once the levels get a little tougher it becomes a lot more fun. Even better though is the Studio setting where you can create your own Pushmo puzzles. At $7.00 it's a great deal.. I recommend Pushmo! It is a fun puzzler but with platformer controls. Combine Mario-like control with Zelda switch action and you have Pushmo. Also the protagonist, Mallo (like the cloud kid from SMRPG) is a cute little red sumo wrestler shy-guy. Buy this game.","think of Pushmo as a cuter, easier Catherine . addictive game of block pushing to the top to get to the goal . good puzzler, inventive while not too challenging until late on ."
355.Freedom Force,"Incredible game. Compelling experience from start to end. If you like games in this genre you must play it.. Unique hack & slash kind of game in comic style. Very fun to play back then, with interesting story and characters.. The first game ive given 10 out of 10 to on this site, find most are much to generous with their 10s. If you can find any part of the game your not happy with its not a 10, and even if you cant find any obvious faults with a game its still not necessarily a 10 it needs that little bit extra that makes it exceptional. For this game the extra is charm, Oh boy does this game have charm! This game was so much fun and it just kept on going not losing pace even at the end, wont claim that this game is for everyone but youd be hard pressed to find a similar game that did what this game does better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Loved the content. Lots of characters and each very diverse. None of the premade characters are overpowered. Long storyline. Interactive/Destructible environment.Game has tons of replayability. Having a ""danger room"" adds to that replayability. Allowing the gaming community to add ingame skins, mods, sound effects, seemlessly is one of the greatest features to make that game unique with every run through. Was going to rate it 9/10 simply because the controls (especially the camera) are a bit clunky without any modifications. However, all the easily available freebees prvided by players (listed above) and the ease with which they can be implemented/utilized overcomes the one glaring annoyance.. The game is pretty terrible. I love the art and the over-the-top comic book-esque voice acting, and the atmosphere really captures that comic book feel, but the gameplay is awful. Though the basics are in place, click something to interact with it, it's the extras that just flat out fail. There are pseudo-stealth elements to the game, and they just do not work. Enemies can see you no matter where you stand, your character is too slow and inaccurate to react accordingly. In fact, the slow pace is very obvious throughout. The characters seem to wade through water, and though your character is noticeably faster when running (at least compared to enemies) he manages to have the attacking speed of an epileptic sloth, and, on the rare occasion when a projectile based attack hits, you have basically wasted your time because of the sheer slowness of the game. The earliest (and best) example of this, that I noticed, was the second mission. Though this is supposed to be a tutorial mission, unfortunately focused on the aforementioned stealth elements, the overall goal, especially the secondary mission goals, seem to be outright impossible with the guide of the game. Admittedly, if you're clever, you can get around this by ignoring the tutorial, but the point is that it seems to me to be a huge oversight when a tutorial doesn't actually lead to success, at least when it's intention is supposed to be success. Though the game technically works, it has not aged well. The game is slow and plodding and the action is pretty underwhelming. Damage seems completely randomized, ranging from one hit kills (for no apparent reason) to barely scratching the enemy with the same attack an instant later, and, though you can technically react to the situations that play out, I never found anything more useful than letting my character auto-beat the hell out of the enemy with my only input being to tell him which enemy. Though there are many skills to choose, and many characters, it all just seems pointless. This game just suffers from age. The mechanics are either boring or don't work, and, though it has a fantastic setting and voice acting (that really captures that comic book world) it doesn't manage to deliver on the action that should accompany that. It's just overall a disappointing game.. I won't lie, what completely ruined this game for me is the control scheme. I know its opinion but still. I just don't do point and click with a game like this.. By modern standards, this rpg/linear rpg thingy feels bland and not fun. The graphics and art style are great, as well as the voice acting. I just can't continue playing. This game has not aged to well in the gameplay department.","if you like games in this genre you must play this game . i love the art and the over-the-top comic book-esque voice acting . the game is pretty terrible, but the extras just flat out fail ."
356.FIFA Soccer 13,"Graphics are great, gameplay are great, a large number of things you can do is also great, but the fact how many times mechanics can work poorly and cause frustrating moments is a big minus of it, yet you can enjoy playing it ;). I love this fifa.. Yes, i know you want to sound cool and intelligent but raging on a sports game won't get you a girlfriend, the only fifa i am reviewing since it's the one i played the most.. I have for Xbox 360 it's Number one of Era With better graphics and new features. The last FIFA Soccer game that i ever played. The reason is quite simple. The game is simply the biggest example of planned obsolescence. As Call of Duty series, every year is released a ""new"" game. Same engine, same playability, same online gameplay, basically what changes one of another is the title. It doesn't matter that soccer players or teams are updated, every year you pay for the same game. Not even matters next generations bringing more realistic graphics, the game is still the same, but with a better looking. OK, it's funny playing online or offline with friends as COD series, but buy just one copy and period, even game's data is out of date. Buying each year is a dumbness, EA sports is making money easily.. Nothing new, same useless AI, glad to see all 20 premier league stadiums but they should of done that like 5 fifas ago. Defending is some **** impossible task which you would think make games more interesting and more high scoring, but in reality each game is pure frustration and not worth playing. Buy it only to play with friends on local multi-player, but otherwise avoid this game at all costs.. I gave FIFA 13 an extended play through before review In order to fully capture what it has to offer. The new features move the series forward and ultimate team is just as addictive. Pro clubs is miraculously fun and FIFA 13 held my attention for a few months longer than FIFA 12. FIFA 13 is the most realistic, rewarding and replayable FIFA to date.. âIf you are a fan of FIFA games you tend to be quite philosophical, because they tend to build you up then let you down.â FIFA should be a benchmark-setting soccer game with great gameplay and years of thoughtful development & refinement. Currently, it is a husk of latent unfulfilled potential, and is a treated as a blatant cash cow for a lumbering shambles of a company. They also treat their customers with disgrace. If you go to EA Sports forums, they have âventâ treads and any criticism you voice about the game is considered heresy pending a banned account and confinement in the Tower of London. What EA Sports had achieved in the past 10 years would have been easily surpassed by any another studio with more ambition and commitment like Bethesda. When buying a Fifa-EA product, I find myself paying through the nose for their monopoly on licensing & copyright rather than for entertainment. They drip feed 1 or 2 untested âimprovementsâ per year, most of which undermine smooth and consistent gameplay; their flagship features such as randomness, first touch passing and UFC style tackle/collision systems have totally lost the plot. This would be fine if it had been done correctly, but there is no consistency to the implementation here. The game lacks refinement and adding ârandomnessâ to already poor gameplay makes for an extremely frustrating experience. The whole result seems like a rip-off of Madden or UFC. These professional âcriticalâ reviews seem to glorify each FIFA game in isolation of the 10 previous iterations before it, marketing each release as some sort of ground breaking & innovative affair; when in fact there is much less to like. According to EA, âIt doesn't matter if you call it soccer or football, in the end all you need to know is that FIFA is the only way to playâ or so they hope! More work is done by EA Sports in each iteration of FIFA by patches & fixes, than the original game itself. IMHO the lack of innovation, absence of improvement and dreadful gameplay does not marry well with the high asking price.. Why the **** is EA allowed to get away with calling this pathetic piece of **** a game? I can't believe how incredibly bad the AI are, and yet I still play it... Why? Because there are no other football games that are better, so the lazy **** over at EA continue to make the same old **** every year and people buy it.. game completely ****, i dont know how it ended up getting a 6.0 score but its one of the worst games ever. as all fifa series. probably kids have rated it 10. I have played FIFA 13 for a full year now and am a division 1 player in Seasons (as In had been in FIFA 12), so the following criticisms should be put in that context. They are not the ravings of a player that simply has not mastered the controls. By Seasonâs standards, I can play the game pretty well. - The new first touch feature is unrealistic when you have situations where an elegant move is destroyed by the ball bouncing of Messi or Ronaldo's shin it happens regularly in the game when it would not in real life. In effect, it ruins enjoyment of the game. - 'New' attacking AI is worse than FIFA 12 your players make wrong decisions regularly. - One of the few realistic introductions is that referees seem to be as error prone as in real life, which is obviously not a good thing. I loved the introduction of tactical defending in FIFA 12 (which is my fav FIFA to date). However, there are ZERO enjoyable advancements in FIFA 13 for me, only frustration and that is why I give it a ZERO score. It has been a waste of money, I really donât know why Iâve kept playing it. Itâs a testament to how frustrating this game is that Iâve gone back to playing FIFA 12. And judging from what Iâve read about FIFA 14 (from actual gamers, not EA butt-licking magazines and big FIFA Youtubers). Iâll be keeping my money in my pocket. EA, please make this game enjoyable to play again.. Rubbish game, EA haven't made any changes to Pro Clubs, its still a big let down at times. Many many changes such as custom kits and logos can be done and have been done in FIFA 12 as well as FIFA street, they just don't wanna give it all away, EA sicken me with their lack of commitment to their fans. Same as the last one but with better graphics its still kicking a football and running around also you still kick a ball did i mention that yet? OH and spoilers its rubbish. I'm sorry to say that Fifa 13 is incredibly surprising piece of crap. Firstly, besides updated team squads and licenses nothing really had changed. It is still the same game it was last year, which is unacceptable, bearing in mind price of 60$. Also, I can't stand all the dumbass decisions that referees make. Handballs every 5 seconds, penalties out of space. Incredibly huge piece of junk.. EA sports have gone back 5 years with this title, player movement reminds me of FIFA 08..game is just a disgrace. Only reason i gave this game 2 is because manager mode is quite good until it gets boring. Matches are fixed also for instance im dominating a game, the opposition has had 3 players sent off...easy win?? think again!! i hit the post 3 times, van persie misses 4 sitters that an old crow on a zimmer could finish and then out of the blue my defence splits letting the opposition through to score a 90th minute 1 nil win!!!. This is the worst FIFA since star players scored from 45 yards, but at least in that FIFA you had fun. I shall start with the positive, the game modes. FIFA's game modes are well thought out, nicely presented and very varied; they entice you to play the game in a variety of ways and will keep you entertained for hours. When you make a quality move the game looks great and you get a strong sense that you were solely responsible for the ball going in the back of the net; celebrations are plentiful too, if you enjoy waving your arms. The negative; unfortunately these game modes are blighted by awful gameplay and a quite terrible focus on pace. This is particularly noticeable on the Ultimate Team online mode where the one button to defend, long balls to attack, and constant CPU tackles can leave you very frustrated. Referee's are terrible, they get in the way, make terrible calls and make strange advantage decisions.; the first touch system is unusual and for defenders a real issue as bad touches combined with the push/pull system means the man mountain Samba would easily lose the ball to the diminutive Barry Bannan. Goal keepers are very inconsistent and due to the long shot exploit, where you shoot after any move/skill/knock on, are statues from distance. However this is just the start as when you learn these exploits the varied game modes also become a waste of your time, even on the highest difficulty all you need to do is recreate the Ultimate Team online ethos and add countering from corners/goal kicks to get you constant wins. The quality of your team is unimportant, as long as someone has pace you'll be fine. In manager mode this is very annoying as you don't feel like there is any point to progressing your players. This takes all fun out of the game, especially as when you decide to learn something different, for example skills, the computer AI will take the ball from you with ease...just **** game is about little more. The extras; the game looks pretty, the largest names in football are there, though scouting/searches are awful, and you get to play your favourite sport virtually....just don't try and embrace the beautiful game; there is no room for your efforts in FIFA 13. All in all I simply can't rate this game higher than a 6, and I feel that is almost generous; having been disappointed by games such as Duke Nukem Forever I can at least say they have a modicum of entertainment whereas this edition of FIFA has been a real let down, as had EA's appalling community service and interaction.. Decent game that offers what I am looking for in a sports game, the only recurring issue I keep coming across is going on loan. Did it the first year and performed above and beyond what was expected of my pro, 9.7 rating 70 some odd goals so on and so forth. I come back from loan haven't even played a game and already I am getting notifications that I will be getting shipped off to another team. Fix that and the game would get a higher rating.. Have you ever tried playing Ultimate Team mode? It's the greatest example of what evevyone's being complaining about. You play it against CPU and it's a fantastic gameplay. You play it online and it's terrible. It is very frustrating as your defense seems to be useless in some matches. I say 'some matches' because sometimes your GK seems to be invincible. Very weird. It is a very unstable online gameplay, so I'll rate it 4, 'cause I believe FIFA is 60% online gameplaying, which just **** in this game.. The graphic are absolutely amazing and the faces look very real. But FIFA hasn't changed its look for ages ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I decided to rewrite my review. I dislike this game for plenty of reasons, some of them being unbalanced game play, unrealistic game mechanics, awful career and online modes, COUNTLESS game braking glitches, scripted matches and performances designed to make you lose no matter what. Only on Fifa can you have 70 percent possession, 20 shots on target, hit the post 6 times only to concede a fluke goal in the last second and lose the game. The amount of times this has happened to me is incredible. Only on Fifa can you be winning a game, press start to manage your team and it completely lock up your console forcing you to turn it off and losing all your progress. Be a pro mode? It's designed so your team doesn't have any possession, making it incredibly frustrating because you can't get in to a game and it lowers your rating, yet another waste of time mode. Ultimate team? Designed to bleed every single penny out of you, nothing more, nothing less. The game is so incredibly broken that I find myself turning it off prematurely out of frustration every time I try and play it... I'll be spending my money on Pro Evo next thank you very much EA.. Would be better if it wasnt the same bloody game every year. Theres a reason why EA is hated. Im not dishing out 50 odd quid for the same game every year. Positives: Great graphics, a great game to play with friends as it always is. Decent online community, couple of new features. Negatives: It's pretty much exactly the same game as FIFA 11/12 etc, only a really buggy version, there're bugs everywhere in-game (personal experience; I was about to cross a ball into the box, when suddenly my player on-the-ball teleported into the box, and sending my cross off the pitch for a throw-in to the opposition.). The only main difference with the new FIFA is the new team line-ups, which is essentially all we're paying for every year. This game to me suggests that EA wanted to see how bad they could make the game and still watch people purchase it (in terms of the sheer amount of bugs, with an even more annoying ref giving the most ridiculous decisions). Not a big fan of FIFA 13, I can play 11 or 12 and have just as much fun. 4/10 because of the bugs, lack of new content, and the price of the game for what is essentially the same game repeating itself every year, with the exception of a little bit **** boost and more annoying ref's with each one that comes around.. this game is wonderful to play if you are into football. the graphics are fantastic and it has an overall very smooth game play. i would recomend you buy this game and play it with your friends especially if you are a compettative player.. I suppose that when you have done something many times you get good at it. EA have been making these games since year 2000 I think. All the new great game modes is nly the icing in the cake. The game always updates players and teams pretending on how good they have been lately. This makes you feel like you`re playig with the real players, it gives more depth into an otherwise bland game. The game play is awesome and it takes alot of practising to get good. You can strategically, chose formation, speed, players and other sweet strategies. The game is though still quite repetitive and the fact that they will make a new identical next year when could just have been DLC takes it down to a strong 8.. This Game is sooooo good, and yet sooooo bad. Its by far the best when you first start playing it. But the more you play it the more you will start to loath it. There are so many in game mechanics that i can only think are designed to make the game more fun and fair, Yet they do exactly the opposite. There is scripting in the game so that if your a high rated team and you play a low rated one you cant just smash them, your players will not play as well to try and combat the difference in stats. 45th and 90th minute goals are as rampant as ever and the foul system is also completely flawed at times. For example when taking a shot and the defending player obstructs by just blocking your leg from hitting the ball and you just fall over. Theres a lot more to it than i can be bothered to type but without the scripting mechanics it would get a 9 and without the silly foul system it would get a 10.. This game does not have a story as it simply just a football games, but EA canât even do that right. Letâs start with the flow of the game. The passing and the movement of the players is actually alright, but the goalkeepers on the other hand are simply diabolical. The keeper seem to have this amazing ability to move from onside of the goal to the other in half a second from a shot from Messi which is simply unrealistic seeing that they said FIFA 13 is the most ârealisticâ football game to date is really just embarrassing. This game is generally brought for the online play and was the second most bought game of 2012 so you would expect the servers to be to the best of its ability but no! They are constantly crashing and cannot cope with the millions of people that play online each day. Now letâs move on to the actual game play. We have covered the goal keeping so letâs move on to the tackling. To be far to EA the tackling is actually alright BUT how Messi can out jump Rio Ferdinand isnât right in the slightest. The slide tackling can be incredible late causing you to foal them or it can make the cleanest slide tackles so itâs very inconsistent. The shooting again is very inconsistent. Cristiano Ronaldo could score a blinder from 40 yards but them miss a sitter from the 6ft yard **** just doesnât make any sense. Now for the worst thing about the game and thatâs the passing. It so, so, so bad! Youâd tell it to pass it one way and it will end up going to a completely different person, the direction of where you put the ball never really goes to actually where you want it. Suitability: Age 3+ Addictiveness: This game can be VERY addictive so be careful.. This game is appalling. EA are selling what can only be described as a broken product. First touch control? Broken. Passing? Broken. Intelligent A.I.? Broken. This game takes last year's quite frankly unfinished FIFA12 and makes it more broken. The career mode, for example, can be quite fun... when it works. Matches will often crash upon pause, causing you to lose progress up to that point. Same with Ultimate Team, games will often disconnect or crash, causing you to lose the match. Simply put, do not buy this game. You will regret it.. If there was ever a love hate relationship this game would be it. I love playing FIFA13. I stopped playing online because 2 things infuriate me. One is the blatant way the game favors one online gamer or the other. I mean you're playing your best and the other gamer takes a stupid shot from 40 yards and your goalie somehow just happens to not be able to stop it. Second is when you're playing and you accidently press a button and the stupid black notice totally blocks your game stating ""you cannot do whatever as you don't have possesion of the ball"" ....it makes me livid. why can't you place that notice on the corner of the screen since you're trying to maintain possesion of the ball.. The first touch system is an insult to anyone who has played football at any level. Apparently while running on to a ball 9/10 you will miskick it smash it 10 yards in front of you or balloon it up in the air. I watch championship standard football week in, week out and never see this more than 5 times a game from both teams. On previous FIFAs skill usually won you the game, not anymore. People just pick fast players and sprint at you and you cannot stop them. Countless goals are conceded with someone sprinting after your defenders tapping the tackle button. Have the developers even played/watched football?. The last Fifa game I owned prior to this was FIFA 10 and it's actually amazing how little they have improved it. The AI in this game is incredibly stupid with some very annoying habits that have evidently not been ironed out in three generations. For example when you pass the ball sometimes your player will root himself and wait for the ball to arrive leaving you unable to control his movement and mostly ending up in an opposition player getting an interception. A lot of the times too players will attempt a through ball when you press the pass button. There is a dedicated through ball button which I would use if I wanted a through ball played, when I press a different button it's because I didn't want a through ball. Likewise with the goalkeepers, sometimes they will rush out of the goals even when you're not holding down Y to tell them to come out and this mostly ends in an easy goal for the opposition. A lot of neat features in the game modes but the gameplay still needs a lot of tightening up.. This game is garbage, i say this having bought every single fifa game since 08. I can explain how massively disappointing the game is. I don't by all means wish to be saying these things about the game, FIFA is one of my favorite hobbies but this years game is an unbearable experience. It just feels like they've taken control away from the user and replaced it with unrealistic animations, super human defenders (when you stab at the ball and miss when i'm at a full sprint and then catch up to me, thats superhuman). In their quest to recreate the sport exactly they are losing all of what makes people play the game, it's fun. Every year it gets harder for people who know the game and easier for newbies. Even watching the gameplay reminds me of watching a coed pickup game. And why is one of the worst soccer nations in the world developing this game, eh?. Graphics: 8/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Enjoyment: 7/10 = 7.75 (Great) For a football game it deserves high reviews. Higher then PES should be getting and higher then Football Superstars. This is the ultimate football simulator.. I have been buying FIFA since 2002 and more regularly since 2008. The games gets more scripted online than before. I am not a guy who is complaining because I lose a lot because I am already division 1 in UT and division 6 . Does EA pay reviewers to rate the game simply? Because FIFA 13 is a piece of **** game online especially. On top of that, EA does not like it if you discuss this on the EA forums. They threaten you with bans. Is this some kind of a dictatorship? Oh and yes there are some handicaps with certain teams like for example, Barcelona. Try getting to division 1 with Barcelona or playing online with them. You will see that the opponent players will just run through Puyol and Pique even after a tackle has been made. Strength is the key factor here and though Puyol and Pique have good body strength, it does not matter. I had a game where I hit the post twice and my player missed an open net where all he had to do was tap it in but he lobbed the ball. Is this realistic? Oh and all of this happened in ten minutes of the game. Then, my opponent scores because the ball bounces back to him twice. Of course I came back in the game but it was a draw. Basically, EA ensures that bad players have a chance. They want to make all the newbies happy. Otherwise, who would buy the game. The game is not about who is the better player. Sure, better and experienced players win more but you can easily notice that newbies and or bad players can defend better because the auto tackling and auto blocking in the box has gotten better. The game is a joke. PES 2014 what I will buy in 2014. Stop lying EA. As you'd expect, this game is pretty much the same. There isn't really much that even makes you think this game is a different game - wan't even worth going over to a friends house to play.. This game really feels rushed. Playing on any level above professional basically means you will never keep a clean sheet, as defender AI is horrendous. If you aren't literally making the tackle or positioning the defender yourself, your team will basically watch as your passed to death. I gave up trying to play online, as I would sit and wait for a few minutes to find a player, and once I find a player, the game will never connect. There seems to be times during the career mode where the game gets sick if you winning and will do everything in its power to frustrate the hell out of you. The first touch is a joke, making gameplay with any team below 3 stars a bloody nightmare. Just give the AI some I and I will be happy. If you walked into the EA Sports offices, sat down with the FIFA development team and asked them what amazing new features they added to this game, the answer would be as follows: ""This year, we put a '13' on the box"" And that's it. That's all this game is: Fifa 12 with a different number.. Its good...though online multi-player has bugs. Good graphics and great commentary by Andy and Clive. Move away 12 and 11, This one has been the best since the start!. (Out of 100) game play: 90 Graphics: 94 Physics: 88 Realism: 92 Replay rate:99 Overall: 93 FIFA 13 does not change much from FIFA 12, but it polishes FIFA 12, from making players look better, making the game pace better, and even those little things like making stadium net color change count. most importantly FIFA 13 is fun. Same game release as of any previous FIFA game. When are people going to realise that EA are fleecing Â£40 pounds + of your hard earned cash every year. Disappointing, career mode is great but everything else very average. A lot of the gameplay is ridiculous. The first touch system is laughable the massive touches they do when a simple ball is played into a professional footballer are pathetic. Obstruction seems to play a key part in defending when in real life it is classed as a foul. Yet again the A.I are terrible in pro clubs they struggle to pass a ball more than five yards and constantly stand off players when defending allowing easy opportunities to shoot on the edge of the area. Goalkeepers are stupidly good in pro clubs again creating a completely different game in pro clubs when playing against a virtual pro goalkeeper. Game is pure garbage, huge step backwards. More scripted then ever, EA why don't you just play the game for us.. It's terrible, the new precision dribbling also a joke, ball sometimes bounces off feet on 1 touch even when receive buttons are pressed.. EA introduced this 1 touch, but were not smart enough to include this in the entire game, have had several instances where i shoot the ball & defender instead of blocking, he trapped my shoot. Defenders can trap shots, but attackers can trap simple pass. Cheating refs calling pk for no reason, don't bother trying to see the replay because they won't show just how bad they cheated by calling it a pk. Awful, graphics good, the game is a joke incredibly scripted with ea still behind the scenes controlling outcome of games.... Most of the reviews here are just ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the first touch feature or the amount of passes that miss or rebounds that occur. They are just fine and add to the experience. Football is not such a straight forward game. The people giving bad reviews are clearly just unskilled at the game or at the very least are looking for an arcade version instead of an at least somewhat realistic football experience. The game is beautiful and stacked with useful and or cool features. You just have to put a bit of effort to learn the game, you won't master it straight away (and this seems to annoy most of the reviewers here). But once you get the hang of it, you're in for the most true-to-life representation of a football game that has ever been seen on any platform outside of the actual pitch.. as opposed to many reviews, FIFA 13 does not show much realism to the world of football, I say this as the the game has many glitches and ball control has been terribly designed. Also, some player ratings can be very inaccurate such as the overrated Torress, Schneider, Balotelli and others. The servers are terrible, I cannot find a game with an opponent online without at least getting a message twice telling me no one was found. The good side is the manager mode and Ultimate team are very fun.. I love this game. However there are so many things that need fixing that, whilst most of them are not major things they do drag the game down slightly. The main issue is the first touch engine. Anybody who isn't Messi or Ronaldo can struggle to control the easiest pass at times, however, it should improve with time, like the Direct impact engine has, only in its second year it is much better than the first one, however still has a long way to go to be realistic and decent. The AI is improved, in particular attacking with realistic chemistry between players (don't expect Lampard and Gerrard to understand where each other is moving and wants the ball for example). Overall, improved graphics, career and FUT make it a worthwhile purchase but is still some way off changing football games like PES 09 did before it turned ****. Following on with its tradition Fifa 13 Manages to stay ahead of the pack with its licensed teams and solid gameplay. Ultimate team has been tweaked and other elements are improved upon giving the player the ultimate Fifa Footy experience. Extra commentary is included (touchline reports from Geoff Shreeves and matchday updates featuring Alan Mcinally) which does add more realism. Also you can buy extras from EA store (Gameplay enchancements, kits etc) using EXP points earned in game. Overall a good game but I prefer Fifa 12 because it plays a smoother game.. Its just ok. I was urged to get into the hype, and what I got was a very similar FIFA game. Good graphics, announcing, player models, but it is still not much of an improvement over the other FIFA games I've played on the 360. Buy if you're new to FIFA, don't buy if you have FIFA 12.. A big improvement over Fifa 12. Gameplay is much more realistic and **** a blast playing the wide variety of game modes that Fifa has to offer. :). This is the Best Fifa yet, I loved the Fifa 12 and EA has prefectiones once more a very good game, the new first touch controls adds more of the rendomness situations that araise on a real game, a reboud on your defender legs that leads the other team to score a goal in your net, that pass that was not well received make the game feel more real and fluid, the impact engine has been improved as well, the old love season is free now, my only complaints is that the Creatin Center has not worked well for me I can't sync the PC Application with my game and I only wish this feature to be within the game, just like PES has been doing it for years, you can't simply go worng with Fifa is not just a roster update, even when I play always found a new animations or a wonderful play that I didn't expected, the besto soccer game but closely trailed by PES.. I'm not sure what all the griping is about. FIFA 13 is a big improvement over 12 -- especially in terms of the physics and pacing. For those of us who have actually PLAYED soccer in real life, FIFA 13 is definitely a more accurate representation of how a game. The ball abides by physics in a way that makes much more sense, the players are more fallible (yes, even Messi and Ronaldo -- sorry fanboys), the ways in which you can score a goal are more diverse, and the games are less likely to become formulaic, as in FIFA 12. The updated teams are also nice -- Bayern and Germany (both underrated in FIFA 12) are much better, and overrated teams (any English team, the England squad, Inter Milan) are all a more accurately ranked. I'm not a big fan of the music, or the absurd number of menu bars and options (I struggle to figure out what most of them even mean until I've selected them). There are good new features -- there's a practice mode (called Skill Games or something) that's more fun than it should be, much better Virtual Pro (so far), and a better Career Mode (see: World Cup). I find the online gameplay a more compelling reason to buy it than the extras, and as someone who spent way too long playing FIFA 12, I feel like this version is different enough to justify buying it.. Truly the WORST next-gen Fifa by far. Don't believe the hype, don't go with the professional reviewers' opinion, who clearly get paid or otherwise benefited directly by EA. The game has countless issues, both online and offline, it has tons of bugs (that will probably never be fixed because EA has proved beyond all doubts that they don't care). The gameplay is so broken, the game speed is laughable and ridiculously high, the passing system ****, the UT servers are down very often, the new first touch controls are a joke. Everything about this game ****. EVERYTHING. And EA simply don't care because they sold their 7 million copies. A zero is perhaps too much for this game, I wish I could give it a negative review number. I want my money back. Just go see what's happening in the EA's official forum, 90% of the people writing there are just mad an the game a","fifa 13 is the most realistic, rewarding and replayable soccer game to date . i gave it an extended play through before review In order to fully capture what it has to offer . i gave it an extended play through before review In order to fully capture what it has to offer ."
357.Into the Breach,"This is a really good turn-based tactics & puzzle-strategy game, it's pretty unique and worth a try for anyone into these types of games.. First of all, I am aware that I am probably not the type of guy a game like this is made for because I'm not really that much into puzzles but I can still absolutely appreciate how well made yet simple this game is. Doesn't really matter if you like puzzles or not this is still one of those experiences you should have.. A diamond **** that has been ruthlessly, painstakingly carved into its perfect form. Forces you into meaningful decisions each turn without being unfair or hostile - you always know exactly what your enemy is up to, it's on you to find some way to use your incredible array of tools to stop them. Extremely replayable.. Why play Into the Breach? It's a pure and simple turn-based tactics games that's really easy to get into and goes deeper than you expect. The visuals are appropriate with their future-pixel aesthetic and the music is both ominous and heroic, doubling down on the theme of doomed heroes going back in time to save the world. The roguelite loop fits perfectly here and keeps things fresh. Subset games knew how to handle a roguelite on their first effort, FTL, and they've only improved their craft here, with a well-balanced approach to difficulty scaling, choice and run time. But again, why play Into the Breach? It rewards strategic thinking and makes you feel like a hero.. Into the Breach is too unforgiving and not as advertised. It's more grid based puzzle game than a strategy game, and these randomly generated puzzles can sometimes be impossible to solve without taking losses that may cripple your run later on. Combine this with the inability to save and reload your game during critical moments and it's just too much of a hostile experience for me.. Gameplay: (Amazing) --- Graphics: (Mediocre) --- Story: (N/A) --- Score: (Good). This game can be brutally challenging but it is an absolute blast. Less of a strategy game and more of a puzzle game.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Very fun and can be short adventure. Alot of replayability with new mech and even achievement for every team, since you are a time traveler saving every possible timeline. Good personality for pilot Pretty difficult if you rush in and dont take your time 9/10 Great if you like one of those kaiju battle to protect the city. Never dipped my toes into turn-based, strategy games since I thought they would be boring, but this is an exception. This game is very good and really test your brain while not being 4d chess and the mechs are all fun to play with, even the bad ones. But wished the music was better because its only fine, and wished there were more areas.. Superb and very addictive strategy gem. By the way can be played with controller without any problems, tested on steam deck.. I was reluctant to play this game because I was such a huge fan of FTL and assumed there was no way this game could be as good as that. Well, unfortunately, I was right. While the core game is very solid and engaging, it doesn't feel like something special and unique like FTL. Instead, it feels like a generic turn-based combat game. You've got three units to work with, and each gets a move-and-attack per round. It's a proven formula, but the early game quickly becomes dull and repetitive, as upgrades to the units seem to be very few and far between. I'm hoping it'll get more interesting with more unlocks, but I'm afraid I may just quit playing before then.. A bit simple, gives you some challenge. I like the graphics and the music. Wish there were more endings, it's the only repetitive thing for me. I've completed every single character before the release of the Advanced Edition, maybe I'll try it in the future.. Me personally its little too hard to play but it is still fun if you like Turn based strategy games but it could also be little repetitive.. Flawless sci-fi roguelike masterpiece and one of the best examples of an indie game design approach, where a super-polished gameplay formula prevails over anything else. S tier.. Into the Breach is a turn-based tactics game that has more in common with Chess or puzzle games than it does with XCOM and while that may be great for those competent with strategy or puzzle games, it's not so much fun for those who lack the patience to make the perfect play. If you are in the market for this kind of game though, you'll find a solid title with appealing pixel art, many mechs and abilities to play around with, and a top notch, atmospheric soundtrack thanks to the talents of Ben Prunty.. The roguelike mechanics actually feel like a shockingly poor fit for the game, especially considering the developers' pedigree. It's still worth giving a shot for a couple hours if you're into strategy games, but the game's replayability is not its strong suit.. This game is surely not bad: The treasure is the gameplay: minimalistic, but gives so many opportunity, this is an art, how to make gameplay: easy to understand but hard to master. It is like chess, but shorter: a battle need only few minutes and the campaign needs only 3-4 hours. Therefore you can play it a little bit and return to real life. In comparison to chess I see here more possibilities: An unit has more options, you can upgrade the units and buy new attack modes. In addition you have different maps, different objections. There are so many genius design elements...I would need too much time to write them all here.. This game is one of the few games, that I want to play it after beat it, because you can unlock new squads, that have different abilities and therefore changes the strategy. Perfect gameplay and thats why this game has so many rewards. There is another element, I like: Do you also ignore achievements, because they are stupid? Not in this game. With achievements you get points to unlock squads and the goals to get them fits nicely to invent strategies. Nice idea. For this game you need a good AI and it is great, even too good, because the AI is already hard on normal level. There are 3 levels in the game and there should be more, because I would like to play something between easy and normal. Look at civilization, there are so many levels and this is motivating. The setting, story and atmosphere fits together. But the presentation of the story could be better. Especially the graphics is so bad. This is how games looked 20 or 25 years ago and it could be very easy to make better graphics.. One of the most overrated games ever. It has a lot of issues - control, accessibility, visuals, and sound. And this game is extremely hard. So, avoid the ""Must-Play"" tag and stop wasting your time.. A fantastic strategy game. Limited moves, limited enemies, great gameplay. It's almost like a game of chess.. A solid, quasi-puzzle game. I played for ~15 hours before putting it down, but I might return to it on a plane flight. Best parts are the atmospherics / art style & the progression / rewards system. Worst part is that each run's beginning stages take too long to get through, even as you've improved. It hurts the replayability to have that level of tedium when there's no real challenge.. A decent strategy game completely ruined with non optional rogue-like mechanics. Most levels are more boring than challenging. If you do find yourself in an unwinnable situation, either due to a bad play, or more likely bad RNG, you're only move is to completely start over. Look elsewhere for a better game if you value your time.. If you are looking for almost endless replay value, look no further. Game is basically a series of interlinked puzzles with upgradeable mechs. There is a kinda steep learning curve, but once you get the basics you start to see new possibilities emerge. If you liked FTL you are gonna enjoy this.. In the distant future humanity fights against an army of giant monsters, known as Vek, using giant mechs that can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armour, and other equipment. Into the Breach is a rouge-like turn-based strategy game played on an 8x8 grid with a limit of five turns per âlevelâ. At first it may seem rather simplistic, but the variety of moves and enemy types brings an almost chess like quality to proceedings. Figuring out how to best co-ordinate your three mechs each turn is both challenging and entertaining, and itâs easy to get **** in for hours at a time as you try to improve your performance. With the excellent FTL also in their catalogue, Subset Games seem to be making a real name for themselves within this genre, and I canât wait to find out what there next project will be.. Played through everything in FTL, nuff said. ITB didn't hit at first, almost boring. But once you realize you can switch pilots (once someone dies in your best extras), freeze your own buildings and stand a freezer on a spawn... Much better. So much hidden strategy. Looks like the AI level match is spot on (if one wrong move and you are toast = your type of game). Oh, and the reason it feels repetitive is because you stick to the same guys. I did two runs, then switched squad and the game got all different. So it is FTL all over, kinda, lots to learn, every run until you ""win"" that one.. I feel like playing a game of chess on steroids. It's one of the best tactic game I've played. The infinite combination is really a brilliant part of the game where battles never are the same (even if they can feel like after 20 hours). I pretty much enjoyed everything, even if some of the main mechanics could have been better explained (permadeath, what to prioritize (grid, timepods, etc...)). I should not need to go on youtube to be sure that I am not missing an important part of the gameplay lol. But except that, I find that it was a pretty addictive experience. I played for more than 30 hours in 2 weeks to finish it with every team and I only have 2/3 of all the achievements. My only complain is that, although all the teams offer a different experience with their widely varied units and combos, the ''random'' team was not a good experience. You really need to be sure that you'll have a balanced team if you wanna go somewhere, because when I did it the first time, I had only one unit who could attack and the two others could only shove or move enemy units. It doesn't seem like a problem, but for whatever reason I always had ''burrowers'' as enemies, and they are THE ONLY UNITS that you cannot move or shove. So I had to accept game over after completing 3 islands only because those units were constantly attacking the buildings and I was never able to attack them. That part really **** and I feel this wasn't really calibrated by the dev team. I also would have like more story, because this is just pretty much the same every time. So after 20 playthrough, you don't learn anything and you also don't give a **** about what the characters says. It could have been nice to feel like you are learning bits of the story every time you start a new timeline. Or that you have a real ''final boss'' at the end when you finish the game with all the teams. But all in all, great experience. I hope the dev team will learn from the smalls mistakes here and there and offer us another great time in the future !. This game is one of the best turn-based strategy type games i have played, it is quite challenging even on easy mode for my first playthrough, but once you start to get a grip on the mechanics and gameplay it can be a rewarding experience, even with all the skill obtain through gameplay the game will still be a very though one to complete. The use of environments in combat is such a very well used mechanic you pretty much haven't seen much like it since. Instead of just being a backdrop for the action IT is part of the action, you'll shoot a missile towards a dam and it'll break causing it to flood killing the enemies on its way. The sprite work is absolutely amazing and i adore it. It can get boring to play, but i only started to get bored after 4 hours of playtime and still haven't seen everything you get to do. It has very high replay value. I would recommend this to anyone up for a challenge.. The game brings a challenge that tests the cunning and intelligence of the player, but there is also a piece random when you accidentally pass the level or can't pass it. Very nice take of this genre. More focus on position and landscape properties. It does this in a unique and challenging way. While I like the unforgiving gameplay somewhat, I must say it is a bit too harsh. One tiny mistake can ruin the whole campaign. Consider yourself warned. Edit: I changed from 8 to 9. This one is a grower! ;-). It took me a while to understand how to play, but it's a really fun strategy game. My only issue is that the game gets really repetitive. I would've liked new maps or a 2nd storyline.. This game could make you like the genre, a must-have for every Switch players!. As I like FTL, this game also has great fun. It is like more complicated chess game. Unfortunately, like FTL too, the game ended too fast, I was hoping we could have longer game, more rpg system.. It's the best strategy game. I have spent a lot of time for that. However, its hard for new player. It's like playing chess. Meaning you might not find out if you messed up until 10 turns later. And if you find out then you've lost everything and have to start over. If I could pick a word to describe this it would be masochistic. I did not find a sense of exploration anywhere in the game.. It's a good game mainly for the lovers of turn based strategy, however I do not recomend this game for people that doesnÂ´t like this kind of game.. As a casual dad gamer I had a tone of fun. The game is not perfect like every other 10/10 game but it was a big 10 in the fun department. + oldschool unlock system (new squads) + multiple playthroughs (randomized arenas, goals, abilities and the abovementioned squads) + easy to grasp hard to master + can be finished in 2 hours on the first try + music and sounds neutral: instadeath. No arena replays, you just lose 3 hours of progress and start again. It felt great to beat it but made me anxious to try another level as it could end the whole timeline. - a few things are not explained and you have to google/check wiki - the graphics could be better especially model animations are just 3 frames in idle and always face one direction at all times. - no coop or any kind of multiplayer - second and further playthroughs are easier as you keep your experienced pilot which makes the first try **** ass twice as much as you neither know the best strategies nor have a good pilot.. Is a pretty challenging game,a truly must play game,when you're a fan of tactical game.. a man goes to the doctor. says he's depressed. he says life seems harsh and cruel. says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. the doctor says ""the treatment is simple. the great clown pagliacci is in town tonight. go and see him, that should pick you up."" the man bursts into tears. he says ""but doctor... i am pagliacci."". Into the Breach is one of those games that, if you like the game play, will keep you playing for ""just one more round."" I'm not the biggest fan of either rouge-likes or strategy games, and even I was quite entertained with the time I spent playing. Unfortunately, there is next to no story to follow, which keeps me from sticking around too long. However, if that isn't a concern to you, I can see some people playing Into the Breach for a many hours. I highly recommend at least checking out this game. At worst, you'll still have a great time trying to complete a few runs.. Addicting and challenging, Into The Breach offers a very interesting gameplay and very interesting mechanics, but its so short that i wish more. Also, the gameplay often limits the player too much, id like to see new uses for itens between breaches, and more units to control. Either way, its a great game and you should take a look.. With Into the Breach, Subset Games has created a true masterpiece. It is down-to-earth, multi-faceted, challenging but never overwhelming. It is simply a dream come true for all fans of turn-based strategy games: No matter how many rounds you may have played, no two games are alike. Far too numerous are the possibilities that arise from position, combination, action and effect. And I haven't even mentioned how different the Mechs play, how varied they are, or that they can be improved during the course of the game. New equipment reveals new ways of playing but also new decisions that need to be made. And no matter how many of them you make in the course ****, they are never tiring or trivial, but always of noticeable consequence. Just as noticeable are the grey cells that search for answers when the opponent positions his units on the randomly generated maps, because the space beetles have come up with similarly impressive skills and agility and take their toll. Conclusion: For just under 13 Euros (as of March 3, 2018) you can already get the Game of the Year in the category: Round Based Strategy Game with Into the Breach.. I love the game. While its no FTL level of amazingness, it's definitely a great game. Can't wait to see more from Subset Games since they proved they're not just a one-hit-wonder.. It's a decent strategy game. But it gets boring after a while. 1hr on record.. It's a well made Indie, i liked it and it offer the right amount of challenge. It's a skirmish game where the player will guide 3 Mechs facing a large number of enemy (monsters) in a chess like small map. One of those game that you play for the sake of it, for a fun turn based combat rather than playing for plot and ending ****'s the way you play old version of Panzer general. Into the breach has less content, and less replayability of AAA strategy title... you will feel some repetition here and there and will probailly see most of his content in one week. But you will still playing it from time to time just for fun It's like a simplified and shorter version of Chroma squad or Super Robot taisen. It's good if you've never played any turn based strategy game in your life.. Good strategy game but it can get quite boring and repetitive, sometimes the game can put you thorough impossible situations.. Too simplistic, not as engaging as FTL, just a bit boring not complex enough, there are better puzzle games around there if you like that aspect. Each turn becomes its own unique puzzle and solving it is really rewarding. Hard at first but becomes quite easy when you figure the systems out. One of the most excellently polished games of all time. Fully engaging, aptly paced, and well thought out, this is one of the few games on Steam which led me to explore all of its content and all of its achievements. This is one of my very few 10/10s and I would highly recommend it to virtually everyone.. Perfect game, on both the PC and Switch. Really, so good I felt compelled to buy it on the Switch too!. It feels like a complex take on chess. It becomes very rewarding after you get familiar with the mechanics.. If your like me, dumb and impatient, you won't like this game when you first start. It has a bit of a learning **** too steep, but while I almost gave up to go study, several external circumstances kept me going. Unfortunately for my studies, now I am hooked. Take the time to google a few tips to get you started in understanding the basics of the game. Once you get that, the real game begins to emerge, and man is it a dragon. I'd expect nothing less from the creators of FTL. Thank you for another amazing game. If you like chess or advance wars...this is like chess on steroids.. amazing game, just like ftl. easy to understand, really hard to master. this game is worth your time if you love strategy games.. Welcome to Acceptable Losses: the game. Imagine someone took the turn based strategy of fire emblem, the setting of pacific rim and combined it with the constant fear that the aliens you're fighting are going to harm some of your precious civilians which the game's life system focuses around. This is a squad-orientated turn based strategy game which makes you consider every shot you fire. Yes, you could nuke every alien bug into oblivion, but then there wouldn't be a lot left to save, right? A developed ftl-style system of mech management allows you to build your perfect fighting machines in an enjoyable strategy game for those who enjoyed Faster than Light, the previous offering of the studio.. Interesting and fun combat mechanics, but lacks the replayability that FTL had.. Chess like, tactical, simple to pick up yet hard to master, minimalist... ...sounds great to me. However, after having ""played"" for about 10 hours, I still can't see how I can tactically place my 3 techs in a limited starting space so that I can plan my moves ahead in a Kapersky like manner. Oh ! I forgot to mention that, at the start of the game, your enemies are already in position - you even get to see the order in which they are going to play. Piece of cake. The only problem is, is that they start first. They shoot off in randomly different directions - good grief, I hadn't tactically planned that ! In the end, my strategy boils down to more or less trying to guess (in a chess-like manner, of course) where they are going to move. Ah yes, this is where the minimalist element of the game kicks in. Minimal fun. Maybe it's because I don't have a bent for this type of game, which means that I can't appreciate it to it's full potentiial *sigh* I guess that I'll have to go back to less demanding games. Wait for me Crusader Kings II, I'm coming back.... Short Reviews! The good: - gameplay - graphic (good pixelart!) - replayability - addictive - challenging - strategy + puzzle game The bad: - short - soundtrack (worse than in FTL) Summary: Obligatory must have. I played on PC, but also tried it on Switch and really recommend to play on Nintendo's platform.. As a casual game it's near perfect. Pick up, put down, come back to. It's replaced Solitaire as my 'while my code is compiling' distraction. As a turn-based game it's never stressful or frustrating, but this doesn't necessarily mean it is easy. Great replay value too.. Great tactical game with a high replay value. Subset Games did once again delivered. Highly Recommended.. An amazing game that came out of nowhere for me, great replay value and a nice 80s or 90s vibe!. An interesting puzzle game which poses to be a TBS and has a heavy mobile feel to it. Every level is a battle of just 5 turns where you use 3 mechs to fight waves of incoming aliens. Protecting buildings on the map is more important than keeping mechs alive. The good: - combat is interesting and challenging. The mechanics of pushing enemies away with shots and making them collide with each other or slide into water or acid creates a multitude of surprising ways a singe turn can go - every level throws in additional mechanics which enrich the basic formula in interesting ways (though all these tiny special rules do feel overwhelming at times) - well-designed GUI - battlefields are randomly generated, so at each replay you have a different setup. This lets the no-reload policy work nicely because at each new attempt you will have completely different battles. It doesn't even feel like much of a setback when you restart the game all over - rather it feels more like a replay or a continuation of the missions sequence - good music The so-so: - new enemies appear every turn at random places, and you don't know which enemies these will be. Moreover, these enemies get a free turn! This means that basically every turn you get a radically different position than just in the turn before that. E.g. the newly appeared enemies may put an immobilizing web on 1 or 2 of your units. I think the authors borrowed this idea from 2011 XCOM, and I find this mechanic pretty annoying. It doesn't let you think past just 1 turn. Also, it removes the strategic feel and turns this game into a puzzle. Namely, it's not even battles, it's just a different puzzle at every turn. And since it's so random, often the puzzle simply doesn't have a solution, and you lose the game - pixel-art graphics style is pretty nice for my taste but I imagine it would put off many modern players The bad: - short battles, equalizing randomness of new enemies (together with extra turns they get) and tiny battlefields give all this a mobile feel. It's as if the authors were afraid to make me play a single level for more than 10 minutes because I need to get out at the next stop of the subway train. This feel is also increased by the small number of battles (about 25 mission to beat in total, and you're done). Thankfully they don't offer in-app purchases! But it's as if an extra energy point or an upgrade is always lurking behind the corner, ready to offer itself for $0.99 - I guess this game was initially designed with mobile and f2p in mind, one feels that. This would be a 10/10 for mobile, but for PC it's more like 8/10. It's still an enjoyable game but I really personally dislike the randomness of new enemies and their extra turn which severely limit planning and annihilate strategy, reducing the whole experience to a puzzle.. Accessible yet at the same time quite challenging, Into the Breach's addictive simple gameplay is enhanced by some lovely visual and plenty of unlockable fun.. I totally agree with skdursh and stherkelsen. The game has good graphics, music and some interesting gameplay mechanics, although gameplay looks and feels well at first, after 2-3 hours you understand there is nothing new and interesting left that game can give you. The main issue with this game is the lack of content and interesting mechanics to make replayability worthwhile, i.e. if you play 1 island (about 5-6 missions, which will take about 1-2 hours) you already see the most part of the game. Other islands have different enemies and you can upgrade your mechs after some time, but core mechanics stay the same and aforementioned facts don't add freshness to the game. Don't get me wrong it is still a good turn-based strategy game, but for me, it is not deep enough with a low variety of scenarios to call it a really great and deep game. Maybe I missed something, but for me, FTL was much deeper and more interesting. P.S: It's a pity that there is no PvP mode (even local) to play with friends (mechs vs insects OR mech vs mechs).. game mechanics, well-designed maps, and great core gameplay that guarantees a long entertainment. [Issue#284]. Not having fun at all... This game has no learning curve, itâs sky high hard from the get go. It does not ease you in at all... On your first day at karate school, you fight your sensei full contact with your hands tied behind your back and a pie in your face. That is easier.. There are much better games than this, doesn't even deserve to be in top 1000. I don't judge, but I can't see myself playing this kind of games in 2018.. What is the genre and subgenre of the game? Into the Breach is a turn-based strategy game. What did I think of the story? The story is simple, you make your way through a series of Islands fighting giant bug-like creatures called Vek. Your goal is to survive the attacks but at the same time level up mechs but also the pilots flying the mechs. Ideally what you want is to make it through each Island and then reach the final Island where you defeat the mech. Favorite Character? The game has 27 different Mechs that you can unlock by replaying the game. The mechs come in sets of 3 so there are 9 different mech sets. After about 10 hours, I unlocked 5 different sets. Unfortunately, I don't like any of the Mechs that I've unlocked and preferred the original 3. Are there puzzles and How are they? Each level is essentially a puzzle. The enemies (the Vek) their goal is not to attack your Mechs but rather the buildings because that's how the Vek actually defeat you. So sometimes your goal isn't to do as much damage to the Vek as you can but rather moving the Vek out of the way so it can't damage a building. The game requires you to rethink the way you normally approach turn-based strategy games. How is the sound design and music? I didn't pay attention to the in-game music too much. I just listened to my own music. How are the missions/levels designed? Every level is set up on an 8x8 grid. The enemies take up one space and so do your Mechs. Every grid will also include some buildings for the Vek to attack but then there is some uniqueness depending on each level and which Island you're on. Some levels are more mountainous, some have an ocean, some are in the desert and have earthquakes. There's is a good amount of variety within each level. Recap: The Good Makes you rethink classic turn-based strategy game. Recap: The Bad The unlockable mechs are not for me. Recap: The Okay The Story.. Haiku Review: Challenges abound / Fun until you beat it all / Still don't like rogue-likes Favorite Thing: The strategy component is simple with only 3 units to control but very engaging! Least Favorite Thing: Runs are extremely short and the only thing driving one to replay is unlockables. Date Completed: 2018-09-01 Playtime: 8h Enjoyment: 7/10 Recommendation: Yes, but it's not a strong yes. It's just not my type of game and after one completion my interest has gone downhill.. not a bad game a lot like advance wars but no way near as good overall... will probably play this until wargroove comes out, to satisfy any turn based strategy gaming itches i get... wargroove is absolute top of the list for awesome looking turn based strategy games though, its a straight AW clone with level creator and online multiplayer etc.... Great little game from great developer! Nice pixel graphic, great soundtrack, smart game mechanics and more than 50h of game play if you decide to master it. Another indie gem!. The game is like a chess game with so many interesting elements that requires perfect strategy in every situation All is perfect . Graphic is okay i think and Music is enjoyable during levels and reminds of a pacific rim atmosphere I give this game a perfect score 10. I actually found the game to be pretty hard especially since there was Permadeath built in this game. Even with difficulty, one can still find the thrill of a challenge to be highly engaging with a game like this. Unfortunately, that was not the case for this strategy-combat puzzle game. Art style was great and felt like playing and old style arcade game. However, this game just isn't worth the high ratings it's receiving now. With its lack of true engaging game play, it feels like yet another clone of other combat-puzzle games that we see so much of today. Good Luck and Farewell Time Breacher!!. One of the best turn based strategy games in recent years but lacks replayability, need an enchanced edition like FTL.. Subset Games has managed to create a heavily distilled and miniaturized strategy game that takes the best of planning many moves ahead but with the added twist that should you fail, you get to pick a character to take back in time with you to re-attempt the overall mission goal. It's a clever way to make the game easier should you push too hard too quickly. The randomness from FTL is gone to some degree making it quite possible for you to go far should you plan you moves ahead of time. The premise is simple: save the earth. The execution via the graphics and UI is extremely clean and well done. Some people will complain the game is short and variety is low but the combinations thanks to the different squads are fun and very challenging. You can keep going back in time to save each timeline endlessly and it works with the plot!. Where do I begin? This game is a tactical turn-based strategy game similar to Fire Emblem o","Into the Breach is a turn-based tactics & puzzle-strategy game . the visuals are appropriate with their future-pixel aesthetic . the music is both ominous and heroic, doubling down on the theme of doomed heroes going back in time to save the world ."
358.Chicory: A Colorful Tale,"One of the best indie gems I have played. A zelda like adventure with an unique spin on the formula: the use of color, the gameplay is quite original the characters are likeable and relatable. The sountrack is great.. sadly the game is better suited for switch... coloring is not as fun on ps4/ps5 i have played both versions I recommend the switch port.. Nice, little cozy game with likeable characters and a touching story, but the actual mechanics can be quite clunky. Also, don't make the same mistake as me and buy it on PS5, as both the analog stick and touchpad are very insufficient input methods for painting and I suspect I'd have enjoyed this game a whole lot more if I had been able to play it with a mouse (PC) or touchscreen (Switch).. As a parent who is conscientious about the media my child consumes, I was drawn to ""Chicory: A Colorful Tale"" by its charming art style and the promise of an inclusive, imaginative adventure suitable for all ages, with an ""E for Everyone"" rating to boot. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met in a way I had hoped. While I can appreciate the attempt to create a space of diversity and acceptance, I was taken aback by the inclusion of themes I wasn't prepared to discuss with my child at their current **** game ventures into discussing personal and sexual identities in a manner that's quite direct. While this could be a valuable conversation for some families, I believe it's a topic that should be introduced within the family when the time is right, rather than unexpectedly through a game.Moreover, while the game has been celebrated for its approach to topics like mental health and self-expression, the integration of these mature themes seems misaligned with what one might expect from the rating it has been given. Parents might anticipate needing to navigate questions about depression or imposter syndrome, but the casual drop-in of a character's sexual preferences seemed jarring and out of place in what was perceived as a childrenâs **** summary, ""Chicory: A Colorful Tale"" may have its heart in the right place, aiming to normalize a wide spectrum of human experience, but it lacks clear communication about its content, leaving some parents like myself surprised and unprepared. It's crucial for the ESRB ratings to accurately reflect the content of games so that parents can make informed decisions about the media their children engage with.. Fantastic game. Beautiful music and amazing artwork. Some may say it is boring, however it is not meant to be an action packed game. Cosy and cute with a lovely storyline.. This game is pretty great and I'd highly recommend it! The concept of of painting everywhere you go is quite clever and is solidly executed. A limited color palette that keeps the game from getting too overwhelming with choices, and gives each area its own distinct feel. The game has plenty of colorful characters, a thoughtful story, and a great soundtrack. It does have flaws that are worth mentioning though. I experienced several small glitches throughout the game, especially with a certain ability obtained. The game crashed on me 5 times, mostly toward the latter half of the game. Sometimes you can't easily paint objects on the edges of the screen, and there were a few times where objects simply wouldn't stay the color I painted them in. I remember a few conversations between important characters that felt a bit stilted, (this could be intentional due to themes of the game, but it still can be a bit off-putting). It sometimes feels like the developers are speaking directly to you as opposed to characters conversing with one another, which is fine for minor characters, but when story-important characters speak in this fashion it detracts a bit from the story itself. I love how this game navigates ideas of self-worth, the pressures of upholding a legacy, and responsibility towards oneself and for others. How it only ever asks the player to enjoy their time with the game and demands nothing more than that, its really relaxing. I ended up painting the whole map and completing all the side-quests, but the game never pressures you to do so and instead encourages you to only do as much as you feel you should. This encouragement to play how you want is also seen through its its numerous accommodations. There really is so much to praise, but I would rather not spoil anything, so take this review as a hearty recommendation to play this game all the way through!About 25-30 hours to 100% complete on standard mode for those curious. When The Picnic Province is suddenly devoid of all colour, the assistant to âThe Wielderâ Chicory finds themselves having to take up the magical brush and find out whatâs behind the problem. Beneath Chicoryâs cartoonish visuals and charming characters there is a deceptively dark undertone that helps make for an interesting narrative. The puzzles do become a little tedious as you near the end of the game however, and this takes the shine off the overall experience.. Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a masterpiece, and not just because it provides you with all of the tools you need to create your own within the game. I found myself wanting to savor every minute of this game as if I was eating a gourmet chocolate dessert. This game is an absolute wonder and I could not recommend it enough.. A beautiful game that deals with complex issues such as depression accompanied by an impeccable artistic design.. Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a lovely little heavily narrative-based puzzle metroidvania game where you color in the world to navigate the environment. You play as Pizza, the Brush Wielderâs janitor. One day, all the color in the world goes away, and strange black trees show up in the nearby forest. With the wielder, Chicory, apparently out of commission, it is up to Pizza to go save the day. The Brush gives you the ability to paint in the coloring-book like world, allowing you to fill in between the lines with colors, and paint the world. This is used to solve various puzzles, from illuminating the environment to allowing you to move through gaps to activate various things in the environment to achieve some end. In terms of core gameplay, the game is fairly simplistic; you start out with nothing special in terms of powers beyond the coloring, but over the course of the first half of the game gain more abilities â almost all movement based â allowing you to jump, to dive through your paint (allowing passage through small gaps), to climb certain walls, and to swim. There is almost no combat to speak of; there arenât ânormalâ enemies around in the world, only bosses at the end of a few dungeons, the source of the âcorruptionâ in the world. As such, the vast majority of the game is a series of navigational puzzles, using your paint to activate things in the environment, move around things that allow you to destroy other things, climb up walls and then jump, toggle switches, etc. The game basically can be split into two halves â in the first half of the game, Pizza is on their own, going around and fixing the corruption that plagues the world, while Chicory is alone and miserable in her tower. This serves as an introduction to the world and its locations and NPCs, and over the course of this, you end up meeting a bunch of people. However, it is also very low impact; these people play little role in the plot, and only a few of them actually end up mattering all that much outside of a very small section of the plot. As a result, your relationship with these people is very ephemeral â while you briefly interact with them, you donât really build a relationship with them in any way, and so you donât really care much. This makes the first half of the game feel kind of weak â while there is an underlying plot, the fact that no one other than Pizza is really seeing it through means it is harder to care. But at the midpoint of the game, things change; events transpire that result in Chicory going around with Pizza for the rest of the game, and so for the last four major areas of the game, plus the final boss, you have a companion with you. This changes things massively, because the game is very much about Pizzaâs relationship with Chicory and their relationship with the world at large, and the pressures Chicory was under that Pizza has inherited. This makes the game so much better, and Chicory â who was already the most developed NPC â becomes someone that the player cares about, and wants to see succeed and be happy, reflecting Pizzaâs own desires. The playerâs perceptions of Chicory evolve with Pizzaâs own, and by the end, the relationship between the two is very satisfying, and has moved from idol and janitor to master and student to finally one of friendship and mutual trust and admiration. You do things with Chicory and for Chicory, and she does things for Pizza. This gives the whole second half of the game much more emotional gravitas and makes the harder hitting themes hit home. The second half of the game also isnât as cutesy, but it doesnât forget to be cute, and the relationship that grows between Pizza and Chicory has very serious aspects and very cute ones. All in all, by the end of the game, you are pumped and primed to solve the worldâs problems â and to make Chicory and Pizzaâs lives better in the process. One of the biggest flaws with âsave the worldâ plots is that they often feel impersonal, but because of Chicoryâs personal investment in the situation at hand, it becomes much more meaningful and important due to that human connection. There was a moment during the final boss fight that made me laugh with glee, and while I wonât spoil it, it is something that I feel a lot of games really want to do, but which few game manage to earn the emotional investment necessary to pull off. Chicory and Pizza earn their happy ending. If the entire game was as good as the second half of the game was, this would be one of the best games of all time. But, alas, it is not. In the end, this is a game that Iâd recommend, but it is not without its flaws. In particular, the first half of the game is not as good as the second half, and the game has a bunch of quite time-consuming sidequests that are very much a mixed bag, particularly doing a bunch of painting side-quests that felt increasingly time consuming and repetitive.. This Game is proof that games can be an art form. And that they can be a masterpiece.. This game is like mom's cookies. There are no technologies that excite the imagination in it, but if you just try it, you will feel this kindness, softness, inspiration and deep, cozy warm, that not a single robot, and not a single major professional can create. Chicory achieves greatness far beyond what other games lack the ambition to even attempt. It's not just better than almost every other game out there; it's better than those games were even trying to be.. Good game has a wholesome story like Wandersong and unique colouring mechanic. Also amazing soundtrack composed by Lena Raine(Celeste). A really really fun game about art, imposter syndrome, and cultivating creativity where creativity seems to be in short supply. I would say the aesthetic of a coloring book is an inspired choice. It allows the player, or a chaotic younger sibling as player two, to really paint the world and make it your own (HAHA BUTTS). It's cute, charming, silly, exciting, but it also doesn't pull punches when it delves into it's darker themes. A well crafted story, albeit short, that has been crafted with love and care as well as a hint of sadness. Additionally, Lena Raine knocks it out of the park AGAIN with the pan flute, piano heavy tunes on this soundtrack. I'll dock a point for a few cliched story beats and repeated boss fights, but the overall journey I went on playing this game left me absolutely delighted. It even made me cry.. Beautiful storytelling packed into a creative collectathon adventure game. Awesome characters, soundtrack, plot, worldbuilding, and game mechanics.. I expected a cute little game about art, not to be hit in the feels so hard. Chicory is a game full of heart and personality with a story that I found very relatable. It holds a special place in my heart and is securely in the spot of my favorite game I've ever played.. I didn't have many expectations about this. But in the end, I've found me pretty disappointed about this. A beautiful, heartfelt, achingly real game that is, on the surface, about a cartoon dog (named after your favorite food) going on a magical, old-school-Legend-of-Zelda-inspired journey to inherit a magical paintbrush that is the source of all colors in the world. Beneath that surface lies an evocative study of imposter syndrome, the pressure of trying to make everyone around you happy, what it means to be an artist (of any kind, really), and a painfully, cathartically genuine portrait of several distinctly different types of mental illness. You'll cry, but you'll laugh far more often, and if you have even the slightest hint of a creative spirit in your heart, you'll be moved to try and be the best you that you can be, and to reach out as best you can, to help those around you along on the journey up to the metaphorical mountaintop. The gameplay is just as deceptively simple as the overarching themes; what begins as a sort of platforming-by-way-of-coloring-in-the-world-around-you evolves into some of the more technically complex boss fights I've run into, bending and twisting the way you use a controller/mouse, all with a deeply forgiving, customizable level of difficulty that keeps things as fun as they are challenging. With music by the composer behind Celeste's soundtrack, an immense amount of depth and thought put into even the simplest of mechanics, a deeply thoughtful array of options to make the game as user-friendly as possible (ty misophonia filter!!!), Chicory is easily one of the best indie games to come out in recent years, easily and readily comparable to all-time greats like Undertale and Celeste in almost every way. Take the time to play this one, I've no doubt it'll be near the top of all the GOTY lists come December.. This game is unlike any other I've played, and it took me a while to appreciate that. At first, it just looks like a big coloring book where you can color-in simple shapes with a small variety of colors and strokes. That was the first impression. It has a deep story about self-confidence, parental love, and the complicated web of feelings between teacher (""Chicory"") and student (you). There are a few boss fights of minimal importance tactically, and a lot more mazes, jumping puzzles, and other problems for you to solve. The variety of puzzles is one of the game's strong points. It is, in fact, ""A Colorful Tale"" -- so much so that it may alter how you see the world around you. If you're worried you lack the needed talent, you'll fit right into this story. You can spend a lot of time coloring the panels as you progress, or you can largely skip that part. For the money, it's a worthy purchase. If you mainly like killing stuff, walk on by.. I can't even put my feelings into words. What an amazing game. Definitely a must try!. Superb game. Story hits many emotional notes, graphics are super cute and of course Lena's soundtrack is amazing. Well worth picking up!. Greg Lobanov's (Wandersong) remarkable talent for writing ambiguous and engaging stories is revealed once again. I love how warm, clever and charmful this game is. A wholesome Top-Down adventure about painting a world with colors! Gameplay is as fun as it sounds with some unlockable tools and puzzles that are just right on the difficulty scale. I had high expectations for the story since it's by the team behind Wandersong. As someone who draws for a living, the themes Chicory explores hits right at home. In fact I'd say anyone with creative passions will find something to enjoy here.. I thought this game is a fun cozy chill game about coloring some stuff but turns out is SO much more than that. There is actual gameplay and story there, accompanied by really good music. Highly recommend it for every fan of adventure games.. A decent adventure game that focuses on creativity and colouring. It offers some nice mechanics and exploration elements. For creative people and fans of activities like color by numbers this might be a big hit, for all others .. maybe a skip.","""Chicory: A Colorful Tale"" is one of the best indie gems i have played . sadly the game is better suited for switch... coloring is not as fun on ps4/ps5 . the game has been celebrated for its approach to topics like mental health ."
359.Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,"The best game ever. Gameplay will make you satisfied and will make your day But this game isn't for everyone. simply perfect, the definition of a hard game, ladies and gentlemen. play this game only if you have the mind in a good state, because it will make you suffer asf.. I just finished Sekiro 100%. All the bosses, all endings. It was my first fromsoftware game. I must say I loved it as mush as it hurt me . Definitely the most difficult game I ever played. But beautiful mecanic of gameplay except the camera.. One of the best action games EVER. A cousin to the soulsborne like games of fromsoft, it carves out its own identity and stands strong on its own. The main strong point of the game is its incredible combat, wich is in my opinion the best in any game ever. The world- and art design and the story are both great too. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sekiro is challenging yet fun game. it explores through the story with such great mechanics. I loved the movement in the game. Nothing was more satisfying than filling the parry bar on a boss or mini boss. The only part I didnât like was the difficulty of the game. They make mini bosses way too strong and the dodging is not what Iâm used too in similar games such as eldin ring.. Game is overrated Lore is ****, story basic af and pretty useless, characters are devoid of any personality You basically go through same area 3x with some new enemies even the bosses are the same early game, mid game and end game... Skill tree is 70% useless, don't even bother unlock the last 2 pages as they serve no useful purpose Same for the arm upgrade. And finally end game boss is stupid hard for no reason, gotta cheese your way for most bosses, what's the point ? Better spend your time on dark souls games. Its a great game. It has a bit of a learning curve, but when you get past it the game is so much more enjoyable. Anyone else that **** on the game is just ass. Along with Elden Ring is the best From Software game, certainly the toughest.. Game is limited to 60fps ( you need to download mod to unlock ), ghosting when moving the camera, camera mouvements make me sick, no keyboard localisation... Uninstalled after 1h I don't understand how this game is ""Game of the year"". Ghost of Tsushima: A Samurai Epic for the Ages Ghost of Tsushima is a masterpiece that stands as one of the best games ever created. Set during the Mongol invasion of Japan, it delivers an unforgettable journey through the eyes of Jin Sakai, a samurai torn between honor and **** game's breathtaking open world captures feudal Japan with stunning landscapes, from serene forests to war-torn villages. Combat is a true highlight, offering a perfect balance between precision-based swordplay and stealth tactics, allowing players to approach battles in their own **** story is deeply emotional, exploring themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the cost of war. With its compelling characters, cinematic presentation, and captivating gameplay, Ghost of Tsushima is a landmark title that redefines the samurai genre. A must-play for any gamer.. The stealth and grappling parts are quite fun. I just wish they made an easier mode. I've beaten Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, and Sekiro still owns me so hard. This basically boils down to how good you are with parrying, I mean ""deflecting"", and rhythm. The exploration is pretty forgiving, but several of the later bosses are just way too hard. Overall, I found this to be more fun than Dark Souls because of how fluid movement is, but the bosses are just so frustratingly difficult.. Beginning, it was so punishing that I uninstalled like 3 times. Then picked up again when I had nothing else to play. Gave it all focus, patience and commitment. Damn, its so so so satisfyingâ¦ what a story, combat is so engaging, must learn which tool is effective against which enemy -strategize. At the end of it - i came out a better gamer, strongerâ¦three or four endingsâ¦ did new game plus twiceâ¦ growth arc from day 1 till now is a long exciting and mindblowing experience. Hesitation is defeat ,masterpiece ,had some problems with demon of hatred but figure out. This game's combat is the best ever in a video game and the boss fights really make you feel like you are fighting a more skilled opponent than just an oversized goon, peak game and the 3rd best soulsborne game ever, it lacks memorable soundtracks, content and overall versatility. But even all of that is executed well, fromsoft drop the dlc brah.. masterpiece deserves 93 as a scorein my honest opinion, it's a well-made game in every aspect and has few flaws. I am huge Souls fan, I had played all From games (including Elden ring) before starting Sekiro. Many people told me that it is best Souls game. However, I do not *completely* agree. It definitely has the potential, but here is where it fell flat for me (compared to other souls games): 1. Overwhelming initial difficulty - you just start with 1 flask and a pathetic health bar and almost no tools/skills at your disposal. And it takes a while to acquire some better gear, which is most of the time acquired by defeating bosses and mini-bosses - and most of those are very challenging. In other Souls game there is always a more linear difficulty progression. So it is quite understandable why some players just give up and never finish this game. 2. Underwhelming prosthetics, skills and upgrades - while they sound good on paper, and definitely are in the early to mid game, most skills and most prosthetics are simply not worth it in the end-game. I beat the game 3 times only using 2 of dozens of combat skills - Double Ichimonji and Mortal Draw. The other skills were either too under-powered or cost too many emblems or skill point investment. Most of the prosthetics were highly situational, so again I was using mainly 2 or 3 of them. 3. Replayability - as you may heard, Sekiro is a rhythm game and if you master the rhythm of deflecting, countering and pressuring your opponent - you are going to have a great time. And you need to master it in order to defeat some of the more challenging bosses However, once you master it, there is almost no incentive to come back. In other Souls games you can always experience something new, by starting a new character build, focusing on different set of weapons and upgrades, and so on... Still, I think it is a solid game that deserves to be experienced, especially for Souls fans. The feeling of overcoming a challenging boss after two hours of dying, and later destroying him in the first try on the second play-through or gauntlet, is unmatched! However, I think I have to put the game on the last spot in my Souls-ranking, to be shared with DS2. It was so close to a 10. The combat is amazing, the artstyle is beautiful, the cinematics are epic, the boss fights are almost perfect. However, it tends to repeat areas and minibosses a lot. Are the areas and minibosses cool? Yes. Are they fun to interact with? Hell yes. Do they make the game look like it's lacking in content? I guess. Also, is it just me or do the characters in this game feel flat? Some characters do show emotion, however, i feel like most characters in this game are just too stoic and cold. I get that this is probably intentional to show the mannerisms of people in Sengoku Japan, however, a bit more of personality for each character would be nice. It is just unfortunate, but I do think that its combat system and artstyle carry this game hard and it is saved from receiving a lower rating.. Beautiful game with unique combat and nice locations. FromSoftware knows how to make their games look good while at the same time keeping the file size small. This is what gaming is supposed to be: fun and lovely crafted experience without mtx, battlepasses or forced political agenda.. inlove all of this game the hit box the enemies the guardpose the lore is amazing. I beat this game 3 times, one playthrough was charmless and demon bell. I like the game, but it has so many annoying and janky flaws that make it annoying to play. The stealth ****, steatlh deathblow works like 60% of the time, the sprint is horribly janky, the grapple hook is unresponsive, the input buffering is terrible, the camera ****, most hitboxes that arent swords are HORRIBLE, most minibosses **** or are not fun, and half of the main bosses are mediocre or just terrible. I only liked isshin SS and father owl, all other bosses are annoying to replay. didnt like the mob minibosses and the reuse of drunkard enemy. The starting of sprint animation is janky and some badly designed combat boss arenas were annoying. Could have been top 5 combat systems in any video game of all time, but it has way too many annoying flaws that are just a staple of fromsoft at this point. I only played this game because there is no other game that does this, not because its great. Its unique and a niche, not a masterpiece. Its mediocre at best from a design perspective.. One of the best soulslike genre, if not the best. Very different from the Dark Souls fÃ³rmula but if you're looking for a real challenge, get this game. loved this game. My preferred one so far. In Sekiro you have to be aware of your limits, learn to overcome them, try to improve, be determined and have a lot - a lot - patience.. The best souls-like game currently on the market. There is no other game with such powerful fighting combat system. Super hard, but also super rewarding. LOVE IT. The first Soulslike game i engaged in. Though it might be suffer while being killed dozens of times, but after being familiar with the enemies, the battle become an epic performance. I would like to fight with Ashina. Great world, with some of the best boss fights of any video game. Steep learning curve, but you will be rewarded with a great experience.. An amazing and satisfying game, combat feels amazing once you get used to it and the world is beautiful. Parry Parry Parry Attack Attack die revive cure Parry Parry Attack die one of the best games ever. Maybe my favorite souls game when it comes to pure intensity and bosses , I think the mechanics are the tightest from software ever made, everything works well.. Incredible difficulty which seems at first immeasurable but which becomes surmountable only by showing intelligence and with precise mastery of attack, dodging and defense times making the fights of exceptional beauty and realism.. This game is just bad. It gives the illusion of adventure for the first six or seven mini-bosses, and then just becomes a stupid, repetitive rhythm game for autistic stimming.. I am a hypocrite. I failed to learn and I almost gave up. I even left a garbage review on metacritic where I cried about the difficulty. The thing is the game is really superb and failure is the player's choice. I was stuck on Madame butterfly for so long, I swear I was never going to get past her. Today I'm finished with the entire flashback section and I'm working on climbing a Ashina Castle. Don't ever give up. Take a break. Watch an awesome video by fightingcowboy, that guy has the best videos. I promise you that you will get there. There is no doubt in my mind; if you don't give up, you're going to get there.. The simple gameplay, combined with comfortable controls and outstanding artistic elements, makes it an excellent game.. It is really the best literally the BEST game i have ever played It is so satisfying in all aspects such as combat and environments this game is justunbelievable i can not wait to see the sekiro 2 sequel. When people said this was the hardest souls game I believed it, but in reality its the easiest with very few hard elements. The bosses are insane but the story itself feels to fall a little flat by the end, almost making the player feel like there was a chunk of the game cut out. Best gameplay ever made 10/10 ****. Hands down the best combat of any Fromsoftware game. Certainly very difficult, but worth getting good at.. My favorite Fromsoftware game , the parry system was immaculate and the final boss was a masterpiece.. Out of every game I've had the pleasure of playing throughout the years I believe this is the best of the bunch. I currently have played through this title 4 times to obtain each ending and each time I felt a sense of accomplishment with every time I beat another boss. Sure, I think someone could argue there is a sense of copy and paste with some of the minibosses but I think that's a minor problem since most can be skipped if you just so happen to choose so. The combat is also flashy and rewarding since it takes true time and effort to get good at it. The DS titles usually have a way to somewhat get around having to fight a certain boss whether it be through cheesing or straight up skipping it while Sekiro makes you go one by one. This is a title truly worth picking up and playing just once. The only thing that I would add in as a negative is the fact that I feel as if I didn't use my prosthetics almost ever. It seems like quite an interesting core mechanic that maybe I didn't fully understand. Nevertheless I unlocked all of them and tended to only use the firecrackers for the Guardian Ape. This never took away from the game but just felt like a part of the game that didn't seem to have a real place within it.. ""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" is a masterfully crafted action-adventure game by FromSoftware, blending intense combat with a rich, immersive story. Set in a beautifully rendered feudal Japan, it challenges players with its unforgiving difficulty and intricate boss battles. The gameâs unique stealth and posture system adds depth to the gameplay, making each encounter strategic and rewarding. Though not for the faint-hearted, ""Sekiro"" offers a deeply satisfying experience for those who seek a tough but fair challenge.. This game is fantastic. Its parry combat system has inspired countless other games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sekiro is a game that has built up a reputation of being one of the most difficult games as of recent. For this exact reason is why consider my personal favourite game produced by from software. It's game that at it's core has elements of typical souls like games, mechanics such as 'bonfires', healing flasks and other similar elements that any souls fan would recognise are really put to use here with it's extremely different combat. From the beginning of the game, you'll notice these similar elements and as most people will, you will start off playing this game as you typically would a souls game. Expect, of course, the parrying mechanic. This is where I personally think serkio really shines, as you slowly play the game more you start to realise that simply dodging attacks won't cut it. Eventually, most people will hit a brick wall that is a particularly boss atop of ashina castle. This is where I, when I first played, got stuck. I was stuck into a continuous loop of death, but there is a moment where you really click with sekiros combat. The game really forces you to sit down and learn it's mechanics. Where most games are forgiving with it's combat, sekiro really pushes you to learn each bosses individual move, and the many possible ways of punishing them. The more fast pace and aggressive combat I never thought I needed. However, sekiros combat isn't just the only thing that I believe makes it from softwares best game to date. The world it's self has very stunning visuals, it makes use of the inherit beauty of Japan as occasionally youll be thrown a stunning visual of ashina. Overall, I could talk more about sekiro and what makes it my personal masterpiece, but of course this game is best experience on your own terms. The only recommendation I can give with this game is to go in blind, and of course hesitation is defeat.. Good boss fights with good combat. One of my favorite game. Sekiro is probably the best game I've ever played. One of the best narrative pieces, the best gameplay loop, graphics that blew me away on my first playthrough, this game is stellar top to bottom. While I don't personally believe a video game can be ""perfect,"" Sekiro is about as close as one can come. The learning curve is the closest thing to a flaw I can find in this game. I eventually learned the gameplay loop and kind of mastered it, but it was a wildly frustrating process, and I've personally seen players quit due to the demanding combat system. Other than that nitpick there is quite literally nothing wrong with this game in my opinion. The story is a bit basic but serves this world and its characters perfectly. I love how tightknit the narrative is, rather than an overarching, in some ways uninvolved story. Every ending being wholly unique and requiring their own individual steps adds a TON to replayability, as does the extensive upgrade system. The bosses are also incredibly consistently good. Not a single boss in this game is overtly frustrating or boring in my opinion. They all had a unique moveset that was fun to learn and overcome, and also all visually impressed me time after time. Sekiro isn't my FAVORITE game ever per se, but it is top down the closest I've seen to perfection.. I have to say it's like banging my head against a brick wall but I love the way it hurts. Even though I'm getting older and my reactions are slipping a bit the parry mechanics are tough but oh boy do they make u feel great when you ""master"" them. So definitely give it a go if your into pain/pleasure kinda things.. It's definitely masterpiece and well deserved GOTY. Combat is amazing as well as the bosses. Story is very immersive and NPCs are remarkable. I would say it's a must play for everyone. 10/10. Was boring and repetitive like all of these dark soul type games. The story **** and at times it was just hard for the sake of being hard not like it actually felt justified. I would recommend a game like Sifu over this simply because its hard but justified, and rewards you in the end with a feeling of satisfaction.. Sekiro is such a fast-paced game, and as such it runs so smoothly. A masterpiece indeed. Before playing it I couldn't imagine falling in love that deeply.. Easily the best game ive ever played..reminds me of times when i beat battletoads with a friend..challenging but never unfair...masterpiece. Probably my favorite game of all time. There is no fluff and the combat mechanics are the most fun I've ever had. Love the story and the characters.. Great game. Really love the atmosphere and combat of the game. Tons of bosses and enemy types to content with. Parrying is a key factor in this game. Content wise is pretty much identical to other fromsoft games. The Story is surprisingly good even though its a soulslike game. The ending, depends on which will leave you kind of heartbroken in a way. Overall this game does almost everything very well and is a definite recommend.. For me the #1 Fromsoftware Game and I love all of them. Sekiro may has the best gameplay ever made. Never before fights felt so massive and satisfying. The fight vs Isshin was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever made in gaming. Beating the game feels amazing.. A really average experience. While the combat is top tier and thereâs some absolutely fantastic bosses, the rest of the game is pretty unremarkable. The areas are forgettable with few exceptions, the music is average with very few OSTs that I would consider great, the stealth mechanics are fine but nothing to write home about and the story is disappointing. Itâs a game with very few flaws, but also a game with nothing that truly stands out save from the combat system.. The best game that I have ever played especially in terms of combat style. The combat style can give you a painful and enjoyable experience. Sekiroâs combat system is amongst the best in gaming and the excellent stealth and traversal systems are equally as good. Even when compared to other From Software games however, this game is punishingly difficult and without co-op or the ability to level up your character there are multiple points at which the challenge will be insurmountable for many players. Sekiroâs quality is undeniable, but personally I feel it would have been a more enjoyable experience if the difficulty was just toned down a notch or two.. It will be remembered as a fast and very batting game and I can't forget this game.. Second favorite From Soft game. I'm a **** for the setting and love a good ninja/samurai game, so I was definitely biased walking into this. But the combat loop was just so satisfying. The clang from the parries and back and forth with each boss got the heart racing every time. Platinumed it a couple years ago, but recently went back to do a couple bosses and still had it. Overall, great experience, punishing gameplay, but all the more satisfying when you overcome the foe.. It feels like the game is just difficult.. to be able to say it is difficult.. Peak gameplay, peak combat, absolutely perfect masterpiece. One of the greatest games of all time.. Absolute masterpiece, incredible gameplay level design and artistic direction , good game even in 2034. I just hate this game,it's way too difficult. I have finished Elden Ring and the Nioh games with some help from summons but I just cannot possibly do it here. I can't say anything more,I understand that for a very skilled gamer this might be great. I am not that bad myself, I played a hella lot of games but sekiro its just unplayable to me because of the difficulty so I cannot give anything else other than 0 for a game that I cannot play. I really don't want to undermine anyone's enjoyment with this game, maybe it's just my skill issue but I honestly believe that this is a fundamentally bad game, one that is not investing in the concept of having fun but on being punished for your own existence, a game that tries to make you pity yourself for how unskilled and pathetic you are. I see how people might enjoy this whole idea for a game but not me personally.. An absolute masterclass of a combat system spearheads this game to glory. Just by playing the first couple of hours, you can instantly recognize it's a FromSoft game but they changed and added so many features from the Souls series that it genuinely feels like something new. The best example is how the combat system differs from the Souls games, being more about countering your enemy repeatedly than cheesing it. It might be a bit rough during the beginning before the combat clicks for you but when that combat clicks it truly becomes a unique experience. Great music, great enemy design (even if it feels like the roster is a bit limited), great environments, and overall just a great game.. Best sword combat in any game period. Once you get used to the mechanics its probably the best combat fromsoftware has ever created! highly recommend it to anyone who likes action games! Combat is 10/10. I have tried, so so hard, to love this one. I love every other FromSoft game. I love being challenged -- I think it's extremely rewarding. I love the utter, unabashed Japanese-ness of this game -- I truly do. It just, so unfortunately, ****. It ****. And that makes me sad. It is a game that robs you of options on how to play. There is also zero payoff to killing bosses -- there's more of a ""good riddance"" feeling, rather than a ""good battle"" feeling after killing a boss that you've been bashing your head against the wall trying to eliminate for days. I hate the control scheme as well. I hate how repetitive it is, and I hate that it actively tries to punish you for dying. The Souls formula (and yes, I am going to relate it to the other ones, because they introduce the same dying mechanic, so I am going to criticize how they erred on it in this one) is perverted greatly by actively punishing you by dying more and more. It was a bad mechanic in DS2, and it was a bad mechanic in Demon's Souls. I can say, for certain, that I am totally sad that I do not like this game, but I can also say, for certain, that I do not like this game.. exciting and engaging gameplay but a repetitive gameplay loop and although it has great bosses they tend to feel as though they don't differentiate enough from the rest of bosses. overall a great one time experience i don't feel the drive to replay as i do with past fromsoft titles. Sekiro is a testament to exceptional gameplay, particularly evident in its combat system. The focus on precision and mastery sets it apart, offering a fast-paced, intense, and deeply satisfying experience. FromSoftware's refinement of Dark Souls' combat system shines through, with Sekiro's combat feeling like a dance of blade and reflex. Unlike traditional RPGs where progression hinges on character upgrades, Sekiro's progression is rooted in player skill. Mastery of Wolf's trusty katana, Kusabimaru, is paramount, allowing for creative approaches to encounters. Whether employing stealth and Ninjutsu techniques or unleashing Combat Arts alongside Prosthetic Tools, every encounter feels dynamic and purposeful. Graphics uphold the game's immersive atmosphere, blending gritty realism based on Japan's Sengoku era with fantastical elements inspired by Japanese mythology. While the story takes a backseat to gameplay, it provides a solid backdrop enriched by memorable characters and voice acting. Traversal is fluid and agile, mirroring the grace of combat. Wolf's mobility, including wall-jumping and grappling, adds depth to exploration, opening up verticality and strategic advantages. Level design, though linear, is meticulously crafted, offering branching paths and varied environments. While enemy variety is generally satisfying, certain areas may feel lacking in diversity, impacting the overall experience. Boss fights stand as the pinnacle of Sekiro's design, offering thrilling encounters that demand skill and adaptation. Each boss presents a unique challenge, with movesets mirroring those of regular enemies encountered throughout the game. The crescendo of techniques and strategies learned throughout the journey culminates in a gratifying finale. Despite its relatively shorter length compared to other FromSoftware titles, Sekiro's concentrated content ensures a rich and fulfilling experience. Overall, Sekiro emerges as a standout masterpiece, showcasing FromSoftware's prowess in game design. With its emphasis on skill-based gameplay and meticulous attention to detail, Sekiro earns a well-deserved rating of 9.8/10.. The best game of all time basically. Combat is incredible, the story good, and the final boss is perfect.. This is the perfect game for me. It has all I ever would want from Samurai based game. It has the best combat system that i've ever seen - it's so flawless that I have no idea how it was possible to develop such game. This game is difficult - probably the hardest game that I've ever played but it's also fair. It's fair in a way that when you learn how to play you will just beat the game. It's definition of ""get good and get rewarded"". Unlike other souls game there's 0 rng involved in this game which is why it makes it so rewarding. When you die you know that you died because of your fault, when you win you know that you would beat that boss second time on first try.. Just a masterpiece... only flaw is the limitation of 1 combat art but easely solved with a mod so i can change CA mid fights no pause nor restraints. Having such ability without mods would be flawless as is.. Fun mechanics but too difficult to be enjoyed. I'm very shure some people will like this but its not for everyone. A great game ! Really good mechanics and very fun gameplay , not a surprising history but itâs kinda good. Amazing combat after you master it, a boss roster that rivals ds3 and above average areas with some superb exceptions. Great narrative/story really the best one among the souls games, in terms of story.. A true masterpiece. The game has stunning visuals and intricate world design that immerse you immerse you in feudal Japan. The unforgiving difficulty level pushes you to the limit, fostering a sense of accomplishment with each victory. The game is masterful in game design, storytelling, and artistic vision. If only the game had decent controls, it would have been the single best game of all time.. Very hard to learn but is one of those rare games that you can improve your stills at and replay to take different branching paths through the world. Brilliant world design and a story that makes more sense than most of the FromSoftware souls games. Recommended!. Challenging but rewarding. It is not a typical Soul game but probably one of the most entertaining one to play.. 1 - it's not a Souls game, is a bad game based on pressing buttons at the right time. And this is really hard 2 - the right time to deflect is really fast, or extreme slow, just to frustrate you. 3 - it's a bad mix between spider man, metal gear solid and a rythm game 4 - standard ps4 version has not good fps, so you don't make right decisions sometimes. Furthermore, a lot of camera problems 5 - completely unbalanced. Lots of mobs surrounding mini bosses all the time. This is ridiculous because the game was designed to 1x1 combat 6 - most items are useless 7 - money is useless a lot of times as well 8 - bosses completely overpowered, you must decorate every movement and the correct time to increase a bar to a big blow 9 - you don't feel the same feeling as on Souls games, because you try and die a lot of times and it'stoo annoying 10 - there is just one weapon ingame 11 - you cannot customize almost anything, not even reset your character 12 - everybody knows that any other Souls game is way better than Sekiro, but they made it right on Elden Ring some years later. 13 - check for gameplays before buying. Don't believe in reviews. Souls are fair games. Sekiro is not.. Probably the most rewarding game ever made. You start your journey as a weak samurai dying constantly to simple enemies, and by the end of the game you feel like an unstopable force and can defeat most of the early bosses on the first try. Your character gets stronger but most of all the player gets more skilled and you feel the progression in this game more than in any other game out there. An unforgetable masterpiece. 4 Years after playing it I still remember a lot of bosses and moments, which can't be said for most games.. One of fromsoft greatest games. If Sekrio had a dlc, it would probably be the best game of all time. you can talk with Emma. But without joking I love this game. Combat System : great Bosses : great Locations designs : great Game is more easy than rest of souls games. You have a character made for the story and you don't need to create ur own. You also don't have all the attributes like vigor, dexterity faith and so on. You just need to explore to find items to upgrade ur health and power attack and that's it.. when I first got the game I thought it was going to be something like Dark Souls game but I was wrong, you donât get as much character customization but the combat system absolutely changes everything. I have never seen something like this before and in my opinion, more games should have this system. I would recommend it. I was honestly skeptical at first but fromsoftware truly did a bold step by stepping away from their usual souls formula to create another truly fantastic masterpiece. The gameplay, world, and bosses are all so rewarding.. Likely my single favorite combat system of any game I've ever played in my life. Combine that with excellent worldbuilding, good characters, and an overall strong atmosphere and you have a borderline masterpiece.. I am a fan of soul series and this one is undoubtedly the hardest one ever. I had given it a try before I deleted it finally because it is just too hard. Now I pick it up again and try hard on practising it again and again, i fall in love with it.. A triumph in gaming. Simply perfection. The gameplay is so refined","a cousin to the soulsborne like games of fromsoft, it carves out its own identity and stands strong on its own . the main strength of the game is its incredible combat, wich is in my opinion the best in any game ever . the only part I didnât like was the difficulty of the game ."
36.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"GTA San Andreas in my opinion is one of the greatest games of all time until 2024.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Goat of GTAs with GTA IV the story is the most exciting of all games of the saga. I keep on being drawn back to los santos to show the Ballas whatâs up. Favourite of the series. This game is master piece for a game made in **** has the best open world i've ever been **** music is absolutely **** plot is amazing with insane plot twists.Overall this is the best video game of all time.. This game has everything to keep you engaged and even after completing the game you have plenty of stuff to do. Game was very rich for 2004 in terms of mechanics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the best Open World game not only for PS2 but also for every platform this game on. Pretty good story, good looking graphics, great music, and a fun free-roam gameplay. If that's not enough for you, there's even a multiplayer mode (console only) that you can play if you have 2nd controller of course, and you can also activate many kinds of cheat (just don't save your game with cheat activated or it might affect your save data). Overall, if you type in ""Best PS2 game"" on internet or other social media, you'll always find this game because it's just that good. ""A classic masterpiece with chaos, freedom, and an unforgettable open world!"". One of the best games of all time, i just played it for one hour, and its very good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Insane for 2004 and Best gta ever tbh with so much to do even after main story. Is there a more iconic game than this one? It has made a deep impact on me, each time is like going back to my childhood. Absolute masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As a 50 year old I was a young man when the late 80s and early 90s occurred and one of the greatest pleasures of this game is its incredible nostalgia value. The soundtrack is without doubt the best ever compiled and the LA vibe is perfectly represented in Los Santos. Fun missions, classic characters and wonderful environments make this game a Genre defining moment in time, and if you're looking for one of the greatest games ever made I suggest you go and buy it now. The hype around this game is highly deserved.. I haven't played this game on this platform. It's just that Metacritic doesn't allow me to delete my rating.. This game is perfect, from stealing cars to flying airplanes, the first time I tried it I was captivated.. My favorite of the GTA games because Yes, it may not be as realistic as 4 or 5, but it makes up for it by being far more fun. The game especially in modern day standards the game is a train wreck. But that's what I love about it, and that's whats so fun and worth playing today. Theres a level of video game randomness and wackyness that keep these ideas and game so fresh.. Without a doubt, the greatest video game ever made. Grand theft auto San Andreas Does literally everything correctly from the engaging story, the incredible gameplay mechanics, even the soundtrack and the dialogue. I am amazed that a 20-year-old game can still stand up to the triple a Titles of today.. Best game everIt is one of the most beautiful games I have ever tried in my life. Who is itbetterGames inHistory and fromHe said noHe lied a fairy gameand ahead of its time. One of the best piece of art that I've played...(Used cheats in hard mission tho). Perfect! This game is Perfect! This game have a open world, nice story and perfect characters.. Literally the most classic game of all time, everyone remembers this game and as it still surprises today with its advanced ""realism"" for its time, it's even better with mods (there are more than 1 million). simply the greatest of all time. i wish they did better with the definitive editio. The best game of the GTA series although there are some problems on the PC side, it does not reduce the quality of the game. Here it is - the childhood game! Yeah, what a babger that was! Completed the story like 3 times on 3 different devices. And for sure it worth it! 3 cities ready to explore, a lot of possibilities (of course for 2005, but better than all ever before) and much fun! Iconic characters and main story. I think almost everyone played it, at least once. A masterpiece of 00âs!. I don't care about,Is 2004 and The history, characters, activities IS better than Cyberpunk, or another things of another game of the new generetion. Leyend,I'm from Spain, maybe i don't write alright. The best GTA game. The story was amazing, the graphics for its time was great, the gameplay was ahead of its time, the soundtrack of the game is the 2nd best of the series, and exploring the open world was amazing, the characters were all memorable (it has the best antagonist in the series), and it's very fun to play. Overall, 10/10.. Clearly one of the best games ever, for the fact that it brings so much content into the game ESPECIALLY for the year 2004, the only games bringing this much content and small details is probably rdr2 by far, so i heavily recommend you try this.. Rarely in games you get attached to the characters and story so well. The variety in the scenarios and the characters is astounding, Grove Street For Life. the greatest game of all time rockstar didn't give the remake justice definitive edition wasn't good at all like the originals. quite simply the best GTA out there! Endless possibilities and a grandiose map!. The bestThe best game definitely, I don't know a game (I've I played) best.. Oh my gosh! This game is one of the best games I've ever played. I remember playing it on my PlayStation 2 back in the day. Wow, how time flies!. Best video game ever made. Still in 2024 there is no game to rival the amount of activities, variety of landscapes, cars and character customization, empire building, relationships forging in this game. Ps this one has the best driving mechanics of any gta out there. Less heavy than 4 and less arcade like than 5.. Gta San Andreas is a very cult game for me. It is one of the best games of its time with its Atmosphere, Open World and many other materials on a solid ground. First of all, the open world is one of the most robust gta games, this open world is big and there is a lot to do, so you can really feel yourself in a country in the game.I can say that the graphics are sweet enough to take you back to the first time you played it every time you play. apart from that, the story flow and character deepening are simply amazing. The quests are really varied and I'm sure they will familiarize you with this world completely.Carl Johson arrives in San Andreas in the GTA universe after the death of his mother. Our character is naive at first, but in the course of the story, he turns into a professional killer and business rogue, and our enemies also go through a developmental stage. The game consists of 100 chapters and a lot of side missions, you can definitely feel the atmospheres between cities, as well as village **** course, the annoying thing among all these beauties is that the first version of the game is very buggy, fortunately it is fixed with fixes, but the side missions can sometimes be tiring and repetitive, but it is still great. When the game is played without a cheat, we can say that it requires a solid mental :) Also, the only thing I am really negative about is that sometimes we may have to do the task from the beginning because of ridiculous game errors, which can be very **** despite everything this game is great and a cult. it is definitely a game that must be played before you die. it is obvious that it leaves deep memories in our hearts and brains. it is a great game that I met in my childhood. thanks to rockstar for bringing out such a masterpiece.. A spectacular game. It marked my childhood and gave me moments of great joy. Congratulations Rockstar.. It's definitely a better game than Vice City. But I like Vice City more. Because it is more short and concise. It's easier to finish. San Andreas is like open world games today. Gameplay time is very long. It is not a game that you can always finish, the missions are difficult and some of them are boring.Good Sides; 1_) The graphics are better. 2_) The characters are diverse and well written. Dialogues are good. It's good to have characters from the old game.3_) The tasks and challenges are various.4_) Weapon level system, bodybuilding, these are nice additions.5_) Going to the barber. buying clothes, getting a tattoo. It added fun to the **** Sides; 1_) I think gang missions are boring and repetitive. Even at the end of the game we have to struggle.2_) Girlfriend missions are same as boring and ordinary.3_) There are too many police officers in the game, almost everywhere. 4_) The roads are very long and empty. If you fail the mission, sometimes you have to go very long ways. 5_) Airplane and helicopter control is very **** despite all this, ""2004"" is an incredible work considering its year. It was a lot of effort. One of the games we rarely see.. The best game in history for me, quite simply, yet my favorite license is PokÃ©mon. Very complete game, lots of things to discover, the story mode is exciting and has an excellent lifespan. It has aged extremely well, there are a few bugs, but the countless qualities of this game make us easily forget them.. This game simply added on to its already proven formula, & leveled up. Vastly larger landscape, additional game mechanics, giving the 90s West Coast feel, & control over your player's health & physical attributes . . . Amazing!!! Another masterpiece.. Its a certified classic that will always live long in my memory. Everything about this game just so good especially the story, the missions and the character. The world also has so much variety.. A tasteful experience, truly an epic storytelling and unique 90s black culture experience. Must-play.. As someone who grew up on the PS2 GTA games, this is definitely my favorite GTA game of all time. Being a Cali resident my whole life, I love the setting immensely. Plus this game felt like it had the biggest map with three different cities in one GTA game. Not to mention CJ is the best protag. And as a fan of classic hood movies, I loved the story of this game as well. Not to mention, they really brought all the bangers for their Radio stations in this one. Even if it looks a bit rough nowadays, San Andreas still holds up super well and is peak GTA for me. Also, my Dad and I used to play this game together when I was a kid, so I have some sentimental attachment to this GTA in particular.. The game was good makes you feel like a real gangster and the gameplay but the world was so big and boring you only drive around with your car or attack ballas but i really enjoyed the game ngl. This game is great, anyone who claims otherwise is gay this game is a game this game is a game. This game is simply amazing, great gameplay, I spent a lot of hours enjoying it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The map is big and there are many things to do, so this game is one of my favorite GTA games.. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas stands as an undisputed masterpiece that earns its perfect 10/10 rating through a combination of groundbreaking features, timeless gameplay, and an unforgettable narrative. Released in 2004, Rockstar Games pushed the boundaries of open-world gaming with a vast, intricately detailed rendition of early 1990s California. The sheer scale of the game world, encompassing bustling cities, serene countryside, and even the neon-lit streets of Las Venturas, is awe-inspiring. CJ's personal journey, rife with moral choices and layered storytelling, adds a compelling dimension to the experience. The introduction of RPG elements, such as skill progression and customizable character attributes, enhances the depth of gameplay. The soundtrack, featuring an eclectic mix of iconic tracks, seamlessly complements the diverse atmospheres. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a flawless amalgamation of narrative depth, expansive world-building, and innovative gameplay, solidifying its status as a pinnacle achievement in the gaming industry.. It's a good game for its time, the graphics are not bad, the story is nice, the game is very enjoyable.. This game is one of the best, if not the best, games I ever played. The story very well written and very detailed, the gameplay is amazing, with a huge map for the player explore, with fun mini-games like Arcade, Pool and Dance. With a lot of collectables to improve the exploration of the map by the player. Highly recommended. Fantastic game. this game is example of great 10/10. The best GTA game ever made. Back in the days When I was a Pony this was ok but I wasn't playing this that much good for the time but in 2023 no thanks. One of the best and most classic GTA's. I grew up with this game, but Vice City is arguably a little more of a classic for me than this.. Honestly mostly gave it a 10 out of nostalgia and indignation at the atrocity that is the ""remade"" trilogy. Still my favourite gta game to date.. the best gta game. One of Rockstar's greatest achievement even to this day.. Amazing open world game classic. GTA San Andreas is my top pick in the GTA series. Its exceptional story, character development, and gameplay make it stand out. The side activities and music are fantastic, offering immersive experiences. I often got lost in the game, enjoying everything from flying planes with Tom Petty's music to countryside drives with Conway Twitty and Jerry Reed. The game's plot twists made it even more memorable, and I wish I could experience it anew.. If GTA III and Vice City established GTA and Rockstar a name to be reckoned with, then Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas made them THE NAME be reckoned with. There is just so much to say about this game it's hard to know where to start. It does everything in the previous GTA's, but only now its across 3 states separated by countrysides and desert. The all star cast is back with even more star power. From Samuel L Jackson to rapper ""The Game"". There's over 100 story missions to participate in plus so much side content, you won't even know where rot start. It's a massive, sprawling game that pushes the PS2 to its absolute limit. If you haven't played this game yet, what're you waiting for? Not much more needs to be said. It's a masterpiece that is arguably still to this day the best GTA. Go play it. Now. Official Score- 9.8/10. It's easily one of the best games I've ever played, even though it's from 2004 its mechanics aren't dated, the game is extremely vast full of things to do, for me it's easily the best GTA I've ever played.. A game filled with fun and amazement. You can feel throughout the game that it was made by people who really know what is swag.. this game is my childhood. this game much more than a game, this game is a age.. One of my favorite games when I was a child. Growing up wanted to play again. I must say, it is all nostalgia. The game is utter garbager, very very bad. Really not worth to waste your time. Game is actually very boring and there is nothing fun to do in it. It is very poorly made. Story is irrelevant and stupid anyway. Mechanics are poorly designed. The worst part of the game and BY FAR, are the missions. THE MISSIONS ARE ABSOLUTE TRASH. If you play this game, do not do the missions. Just have fun with cheats and thats it. Highly over rated game, just good because back then all the children like me liked it, but once you are an adult and experience other games you reallise this is actually bad on every level. This game is a big part of my childhood, but I realized I did not play for the story, i played cause it was the only game i had. The only one I had because everyone talked about it. Just fuss no funn.. the campaign in this game is hard asf and the barber is always giving me some fire cuts. As a teen, i could not ask for more than this. I played this so many hours, alone and with friends. Good old times.. The GTA universe is expanded with a much larger play environment, a really well written and celebrity voiced set of characters, an involving storyline, brilliant soundtrack, more varied set of missions and a character that is constantly evolving in the RPG style. For my money, this is easily the best game on the PS2 and despite the obvious technological improvements of the later games, this is still my favourite of the series.. It's exceptional, but I personally enjoyed GTA III and Vice City more. Truly a phenomenal game regardless.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. very fun ps2 game and a lot to do with around 100 missions, but some of the missions could feel like if they weren't in the game it wouldn't change that much. love the characters they really feel like people!. GTA San Andreas is my favorite of the GTA games. The story, characters and gameplay were all masterclass. The side activities and music were all amazing as well. I always found myself flying a plane with Tom Petty playing, driving through the countryside listening to Conway Twitty, Jerry Reed, etc and be zoned out of real life for hours. The twists and turns in the game were also surprising and I wish I could play it again for the first time. Its an EPIC game. I like the gameplay and the visuals were fantastic. I would like to play again in future. My inter holidays with HCL laptop days!. I played Gta San Andreas with 3 years and it was the my first game i played. When i played, I thought I was in the real world because heÂ´s graphies. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. I am really surprised that the meta score for this game is lower than GTA V. In my opinion this game is much more entertaining than GTA V. The story is very beautiful made and the unofficial multiplayer is very nostalgic for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Great Story.......................Great Score.....................Great. GTA San Andreas was a milestone in the franchise. Everything about this game, from cool soundtrack, interesting story to sheer freedom is outstanding. Overall rating: 9.5.. Always enjoyed hunting eastereggs that never existed and the story was very cool with loveable characters.. The best GTA ever created in history, and one of the most complete video games in every respect. GTA SA had EVERYTHING, and on PC, let's not talk about it with the ability to add mods and SA:MP. It covered my childhood and I devoured it worse than the snacks my mother used to bring me after school. It remains and will remain the best GTA of everything, from story, to gameplay to... everything! I wish I could lose my memory and replay it like it was my first time, it's a game that only gets boring when you don't play it.. Game holds up very well, easily the best radio in any gta game besides maybe gta 5. The story starts out incredible but towards the end feels a little too crazy. The missions were very fun for the most part and the ending was satisfying but honestly not that great.. Best ps2 game and best gta game. ""Oh **** here we go again!"" Best world map in gta game series. A Revolutionary Open-World Adventure - Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Rating: âââââ Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas remains a timeless masterpiece that set the standard for open-world gaming. Released over a decade ago, this iconic title continues to captivate players with its vast, immersive world, engaging storyline, and unmatched level of freedom. Set in the fictional state of San Andreas during the early 1990s, the game follows the journey of Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, a former gang member returning to his hometown after the death of his mother. The narrative delves into themes of family, loyalty, and the gritty realities of gang life, delivering a compelling and memorable storyline that keeps players invested throughout. The sprawling open world of San Andreas is a marvel in itself. From the bustling streets of Los Santos to the rural countryside and the gang-infested territories, the sheer size and diversity of the map are staggering. The attention to detail is astounding, with dynamic weather, realistic NPC behavior, and a vast array of activities and missions to undertake. One of the game's standout features is its unparalleled freedom. Players can explore the vast landscape, engage in side activities such as gambling, racing, and even customizing CJ's appearance. The ability to interact with a wide range of characters, each with their unique personalities and stories, adds depth to the world and makes it feel alive. The gameplay mechanics strike a balance between accessibility and complexity. Driving mechanics are intuitive, gunplay feels satisfying, and the RPG-like progression system allows players to enhance CJ's skills and attributes over time. The missions are varied and offer a mix of thrilling action, clever storytelling, and creative objectives, ensuring there's never a dull moment. The soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas deserves special mention. With an extensive collection of licensed tracks from the '90s, spanning various genres, the radio stations in-game provide an immersive and nostalgic backdrop to the gameplay experience. While the visuals may show their age by today's standards, the art direction and attention to detail in the environment remain impressive. Additionally, the PC version offers a modding community that has breathed new life into the game, allowing players to enhance graphics, add new content, and extend the replay value. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a true gaming classic that has left an indelible mark on the industry. Its rich open world, compelling storyline, and unparalleled level of freedom continue to captivate players of all generations. Whether you're revisiting it for the nostalgia or experiencing it for the first time, this game is an absolute must-play for any fan of open-world adventures.. One of the best games ever made! Absolutely must play but better the original, not the remastered version!. One of the best game in the franchise and the best game released on PS2. I think I spent half of my childhood on this game, I replayed it so many times i can't remember how much times anymore. Awesome story, great gameplay and full of minigames and side activities, you'll never get bored of playing san andreas.. I feel like at this point in time, it's more of an 8/10. At the time it came out, it probably felt like a 10/10. And in retrospective, considering the limitations at the time, I'll give it a 9/10. In terms of what they did right, this game seems pretty clearly the best one from this era of GTA. The story is pretty well-done. Characters are all memorable. Voice acting fits really well and has some unforgettable actors involved, like Samuel Jackson, David Cross, and Ice-T. The dialogue brings up a lot of social commentary, which I feel like is an underappreciated aspect of these games, and this game does it exceptionally well, referencing the LA riots from 1992, among plenty of topics here and there. Plus, this game can be funny. ""All you men think about is ****ing! **** this! **** that!"" ""I'm sorry, baby!"" The map is relatively huge and well-made. Everything flows really well, with loading times only being for building interiors / missions. You can swim, use a jetpack, and all the other normal GTA stuff like use tanks, planes, military helicopters, parachute from anywhere, take the train... You can date multiple girlfriends, who provide perks, vehicles, and outfits as you progress. Worth it for the two girls who let you keep your stuff when you die or get arrested. The added mechanics and different stats do make this a pretty immersive game. Gang territories are actually pretty fun, despite being somewhat repetitive. However, we must admit there are a few problems with this thing that can be pretty hard to overlook. First, it is incredibly frustrating to lose certain weapons after doing missions. It's weird, some missions will end with you have 50 rockets, and then after other missions, you'll lose like all your ammo for a couple weapons. Second, flying is such a pain in the ass to get used to sometimes. I feel like it adds some weight of realism, but the reason these GTA games are so fun is because they get ridiculous, and it comes across as more clunky. Third, buying clothes takes SO LONG. It takes like a full minute just to try on and buy 4 articles of clothing. I watched unrelated videos online to fill the time so I can buy everything, which is also kind of an issue: There isn't a big thing to buy. I can buy everything out well before the game is over. Fourth, I was not warned that I would lose the option of gang territories after about 30% of the story was done. This made me keep waiting for when they'd bring it back and it made me start to get a little impatient with the story, which did get a little bit tangential after that. That all said, it's still a really fun and addictive experience. The game's got a lot of personality, it does a lot of things right, despite its flaws, and I would consider it a top-tier PS2 game.. The best game of all time and my favourite game in my life ÐÑÑÑÐ°Ñ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ° Ð² Ð¼Ð¾ÐµÐ¹ Ð¶Ð¸Ð·Ð½Ð¸ 10/10 Grove Street for life. There is very little I can say about this game that spanned most of my childhood. Although it is a very old game, it is one of the rare games that I will enjoy even if I play it now. Characters, story, plot, map, quests, etc. When you think about all this, you can't find much missing in the game, they are all unique things. If you ask me, it holds the title of the game with the best features in the ""GTA"" universe. This is the highest rating I can give this game. 9. I mean, do I really have any problems with it? I don't think I do tbh. The gameplay is fun, the story is great, the characters are great, the music is great, the world is great, it's all great. Samuel L Jackson? How in tf. The cheat codes are god tier in this game. Flying around in my car listening to the radio. My childhood! I liked the idea of multiplayer even though it didn't really work out too well. But who cares, you don't get this game for multiplayer. You get it to kill fools. This game is truly amazing, I wish it would get the remake it deserves. Instead we get the trash af ""Definitive edition"". AMAZING. Incredible story, incredible characters, soundtrack and in addition to being a legendary, incredible and fantastic game, it is a PS2 and Rockstar Games classic. There are no words to say how perfect this game is.. The best GTA quite clearly, it's an amazing game and thanks for existing, I don't think anyone will not like this game. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. I mean, it's a great game, but the story is a bit... meh. Nothing special. And the action is a bit repetitive in some points. The best is the map, 3 cities and a lot of country in between to get lost looking for easter eggs and details. So yeah, play it even if it's not te best GTA out there.. GTA San Andreas the best GTA game ever I've ever played and It will be. Thanks for the developing this game lol.. It's my favorite game, especially the online of it (samp), good main characters and a very good story. What can be said about San Andreas that has not already been said? it is one of the best games in history, with an impressive world and mechanics for those years, today it has aged, but even with the passing of the years it continues being fun and cool in his own unique way. Classic of classics. Great world, great story, great soundtrack, great activities, great everything. With the San Andreas, world is yours.. Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets. [Rockstar. Legendary radio songs, great driving,shooting, addictive story. 10/10, dont buy definitve edition, this one is still better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. pls add hot coffee mod pls pls pls pls add hot coffee mod pls pls pls pls add hot coffee mod pls pls pls pls add hot coffee mod pls pls pls pls add hot coffee mod pls pls pls 31. Probably by far the best GTA of all time. almost everything was just right here, a huge open world, a brilliant story, great characters, 90s setting, sex, violence and drugs, a very varied open world, a very popular and organic open world with which even modern games sometimes can't keep up can. 9/10 because the PC version is the better version and because of the model airplane mission, which is really annoying. Oh yeah and I had my first girlfriend in the game lol. Das wohl mit Abstand beste GTA aller Zeiten. hier stimmte einfach fast alles, eine riesige open world, eine geniale Story, tolle Charaktere, 90er Jahre setting, Sex, Gewalt und Drogen, eine sehr abwechslungsreicher open world, eine sehr beliebte und organische open world mit der selbst moderne Spiele teilweise gar nicht mithalten kann. 9/10 weil die PC Version die bessere Variante ist und wegen der Modellflugzeug Mission, die halt echt nervig ist. Ach, ja und ich hatte meine erste Freundin in dem Spiel lol.. A classic with variety of missions and cities to explore, a big open world and improved mechanics from previous games.. I don't know anyone who hasn't played GTA San Andreas and not enjoyed it.. unless there some ignorant boring no fun boomer or something lol ANYWAYS.. this game holds a lot of #1 titles when it comes to PS2 games and for good reason, its by far the best game on the PS2 that has ever existed.. 2nd favorite gta game memes kinda make this game annoying but i still love this game so much only thing really bad about it is the controls but its a ps2 game so obviously it has bad controls. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my childhood games, gotta say it's my #1 favorite game of all the games I've played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. zero missions and plane missions are the two mains flaws but besides that it's a classic. Gta it so good and perfect because this graphics and animation for year 2004 it so good. Rockstar Games thanks for the childhood. ""Grove street. Home, at least it was before i **** everything up"" (c) CJ. The greatest game to ever be in the Playstation 2 and the greatest game of all time.. GTA is my favorite game series. It is so immersive and well crafted. You get the freedom to do many things and have fun around the huge world.. Brilliant game. Will always have time to play this. I still enjoy this game to this day. I don't need to write a full review because I'm sure everyone has played this by now. The story line is amazing and all the characters are unique and memorable. The graphics on the PS2 are still great although the Xbox original one is definitely better. Some people how ever may prefer the PS2 looking one.. This game is rated M for Masterpiece (bunch of pointles text because my review is not long enough:-). IN PC game has too many bugs like if you close framelock you can push cars can't go out form gym DÄ°E when you jump at anhother bulding graphics bad for 2004 game is","if you type in ""Best PS2 game"" on internet or other social media, you'll always find this game because it's just that good . if you type in ""Best PS2 game"" on internet or other social media, you'll always find this game because it's just that good ."
360.Tekken 8,"Best fighting game on the market on par with SF6, has some problems but still enjoyable. Tekken 8 It's Full Best Game Ever Battle Fighting Everyone Anymore 5 Stars Full-Rating. As usual,game is everything we expected from a new tekken(new graphics,mechanics,game mode,story,character moves)main story/graphics is a lot better than 7,heat system/counter ability when you block,new punishing counter,etc need some time before getting used to(i personally didnt like the combo breaking counter ability),overall the important core gameplay like long #$$ juggle air combo feeling,ghost battle etc is still the same and thankfully most of the characters i usually used is not one of that paid dlc characters or otherwise i would give this game a 4. Best Tekken since Tekken 3, absolutely gorgeous in visuals and super spectacular and fluid in fighting. Plenty of offline modes like the Dark Awakens (best story mode ever in Tekken series), Character episodes, Free DLC stories, Arcade Quest, Arcade Battle, Ghost battle, Tekken Ball, etc. Jun Kazama returns and the new character Reina is awesome.. this game is really out of tekken serie , they only think about profit !! you can buy a white ball with 4 dollars for nothing !!. I absolutely hate Tekken. The movement feels clunky and outdated compared to other fighting games, and the combo system is unnecessarily complicated, making it frustrating to learn. The characters, while visually impressive, often feel unbalanced, and the input timing is way too strict, taking the fun out of experimenting. The story mode tries too hard to be serious but ends up feeling overdramatic and boring. Even the online experience is a mess with its lag and matchmaking issues. Overall, Tekken just feels like a chore to play rather than something enjoyable.. They broke our precious game. They turned it into Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. The decision to add more rage mechanics doesn't add to the game. The precision and simplicity are what created this Tekken community. It was the only modern fighting game that emphasized perfectionism and balance between characters, and now they've turned it into a game where the first one to enter the special attack animation will probably win. The way the fight stops so the player can perform the dance and enter a hit worth 50% HP, even when the other player attacks with a low frame - a simple press of R1 breaks the rhythm and the sequence of the fight. And for dessert they decided to release the game again with paid characters Ptw , which is certainly cheeky when not all the characters in Tekken 7 have been released to this day. In conclusion, I doubt this game's ability to create the community that was in its predecessors.. An absolutely worthy successor to Tekken 7, Tekken 8 gets you ready for the next battle! I have a generally favorable view of Tekken 8. Full disclosure, Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise. That being said there is an awful lot to love about this newest entry in the second franchise, however a few publisher overreaches prevent this from becoming a perfect sequel to Tekken 7. From graphics to gameplay Tekken 8 is an amazing and alluring site to behold. The Tekken team have really brought their a game and bringing The saga of the Mishima's to a close. There are a ton of excellent features such as a robust and frantic story mode. The ability to jump into a replay of a fight you played to try and figure out if you could have played a match differently from the moment of impact. Character customization is also back albeit seemingly scaled back a little. And Tekken ball makes a triumphant return as well. There is a brand new mode that serves as a tutorial for the online mode getting players adjusted to what it's like to fight online. Arcade quest is a fun quirky mode that allows you to create an online avatar and simulate the old days of going to an arcade putting your quarter up and battling people in an arcade setting. It's definitely a fun addition that's not quite perfect but I'm hoping gets a lot of adjustments and add-ons in the future. The combat system has been retooled and refined and luckily not to the detriment of casual or pro gamers. Whether you want to dedicate 8 hours or 80 hours there is something here for you. Just want to play with your friends after work? Try simplified controls. These will allow you or your friends to string together combos and rage arts with simplified button controls simply by pressing L1 on your PlayStation controller. Well this won't enable you to win any tournaments, you will be more than able to play some matches with your friends of intermediate skill. However my main gripes with Tekken 8 come from the battle pass and aggressive marketing. Just loading in to Tekken 8 to play versus mode routes you through the online store first and shows you any available DLC characters you don't have yet. Also there are considerable character customization elements locked behind the battle pass and must be obtained with premium currency. Premium currency that as per the usual cannot be obtained just to get the one thing you want but always leaves you with slightly more currency but not enough to afford anything completely. These honestly are the only reasons that prevent me from strongly recommending Tekken 8 to everybody I know. However if someone is able to not be tempted by some of the more aggressive marketing, Tekken 8 definitely has something for everyone.. The best fighting game this year, good job to the devs. Please release some good DLC soon I want the classic Julia back though. The one with glasses was cool, but I want the original back.. Tekken 8 enhances the series with the introduction of the Heat system, allowing for explosive, fast-paced combat where well-timed attacks can turn the tide of a match. The game balances accessibility for newcomers with depth for competitive players, offering modes like Arcade Quest and detailed training tools like Replay Analyzer. Online play is smoother thanks to rollback netcode and crossplay support, ensuring a robust competitive environment. Overall, Tekken 8 refines the franchise's combat mechanics while providing something for both casual and hardcore players. While Tekken 8 may not be anywhere near as bulky on singleplayer content as Street Fighter 6, it still proves to still be a very well-crafted fighting game with tight, intense combat but made more accessible for newbies or casual players with the option of assist mode. The story mode, albeit only a few hours, is incredibly satisfying to go through and delivers surprisingly large-scale moments I did not expect from an arena fighter, and some of the best visuals and spectacle of its genre that rival modern Mortal Kombat.. What can I say, this is the best Tekken game ever made, noltalgic fans will try to denied this but this just have it all from the start, even things I didnât know where necessary, I canât think of a better training mode in a fighting game, graphics, music, quality and quantity content, great netcode, and even AI ghost battles, congrats Harada San.. This game is not a Tekken. Maybe, a Dragon Ball wannabe. But not a Tekken. And it's not because of the developers have killed the game. First of all, the strategy and knowledge of each one of the characters gets lost with the inclusion of garbage like Azazel, the final Devil Kazuya or the Angel Jin. All their unstoppable attacks, their ""magic"" and their **** goes against the logic of this saga, and completelly kills the gameplay. Second, they steal main, iconic characters like Heihachi, Eddie or Lei, just to make people pay for them. Heihachi has been in the saga since the first game, for gods sake. Lei since the second, Eddie since the third. And many more. This is not an addition to the saga as a DLC, like if they were adding a random character from other franchise, it's just the contrary. If they want to kidnap our favourite characters, at least they should put the pull of fighter on the box of the game so we can decide if we wwant to buy ot or pass. Those greedy Bandai Namco people have killed the best saga they had. Congrats.. Tekken 8 offers an exciting and deeply engaging experience for fans of the long-running fighting game franchise. The game introduces several key features that refine and expand its gameplay while maintaining the core mechanics that have made Tekken a staple in the fighting game **** of the standout features in Tekken 8 is the new Heat System, which introduces an aggressive new dynamic to combat. When activated, Heat powers up characters, adding new abilities, moves, and perks, such as chip damage and devastating finishers. This encourages players to take a more aggressive approach during matches, shifting the balance away from defense-oriented play. The system is different for each character, making it a strategic tool for both new and experienced playersâ. The game also introduces a new control scheme, Special Style, designed to make the game more accessible to newcomers by simplifying combo execution. However, this system comes with limitations, as it doesnât provide the depth needed for high-level competitive play. It's ideal for story mode or casual players, but serious fighters will need to rely on the more traditional input methods to master the gameâ. Another notable addition is the Arcade Quest, a mode that allows players to travel the world and compete in virtual arcade tournaments. This provides a fun and rewarding single-player experience, with battles against AI ghostsâAI opponents that mimic the fighting styles of actual players. The modeâs integration of real player data adds an interesting twist and makes for more challenging and varied AI opponents. Overall, Tekken 8 builds upon the legacy of the series, offering improvements in accessibility, strategy, and gameplay modes. The Heat System and revamped practice tools make it both a challenge for veterans and an exciting entry for newcomers. Whether youâre playing casually or competitively, Tekken 8 has something to offer.. I played Tekken 1, 2 and 3 in my childhood. I skipped the PS3 and came back on the PS4 and purchased tekken 7 I was hyped and worried about that Tekken 7 could be the last, because there were no signs for a next game. And then when the data leak came out I was also hyped for tekken 8. but since I purchased that game on my PS5 my fun on that game get lower and lower. That game was designed for micro transactions. in tekken 7 I could get all designs all costumes with playing that game. But now in tekken 8 they costumes for the ingame currency are just crap and everything else even the old character costumes are only available with micro transactions. I was worried about that tekken 7 would be the last. Now I hope tekken 8 is the last one.. The mechanics of this game feel pretty good, the combos and skills are well balanced as they have a level of difficulty and effectiveness at an excellent level in general, the character customization gives you many options and it is interesting to try them, although it also has points that could be improved such as microtransactions (these have been exaggerated with the DLC they released) and in some moments ridiculously effective and unfair strategies of certain characters like Dragunov, this is a very good fighting game that I recommend trying.. Increased in micro-transactions, old character skins behind a paywall, old characters as DLC, and season pass not including stage.. Too many microtransactions, the fight passes are unnecessary, hitboxes are deplorable and there are terrible balancing issues. I've been playing Tekken since 2 in the arcades of the 90s so well over 30 years and I've never been frustrated with Tekken until now. It's very beautiful and fluid but like Mortal Kombat 1, the big corporate companies are eating it's soul and the gamers are paying for it.. Poor balancing, weak story, poor music, itâs a fun game for your average low commitment player but seasoned veterans of the series will quickly find themselves bored of the gameâs repetitive mechanics and generic character archetypes. The new Heat system is an unbalanced trash and the developers had the greatest idea of all time to turn the game in a button smashing hell. There's no skill anymore to have to master the game, just button smashing using moves that completely kills the 3rd dimension of the game. Furthermore, the only focus of the Tekken team now is to get the game as dump as possible to sell copies, and adding useless costumes as dlc. No intention to release a satisfying balance patch that fixes the infinite amount of cheap and game-breaking moves. Worst tekken ever so far, just the graphics is ok. Tekken 7 had a lot of issues, just like other fighting games, but it was af good fighting game at least, Tekken 8 is more like mortal kombat, for casual players.. Tekken is has improved a lot over the years. The game is great and all (heat mode, rage mode, combos, no move list, easy play, nice graphics, vibrant colors, landscape scenes, music, etc.) **** two point deduction is for the lack of story interest. Iâve been in love with Jin since he was introduced in Tekken 3. Why hasnât Harada given Jin a woman who Jin actually LIKES and WANT to be with? I donât know but Harada needs to redeem himself. The story line in the game gets a little boring if the creators donât spice it up with a little bit of romance to keep the game interesting to play. Harada owe Jin a new girlfriend in Tekken 9. I would love to see Jin kiss a new women in Tekken 9 and throw Xiaoyu under the bus. Letâs face the facts, Jin is NOT interested in Xiaoyu so why do they keep pairing them both together in the game? I donât know but they are clearly UNFIT for each other. Come onâ¦â¦Give my man Jin a new woman. TEKKEN 9 would be sooo HOT and ALLURING to play if the developers, simply introduce a new female fighter for Jin. A women who Jin is actually interested in. Since he lost his devil gene in T8. How is he going to win his battles in T9??Harada your sorry ass better not disappoint us in T9!!!. The best fighting game ever! Still a 9/10 until most DLC comes out, then itâll sure be a 10/10 depending on the delivery.. Great fighting game that does not do much differently than previous ones. I think they could have done more with the story. Even though it feels a bit ""samey"" to me, it was still a lot of fun to play as the core features of the game holds up to this day.. Having grown up playing the OG Tekken games this was a disappointment. The gameplay is hollow and flashy, the story is negligible and the overall feel is like watching a cheesy anime movie trying to be Tekken but with all the effort on cinematics rather than gameplay. Its 80% visuals 20% gameplay. In addition the gameplay is so easy and dumbed down that it feels like the game is helping me cheat. Back in the day we had to use cheat codes for that kind of thing now its just built into the game because the developers think everyone is too lazy and stupid to learn how to play. Overall I would not recommend and calling this a must play is like calling hamburger helper gourmet.. This gameplay was probably fun 15 years ago but today game is boring and pointless. It would be nice to see gameplay to evolve at least a little in 15 years.. Basically everything I've wanted in a new Tekken except missing Kiryu as a cross over character. TEKKEN 8 delivers a visually stunning and mechanically rich fighting game experience that builds on the strengths of its predecessors. With its impressive graphics, deep combat system, and diverse roster, it offers something for both long time fans and new players. However, the steep learning curve and potential balance issues might pose challenges for some. Despite these drawbacks, TEKKEN 8 stands as a strong entry in the series, providing a robust and enjoyable fighting game experience that will keep players engaged for hours on end. Whether youâre a competitive player or just looking for a fun fighting game, TEKKEN 8 is worth checking out.. I gave Tekken 8 a chance and whilst it is a solid fighting game I just found myself rather underwhelmed and completely disagree with the journalists shouting it's praises for single player content. Also numerous 10 scores on here feel as though they weren't made by actual people. Technically Tekken 8 is a great fighter, it looks fantastic with some real effort put into the story mode cinematics and blend with the gameplay. It's once you get past these things that Tekken 8 starts to not look so great, character customization is kind of terrible with anything worthwhile behind a paywall and not to mention the mtx shop that they decided to not mention during the build up towards the game being released which seemed very deliberate and predatory to cash in on great preorder sales. It is a shame that such a well constructed game could also be such a disappointment which gets pretty boring rather quickly once you've done the arcade story and tire of just playing online matches over and over again. The game deserves more than 0s and 1s but it's still a game I've already sold not feeling like I'll be investing in it any further.. the best tekken ever its got so much to do awsome fights a 10 out of 10 its so good. This game is great, but it has some problems that I hope will be fixed1- Very high damage 2- Few stages 3- The sound of entering the game and selecting the stage and the sound of comboing and defending are terrible and play badly and loudly. Please fix it and use better sounds 4- It says 59 fps 5- The artificial intelligence of the game in the player vs cpu section should be better and with longer combos 6- Please add characters with supernatural powers and characters with the skill of using different weapons. Absolutely incredible! Iâm a gamer that has preferred the Mortal Kombat series. The latest, MK1 is very disappointing. So I decided to check out Tekken 8 and Iâm like wow! Characters are great, graphics fantastic, sound in music are awesome. Tons of customization and coins for upgrading are easy to come by. Thereâs also paid customization, but you donât have to go there. Huge variety of gameplay modes. Including a very nice single player story and individual character missions. Iâm not big on playing these games online, but this one does a great job of matchmaking. I simply cannot recommend this game enough. It is fantastic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. After coming from my favorite fighting game of all time (TEKKEN 7) this game does not even feel like a fighting game. It is just a game of who can press buttons faster. A lot of the technical skill was taken out of the game in favor of appealing to casuals, which understandably makes more money, but I consider myself a more advanced player. Movement is a joke and the top tiers of the game ruin everything. Skip this entry and save your money. Buy SF6 instead, an actual quality product!. This is a great game,extraordinary story, and the best DLC I love. I don't know why they heating and I don't give a damnwhat they think. F the haters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Everything in This game is perfect characters story grafic and this game is the best fighting in fighting categories. Another part, a bunch of characters, battles, battles, battles, something like a meaningful plot... And besides improved graphics, is there anything to pay attention to and spend time on? I don't think so.. The best Tekken ever! Until they drop pay to win characters as DLCs after you bought a 80 $ game. Nice EA attitude NamCo.. Absolutely the best video game ever made ! The graphics and gameplay of Tekken 8 are stunning ! I'm really falling in love with this gorgeous fighting game !. The story mode is interesting and well done, the graphics are very beautiful and there are several single player modes. I don't play multiplayer so I can't comment.. It gives me more reason to play Tekken again. Definitely better than 6 and 7 combine.. DLC and battle pass have ruined the best fighting game. One of thegreatest things about Tekken was playing to unlock everything in the game. Sadly theyâve hidden the greatest of Tekken behind paywalls. Itâs hard for me to play and Iâm a hardcore fan of the all their games. Unfortunately this is the death of the franchise to me and I wonât spend another dime on extra content. I really wish I waited till the game went on sale to purchase.. I've been playing tekken since tekken 3 and this one takes the cake, it's the best since tekken 6. And I've been playing the game for a while now and I love it, it's better at everything. But that I hate about the game is that some characters have an animation for their heat while others value heat as moves, I hope the company fix that for all characters to be fare playing as thesecharacters.. A complete mess. I play Tekken for around 6 years. So not an OG but not a newbie too. I don't know what that crap is, but that is not Tekken. They did an amazing job with Tekken 7 and their Ego went through the roof so they though they can do whatever they want and people are gonna love it. And the problem is NOT the Heat system. Its what they have done WITH the heat system. Characters are beyond busted in this game where everyone flies around and does freaky funky stuff. If i want that then i play an other fighting game because tekken is not ment to be this way. You know how serious i am when i literally made an account just to leave this bad review. I wish i could refund the game because the end product is not what i thought its going to be. We knew that Tekken 8 will be different to Tekken 7, DUH, but this is literally night and days. Im not even 1% through on whats terrible in this game but i know my thumbs would hurt with all that typing.. battle pass ****. The short of it is that Bandi/Namco getting youtube channels outright deleted over fan created content for Tekken 8 so a boycott is being called. I was holding off to buy because of possible add-ons post review/release, such as the battle pass & store (just don't pre-order anything ever). Of course they dropped and has already been a deterrent along with the price of the base game, let alone the DLC (not including the MTX which just continues to add to the cost). I can get past some of the character imbalances as those are often addressed, however, the recent slaughtering of youtube channels over fan created content I simply can't get behind. If it weren't for the unreasonable actions of Bandi/Namco, I probably wouldn't be here writing this review. People have lost years of work and content they've diligently created. As someone who grew up with the series since the first installment on PlayStation, it breaks my heart to say I will not be purchasing this game anytime soon and I encourage you to do the same. For reference I've played Beta & Demo.. An absolute predatory garbage game. The POS devs and Bandai had the nerve to hide scummy predatory practices like micro transactions and a battle pass at launch just to avoid bad reviews. On top of those horrible practices almost every other feature that is vital to making a game good had gone downhill in the game since launch. This game is just another one of many other modern FG that has exposed how shallow, exploitive, and just plain awful it really is after the initial honeymoon phase. There is no different character playstyles, player expression, or true skill involved anymore. Just braindead mashing, unskilled 50/50 guessing constantly, boring overly long way too powerful corner carry combos, and aggressive overbearing BS system mechanics that make every characters diverse move-set useless. These things make the whole game feel the same and cheap like a player did not earn their win through skill at all. This caters to casuals and people that don't give a **** about competitive FG. Bandai and the devs have shown their awful true colors like most other modern FG and their company's behind them. They have all shown the awful state FG are in today compared to what FG used to be. The supposed ""new era"" of FG is an absolute joke and this game is a prime example of that. It all makes the future of FG look like garbage.. Shady practices adds in microtransactions, dlc, battle pass, couple of months later after release to avoid backlash, now they're also trying to wipe out the modding scene on PC for me that's the last straw, avoid this game as much as possible and if you buy try to buy used or buy 75% off. Mtx shop trying to manipulate you into spending more than you have to by implementing vbucks, also a battle pass and a season pass and if you try to watch a replay with eddy in it you're locked out of your own character and the whole replay ****. How can the game be full price with multiple season passes and still implement f2p tactics? What will these reused asset skins even tho pay for the next broken balance patch?. pure greed from the developers and greedy executives , 2 months after initial review from reviewers and they put microtransactions. Scumbags.. Bandai Namco pulled a cheap move on Tekken 8 by hiding MTX for a whole month after the release then this $70-$100 game received DLC Skin packs for $4 each and a season pass that contains the assets of Tekken 7.. Scummy rip off. Seeks to bleed players dry of money by every mean possible and ban or sue everyone else.. Better stay in Tekken **** dont have battle pass.Arrogance and greed of big companies is growin every year. With **** **** Eddy from Tekken 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 being locked behind a paywall along with the decent cosmetics that wIere basic in tekken 7. Its kind of sad. The game looks and feels better when its not crashing because **** breaking update that ill have to manually verify again on steam because it always seems to have a problem updating. Just you tekken, just you. If you going to lock everything up, let me make my own custom character at least. Make it worth it.. Better than Tekken 7 in nearly every aspect. Incredible graphics, great gameplay, entertaining story mode, innovative features, large roster, fun offline modes, etc.. No penalties for pluggers. Old ported customisation items now locked behind pay wall. Predatory features added 1 month after launch but can't fix bugs or plugger problem. Doubt much the money from DLC and ingame shop will contribute to making this game better for consumers.. Bandai Namco is turning this game into a 50/50 casino with no counterplay. There are obvious favorites when it comes to balancing specific characters. The developers stay silent and implement greedy/hostile updates, like adding a micro-transaction shop despite all the problems with the game that need to be addressed. Balance the game Bandai Namco, fix the server lag, ban cheaters, and make this game about skill again. Stop being greedy.. Game has genuine issues like cheaters, rage quitters, a flawed ranked system, lobbies that don't function properly, and crashes that still haven't been addressed but Namco seems more interested in adding a costume shop that doesn't allow you to buy what you want without paying more than you need, and a battlepass with low-effort recycled items in a game that already costs $70 and sells you a yearly character pass for $40. Characters with such a huge effect on gameplay should not be put behind a paywall, especially when the game is being aggressively monetized in other ways. Even decent free to play games avoid being as blatantly pay to win as this game is right now, and it's only going to get worse as more characters get added to the game without the ability to even practice against them or use the replay takeover feature unless you pay **** actual gameplay is fun and there's a lot to like about the game but the scummy post-launch monetization paired with the other existing issues makes the game hard to recommend, as much as I love it.. Embarrasing post-launch support for this entry in the beloved Tekken series. $120 NZD for a game with abhorrent and predatory monetization and a battle pass that looks like it was spat out by AI. Nothing positive has been added or changed about this game since launch with serious issues like PC performance, online stability and ranked match quitters/pluggers and overtooled characters this is a rough start for a game that showed so much promise. Bandai Namco can salvage this product and reverse some of their baffling design choices, but i can't see that happening.. I've been a long time fan of Tekken for 20+ years now, but this last one has sorely disappointed me. The business practices of Bandai Namco are truly a spit in the face of loyal customers that have already paid $70 USD for a game. Cramming in microtransactions and a battle pass is unacceptable. Their rollout of Eddy's DLC has been horribly mismanaged. Not only is he $10, but you can't even practice in replays if you don't own him. Steer clear of this title until these problems are remedied, which they likely won't be.. With its amazing visuals, smooth gameplay, and many diverse characters to choose from, Tekken can be called the best fighting game of the year, or maybe even of the last few years.. Instead of addressing balance issues and fixing plugging and cheating, Bamco rolls in a crapfest of worthless microtransactions. And all of this after the game got its glowing critic reviews. Gaming outlets should revise their scores.. Bandai Namco's business practices and monetization strategy have killed my interest in Tekken. In terms of gameplay, Tekken 8 is a pretty strong 8.5/10 or so, but the way the game is monetized is straight up disgusting.. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Here's the thing about Tekken 8. It's a great game if we're to look purely at just the gameplay. The music is solid, the new characters are fun to play as, and the story is incredible. Why is my score so low? They've repeated an unfortunate trend that Crash Team Racing have done, and even something Street Fighter 6 has done with DLC costumers/collabs. After all the rave reviews, commercial success, and strong praise from the community, they've added in expensive microtransactions in a full priced retail game. Getting old school costumes for your fighters shouldn't cost so much, especially when older games like Tekken 7 had them in the base game. If this nonsense was never pulled, I'd have given Tekken 8 an 8 or a 9 as my score. But I can't give Tekken 8 those scores after this kind of nonsense. Dropped down to a 1, as Tekken's developers have been taking down the YouTube channels of modders.. Overall gameplay is fun and an improvement from 7. But the after release, battle pass and various other mtx are scummy. Especially when other basic functionality like disconnection rate weren't properly working. This is the only fighting game that has a huge rage quit problem because it isn't dealt with properly like other fighting games. On top of that the quality of the mtx items are extremely low effort and not worth spending any money on.. The game contentis so much fun for me as a first time fighting game player. I am disappointed in the priorities of those making the decisions for the game.There is an ongoing bug that crashes the game for players frequently (present since launch) which ahs not even been acknowledged by Bandai. The ranked system does not penalize people who purposefully disconnect from a match they are losing. It's as if the match never happened. Quite frustrating. Their priority is to implement battle passes and the tekken shop. I understand they need to make money but the quality is disappointing.... F2P MTX mechanics on a full priced $70, AAA is beyond comprehension. Greedy publisher limits customization so they can milk more money out of you via their âTekken Shopâ thatâs announced weeks after the release of the game, or their recently announced battle pass.. I Really l","Tekken 8 is the best fighting game on the market on par with SF6, has some problems but still enjoyable . overall, Tekken just feels like a chore to play rather than something enjoyable . the movement feels clunky and outdated compared to other fighting games ."
361.GTR 2,"Genre defining sim without this i doubt we'd have seen the likes of rf2 or iracing. What a feeling of driving a car in this game. I had a lot of fun. But you need to know, that you must know the tracks very well, the time difference between driving a bend good and great is big, so you will need a lot of practice. the idea of implementing a driving school to learn every sector of a track is great. I wished there will be something similar to understand the many options to setup your car. And the manual doesnt help either. Dont forget to download some graphic mods, that makes the game very good looking even today. Yes, you can play this game with a Gamepad, it only needs to have a lot of analog possibilities.I played with the XBOX controller and it worked. Of course you will see after some hours, why a wheel and pedals are better for this game, but anyway it is still playable.. This is the only racing game I admit so far. It depends largely on driving skills, and gives a great feeling and experience to the player especially with the gaming steering wheel. GTR 2 has been made with a rare dedication and proficiency. For that and by considering everything else I didn't mention. GTR 2 shouldn't be rated less than 10.. Best PC Racing Game of All Time at the Moment. Great content and features with added great game play and modes that include a racing school and a long list of championships to compete. The driving has all levels of difficulty to accommadate all users with all types of controller hardware. Scalable weather and time acceleration in 24hr scales. Great physics and car selections plus the ability to add some of the loads of add on content created by the community along with great league support still make this the best racing sim of all time. Play it with a Wheel of course. My favorite game of all times. Played it 2500h+ between 2006-2009. Has some shortcomings but Simbin never did better so far. RACE07 and subsequents addons where not as good.","this is the only racing game i admit so far . it depends largely on driving skills, and gives a great feeling and experience . great content and features with added great game play ."
362.Total War: Shogun 2,"Shogun 2 was peak Total War. Creative Assembly has not made a good game since and this was released 13 years ago. It was innovative by being able to create your own general and build your army, the visuals were stunning for an RTS game in 2011 and the gameplay was excellent (apart from the desync in co-op, which was sadly never fixed). Pros - 1. General creation and customization is awesome, skill trees are cool 2. Beautiful visuals for an old game 3. Great battle animations Cons - 1. Co-Op desync will happen at some point.. could be early on, could be after 10 hours of play time. 2. The heroes are a little OP and silly 3. Maps could be more detailed.. One of the best Total War titles for sure. Really interested in the shogun era and the game delivered.. Good game, solid mechanics, well planed tactical battles... Lack of innovation for the TW series, one more, almost the same, game. You must get the Fall of the Samurai expansion. It combines the best parts of the base game with gunpowder-based warfare of Napoleon total war. While it might not be the overall best Total War (Medieval 2), FotS has the best battles.. Such an amazing game. Holy crap, Shogun 2 is the king of gaming as far as I think. I do enjoy the esthetics of medieval Japan and the fact that they tried to make all the factions look real with advantages and disadvantages is nice as well, but it still feels a bit dull towards the end game when all of the folks declare war and diplomacy is practically useless, so you have to go warfare management non-stop. Still, it's one of their best so far. Utterly fantastic Total War game, it's amazing. Best Total War game ever. Oh yes.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 9.. This is easily my favorite strategic of all time. Not for everyone, but if you like these type of stuff this is definetely the best ever. Total War: Shogun 2 is a strategy video game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega in 2011. It is part of the Total War series and returns to the 16th-century Japan setting of the first Total War game, Shogun: Total War, after a series of games set mainly in Europe and the Middle East. Shogun 2 is set in 16th-century feudal Japan, in the aftermath of the Ånin War during the Ashikaga shogunate. The country is fractured into rival clans led by local warlords, each fighting for control. The player takes on the management of one of these clans, with the goal of dominating other factions and establishing rule over Japan. The standard edition of the game features a total of eight factions (plus a ninth faction for the tutorial), each with a unique starting position and different political and military strengths. The limited edition includes an exclusive ninja clan, the Hattori, and a DLC unlocks a tenth clan, the Ikko-Ikki.. This is my favourite total War game in my favourite game to past time with . still the best balance of any of the total war games and it has some amazing gameplay in graphics still I would recommend it. The game has a wide range of features. The details are stunning and perhaps better than most previous games in the series. But the main point here is that due to the imbalanced difficulty, or better to say, the irrational difficulty, it is not possible to enjoy it. In fact, all these features have been somehow ruined.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 84 IIIIIIIIII====================. One of the best in the total war franchise. Some of the best mechanics from previous total war games are enhanced, and the setting on feudal Japan? Awesome. Definitely one of the best games in the total war series. Though, some perhaps major, drawbacks: 1. Can only choose from 12 factions. For players of hardcore feudal japan-themed grand strategy games, this number is not that high, since it means you can only choose between very prominent houses.. Often, there is very fun gameplay to be had in lesser, obscure households as well, so in this case the game can comparatively have less depth. 2. Mostly fictional officers and vassals, with randomly generated Japanese names. Thus, it makes the game seem ""shallower"" than it actually is... It is fun and all building a family tree and looking back on your ever-growing household. But with fictional names? Although it seems simple it can definitely feel underwhelming.. and that is not a feeling you want after spending many many hours playing one game. This limitation does not exist in well-researched games, like in Nobunaga's Ambition series. Had these limitations overcome, this game could be close to perfection.. Good game, but I feel rushed by time to complete the objectives in the campaigns compared to other Total War games.. Best Total War game ever. Wonderful mechanics and good graphics for its time, good soldier options.. The last good Total War game. Simple gameplay even the series' infamously braindead AI can grasp, great authentic music, and graphics that look stunning 9 years after release.. the most beautiful game in the series, and a very enjoyable multiplayer mode.. It's 2020 and I can still go back to this game. And is one of the few Total War games I keep going back to play time to time. Not many games have that replay value and still feels fun each time you play it. Shogun 2 have, in my opinion, the smoothest gameplay of all the Total War games. Which makes it a more fun experience to play.. Use Yari Ashigaru and Bow Ashigaru and Profit ,and take Oda for max efficiency. It's the most masterpiece in the Total War series. It is the most interesting game. It's like a real medieval Japanese war game. I think the samurai of that era would have actually been at war like this.. Good game! I love this series since Rome Total War. Got it for free on Steam - happy as an elephant) All the names for me, a European, are very unusual, but in general the game gives great pleasure! Compared to Rome Total War, AI has changed for the better. Now the enemy you are attacking will not stand and wait for your fate, but will try to take the most advantageous position. In general, playing has become even more interesting!. One of the revolutionary games of the Total War series. Graphic quality and strategic depth are very good. The atmosphere is at the masterpiece level.. My favorite total war, great map, units and battles, give a great feel for Japan in the era. General and agent upgrades could be more meaningful though.. Fantastic visuals, music and unit design make for one of the better modern total war titles.. One of the best totalwar game I ever played. It was like medieval 3 but more paced and better in every side. With super graphics, sounds fun gameplay and well designed details. It were creative game to make in strategy category. Graphics:10/10 Sounds: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Fun: 10/10. The last truly great total war game. Not as moddable as the previous titles but the game offers a truly great experience in a fun time period. I didn't give it 10/10 only because there are some pathfinding issues on certain sieges but those are easily ignored.. grat fun game its really good and tthe battles are really fun to play and the clans are historically accurate and pretty good. One of the better Total War games. Realm divide keeps late game interesting,. super great and polished, the feeling of the game and also the naval is very important and strategic than any total war game since japan is like a large island. Even tho you may argue that battles may be easy against AI, Shogun 2 delivers excellent gameplay which is easy to learn but difficult to master. Graphics still hold to this day maybe aside from character models. Each clan seems unique, which offers great replayability. Overall excellent game in which I spent many hours and will probably spend a lot more.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. This was the second RTS game i played after AOE for a beginner this game was perfect aside from the occasionally mess up form the AI i think this game hits all the expectations they promise. Have lost a ridiculous amount of hours in this comfy strategy game over the years, decided to give it some love on the review website too. One of the better total War games ever released and there are some fantastic mods for it to make it even better. If anyone actually hasn't played it yet, go ahead and give it a shot. I highly doubt you'll regret it.. Disappointing. Medieval2 was OK, but since then Total War has become mediocre. The graphics may have improved, but all the flaws of the previous games (bad and cheating AI, useless diplomacy, unfair battle auto-resolve, confused units that ignore orders or get stuck, and other unreliable mechanics etc...) are still bad in Shogun2, and now it takes forever to load. Age old problems like gunpowder troops randomly failing to shoot at enemies that are charging towards them even after they have had ages to line up are still here. Naval combat is broken - try to board an enemy ship, and half of the time, soldiers will get permanently stuck due to an AI path finding failure. All the factions look and feel the same. There is also an over emphasis on expensive DLC that should have been in the base game. And where did hotseat multiplayer go?! They removed it because it allowed 2 people to have fun without paying for two copies. DarthMod helps, but not enough to make it enjoyable.. Unlike other Total War games this one is really well polished. Combat is fun and balanced, the campaign AI is reasonable (until...) but that's it with the positive aspects of the game. Once you hit a certain amount of territories the entire map declares war on you (no matter what good relationships you had with them before) and by that time you need to have a bunch of armies with which you mow down your enemies from one end of the map to the other, that's the only way you can win at this game. The lack of turns also forces you to go fast with your conquering, otherwise you run out of time. So it really dumbs down to: Build armies, beat the crap out of everyone else. There's no other approach to the game through which you can become Shogun which makes it a slightly dull experience.. Amazing detail in everything that happens on the battlefield. The game is paced a little too realistically though. Just when my lords are getting really great they get too old to fight and need to be replaced. In fact the real annoyance with this game is it follows the historical timeline too closely. The combat is solid and strategies usually pan out if you plan them well.. This game is great in many aspects: Great graphics, I love this japanes setting, the gameplay is complex and with a strategic and tactical part very interesting. There are a lot of mods that improves the game even more. Especially the KI is better and shows great job on the battle with good maneuvers and only small mistakes (more on the easy level, that you should leave very early ;). There are some problems ingame: Realm Divide: When you have a lot of power and your victory is not so far away every KI is starting to be hostile to you and almost all of KI Clan declare war on you (even your allies). In the reality you would have no chance, but this mechanic is only designed to have only an artificial challenge -.- , so the whole Japan will not attack you at once. Is is realistic, is it fun? No. Fortunately there are mods, that changes this. Another mere little problem is the KI on the campaign part, that shows illogical moves and the same in the diplomatic system. Why on earth do my most powerful clan pay tribute to very weak clans to get a trade treaty or military agreement? They should give me money for that. Other bad points are the very small manual, for this complex game you need a good manual and not this consolish paper. I dont like the binding to steam either. 9/10 from me. This is a game that seriously stands out and grips you as any good game should. With intelligent AI, massive amounts of content and detail you'll be a fan of the old ways in a seconds. From the beautiful introduction into the campaign, to the extremely competitive online play. I'll be totally honest, it's the most satisfying online game I've come across. There are great visuals that only become loosened if you have a rather powerful graphics card and this game was one of those where I had to upgrade, and yep it was worth it. Simply put Shogun 2 feels like a complex and exciting version of chess that is elegant and efficient. I would say it is the best strategy game of all time in my opinion. Excluding chess though. :P. Personally, I think this is the ultimate Total War game so far with a great balance in the turn-based campaign and real-time battles. It's also a great reminder of the first game in the series while the game itself is innovative and fresh.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Shogun Total War 2 is first casual game in the Total War series. It offers great experience with limited content. Casual and fast paced battles, simple rock-paper-scissors strategy and small map may be good for next generation players but at the same time these are the weak points for hardcore fans. Feudal japan concept is successfully created with beautiful graphics and sound effects. Game has less technical problems compared to first Rome and its followers.(except famous SEGA splash screen bug). Land battles are shorter than older games so can't be watched decently but they are very excited and brutal. Naval battles are playable and entertaining after Empire TW and Napoleon TW sea battle failures. There are too many good DLC's to increase unit and faction diversity by adding new clans and clan specific units. Like the other TW games, this game has a poor AI too. Thankfully, CA has an epic modding community and there are too many good mods to improve AI's ability. As a result Shogun Total War 2 is a good game with new casual gameplay elements for new players and price is reasonable for a AAA strategy game. But if you're hardcore TW fan and love samurai concept, I recommend to you Total War Shogun 2: Fall of Samurai.. Just excellent game, only bettered by FOTS DLC. Little replayability though : all factions feel the same, but ikko ikki. The AI is the best in a TW game, even the diplomacy is good (unique in a TW game which all have **** AI diplomates). Shogun 2. Not the best Total War but not the Worst. The game is a bit to fast paced turn wise and the troop options are non existent. Naval Combat is so so, i don't really enjoy it compared to Empire and you basically don't really need a navy. The Tech tree is back and I'm not really for or against. The upgrade options for generals are interesting but not really game changing. There are some improvements to diplomacy and the family tree is back, YAY! Load times are epic and graphics use massive resources as per normal for a total war game. The game play is important not the graphics. I want better controls, i don't care about individual blades of grass or reflection off water. Also ""I DON'T SPEAK JAPANESE MR GENERAL"" I have selected English for my language!!! Army formations, what where you thinking Creative Assembly. How am i supposed to tell the difference between a bear and a dragon formation. DUMB So a mediocre score for a mediocre game. Positive but not that positive.. This game takes me back to the good ol days. Such good memories from playing this game, I remember my first game I just had mongol against one unit to see the devastation. This game blew me off my feet, after seeing Napoleon total war I thought CA was taking steps back and was scared of what shogun would be, I was wrong big time. Personally, If I had to live with only 1 total war game it would be shogun 2/rome I total war ^^. This game was a blast I felt that it had a very solid campaign, great graphics, an overall decent AI compared to other total war games. I felt that it is also the only total war game with fluid animations that look real and the battles, are intense and brutal. Only thing I did not enjoy about this game was lack of units to choose from but this was kind of made up for with mods and DLC's but I would have liked for each clan to have there own unit types and such. By far the most game I have ever played used to spend hours each day with friends just multiplayer battle after multiplayer battle. And the multiplayer campaign with friends with junk food and watching tv was the best gaming moments I have had along with a few moments from skyrim with friends, and chivalry. Great game was so good made me hate rome total war 2. DLC's for this game were surprisingly good though I felt that fall of samurai was ehm op lets say compared to the normal game but, it did not matter since you could choose in multiplayer to fight with only shogun 2 players or along with fall of samurai. My overall scores: Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Community: 12/10 (best community so far, for me at least) Multiplayer: 100/10 (cannot be matched!) Units: 8/10 campaign: 11/10 animations: over 9000 final score: badass game, that is so fun to play and even more fun to play with friends.. THE ONLY PLAYABLE TOTAL WAR!! So the other Total War games don't have a listing of all the armies, navies, agents, etc that allow you to keep track of which ones you've already attended to even if you choose not to move. That alone makes this really the only playable game. The other ones, including rome 2, are way to cumbersome and it takes all day to make the turn. I'm addicted. I am the type to get bored **** super easily, and I play this game every second I can, which means playing 11pm to 4:30AM when I have work at 9AM. The graphics are still amazing in 2014, and the game runs on all maxed settings even when I had a 560ti. The diplomacy is shallow, and the economy of the game leaves me wanting more (I'm a nerd), but most people would not like having to go so in depth. The battle gameplay is fantastic and very in-depth. The generals and family tree is fun. Try it. It will provide the most bang for the buck for any game on the market. Only complaint is the UI gets buggy when you try to do 1000 things all at once clicking like a mad man on the campaign map. Can't fault them because the game works except when you are trying to move 3 armies literally at the same time.. Strategy games can, honestly, never get better than this. Excellent campaign map, clear, concise tutorial, awesome naval battles, and bunches of detail, from the katana of a samurai to the biggest mountain.. Definitely my least favorite Total War game. I'll start off my saying i'm not a fan of the theme. Since Japan is such a small place, all of the factions ended up being pretty much homogeneous. You'll have the same units for almost every faction. The only exception are the ""Warrior Monks"" that are in 2-3 factions. Also, the most interesting and different faction, the Ikko-Ikki are locked out. You have to buy a DLC to play a faction that is already in the game and fully functional. Seriously?! Also, due to the size of Japan, you'll have the same looking battlefields and a total of like 4 different siege maps. This obviously makes battles incredibly repetitive. The graphics are good and the polish is there, but the optimization is not. Load screens take an absurd amount of time and the turn timer takes way too long. This is partially due to the fact that there are like 50 different factions each with like 1 region on the map (Only 9 are playable with the base game). Want to play as 3 addition factions? You have to pay $5 each! A complete and utter scam. The game is still somewhat fun, it is a total war game after all. I enjoyed the campaign most of the time as long as I was autoresolving the terrible battles. Then I got to realm divide. It's a good idea that was implemented terribly. Basically once you conquer enough regions, every other faction in the game will declare war on you even if you've been allies the entire time. Obviously, for someone who is unprepared for such an occurrence, they are totally screwed. In conclusion, repetitive clans and battles, as well as greedy DLC practices have lead Shogun 2 astray to the point where it really isn't worth picking up unless you're a big fan of the series.. The greatest RTS game I have played, where other RTS's feel chaotic and are filled with infinitely spawning units this game feels completely controlled and a blast to play, as well as watch, as all characters on screen are individually modeled, and at times there can be over 10,000 characters on screen at the same time and I rarely get any lag.. Shogun 2 is clearly the best game of the total war franchise. Of course there is room for improvement but judging from rome 2 this ""improvement"" won't come from CA in the near future.. Rich with entertaining features, beautifully designed, and an overall excellent experience. Plays just as a Total War game should, even above the elevated standards of the franchise. Replaying this game is the perfect way to remind yourself how great TW can be in the aftermath of the Rome II debacle.. This is a fairly difficult game to review. The vanilla version of the game falls short for silly reasons while the modded version (Darth Mod is a true hero of our times) is awesome - easily one of the best strategy games made recently. So, in order to give the game a thorough review I'm going to look at what they did well, what they did (horribly) wrong and how the mod fixes it. What they did well: The AI is vastly improved especially on a strategy level. The AI now forms lasting alliances and looks to expand in a sensible way. It also builds armies quite well and tries to retain a useful balance of its forces (unlike previous TW-games where you could easily meet a full stack of archers because the AI thought it was a great unit and hey... you can't get enough **** thing, right?). The economic system is much harder now and you can support fewer full stack armies which is great as it forces you to think more on how best to deploy your resources. It also means that you can't abuse the blitz-krieg concept which just won the game in previous TW games. You don't have enough armies to simply overwhelm any enemy in a year anymore and once you do, he has enough to defend against it. You have to build good armies, keep them alive and choose your battles carefully. Winning large battles quite literally determines the fate of empires. What they did wrong: Unfortunately, none of the good things mentioned above matter because of what they did wrong. On hard level and above, the computer cheats violently. It respawns full stack armies and earns bundles of money from nothing. Of course, that makes the game fairly difficult (and annoying) but more importantly, it removes all of those strategic elements the game got right. Winning on the filed means nothing now, no strategic value because he just spawns a new army. Only taking cities matters now. Blockading ports or otherwise hurting the AI through economy means nothing, he gets money for free. Diplomacy is useless because everyone automatically hates you now and they all have endless armies. Basically, this ruins the game. In the pure vanilla version this is no more than a 4/10 game. GO MOD! But luckily, the modding community comes to our aid. Darth Mod fixes all of those annoying points and even improves on the good ones (it's also easy to install). The AI is better on the field (you can actually lose now if you do something silly) and the world seems coherent and punishing. If you choose the wrong allies, you'll be in trouble, if you leave yourself exposed against a non-friendly neighbor, you'll be attacked, but at the same time you need to check the most rapidly expanding AIs or you'll find yourself in the world of Rob Stark: defeated without ever losing a battle. To win effectively on Hard level you have to use all aspects of the game; economy, diplomacy and tactics. Then it suddenly becomes a 10/10 game. However, since I can't give the game a top grade for work they didn't do themselves, I'll leave the rating on 7.. I don't know if I like the game or not. It is good and complex but at the same time frustrating. It's a Civ combined with an RTS and I find it quite hard. You can't see the unit's type on the battlefield so you have to select a unit to see what it is. Archers? Pikemen? Not so obvious when you look at them from the top. So it can be really easy to loose battle when you don't really know what you're playing with. Also the map units - spies, monks, etc seem to be invincible and keep sabotaging my city while I try to send yet another ninja squad to assassinate them. Unsuccessfully most of the time. And there is the Japanese theme which I'm totally no familiar with. The names of the units and buildings tell me nothing. It's totally not appealing to me. The AI can also be a pain. My whole army gets slaughtered by archers because katana warriors can't get through the gates as they're fighting a few defending soldiers. Ninjas get killed really quickly, everybody else gets killed by the archers and watchtowers and charging unit decided to go all the way around exposing itself to arrows. It's just frustrating to play.. This is the best strategy game I've ever played. The experience was as exciting as playing Rome when it came out about ten years ago but with obvious improvements in graphics. I was pretty disappointed with Empire when it came out (particularly the overall strategy of the game which was far less complex than previous Total War games) but liked certain aspects of the game such as long range trade routes, improved diplomacy and tech trees. Shogun however manages to take on all the improvements of Empire while staying true to the strategic greatness of Rome (and Medieval 2). I was addicted to this game for about 6 months in 2013 and started getting really excited for Rome 2 thinking that it would be even better but having seen the overwhelming negative reviews for it I haven't even bought it yet. Creative Assembly needs to bring out a new game based on the foundation set by Shogun 2!. Awesome, i loved this game, is my favorite video game of all that i have played all my life :), the map, the story, the graphics, well, all is awesome compared to another strategy games, congratulations creative assembly :D. It took me long time to get into Shogun 2 but with some help from Radious Mod i have to say that i'm really enjoying Shogun 2 now. The artstyle and graphics are amazing in the vanilla shogun and the music really adds to the atmosphere especially on the campaign map, which looks and feels beautiful. The AI is a lot better in Shogun 2 and i found myself really struggling at times against large stacks of enemies landing behind my lines, especially after Real divide. The battle AI still has its flaws for instance generals still rush into danger and the tactics it employs can be pretty predictable, however on the whole its alot better. However vanilla Shogun 2 has to little unit variety for my liking hence why i was forced to use Radious Mod and while i like the RPG elements on agents and generals CA seem to have removed a lot of the natural growth generals had in earlier titles. Naval battles are also quite hit and miss but that might just be because i'm a terrible admiral. Taking all into consideration Shogun 2 is a great game, it doesn't reach the heights of M2:TW or Rome:TW in my opinion but its alot better than Empire or Rome 2.. I played TW titles since the original Shogun Total War 1 published in 2000. While it has been something very new and exciting back then, today I feel like every new title is barely adding fun to the game: its just updated graphics, more menues, more choices. But overloading the game doesn't make it better. Game mechanics can be OK like here with Shogun-2 or can be really bad like with Empire TW. Opponent AI feels like the same as 13 years ago and thats really poor. Still, you won't notice instantly and this game could be good for some 10-20 hours of Japan conquest. I give it 7 out of 10, because it is still a ""good"" game, but by far not as good as it could be.. Honestly after the rome 2 disaster i was hesitant on trying the newer total war games.. Boy was i wrong this game gets naval and land combat right its honestly a blast to see two groups of samurai split off for 1v1 combat in a skirmish. Not the big clump of men rome 2 has... The campaign map can be a pain to navigate with frequent slow downs on older PC's. Also this is the first total war game i played were in multiplayer more Calvary doesn't equal a win.. Another great addition to the total war series. These games are consistently getting better with each release. The new skills for generals, and the multi-stage siege battles keep me on the edge of my seat.. this game is truly the pinnacle of Total war, and all strategy games. Awesome graphics, create campaign map, this is a release to be proud off. Currently clocked 360 hours and even the release of Rome 2 isn't slowing me down.. This is a very good game, and I love it. However it does game design a disservice to pretend that this is a 10/10 game. It isn't. Much as it pains me to say, this game has a number of serious design flaws that leave it a long way from perfection. First and worst is the design of the single player campaign. It seems the crew in CA are unable to grasp the key point that a factional civil war requires a POLITICAL game. Personalities, loyalties, betrayals, economic considerations, deals and diplomacy SHOULD be at the heart of the experience. But NONE of that is there. CA has a very simple political model based on linear expansion of an empire. There is nothing that approaches wheeling or dealing or THINKING requires in the campaign EVER. Nor can we take any deal or alliance seriously, since the AI always breaks its deals and alliances on a whim. Over-all this is the tragedy of the creative Assembly. They have failed to grasp what was good about Rome (1). And they have failed to develop any kind of political-diplomatic engine or gameplay. A big fail. Beyond that all the actual war mechanics: The UI, the graphic art. unit balancing, music, voice work, in-game movies are all BRILLIANT! magnificent! Multiplayer is fantastic with the avatar system. All the nuts and bolts of a brilliant franchise are polished and chromed and gleaming. There is definitely too much time lost in loading screens. Other than that, its a fantastically built game. But at its heart, a true heart is missing. We can appreciate that in Rome 2, there is the beginning of CA trying to expand the victory conditions: they have the idea of an 'economic' or 'cultural' victory. But nowhere near enough. They probably need to hire a team to rebuild the core of gameplay, but a lot of energy and resources into getting the HEART of the game right. When they append their own great visual assets to an enhanced, politically-focused engine they will finally pull their franchise out of the swamp of perennial 'could have been great' titles and achieve an honestly great game. Nothing else would be a just reward for all the great things CA has given gaming over the years than to see them reach Nirvana, turn the corner, and hit a home run. Shogun 2 was a great effort, but caught in the outfield. orctowngrot. I love this game. It has good new features, a good skill tree, good polish, good balancing, specially with mods, but it has its own problems too though. In vanilla game, AI spawns stacks of archers with almost no melee, battles are way too fast, and AI spawns armies out of nothing, but mods fix almost everything. Would play this over Rome 2.. I love to play it. You have many different units and clans you can play. Also you must organize your towns (when you play campaign) very good otherwise you get rebellions etc",Creative Assembly has not made a good game since and this was released 13 years ago . it was innovative by being able to create your own general and build your army . the visuals were stunning for an RTS game in 2011 and the gameplay was excellent .
363.Empire: Total War,"Only good game but the bugs is f*****g s!!!. But the graphics and mechanics is so very good.. Empire: Total War is probably the biggest innovation in the series and I think it deserves credit for its attempt to do something entirely new by combining Total Warâs macro RTS system with Pre-Industrial modern warfare. This match works remarkably well, since the tactics of the period apply naturally to Total Warâs established system of battle lines and tight formations. The exception being the native tribes in the colonies, where it seems rather silly to see the symmetry of European armies. During the battle of QuÃ©bec for instance the native troops on the French side refused to fight in lines and instead fired from cover and ducked down while reloading. Though this is just a small nitpick and does not distract from the gameâs great portrayal of 18th century combat, especially in terms of the positioning of artillery pieces, that historically was and in the game is decisive in most battles and thus makes the topography of the map a central strategic element. This is also why the advent of mortars in the mid-game is such a game changer, because obstacles on the map can largely be ignored which changes battle tactics substantially. But this also highlights the shortcomings of the AI, one of the games biggest problems. The enemy simply cannot deal with the artillery, especially mortar fire and very often the player can shell the enemyâs army to bits. In the late game when fortifications and mortars are more common this gets even worse because the AI fails to bring their troops in position and out of reach of artillery. Instead units calmly let the shells rain upon them. The AI was never a strong suit of the Total War games, but Empire struggles even more with this, because of a combat that is focused on ranged attacks. On a similar note the naval battles are rather difficult to manage, with the best tactic being, forming a line and manoeuvring the fleet alongside the enemy. But even then depending on the AI it is still possible that the battle ends up being one big mess of clunky ships with little to no space to manoeuvre. The thing is I cannot criticise the game for such a portrayal, since the transition from ships in lines to total chaos is actually historically accurate (e.g. The Battle of Trafalgar). But what I do consider disappointing is the fact that the navy is essentially useless in this game, especially on higher difficulties. The seven-years war, the game appears to be based on, was the first world-wide war in history with an American, European and Indian war theatre. I appreciate the fact that they depicted the geopolitical situation of that war on the campaign map, but the navy played such an essential role in this war, in terms of amphibious landings (e.g. Battle of QuÃ©bec), shelling of fortifications (e.g. The Siege of Pondicherry) and control and protection of supply routes, which is why I would have expected a more meaningful integration of the fleet into the game. Instead the player is motivated to have as small a fleet as possible to save money for the way more effective army. For amphibious landings of armies one only requires a âfleetâ consisting of one ship and directly attacking harbour cities is impossible. This period is called the age of sail for a reason, but in this game there is sadly no wind in it. Another instance where the game creates high dissonance to its setting is the diplomatic system and this has something to do with the way the entire Total war series works. Like the name suggests the game revolves around a constant war that requires the player to conquer cities and expand, which results in the other factions hating the player and declaring war on them. This cycle is what gives the player something interesting to do at all times. The problem with this system is, that there are some settings where this cycle of conquest is completely out of place. A Roman Republic that is forced to expand constantly makes sense, but early modern European politics revolved around the idea of a balance of power. This meant that the great powers of Europe always sought to keep each other in check so that no one would become too powerful. The idea of Britain conquering mainland France would have seemed ludicrous to the people of the 18th century, but this is exactly what you would have to do in order to win a war against them in the game.. I played the American campaign and ended up fed up that everyone is attacking at the same time over and over again. I played for 22 hours or so doing other battles from time to time but now I played with the Plains Nations and at first was good but now I just need an specific region to end the campaign. Well, Great Britain is not gonna sell it or trade it, it doesn't matter what you offer it. Then you have Spain and the USA attacking all the time and especially the USA is such a pain, their armies just appear from nowhere again and again. I gave up when I reach a peace with the USA and it didn't last a single turn. Just crazy! I played for 32 hours. Am I ever going to play it again? maybe but I won't try to finish any campaign. It's just too frustrating and unfair. I read that with mods gets better but as I'm new with the computer games I don't know how to do it and I'm not really interested in learning it.. Just like the other total war games that aren't rome total war i never got too much into it, the best aspect of the game is probably the naval battles which were pretty amazing.. Worst Total War game I ever played. Empire Total War is not good compared to other Total War games bad battles, weak AI and... make it bad game.. Easily my favorite total war game, itâs set during one of the most fascinating points in human history and the mechanics feel far more intuitive than shogun 2 or Rome 2.. empire tw have great potensial over legedanry mediveal 2 but miss the potenisal greatly. game focuses sea battle and gun play more than nations maps and close combat. ottomans here compared mw2 feels west nastinon. some untis like normal janssary use sword but every nation mostly gun focused untis more. maps also feels much smaller. less cityies. game simply go too forward on time be good history total war game.. It's weird to fight with only ranged units and horses, but it worked. Interesting and campaign, A bit more complicated than in other installments of the series (advantage). Good title.. I generally liked Total war games. And this was one of them. Game mechanics offer you a realistic combat experience. I especially liked that it deals with the new age and colonialism, and this is the most beautiful feature that distinguishes it from other total war games . But the lack of variety for the game and the lack of development makes it extremely boring during the overall gameplay that the AI ââbehaves like an idiot even at the highest ""difficulty"". Although I am not very liked the naval warfare system of the game, I can see it as normal since naval warfare is tried for the first time. I was hopeful about many things from Empire Dan, but it fell far short of my expectations. The sound of the music could have been a little louder because the music in general is underpowered by the sound effects. The team or man who made the music should have noticed this. Of course, that's not a huge minus. Apart from these, one of the minuses of the game is that you cannot play with small states and Indian tribes. Playing only with big states can get boring after a while. Other than that, it's a average game. This is the highest rating I can give this game. 6. This game's ambition is still inspiring, but it failed to meet that ambition. The trading is the best in the series and the battles become huge, but that's all it has going for it. It's bugs are so numerous I could not even begin to describe all the ones I encountered in 20 hours. I still really like this game, but it could be much better.. In New York (ayy, ah-ha) (uh, yeah) Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made of There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay). Excellent game! So many possibilities to evolve your empire hehe I don't like only naval fights - it's so chaotic and ai has advantages against the user. You have to control every step of every ship from 20 in your army on the battleground because without this control your fleet is too silly. If you click only attack then with 99% chance your ship will ruin everything. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 5.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 80 IIIIIIIIII====================. Boring, bad mechanics and ui. Did i mention it is boring? Animations are bad too.. Itâs a decent total war game, though I feel like there is a gap between M2TW and ETW not just in terms of quality, but also in terms of historical continuity, there is no total war game that covers the period of late renaissance and baroque period (30 years war would be particularly interesting topic to cover); nevertheless I think that it deserves higher rating than 7 points. This game is initially an ambitious and innovative game ... On arrival, however, it is a nameless cloth. Bugged as it is not allowed, we play more to suffer and rage than to have fun. The premise is good but nothing is right .. Messed up diplomacy, i messed up, messed up morale, town and strong messed up balancing between messed up faction and little that catches up with the title.. For me it was one of the worst in total war series. Campaign idea of all of the world were good but not well designed. Also diplomacy were unstable and unrealistic. Game was not well paced, it was too slow. Graphics:7/10 Sounds: 7/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Fun: 7/10. A buggy mess ****. The AI is brain-dead at best and the campaign often freezes in the middle of a session. I deeply regret purchasing this title.. Can't understand why this game is so hyped. Provinces in Europe are way too big, which makes conquering the whole continent too easy. And since the AI almost always refuses peace deals you usually have no choice but to fully conquer them, making your country too powerful too fast.. It's in not bad just not as good as Total War: Rome. I really didn't enjoy naval battles.. Game cool! I've only played in Rome: Total War before. Maybe because of this and liked that he played only two, but the battles at sea I was pleasantly surprised! I do not regret that bought. The game is very interesting.. This game has been out for ten years and Creative Assembly still hasn't fixed the bug that stops you from repairing forts. Pathetic.. In my opinion, this game is a masterpiece. I will explain why in a few categories: Price: Great value for what you get in this game. Difficulty: Very easy to learn, and great for newcomers to the total war series. Gameplay duration: There is no end. (coming from someone with 227 hours) Graphics: For the time, pretty good. Not many bugs, and AI rarely acts idiotic Gameplay: I'm going to take a while on this section. You have many options for the gameplay. First, you have the battles. You can either do land, sea, or siege battles. The are many maps, and really fun to command thousands of troops. You can even pop into some real-life scenarios. Including the Battle of Brandywine Creek in the US revolution. Then, you have the campaigns. There is one set campaign, Road to Independence. Which you start in Jamestown, Virginia and go through to Seven Years War and the revolutionary war, including battles against the Powhattans in Jamestown and the Battle Of Bunker Hill. Then. You have the Grand Campaign. You can either play as Great Britain, Spain, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, France, Sweden, Martha Confederacy, Prussia, United Provinces, Poland-Lithuania, and Austria. You take control of that nation and its armies and conquer the world. The AI is non-historic, so it can make for fun and funny gameplay. (In one instance, Austria captured Mexico and Nicaragua xD). One more gameplay option to go: Multiplayer. I haven't played multiplayer though, so i can't judge it :p. Replay-ability: As you can tell from my 227 hours, this game is very replayable. DLC: Haven't bought; Can't judge In conclusion: 9.5/10. Very excellent game. I'd recommend it to people of ages 10+. With amazing gameplay, fair graphics, much content, and overall very worth it, I recommend it to you who is reading right now. Thanks for reading my review!. With over 100 logged hours I think I am in a position to judge this game. Also, I should note that I am including the Warpath DLC in my opinion. I will also say that I do have a bit of bias in my review since I have a deep love for this time in history and style of combat. But I also know that this is far from a perfect game. I first started with the Road To Independence campaign. It definitely helps you learn how to control and maneuver a little bit but overall I would say the story is okay at best and really does not take that long to finish. Also, it is the only way you really get to play as America so it kind of does fulfill that itch but I still don't know why you can't play with them in the main campaign mode. The main campaign mode has a decent amount of countries to chose from along with varying victory conditions based on the size and location of your country. The map is very large covering all of Europe, North Africa, The Middle East, India, North America and the upper half of South America. There are also trading ports in places like Madagascar but that is all you can do there set up a trade route. The way you move around the map has largely gone unchanged from prior TW games and that is just fine with me. Diplomacy saw a change from the family tree system to a more timely government system that allows you to promote Generals instead of raising them which makes sense. You can fire people in places of government but I never found myself looking too much into this aspect of the game as it is self-propelling and does not have much impact on your progress. The technology bracket accelerated my building collages and universities is a much-welcomed improvement to the series as you unlock new abilities through study as well as being able to trade and steal technological discoveries as well. Diplomacy as with many games of the turn based genre could be better but is functional. Still feels like the whole if they like you they will work with you and if they don't they won't style of a system we usually get but at least you can often still trade with unfriendly nations if you make it worth their while. Alliances also do make some sort of sense and do have so impact on your decisions especially on harder levels. I am pleased to say that the AI is no pushover if you crank up the level but are still very much beatable if you have experience with the game. Let us talk about combat. Ground combat is very satisfying. Units are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but are competent overall. Creative Assembly did a great job in getting the style of combat of that time down to where it feels like you are commanding troops of that time in a sensical manner. Newly added naval combat is total crap in my opinion and really needed to be worked on more before they added it to the game. I would have been happy with simulation just like in Rome TW and that is what I found myself doing anyway after several frustrating naval encounters where I had the clear upper hand. I thought maybe it was just me but apparently many others share my frustration. Lastly, I would like to mention the Warpath DLC where you can play as Native American factions. Basically what was done was the devs took the victory conditions from the European countries in the main game, slapped them on the native factions and called it a day. I played through the short campaign with one of the native factions and I lost not because I was playing on a hard difficulty or I was getting my ass kicked in combat, but because I could not get to my enemy fast enough with a reasonable amount of forces to take over a city. They did not take into account that the native cities are very spaced out and they do not have roads for a fairly long time due to the small size of your beginning cities. So travel is a lot slower without connecting roads and trough rough terrain which is what you are working through with most native factions. Plus the combat with natives is not nearly as fun given the design of the game. Combat was mostly designed around musket troops which the natives naturally have very few of. You really need the numbers advantage to have any chance of winning which is a chore with slow travel. For some reason, I wanted to give this game an 8/10 and that is only because as I said I am biased towards this time period. The game has flaws for sure but has kept me playing on and off for years. However my final verdict is a 7/10 GOOD. This is mostly due to the lackluster DLC and naval combat.. This game is broken. Not only because the bugs, but also user interface, game dynamics, artificial intelligence... nothing works properly. Total war games have become one of the worst strategy series for the PC. It is unbelievable that after so many years and so many games, total war games are still without a proper AI. It is like a platform game without a working collision detection. Programmers should be ashamed of this game. It is needed just 5 minutes of play to start finding bugs. This means that either Creative Assembly donÂ´t have a QA department or they are aware of the bugs but they donÂ´t give a shxx. Regarding the AI, they rely just on giving cheats to the computer. The computer wil know the position of all your armies, all your fleets, it will know what you can see and what you canÂ´t, in battles it will know exactly the range and the arc of fire of your troops to put their troops in the safe edge, it will know things like when you order to your artillery to fire on the enemy general, and it will move the general away in the precise moment you make click on it. Diplomacy is not working because of the nonexistent AI. The rest of the nations are not trying to win, they are programmed to just go against you. So diplomacy is totally broken. There game does not have difficulty levels. It just have levels of cheat. The AI plays equally bad in very hard as easy. Why creative assembly do not program a proper AI for their games? Because they know that they will sell total war games just improving the graphics.. The best Total war, the pinnacle of the series. One of the rare occasions where official reviewers scored it right. Don't get me wrong, the launch was attrocious, i remember it clearly, i had pre-ordered it. And CA should pay for this blatant disregard for the customer. But as a game, this was a masterpiece. And today, after the patches it received, it is perfectly playable and fun. Many people don't seem to appreciate this game, because they were used to the more arcade-y battles of previous installments. You know, just click on units and charge!. Well, Empire Total War does a really good job with its battle system, portraing the battles of its era. You need proper tactics, and positioning is key. Morale is everything. The battles are more chess-like, like in real life Napoleonic-era battles. You need to take care of not breaking your battlelines, while breaking the opponents, causing morale shocks, and eventually routing him. This takes knowledge of how the units work, and how to position your units properly. I write these things because many people think this game had bad battles, because they tried to play those battles like Medieval II and Rome. I did at first too, i know. In the end, this is the best gunpowder era game we have. If you love maskets and cannons, and want a really great empire management game with cool tactical battles, this game is for you. This was much better than Rome and Medieval II, Napoleon and Shogun II began the downward spiral of casualisation. This spiral began because people complained about Empire. Careful what you wish for people, you didn't like the realism of Empire, Rome II is what you eventually got.. An amazing game, one of the best in the Total War series and my personal favorite. The game runs very smoothly and gives interesting gameplay, allowing players to use different playstyles with different nations. Each nation offers unique gameplay. Overall, I am impressed with this and give it 9/10 rating. The game could be a bit more historical, although I understand the game was not meant to be played in all ways historically.. I am writing this to alert people once again at how bad this game is. Never mind how bad it was at launch, I will tell you my experience as of the last CA patch, when they announced they would no longer be patching this game. I played the campaign long enough to play a single battle. I was defending a fort from an enemy assault. Mere seconds after the battle started the opposing AI ran his general out, sweeping across his front lines, and opened fire on my fort with his cannons....directly through his general's unit, thereby killing his own general within about 15 seconds from the battle start. Probably trying to cut around my fort at my reinforcements behind and to the left of the fort. That was the start, then about a minute later I had moved my two reinforcing units up to flank the attacking force, when the AI decided it would meet my reinforcements head on with a cavalry charge. I had elephant cavalry and some sort of hybrid ranged/melee unit, so I switched my ranged unit into melee mode, and counter charged, relying on the elephant cavalry to break the enemy charge and my other unit to overwhelm them. Then I switched back to manage the assault on my fort, which was going well for me, only to switch back to the conflict outside my fort to find that while my elephant cavalry had charged, my other unit had not. At first I thought I had misclicked, but come to find out, when I had put the unit in melee mode, it froze in place. I couldn't move it. I had to toggle it back in forth multiple times before it ""fixed itself"" and I could move it again, but only in ranged mode. As my general was part of the now gutted elephant cavalry, I was actually at risk of being routed. I held the fort, but the AI was reforming for another attack, and all I had to stop his cavalry outside the fort was a unit that I couldn't switch from ranged mode or it would stop moving. Meanwhile his cannon had done serious damage to my wall. Reviewing the damage I realized his cannon were no longer firing, why not? Well, that is because the AI decided to abandon his cannons, which still had plenty of ammo, and charge the fort with his cannoneers, while his other units stood and watched. The marched right up to the walls, where I had local number superiority, then broke and ran, as did the rest of the forces. Giving me the victory. Realizing battles where not a test of skill, but a test of whether the gameplay crippling bugs the player experiences are worse than the horrible, suicidal. AI, I stopped playing then and there and have not touched the game since. i honestly think anyone who rates this game a 10/10 is either being paid, is not a gamer at all, or is playing on such easy difficulties they don't really notice how terrible things are. keep in mind, my experience, was post the last CA update, after they had ""fixed"" the game. TLDR: As of final patch, game was still broken with massive bugs and a non functional AI. Not worth playing, not to mention paying for.. i am sorry about people's that have negatived review to this nice game . unfortunately some of player can't wait and think carefully . these games are not exited to them because not action .and so puzzle work to do . you have to command ,role ,economy terms ,also you have to change the history , this people's don't know how to play then comes and write about rts games . i have been playing rts games from 1995 until now and the Empire:total war is the best rts game on 2009 .. Giving it a 7, A decent installment of the Total War franchise that offers some fresh mechanics like gunpowder, the ability to traverse continents, strategic battles that aren't focused solely on the capital city(forts and such) and good naval battles. While the game isn't perfect, the new features offer a fresh experience that should be fun for awhile for most people.. One of the better entries into the Total War series, it has its highs and lows. Pros: The game finally opened the world map with the base game although some earlier adaptations had given peaks into the Americas and other areas. The expanded unit selection felt greatly improved over most games in the series who offered only a few unit types with little difference in play style. Cons: The AI will anger most people to no end, for something as simple as colonial era line infantry you'd think it'd be easy to nail down decent mechanics, most units will get the job done for combat but its very immersion breaking. Campaigns in this game are rather bland after a certain point and you quickly get locked into a system of being drawn into pseudo world wars, where in trade is useless and you're only option for profitability is to conquer your neighboring territories leading to a larger world war. All in all its a decent game that fell short of what it could've delivered.. Total war has been around for quite some time, and I have bought and played all of them since the initial Shogun. The expanded campaign map is welcome and the trading ports, Naval warfare likewise. Lots of pluses that is, but there are drawbacks as well. To me, those drawbacks are ""blocker bugs"". Blocker bugs would be something that would prevent the game from being released. Previous Total war games has had a few, but I am amazed that a franchise that's been around for so long still has issues like this. After half an hour of navigating three ships against nine enemy ships, having one left and aaaaalmost winning the battle and the game freezes... The graphics are also quite bad. Room for improvement. Yay!. This is easily the worst entrance into the series (other than Rome II). The concept for this game was so good and it had so much potential but it all got wasted for some reason. It could have been that they were rushed for release or that they were using a new engine, but whatever the reason, it still doesnt excuse this game for its quality. That being said it is still a good game. There are a lot of very memorable things about this game like some of the battle. I remember in my first playthrough I played as the United Provinces, it was late game and I was invading Russia. I was on their final settlement, which was Moscow and they had built a star fort for the city. It was a massive battle, my army was made of 3 max chevroned elite unit stacks and their army was made up of 7 garbage militia army that were untrained. I lost all but 4 units but I won and with it I wiped out Russia!. Perfect game. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I'll review Empire:Total War v1.5 plus all DLCs. Like a lot of people here I discovered the Total War series with Rome:TW, back in 2005. After ten years of playing every title Creative Assembly has released, I think Empire:TW has all the necessary elements to claim the throne of the Total War saga. Its attention to detail and richness of features is remarkable. Powerful ships of the line, pirates, best sea battles ever, commerce all around the globe, profitable trade lanes, plenty of colonies, very useful technology research options, musketeers of all kinds and the first riflemen, devastating artillery, classical music, very interesting historical announcements, silly mustaches, wigs and uniforms, great graphics, details and effects, gunpowder and smoke everywhere, etc. If you have a craving for these things, Empire:TW is just the thing you are looking for. This game separates itself from the rest of TW titles (except for Shogun II and perhaps Rome II in certain aspects) with respect to naval commerce and battles, regions on the map, types of agents, unit replenishment, building options and tech tree If you are used to the endless building options from Rome:TW or Medieval II:TW, you'll find Empire:TW a tad simplistic in this regard, but the amount of amazing stuff this game has to offer compensates for it. Don't get me wrong, you can still build a fair number of different buildings in both cities and towns, but the assortment has been reduced in comparison (cosmetic buildings have been eliminated, which is a good thing, if you ask me). Empire:TW is all about smart diplomacy, a strong navy, colonization, trade, trade and yet more trade. Trade lanes can be raided by fleets, damaging the economy and, for the first time in TW, the blockade of a major commercial port (connecting you to your colonies and major trade partners) can lead to disaster. In Rome/Medieval II you could conquer most of the campaign map without a decent navy, that's not the case in Empire:TW... without a strong navy you can't secure trade lanes, can't defend your ports, can't transport invasion forces safely, etc. Besides, you'll be missing one of the best things in the game: naval battles between frigates, galleons, brigs, sloops, etc. In Rome II:TW I usually autoresolve naval battles because they are pretty dumb and broken, but in Empire:TW I just can't stop commanding my fleets personally, positioning my ships for a deadly broadside, taking the wind into account, surrounding the enemy fleet, boarding enemy ships and capturing them when they are worth it, fighting pirates in the Caribbean, researching technologies to improve my fleet, it's exhilarating!!! Graphics and effects are pretty good too, even for 2015. I can't get enough naval battles in Empire:TW, I'm totally addicted... Every time my first /second rate ships of the line fire their three decks of heavy cannons at the enemy, I feel a unique excitement. The sound of the cannons, the smoke from the gunpowder, the wooden hulls being splintered, the sails being ripped, the masts being **** I said, graphics and effects are great, naval battles are thrilling and feel quite realistic, also, strategy is essential, which finishes the package. What about the regular land battles? Well, effects and graphics are great too, the unit firing dynamics is amazing too, specially after researching milestone technologies like ""fire in ranks"", ""platoon fire"" and others. It's awesome to see how the first rank of soldiers crouches after firing, so the second rank can fire right after, and then the third one. The musket sounds, the gunpowder smoke, units being decimated by enemy fire, etc., it's just awesome. Not to mention the artillery, mortars and howitzers are specially deadly when loaded with special kinds of ammo, which needs to be researched too. Strategy is vital here too, which also finishes the package nicely. Research is conducted in special buildings (schools, colleges, universities) and can be accelerated using gentlemen (agents than can duel other agents, steal technologies or research them), technologies can be exchanged with other nations through diplomacy, which is great. Diplomacy options are more complete than in previous TW titles. Several buildings can be constructed in specific landmarks outside major cities. Ministers can be sacked if they are incompetent. Units can be replenished almost everywhere and can also be separated from their parent army. To summarize, Empire:TW is a delight to play, specially if you have a craving for this historical period. As always, TW titles are vastly improved using mods, in this case I recommend DarthMod. It introduces tons of improvements, several new units, increased income from settlements and trade, graphica",the bugs are f*****g s!!! but the graphics and mechanics is so very good . Empire: Total War is probably the biggest innovation in the series . it combines Total Warâs macro RTS system with Pre-industrial modern warfare .
364.Astro Bot Rescue Mission,"The best VR game for PSVR1. Really too bad the new AstroBot is not having any VR levels.. After played the PS5âs Astro game Ihad to give it a chance to Rescue Mission,Iâm not surprise any more Astro Bots games are high quality games, very fun games too.. If you donât have PSVR then you are SERIOUSLY missing out! Thankfully Astro Bot is getting his first full length game soon so everyone with a PS5 can experience how amazingly fun it is to play as this little robot!. Probably the best VR game I ever have and will have played.....................Cute bots too.. it baffles me people havent played this game, in 2024 still by far the best platformer, please sony can they remaster it for vr2. Story: Not much to say about the story of the game. As expected for a platformer, the story was very minimalistic and also not thrilling or interesting at any moment. Gameplay: This is where Astro Bot Rescue Mission plays his trump cards. The gameplay is very varied from the beginning and throughout the game, as the player never has the feeling that a level or design idea of a level repeats. Therefore each level and world (each world consists of five levels) feels unique and interesting. Also the development team managed to greatly implement the VR, as the player controls the Astro-Bot as a third person ""robot"", who also controls the Bot ingame. Graphics: Graphics and visuals are perfect for this game. The different levels feel unique and detailled.. Had an awesome time with this game. This game also has 0 motion sickness for me personally. I loved it!. Awesome platformer for PSVR maybe The best Platformer on VR. Got this game free with my PSVR Mega Bundle and i played it right away. It was my first PSVR game and it was AMAZING. I am not the biggest fan of platformers but I really enjoyed Astro Bot.. I rarely put a 10, especially to a VR game. But despite the average sharpness on the PSVR1, this game shows that VR can be terrific even for plateforms, and that gameplay & level design quality is much more important than the resolution of the display or the quality of the lenses on the VR headset. Terrific game, easily one of the best VR game ever.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done!. A simply amazing experience in every way. Aa good as any Mario game. I pray they make a PSVR 2 sequel.. The best 3D platformer I've played. VR really does add to the experience and make the game the classic it should be remembered as. Worth the price of PSVR alone.. This game is so fun to play. The soundtrack is really good. The cute robots make me really happy and finding all the things in the world of Astro Bot is really fun. It is easy though, so if you want a challenge this game won't offer one that much. It can be hard for me sometimes though. This game is so good and I recommend it to everyone who can play it. All the ways you are affected by the world like water on your face and your screen appearing to be cracked when you, the player, get hit by something is really cool. After four levels of every world there is a boss. I always look forward to the bosses while finding all the things in the world. I did get stuck in a wall once, but it's okay.. Took a rental of sony's vr headset specifically to play this game and I got to say that they did knock it out of the park here! If anything, I would say that this game is underrated, I think if it were another Mario game it would get 96-97 metacritic score. Anyway, this is a near perfect 3d platformer with a fantastic, creative, beautiful and ingenious level design, silky smooth controls, rock steady framerate and of course, jaw dropping vr effect. It has that inspired direction feel to it that just keeps you involved until you beat it at 100%, with the game constantly introducing some new gameplay ideas. Overall, as a fan of the genre, I would say that this is one of the very best examples, which reminded me playing Super Mario Galaxy and Rayman Legends games. If I would to point out some flaws I would say that the game is a bit on an easier side (except bonus challenge levels of course), and combat and enemy types could definitely use more variety. And it can be a bit too cutesy and kiddy sometimes for my taste. Nevertheless, this is tour de force of game design and I think every platformer fan should absolutely play this game, maybe take vr rental if needed as I did if you don't have a headset. Not to mention that this is probably the most polished and most compelling VR game out there (possibly with the exception of half life alyx). I just wish sony would release more platform games instead of their current open world schlock output, but oh well.... Astro Bot Rescue Mission has a beutiful world with detaled characters and fun gameplay must have for psvr. When I heard that this should be the best VR Game out there I was pretty sceptic. I am not so much into Jump and run and I dont play games that are aimed for a very young audience. But little did I know that Astrobot was so great and superior to all the things I have seen so far that it was super addictive right from the start. It is surprising how important it is to see it with your own eyes especially when it comes to VR, a 2D Demo on the TV wont give you the slightest idea on how this plays in real life.. Astro Bots know how to operate controllers. When I play, I am first surprised by the cute artwork and then I am surprised by the level design using the controller.. Love it very well taught out. Graphic utilize fill resolution which looks sharp. All the controller and vr hardware is used to the fullest!. Deleted. Was on the wrong page when I wrote the review. My apologies. Enjoy your gaming.. Astro Bot Rescue Mission is an amalgamation of recent Nintendo platform games, such as Super Mario 3D World, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, and Splatoon. Problem is, those games weren't great, they were just average. This rendition is greatly improved by a clever second-person view that I would love to see more of in video games. Problem is, while taking ideas away from Splatoon, they could have taken the lives system (maximum of 3, restores every checkpoint). Problem is, this game is just good. It's not GREAT. It's not enough to justify the prices of PSVR on top of what a PS4 or PS5 costs. And make sure it's at least a PS4 Pro, because this is a very advanced game that might crash on something earlier. Overall, this will be a fun game when many more people experience it for the first time in 2025 when it runs smoothly enough and prices of the hardware are low enough.. A well crafted VR game that leaves nothing at the door. It is a fun platformer that has been brought into VR. The best way to describe this game is if Mario got a VR game made by Sony. Definitely something to play if you are new to VR. Whilst the controller can be unresponsive at times the rest of the game works extremely well in a fun solo adventure.. Charming is the word that best describes astro bot. When I saw the design for the first time it looked extremely generic but they managed to convey a lovability personality through this design. The game is a linear 3d platformer in vr and it nails what all 3d platformers must nail control. Astrobot handles like a dream as he jumps hovers and punches enemies. At times your controller is given abilities like spraying water and ninja stars, which reminds me a bit of nintendo land and other early wiiu games. These give the game the variation it needs to keep from going stale. The levels are fun and varied with level themes changing level making no level look or feel the samw as the last. The soundtrack while not having many tracks is realy enjoyable listen to adn you don't get sick of any of the tracks even if you hear them every couple levels. The game also has fun bosses that while being quite easy are a lot of fun to take down. For the completionists there are 8 bots and a chameleon to find in each level. The chameleons unlock challenge levels that will moderately test you but platformer veterans will have no issue. The use of VR in a 3D platformer is inspired and the developers ring most of the potential out of the concept with having you look around corners and from a birds eye view. It's the game I have played VR and is a must play for PSVR owners.. A testament to capability of PSVR and the game designers. This is not just an amazing, immersive and fun VR game - itâs simply a brilliant PS4 game regardless.. Was honestly expecting a mario galaxy knockoff or something going in initally, but after finishing it, I can fully say this game is amazing and takes advantage of the psvr hardware so well. So many specific vr features mixed with smooth gameplay, a banger ost and I can always have a good time playing this game. Amazing 3D platformer not just for PSVR but as a whole. Great controls, level design, cute graphics, fun boss fights, and also a magnificent VR integration. It hits all marks.. If u love games like mario but in vr, this is a similar stunningly good game on psvr, absolute must play!. Perfect plate-forme game, beautiful, lots of levels and mechanics, perfect game play, lots of secrets. A must play.. Best game for VR. Funny, shows different VR possibilities. Funny to watch how friends playing it, too.. Don't hesitate, just buy it. It's an absolute masterpiece and the best game on all of the PS4 including non be titles.. A review from Nintendo guy! + Soundtrack (Good job Kenneth!) Gameplay Bossfights Visuals Amazing Animation Levels are unique and fun! - Challenges can be pretty hard. This is basically Super Mario 64 but in VR, Good job Sony.. Fun for the whole family. Astro Bots: Rescue Mission is my favorite VR platformer and using the VR mechanics in interesting and fun ways. :D. When RE7 is too scary for you to play in VR than this should your favorite choice. Astro Bot is one the best VR game which was ever made. It is just a pleasure to play this game, that you will smile along the whole game from start to end. The best part in this game is how the creators has used the VR capabilities. Nice demonstration that Sony as the creator of this game are masters of its own hardware.. One of the best Virtual Reality games I have ever played! The mechanics and graphics are great!. Real imersive game, 3rd person good done!! Love Music, and the feling of been in stages. ASTRO BOT: Rescue Mission is far and away the best VR game I have ever played. I am not quite half way through it and I can already say that if you have any interest in VR, you have to play this game. I have never seen production values like this outside Nintendo's games before. All of the little nuanced flourishes in the interface and environment show that there was a ton of love put into the production of the game. Every character is full of life and the soundscape really breathes life into everything. If you have some kind of physical handicap, this is not a good game for you, as you will be required to move your whole body around a bit to advance and you have to have pretty good reflexes, too, but there was never a time that I felt the game was unfair. Every enemy action is properly telegraphed, so your reflexes can lead you to victory without memorizing patterns and if you ever do die, don't fret, there are re-spawn points every 30 seconds or so. This game respects my time like no other I have played before. As for gameplay, I would describe ASTRO BOT as something like Mario 64 in VR, but like any good VR game, you can't really imagine how immersive it feels until you put the headset on yourself. Do not miss it. I rate it 5 out of 5.. Astro Bot: Rescue Mission is a 3D platform game in which the player takes control of a small robot known as Astro Bot, the aim being to rescue Astroâs crew scattered around each level. Using the duel shock the player is able to control Astro as you would with any game in the genre, the way the game utilises VR however is simply brilliant... Despite being a launch title for PSVR this game that remains the single biggest reason to purchase the headset. I could count on one hand the number of times Iâve been truly surprised by a game in the last decade, but this is an experience like no other and every level and little detail had me smiling from ear to ear. Playing Astro Bot was the first time I could actually see a future where virtual reality becomes an important part of gaming!. Best PSVR game i have played. It brings a smile to my face every time I load in and i get lost in the beautiful rendered worlds. Really good platforming and music to go along with it. level design is really well done, takes advantage of the VR and lots of secrets to find along the way. Also you dont really get much motion sickness playing this, so if you are beginner at VR this is a good game to start.. Masterpiece! The best and most fun video game of all time!! Sorry Kyoto, PSVR is the undisputed king of the world of 3d Platformers with this gem; This is another level of gaming and a true system seller (Like Ferris Bueller said ""If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one **** absolute gorgeous, brilliant and progressively challenging experience that will literally take your breath away (in a good way!) I'm nearing the end of the game and I have never been so sad to see a game end. Luckily these last levels are by far the most amazing in the game and just when you think you've been blown ****! You're blown away again and then world 5-2 comes and you're in awe.I lost sleep last night after 5-2; I was so impressed and couldn't stop thinking about it! Oh and the challenge stages..Pure brilliant hardcore platforming at its absolute finest and most fair! If you die, it's 100% your fault. A truly fun experience of epic proportions and wonderful game and I thank Sony's Japan Studio for giving this to the world! Oh, and the music is amazing too..I mean really amazing! Whole game is a masterpiece of design! I cannot stress how fine **** this is! A++ 10/10. I thought Iâd be done looking at VR games for a while, but alas, here we are. After completing games like âSUPERHOT VRâ and âBlood & Truth,â I expected that my VR time would merely be spent clocking hours in âBeat Saberâ and âMLB Home Run Derby VRâ (the latterâs actually rather fun, I might say) until Sony decided to bombshell us with some larger VR announcements. That said, my brother decided to buy a copy of âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ after trying out âTHE PLAYROOM VRâ (a free, glorified tech demo for the game) and he very highly recommended that I give it a whirl. I tried one level in it, but was immersed so much in it that it became a title I absolutely needed to play through. And now that Iâve beaten it, I can say itâs definitely a pretty great VR adventure. âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ advertises itself as a 3D mascot platformer with a VR spin to it, and I can certainly say it looks the part. The visuals are colorful and very sharp (even though the VR can often downgrade those a good bit), the sound design is very strong, with clever sound effects and catchy music, and the game plays as well as your standard 3D platformer would play. What gives the game an edge over said standard 3D platformers, though, is how well it integrates the VR into its play. I worried about how necessary the VR would be to a 3D platformer, especially one that used a regular control, but I can assure you that âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ feels like it couldnât have been done without the VR. Having the VR serve as your in-game camera provides a fantastic new twist on the 3D platformer, and the way that the VR plays with things like depth perception is so fantastic and clever (it also doesnât hurt that there are a ton of âwow factorâ moments coming from things like having your head under water, birds randomly flying by you, etc.). And fortunately, while you will be moving around a bit, the movement is minimal enough that this wonât make you as dizzy as, say, âBlood & Truthâ will (it also helps that âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ is easier to play when sitting down, too). There were several points while playing where I felt like âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ could be to the VR what games like âSuper Mario Bros.â was to the platformer genre, and what âSuper Mario 64â was to 3D gaming. For much of the early game, I had a feeling this couldâve been my first 10/10 rating for a PSVR game, and I felt all ready to crown the game as the best title available on VR. However, I started to find a few problems with the game. To be completely honest, I felt the game honestly couldâve been a bit shorter. I know that might seem bizarre, given that some VR games need to be short so that you donât make yourself sick wearing the headset, but in the case of âAstro Bot: Rescue Mission,â while the game starts excellently, around the last few worlds, the game sort of crawls its way to the finish. By the end of World 3, the game seemed to have exhausted a good deal of those âwowâ moments I mentioned earlier, to the point where the last few worlds just feel a bit lackluster by comparison. Not only that, but by that point, you do start to notice that the level design gets a bit repetitive, and while the levels are beautifully-crafted, they start to feel too same-y by that point. Even so, while the last few worlds do take away from the game a tiny bit, âAstro Bot: Rescue Missionâ is still a pretty great VR title. It might not be my personal favorite game on the VR (âBeat Saberâ and âSUPERHOT VRâ are still a good deal ahead of it), but the game definitely expands wonderfully on a tried-and-true formula, providing a game that serves as a pleasant introduction to VR for younger audiences, while a charming and clever enough one for older audiences. As one of the leading exclusive titles for the PlayStation VR, I can see this being a system-seller, and itâs a definitely a game to try if you own Sonyâs virtual reality headset. Final rating: 8 out of 10 âGreatâ. One of the best PSVR games, maybe best, there's nothing to complain about. Game is unbelievably beautiful for a PSVR game, runs well, fun to play, lots of challenge. PSVR must have game. Realistically 9,5/10 cause it's not perfect but I'll give it a 10 for that extra cute atmosphere. This game is just a blast and as others have stated the level design is outstanding. The devs really did a great job on this **** a 36 year old man who bought this with my kids in mind, I played the crap outta it myself. Well worth a buy, a must have vr title imo. Just incredible, this is a new era for platforms in the industry! The visuals, OMG.. Best PSVR Game yet! I was never so much into Jump 'n' Runs, but after I played this the first time (tried it just because of the high ratings) I was completely blown away. This game is so much fun. It simply puts a smile on your face while playing it. A must have! Not only for VR enthusiasts, but for everyone who likes likes Jump'n'Runs. Clearly a must have It's fun, nice, beautiful and original Even if you are not a big fan of plateforme you gonna love My favourite game on ps vr. Brilliant game! The platforming is fun, creative and tight. The graphics are clean and crisp! Surprisingly good for what I have come to expect from VR games in general and the performance (framerate) seems like pure perfection in my eyes. I played this on a PS4Pro though so that might be different on the standard, although I heard that it is only the resolution that is lowered. Only ""complaints"" (small ones) would be that the controller tracking isn't perfect but it is still good enough so that it isn't a big issue in the slightest and generally, the controller tracking isn't the most used feature in the game. You mostly just use the traditional buttons on your DS4. Another one is that the scope/ambition of the game isn't that big and the price tag reflects that. For the price, you get more than enough. But as an overall game i would love something with greater ambition.. Astro Bot is as close as you'll get to a perfect representation of what can be done in VR currently. It's one of the most fun games I can remember playing, and gave plenty of awe-inspiring moments by making perfect use of the new perspective, whether it is the sheer size of boss enemies feeling like they are towering over you, taking a moment to enjoy the spectacular surroundings, physically using your head to attack enemies or break obstacles, or moving yourself to peer around corners or stand up to look over walls and realising you can find hidden areas this way. It can be fluid and almost rhythmic in its' gameplay at times, as you control Astro over platforms and around enemies, while ducking and weaving around obstacles yourself, and it can be quite challenging late in the game. Forgiving checkpoints help with this however and ensure you don't get too frustrated with having to repeat lengthy sections of a difficult stage. If you own a PSVR you definitely need to get this game. It's one of those games you will want to show your friends to convince them of the wonders of VR gaming.. I can comfortably say that Astro Bot is the best (PS)VR game I have every played beating RE7, Tetris, and the rest of the top tiers in that category. First of all, the graphics are truly the best and the pinnacle of PSVR to date. This cartoon art style makes practically object seem blurry. Everything is vibrant and there are so much little details in animation. Many levels might seem similar in some ways, but there are a lot of levels. Finding all the bots and the challenging levels easily gives replay value. Enemies aren't that challenging, and the game is very forgiving when you die, but the linearity of the game does shift the focus from tense and struggles to a more relaxing and enjoyable experience. There are creative ways to use tools, boss fights are decent, and it's just fun to play. Astro Bot: Rescue Mission is a system seller that is a super fun plat former that will make you smile of how awesome a game can be. Another 10 from me, an absolute treat to play and a masterful example of how VR should be shaped into the future. Absolute masterpiece. Such a joyful and uplifting experience. It's impossible not to smile and you'll keep the smile a long time after you take off your headset. The happiness received from this game is like playing with small kittens in real life (the happiest feeling I can think of right now).. One of the greatest video games of all time. Yes, you read this right. And I am a HUGE Nintendo Fan Boy. Not since my jaw dropped from playing Mario 64 for the first time back in the day, Astro Bot had me screaming so many times, ""OH MY GOD!"" out loud! The play is fun, clever, always a joy, however, the environments, the immersion of this game in VR, is where this title shines the brightest. I loved this game so much I gave it two standing ovations during the credits sequence (and, post credits, there is over 10 hours additional content to do!) Astro-bot is platforming genius. If there ever was one game that was worth buying PSVR for alone, this game is it. It will be remembered in gaming history as the truly first great VR game. It's on my top 10 list for greatest video games of all time. (And, meteoritic, the zero scores below are just so annoying and done out of spite by those who never played the game. Please create a system where the top 5 and bottom five scores are not factored into the final metascore). Thank you Japan Studio for making me believe in the game industry again. As a 38 year old gamer I find it so sad to see the game world is being ruled and ruined more and more by commercial managers, marketeers, and business men.... purely focussed on how to earn maximum profit. I miss the times when game studios simply wanted to make great games, where the game designers were free to display their creativity and a game was finnished when it was finnished. Astrobot made me smile like a kid, for the first time in a long ...long time! This is VR as it was intended ot be + more. The love that has been put in this game is feelable. - great world - creative VR and immersion - awesome and enough gameplay - good price - no **** (microtransactions or whatever) I normally don't rate a 10, but **** guys deserve it. One of the best if not the best games of VR, fun and somewhat challenging. As for most of the games of its genre, it lacks of a solid story, it is fun anyway and becomes more challenging as you move forward but not as challenging as it should be, that gets solved by the challengues you unlock allong the way so it is suitable for everyone.. it is the first must play vr games all over the world!!! the resolution is perfect. Gameplay/Mechanics: 9 Sound/Music: 9 Graphics/Art: 9 Story/Atmosphere: 9 OVERALL: 9/10. This game is magical, I would say this is now the best psvr game. Even if you don't normally like platform style games this title is so creative it will win you over.. The best reason so far to buy the PSVR; beautiful, innovative and visually stunning game which actually truly benefits from the VR perspective in every way imaginable. You want to showcase VR to the skeptics out there? Get them to play this game. It's fantastic.. This is an absolute must for anyone with PSVR. If it were a standard none VR game it'd still be fun but getting into Astro's world in VR is a game changer. The worlds are unique, finding the little bots can be challenging on some levels and they are so damn cute their cries for help really make you feel the need to go back and get them all. It game is absolutely beautiful along with a great sound track. Best platformer I've played in 10 years if not longer.. One of most enjoyable games I have ever played. I love everything about it - locations, music, diversity of the gameplay. It is also funny, it's a real pleasure to play it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A true masterpiece, Astro Bot is the new definition for 3D platformers. It works surprisingly well with VR. Good for all ages. The only con is the shortness. Therefore 9/10, with more content it would be 10/10.. A true gem of VR! I don't care for platformers much, didn't really like SMO on the Switch. I only got this because it came in my bundle and it's my favourite PSVR game for sure. The environments and puzzles are very inventive, and the tricky jumping puzzle nature of platformers is kept to a minimum.. This was the first game I played on my PSVR, and watched my teenage son play through thefirst world. This game looks like an updated Mario 64 I thought and wasn't anything special I wrongly assumed watching him play the levels. The next day I tried the game out and was blown away by how great this game is when you put on the headset and exprience it for yourself. Everything in this game is pure fun , the catchy tunes, the stunning graphics, clever gadgets and variety of levels and enemies. Every level is unique and quirky and you're driven on to see what the next level **** personal favourites - and beach level which goes undersea and a spooky level later on. This is not just the best VR game I have played but the best platformer in my opinion. A great showcase for VR- and just pure fun. This game is so good I was hooked from start to finish (to the point where I have found every bot, did all the challenges and got every collectible). It really shows the potential of VR. The graphics are incredible, the details in the environments and on the little robots are amazing, and there is a lot of content as well. I can't wait for a sequel.. This is by far the best platformer that I have ever played. Just when you think they have ran out of ideas, the next level blows you away even more. This game is brilliant.. This game is really incredible by far the best 3D platformers in VR, it's ingenious what made japan studio, this game is better than mario odyssey, really a pearl. The VR makes sense with him !. Astro Bot is a delight, akin to Mario 3 on the original NES. I'm not really into cute game characters, however this game is AMAZING! Everyone should give this game a go and you will be converted to VR.. The most feel good VR game out there. I played the one that came with PSVR worlds and I wanted more, I'm so happy this game came around. Reading at the two 0 ratings... like what? How? How did you rate 0? Looking at their comments, literally they have 1 point as to why it's bad. The game is amazing, this, Firewall and Beat Sabre made my PSVR worthwhile. Would recommend. 9/10 missing one because it could be longer.. This is the best game I played for years. Its just so damn fun. Ended up playing this more then red dead redemption 2 now under the holidays. You feel like a kid playing mario 64 for the first time again.. Great Game. It's definitely a must play. It feels like Mario for a new generation of gamers.. Just got PSVR as Xmas gift. Tried a few games. Downloaded the Astro Bot demo to see if I liked it. Around 2 minutes into the demo I knew I was buying the game. An excellent little 3D platformer. The best thing I can say about it is that it has come the closest to making me feel how I felt when I played Mario 64 for the first time around 22 years ago. It is a beautiful game and if you are new to VR as I am then I thoroughly recommend it as a first game. Only played the first two worlds so far and loving it. Not too difficult although one or two of the challenges have been tricky. Really hope they have a sequel in the works with more worlds, more collectibles but along the same lines. My favourite PSVR game so far.. Hands down the best VR title as of yet and the best platformer of this generation.. An absolute joy to play. I went in skeptical, as I don't think 3rd-person VR often works well, but I was all smiles all the way though. Polished to a mirror sheen, with some delightful little details. Perhaps a bit easy for older players, but great fun.. By far the best game made so far in 2018, what else can I say? The protagonist is cute, it is a little robot that has to save the day, imagine Megaman, but with an actual level design that is done correctly with no death traps nor enemy spam all over the place. Overall, if it isn't elected best game of 2018, I'm going to throw a temper tantrum (JK).. This is it. I've been playing games since Zx Spectrum, moved on to PC and jumped on Sony's bandwagon when Playstation arrived. Meanwhile, I did get a Nintendo Wii for my kids - and since everyone was talking about Super Mario Galaxy (1 and 2), I gave it a try. And I was absolutely stunned. Up until now, even if I'm more of a ""great graphics"" kind of guy, I still regard Super Mario Galaxy 2 as one of the best videogames ever. Move forward 8 years, put on a PSV helmet and launch Astro Bot. Just wow. A game that justifies VR on its own. One of the best games I have ever played. And just like Super Mario Galaxy (where Astro Bot gets a lot of inspiration), it's all about the gameplay. The fun. The joy. Enough for me to create a Metacritic account just to tell you how thrilled I am to experience this gem. Game of the Year, for me.. I'm pretty sure Miyamoto is a little jealous of this one. Awesome game and easy to play for long sessions in VR. Great job Studio Japan.. reminds me of a disneyland or a themepark ride.. one of those ones that you just think about how fun the experience is/was, it's really really - really, good.. Great Game and a must have. Reminds me of the good old days with the N64 with a VR twist.. This is an excellent game. this should be the go to game for anyone playing VR and in the top 3 best games of the year across all platforms.. Admitted society was fine for something good. Will the former game history history be the most fascinating game for this?. The story in this game is practically non-existent. Maybe there is a short interlude at the beginning, but as befits most of",the new AstroBot is getting his first full length game soon so everyone with a PS5 can experience how amazingly fun it is to play as this little robot .
365.Bayonetta + Bayonetta 2,"The first game is better than the second game, but both are by far recommended and amazing experiences.. I gave it a try and the controls were just too complex. What a shame, the game looks interesting, but it's too complicated for old millenial :D. 2 of the greatest hack and slash games ever, 2 being the best out of both of them.. I loved the fact that the stories come full circle. That was completely destroyed by the third game. So, it's a shame I had to lower both of these games to a 7, since now they aren't even part of canon, if you think about it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 2 absolutely perfect games that aren't the longest but keep you interested over the whole experience. I would recommend everyone to at least play the games once and especially people who like hack and slash games and bayonetta is definitely one of my favourite game series of all time.. Bayonetta 1 and 2 in a bundle, those two games are an experience that you should see by yourself, when you think ""how are they going to top this?"" then they top it, it's a constant evolution.. The perfect bundle to get into the serie of Bayonetta. The Bayonetta's saga is one of those were the lore it's no extremely deep, but if you have played the previous games you get another level of experience in the following entries.. a very good action game that deserves all the love that you have. i love it so much. AMAZING gameplay, really good design. the game is so perfect i love it til the end. A double pack of 2 average games is good value, but it's still 2 average games.. Both games are grate. The characters, the combat. lots of fun to be had here.. Some of the best hack and slash games you can play. The combat is incredibly satisfying and polished, with tons of combos and other mechanics that make it so good. Bayonetta 2 wins by far in the combat aspect. Also, the characters are very interesting and there are some very funny silly moments in the stories. Amazing bundle.. Bayonetta 2 is the better game with improved combat, gameplay, setting and BGM. Bayonetta 1 felt repetitive and slightly more difficult. I wasn't invested in the story in both games. If I had to pick one, Astral Chain is better. Its a similar hack/slash but longer, better story, characters and vibrant setting with more replayability. Â£50 is ok since there are two games, I would have been ok to just play the 2nd, but won't play again.. Solid games, I especially enjoyed the first one. Great characters, gameplay and replayability. best hack and slash games I have ever played. So glad it's on the Nintendo Switch. It's so cool that we get to have a super good game AND Bayonetta 2 on the Switch!. True fluid non stopping combo action hack' n slash. Just amazing! Masterpiece.. Great game, immediate fun, crazy characters, nice staging. The only cons I see is the non remastered graphics, do not wait for great visuals ... As a none Wii U owner, i was sad that i missed those games, was happy for the re release on the switch and loved them both, 2 being my favorite, hope 3 will come soon :). Bayonetta 1 and 2 are the games that made me love videogames again. Not only on the fact that gives you the best action i've seen in a videogame, but also the quantity of replay value that it offers is crazy. Bayonetta has one of the greatests OSTs i've ever heard in my life, from catchy pop songs... To epic orchestras that empowers the player and makes you feel invincible. These games are an adrenaline rush of epic proportions that can only be described by experiencing them. Bayonetta 1 and 2 are a MUST BUY for every action games player out there.. Bayonetta is mindless button-mashing fun at its finest, with a wild story and over-the-top visuals ensuring a good time to be had by all. A must for every Nintendo Switch owner.. Ultimate package nothing less. Two great action games for rising your hype about ucoming Bayonetta 3. Glad I preordered it. Both are solid games, and excellent ones, but the one that's the best is the sequel.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Epic hack and **** story in the first one was a bit mediocre, but on the 2nd game the story was better and made you understand the story of the first game and the overall story better. No words for the graphics and the gameplay. Just awsome.. This bundle is a good choice. For the price, there are 2 awesome games... I like : - 2 games bundle - Story - Combos, too many combos ;-) - a real kicker - Lifetime (15-20H per game) - sexy witch ^^ - very fun I don't like : - the routine, especially on the first one - graphics of the first one - 1 & 2 are very similar. I am so happy Bayonetta 2 is on Switch now. I didn't buy the WiiU but believe me I almost bought it only for that game. I had Bayonetta 1 on PS3 and honestly I think it's an awesome geisture to put the first game as well. I had a lot of fun revisiting it too. Thanks for this amazing series, can't wait for more.. if you have no taste and you like watching ""sexy"" women you may enjoy this trash.... terrible sexist game for horny weebes.... Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 are easily one of the best, if not THE best action games I have ever played. The combat system is a non-stop roller coaster of fun and excitement that ends up keeping me play the games for hours (particularly Bayonetta 2). Thereâs a enough meat on the storyâs bones to keep you there, but the main focus is the combat and the various well designed characters. This was my first time playing either one of these games and I will have to say that Iâm sad I waited so long to play them. Bayonetta 2 is one of my favorite games Iâve ever played and canât wait for the next installment to the series coming to the Switch.. I never got the chance to play the Bayonetta games despite owning a Wii U so I was thrilled when they were announced for the Switch. I'm glad to say that the hype and praise surrounding the two titles is very deserved. I found the gameplay a little repetitive at first, but then I realized I just had the insta-combo accessory on (in the first game) so if that's anyone's issue, just turn that off. Here's a quick rundown of the features of the games. Story: Bayonetta is great in both games, but different at the same time. In the first game, she's much funnier while in the second game, she's more serious. I like seeing both sides of her personality. I'll give the upper hand for story to 1 overall because certain characters are featured much more heavily in the first game, but the second half of 2 is beyond anything 1 had. Gameplay: The gameplay of the games is very simple to understand and the combat is really fun. This is one of the few action-based games I've played where I haven't got bored of the combat. Each battle is unique and memorable. 2's gameplay is a little more refined and also has less on-rails segments so I'll give this point to that game. Graphics: Obviously 2. The color palette of 1 is a little bland and Bayonetta 2 is one of the best looking games I have ever played. Seriously. Soundtrack: Both games have great soundtracks but Bayonetta 1 has much more memorable original themes such as Mysterious Destiny, One of a Kind, You May Call Me Father, and Let's Dance Boys. 2 has a few great tracks like Tomorrow is Mine, Noatun, The Legend of Aesir, and Let's Dance Boys 2 though admittedly not as many. Fly Me to the Moon and Moon River are equally amazing. Story: 1 > 2 (slightly) Gameplay: 2 >> 1 Graphics: 2 >> 1 Soundtrack: 1 > 2 Both Bayonetta games are fantastic and worth playing but I personally found 2 to be superior in the most important categories. Do yourself a favor and get these games!. The Bayonetta series was something I was completely unaware of until it blessed my existence on the Wii U. Since then, I've been embracing everything the game has to offer, from its sass, to it's music, to it's style, to... god, everything. Bayonetta is hands-down one of the best games in my library and I am so happy to have had the chance to play it. The sequel builds on everything the first game has to offer and refines it. The story is a bit less engaging in the sequel, but it's still fun to go through. Personally, I like Bayonetta's appearance in the first game compared to the second game, but she looks great on both games anyways. The Switch version is definitely the definitive version. I am very happy to see PlatinumGames' best work finally being recognized on a console that has a lot more traction going for it than the Wii U. As for those who complain about pricing: believe me, it justifies the price. And this is coming from someone who has now Triple-dipped on Bayonetta (Wii U, PC, and now Switch).. The Bayonetta Series deliver the best Hack and slash games ever made. They Will be considered classics and unmatchable in the future just like treasureâs games stand now among 16 bit games. Every gamer Needs to play both! If the cutscenes put you off you can always skip them. They are just there as an excuse to deliver the craziest and most solid gameplay you've ever witnessed in an action game. And Bayonetta is just that. Both games are great, amazing even, and I would totally give them a 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the steep price for 60 bucks for an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD game and FOUR-YEAR-OLD game respectively. Are you **** kidding? Crash Bandicoot has 3 games for 40 in HD, Okami HD was 30 retail and 20 download, Shadow of the Colossus is 40 and it's been reworked too, and This is 60? FOR AN EIGHT AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD GAME?! WITH LITERALLY NOTHING NEW?!?!?!?! Yes, it's portable, but give me a break on this portable **** that everyone mentions - especially when the switch lasts no longer than 3:30 hours! If they at least added something new in both games but they really didn't, it's the same exact game from 8 and 4 years ago plus the Nintendo exclusive gimmick stuff. As if we have to be reminded... It's like charging full price for final fantasy **** ps1 version! And please don't give them ideas... Besides the price, it's also shipped amazingly cheap: 60 bucks for two games sounds like a good deal, until you realize that one is a download code that really could've been inside the game - without mentioning there were cases of misprinted codes, because that's quality for a 60 buck game! I could at least let it pass if it was 2 retail boxes or one game containing both games, but nope: you're essentially paying for one game and a download code, which both have 8 and 4-year-old games respectively, for 60 euros/dollars. Do people like to be ripped off or something? Thank God I can return it and get ACTUAL compilations worth the price...like the Uncharted trilogy **** 30 bucks... But with all this (justified) ranting aside, if you NEVER - EVER - played Bayonetta before or if you never had a pc, PlayStation or Xbox before, can I gladly recommend it despite the steep price: these are the two best action games after Devil May Cry 3 or 4 and the 6 rating can easily turn into a 9 without any trouble for this very reason. The graphics quality is okay, handheld works ""decently"" and if you have a pro controller this game actually is a blast to play and overall, they're fun games with really not much wrong going on besides the occasional frame drop and other tweaks. It's just the price and overall quality of the shipment being ultra lazy and questionable, to say the least... But if you're like me who actually played Bayonetta before on basically everywhere, you can find the first game on steam (and it's well optimized too), you can still find copies for the ps3 (not recommended) and Xbox 360 (recommended), and if you still own your Wii u you can still find those boxes with both Bayonetta 1 and 2 at a very cheap price , and it's FAR superior in quality than the switch version. The only issue is the second game, which is Nintendo exclusive and ONLY available on Wii U and **** let's be really honest here: with the first game available at a very cheap price (20 bucks on steam), is it worth the additional 40 for the second game? Don't take me wrong it's amazing but unless you're eager to have a complete ""collection"", you can survive on the first game alone. And if you still have a Wii U, just find one of those double boxes with both games (I spent 20 euros for mine) and save up those money for other compilations worth your time... ....at least the Wii U version has two retail boxes you can store!. It's my first time playing this game. This is one of the most awesome game I have ever played. Great story, fair difficulty and really enjoyable gameplay. 10*/10.. I love me some Bayo. This game is so much better on the Switch and even on the WiiU it was a fantastic game. If you have not played the original or Bayo 2 you owe it to yourself.. WOW !!! This is Really Fantastic & Amazing Game ! Just Play ! Do it. then You must understand Why I recommending.. The game is great (played 1 and 2 on Wii U) but the Switch version is rather dissapointing. The game runs only at 720p while docked which looks pretty bad on my 65"" 4k TV. This is annyoing since the game plays so much better with a Pro Controller for pulling off combos than it does in handheld mode.. These are 2 of the best action games ever made and the Nintendo Switch version is the best yet due to the versatility of being able to play them both portable and on the TV. In portable mode both games look and play amazingly, in TV mode the game would have benefited from a higher resolution as it is only 720p. There are also some occasional drops in the frame rate but 95% of the time the game runs at a stable 30fps and even the most action-heavy battles play smoothly.. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a huge fan of character action games, but I've played a lot of the big name one's; Devil May Cry, some God of War, maybe the Arkham series kinda fits in, but Bayonetta 1 and 2 are just in a league of their own. The polish, the combos, the game elements like Witch Time just elevate this game to a different plane of existence. Few games capture that intense speed while also feeling completely skill based and rewarding the player for getting in the zone. Bayonetta 1 is great and I love the story but 2 really does up the ante in almost every single way. 2 is more fluid, more colorful, more open, better balanced, and just all around more spectacular. Can't recommend these games enough if you like action games at all.. so i had never played these games before there releases on the switch as they went under my radar upon there first release but i thought id pick them up on the switch and give them a try and let me day that these are 2 of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. A stellar action game on the Nintendo Switch. My heart actually races when I play this game because it is so exciting and well made. The level and boss designs are fantastic and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this game.. It's a great game, but not as awesome, as I remembered it. Traversal is kind of clumsy on many occasions and the menu system where you configure your weapon selections and craft items isn't the greatest. Game play is still top notch though! But the camera becomes a fierce enemy from time to time. I also love the over the top and weird characters, overall presentation and bonkers story! The game also has loads of replay potential and many, optional stuff to unlock (or rather buy from Rodin). I also purchased my copy to support Nintendo and Platinum and to contribute to the message that this kind of games are still wanted by the players.. One of the greatest hack & slash games of the last 10 years is now portable. Bayonetta makes her Nintendo debut in Bayonetta 1 and it's sequel Bayonetta 2 for the Nintendo Switch. Both games preform nicely, giving gamers the best home-console expierence for Bayonetta 1 (unless you count backwards emulation through the Xbox One X) Both games look great on the Switch, staying at a near 60fps running at 1280 x 720. The games are as fun as they've always been and it makes most gamers, including myself, insanely excited for Bayonetta 3. Overall, a ""must-have"" in my opinion. Over 8 years later, and Bayonetta 1 is still a blast to play through; and Bayonetta 2 is great as well. Her bewitching personality and fun-to-pull-off combos make the game the opposite of tiresome. After a long day of work, it's great to pop these games in and take your daily frustrations out on fallen angels as one of the most powerful badasses from Platnum. Absolutely amazing.. the best hack-and-slash game I have ever played, If you have a Nintendo Switch you need to buy this games!!. Absolute masterpiece! This game is a must buy for anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch.. The best hack & slash are now also portable....I love Bayonetta! She is sooo ""naughty"", to control, to watch, to hear and beyond!!! Wonderful combo system, great add ons, customizing your gear ect. - a little nice feauture is the **** the Mushroom Kingdom Princess custume....Rawrrr!!! Ohhh YES boys, you'll love it :P The story is about heaven/hell......short: Your friend is caputred in hell, bring her back! The whole world fits the characters ect. A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR SWITCH!!!!. One of the best games ever made, and I'm so glad they are on the switch now.. These games are full of juvenile sex-jokes & swearing, and the the music is also quite juvenile.. I couldn't even get through 30 mins of this game. This might seem cool when you're a teen full of raging hormones, but as an adult - I find these games unplayable because of it. The games are also very poorly optimized for Switch, still rendering in 720p - in Tv-mode !! It has a slightly improved framerate, but is still unable to keep a solid 60fps - even on supposedly significantly more powerful hardware. Get used to seeing dips into the low 50's and even sometimes 40's. go figure.. My personal recommendation is to stay far away from these, they're utter garbage in my humble opinion.. Bayonetta 2 still remain the non plus ultra of the genre: technical and incredibly rewarding fights, incredibly inspired boss, crazy story and an artistic style that is unparalleled. If it came out in the ps2 era, in which the mentality of the players was certainly more open, Bayonetta would become a cult game.","two of the greatest hack and slash games ever, 2 is the best out of both of them . the combat is incredibly satisfying and polished . the characters are very interesting and there are some very funny silly moments in the stories ."
366.Final Fantasy VIII,"Sure, the combat could be better. Sure, the junction system can be annoying. Sure, the GF cut scenes can be repetitive. But you want to talk about a story...? My god, this is the game that made me fall in love with video games. The cast in this epic are the most endearing and fully realized characters that you may ever have the pleasure of coming across. From Squall to Quistis to Seifer to Rinoa to Headmaster Cid, I can't think of an ensemble more engrossing than this one. They draw you in unsuspectingly and before you know it every single one of them matters to you more than you ever anticipated. Even the side characters of Balamb, Galbadia, Deling City, Timber and many many more feel like fully fleshed out people existing within this concentrated universe with their very own personalities, dreams, hopes, concerns and I suppose most importantly, loves. Because when the dust settles on this magnificent title... you'll realize that it was a love story all along... and perhaps the best one you've ever had the honor of witnessing. Nay... not witnessing... being a part of.. Oh yes, Final Fantasy 8 which has grown to be quite divisive among fans of the series. Personally, I enjoyed it a lot. I like the gameplay and is a huge reason to play this. Once you master this and the card game, you'll make this game your you know what. The story is rather generic imo, it has some nice moments but is very 90s and dramatic at times. The characters are memorable tho and so are the GFs which there are a lot of them. I feel the story starts off strong but loses heart as time goes and the gameplay is the opposite, starts off kinda boring but explodes with style as you progress. Overall, this is a great memorable experience even if it feels very 90s and cliched.. So weird at times, even for this series, that it makes you giddy. The combat is quirky and has some great game-breaking options. The card mini-game is incredibly fun. Really underrated story, too. Some gems on the soundtrack.. It's a cult classic, an imaginative universe that has a distinct mood and aesthetic about it. The CG art in and of itself is brilliant and polarizing. My personal favorite, and the one most in need of a remake. Squall gets so mischaracterized because of a not great job at localization.. My all time Favorit Final Fantasy. I Hope for a Remake on Time ð¤ #squallisbetterthencloud. Overrated!! graphically it's an improvement but any other way it's a downgrade.. Final Fantasy VIII, stands as the pinnacle of the Final Fantasy series for me. The game's atmosphere, its deeply engaging story, and the meticulously crafted character development are simply unparalleled. This masterpiece not only set a new standard for role-playing games but also holds a special place in the hearts of its fans. Its excellence is a testament to the creativity and passion of its creators. A very solid follow up to the previous entry, which build upon the stunning visuals for the time of release and excellent story telling. FMVs and realistic character design were a first for the series. The plot is excellent, with the usual convolution expected from an FF entry. Full of rapturing moments and emotionally engaging. The gameplay is very solid, I personally love the Junction system. The only drawback is how spells are acquired and used, the draw mechanic is not a very good design, leading to a lot of repetition. And then, there is the best minigame of all time: Triple Triad. If you want to experience serious addiction, just press square.. loved the story veeeeeery much, can't find the the cons ( or I am just a fan of this game lmao). Loved the story & characters. Huge graphical upgrade from FFVII, but I can't help to feel like FFVII was so brilliant it made this feel subpar. Still, a really good game.. This is by far my fave game of all time a must play. Has a unique story with well developed characters. A deep and compelling plot. And the game play is awesome with a really good lineup of summons, limit breaks, magics and weapons. Monster designs are awesome too. And by far the best romance done in a video game. This game was so epic for me that it still holds a special place for me. Donât think another game will come close. I used to have hopes that versus 13 would come close but that game just took a whole new direction. This game should get a remake a well done one. That would be the day!!. I loved FF8. People who say it's not as good as FF7 are wrong. FF8 has a special place in my heart. The story, characters and the music make this game a work of art.. my fav final fantasy game, the story and the characters are it made me fell so clode to it that even made me cry, should play it. An epic storyline accompanied by incredibly endearing characters, this game features a battle system that may not steal the spotlight but still delivers numerous enjoyable and strategic moments when facing challenging bosses.. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. The first Final Fantasy I ever played on PS1 in 2000. Great game but the worst of the mainline PS1/2 games.. My first Final Fantasy, the only bad thing I can say is the gameplay, but it still has a lot left. Such an amazing game. The story, characters, world, music, and gameplay. It all works perfectly and I didn't even notice that I have spent 100 hours on this game. 100% recommend it.. I could stock magic four hours on end. Nothing is more fun than junctiong Curaga to my health stat.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this eighth game in the series.. Nostalgic and my first JRPG, played for so many hours. It was before the great internet times.. My number 1 game The most underrated due to the complexity and beauty of it's story Love it in every aspect and wish to see a remake. My favourite Final Fantasy and by far the best. Can still get lost in it's story after all these years.. Terrible game! How this POS failure has defenders is past me. Itâs about as horrid as the 13 trilogy and 15, itâs offspring but those abortions get far more criticized. The plot is a broken, horribly convoluted mess thatâs MST3K material full of ginormous holes, astronomical coincidences and laughable plot twists , the characters arenât interesting or very deep at all, the romance is artificial in its entirety and gag inducing, the soundtrack is mediocre in general with a couple tracks that are actually really good, the gameplay âinnovations â are are pointless and get in the way of getting any possible fun out of this abortion by causing unnecessary frustration and tedium, the locations arenât that interesting or exciting looking and Squall is a whiny emo **** who isnât particularly fun or interesting and Lightning and Noctis seem to have regretfully borrowed a bit too much from him. One of the biggest mistakes to come out of this franchise. People wonder why this franchise has been struggling more than succeeding with its fans but Final Fantasy 8 is a big part of what caused this. Almost everything to come out of it was a bad thing before it was a good thing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games ever created by man and possibly my all time favourite game soundtrack. I consider this game a diamond, a piece of genius. Questis really out here creeping on her students and nobodies going to say a word, huh?. A lone wolf, Squall is my man! GFs are fun and graphics took a step forward from VII. Top 5 FF for me. And btw, LOVED the Triple Triad!. The game is okay................................................................................................... One of the best rpg games of all time, it has a great story. I hope you will like. This one is more similar to current rpgs than others of the time.. One of my earliest FF games and I finished it approx. 20 years later. The music is extremely good. The scores are also good. The GFs make the game huge and keep it interesting in battling with enemies. After delivering two of the greatest RPGs ever back-to-back with Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII, it's no surprise Yoshinori Kitase returned to the director's chair one last time with Final Fantasy VIII. Unfortunately, Final Fantasy VIII is bogged down by frustrating inconsistencies, including the tedious Draw System, a lackluster cast of characters, and a messy story. Still, Final Fantasy VIII is a risky and ambitious entry in the series, and the Junction System gives a lot of freedom for customization for veteran RPG players.. Right now, my review is based on my memories, as I played final fantasy viii when I was 16. at the time this game was spectacular. its gamplay is very good, the visuals and history and its music is the best. you can't die without having played this gem. GAMEPLAY: 9 STORY: 9 MUSIC: 10+ VISUALS: 10 PERSONAL SCORE >> A JEWELL. possibly one of the worst RPGs I have ever played. the game is fundamentally broken and goes against everything an RPG should be. leveling up makes it HARDER. the junction system is awful, they try way to hard to be cinematic to the point it gets in the way of gameplay. the worst example being when they actually make you wait in an office for someone to arrive and talk to you. also, the train part.. Final Fantasy VIII is a game with many problems, and most of these problems lie in the very fundation of this game's Combat: the Junction System. The Junction System is made up of many different new Mechanics: GFs, GF abilities, Consumable Magic and Magic Junction. GFs and their abilities are great: Summons can now give new abilities or improve the Stats of the character they are linked to, essentially becoming a new form of Equipment. They are just great, anything negative to note about them. The problems arise with the last two: Consumable Magic and Magic Junction. Making Magic a consumable item isn't a bad idea at all: It can lead to a new layer of strategy tied to resource management. Magic Junction isn't a bad idea either: by linking a type of Magic to a Stat, that Stat raises, and different types of Magic have different results on different Stats. It can lead to satisfying situational equipment, keeping players on their toes. But now, if you take these two mechanics, Consumable Magic and Magic Junction, and mesh them together, suddenly enormous cracks start to appear: players will collect as much new Magic as possible from enemies to enhance their Stats as much as possible, leading to hours and hours of mindless, tedious collecting. And in battle they will always hesitate in using Magic, to avoid hurting linked Stats, or maybe even avoid battles entirely (which begs the question of why are we playing this game at all if we actively wish not to engage in fights). Maybe avoiding Combat isn't an option, like in Boss Fights, and we are forced to use Magic linked to Stats. This leads to a very boring process, after Combat, where we need to check if now we have any other Magic to increase the Stat again. As you can see, Consumable Magic and Magic Junction weren't a problem individually, but as soon as they're present in the same game they actively hinder each other, resulting in extremely anti-fun gameplay full of tedious farming, battles that discourage the player from using their tools and constant boring micromanagement. In this spectacular failure of a Combat System, players are basically incentivized to simply spam GFs since using them doesn't require any resource whatsoever (There are bosses that are challenging enough to be entertaining, but they're few and far between). So yeah, gameplay is pretty awful, but there's a pretty substantial amount of good ideas and concepts sprinkled here and there, which help make the overall experience a lot less terrible. Firstly, there are many instances where the turn-based combat takes an Action-esque twist: requiring the player to press a button with the right timing, or powering up GFs by repeatedly pressing a button, or a Limit Break that asks players to input combos of buttons quickly, and many more. These are all extremely cool ways to keep the player's attention high outside the menus and add a bit of Action to the mix. A shame that later Final Fantasy didn't develop this concept. The world-map is also just as beautiful and full of secrets as it was in the last installment, giving plenty of hours of content to dig in after the main story. Also the level of details of the backgrounds and the quality of the soundtrack are once again great. But arguably the absolute best thing about Final Fantasy VIII's gameplay is ""just"" a minigame: Triple Triad. This card game is just perfect: simple, yet challening. The possibility to collect and catalogue every card also adds a layer of collectionism to the mix, and even if you don't like collecting for the sake of it, you'll be able to convert cards into items, and rare cards turn into extremely valuable items, so there's something to gain from this fun minigame for every type of player. Almost every single NPC in the world can be challenged, always providing a fun diversion from the monotonous gameplay and... messy plot. I think it's time to talk about the story of FFVIII. The story of FFVIII is rich of incredible locations, tremendously fantastical concepts and creative ideas to potentially craft a story even better than FFVII. And yet all of it, every single thing crumbles under some of the worst storytelling and character writing I have ever seen. Plotlines that are introduced with great emotional impact only to lead absolutely nowhere, inconstistencies and plotholes too huge to be ignored, romance between characters that have no chemistry whatsoever, vital plotpoints completely left unexplained and lastly an ending that simply doesn't make any sense. This is the story of FFVIII. There are many well directed emotional and epic moments, but they can't shine properly or be as great as they could've been because they're still part of this jumbling mess of a plot. Or, in other words: FFVIII is a bad game and an even worst story. What saves it from being straight garbage are some very good gameplay ideas, the incredible beauty of its vast, rich world full of secrets, and its soundtrack. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me this game represent the best time of my life, and the feelings i had with this masterpiece will be forever locked in my heart. A must play.. Very well done across 4 discs. Squall could take some getting used to but over all it was a very enjoyable game.. Possibly the worst mainline final fantasy game to date. The combat systems while interesting end up being terribly broken. Any RPG where you want to avoid leveling up due to level scaling is a terrible RPG. You know you made a bad RPG when you spend more time playing cards than fighting battles.. It had the potential to be the best Final Fantasy in history, but the storyline from the middle onwards takes a bad turn, falling into some banality. But it remains a videogames' icon, an exciting journey that a surprise for you will forget, a bubble full of love, both in the characters, both in the art design and both in the gameplay. it's the kind of game that you love to madness even recognizing its flaws.. A lot of people missed the point of this game which is life is morally grey. Everyone wanted a stereotypical badguy you follow throughout as the hero.. Instead the badguy shifts and changes given the situation. Even goodguys become badguys. The point is to question authority, motivations, dogma, even memory to become better instead of being a complete tool and regretting it.. the story is very good but the junctioning is very confusing and the world feels dead. This is my 6th favourite final fantasy game and the fact I'm still giving it 10 says how good it is. The storyline is certainly on the weaker side in terms of final fantasy standard mainly because of how confusing it is, but it's still great because of its usual strong cast of characters. Although again it's probably not as good cast wise as 4,6,7,9 or 10. I also want to mention its opening because it's on par with 6,7 and 9 for being the best opening in the series. The combat is certainly better paced than its predecessors, it doesn't feel overly slow or overly fast and it flows surprisingly well. Visually it's also superior to its predecessors especially in character design. The soundtrack is also brilliant even if I prefer 4,6,7,9 and 10 because of personal taste. The futuristic setting is really nice and whilst I definitely prefer the worlds of 4,6,7,9 and 10 I still like it because of this reason. The one thing I found to be pretty decent in FF8 was its side content which I found to be very strong. Overall whilst this game has some issues and certainly takes some steps back from 7 it's still a great game and one that should not be missed out on.. Great story, great characters. The best FF in my opinion. I loved it from start to finish.. People usually say your first final fantasy is your favourite, yet this was my third and gosh it is good, its my favourite by a good margin, It has an excellent story and, the junction system, although not easy when you start playing this game, turns out to be an excellent system which leads you to and endlessly customizable experience.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. A good RPG that I enjoyed but has also much stuff that I hate. The prequel Final Fantasy 7 was a huge commercial success and also by fan acclaim so we all were curious what to expect next. Square did not play it safe and made many innovations except from the core turn based style. It is set in a different world and follows Squall Leonhart. He is a trainee in Balamb Garden were he is trained to be a SEED (=Mercenary / Agent / Soldier / Hired Hand / Problem Solver chose one if you like as there is an overlap). The beginning or introduction is his graduation exam. It is also the story of his classmates as they are drawn into something that will escalate into a far greater conflict and can change the world. It has political plots, power-struggles and the characters have much to endure or solve. The story itself is engaging and has some good twists but also some really bad ones. Same goes with concepts and ideas used in this game. Some are awesome and really interesting while others fail. It uses Guardian Forces (GF) a character can equip. These grant him/her powers like summoning them (You will do this very very often) access to abilities like draw (collect magic spells from enemies), use these as magic spells and link spells to stats to improve them, gain resistance or the spell effect at attacking. On paper this sounds interesting and it is so. However this has its limit. It takes forever to get the max number of spells especially early on and if you use linked spells you decrease your stats (Can later use an ability to transform some items into spells but it does not help much). The GF work well and level up, gaining new abilities and skills for you. There are some great combinations and later you can use items to forget and add new abilities. There are of cause some hidden once and you must draw some from enemies (boss battles) that can be missed. The GF are basically your only efficient method of dealing damage until you can raise your stats. Even the previous almighty Ultima spell is not that strong here. Also while I am at it. The game levels your enemies with your progress. You can actually get weaker by leveling up. If I would play the game again I would try to stay at the lowest possible level because linking spells to your stats gives a bigger bonus than leveling up in relation. You can do this with an ability that prevents random encounters and by transforming enemies into cards (Quetzalcoatl a GF you have at the beginning can learn it at the start of the game). An alternative would be to learn GF abilities that increase your stats at level up. I did this with 4 abilities onto a single character separately (Other party members were knocked out to not waste the level up bonus for them). While the later gives you huge advantages it is still weaker than a level 15 character with strong spells linked to the stats. Then there is a card game as side activity. I really enjoyed it and the struggle to get the best cards (GF and characters). However the rules can change from region to region and some are terrible. The random hand weakens you as your cards are chosen random and the plus rule destroys your numerical advantage but can also help you to humiliate much stronger opponents. Like I said the game is great but some ideas are not done well in all areas. Also you don't earn money through defeating enemies directly. You are an employee of Balamb Garden and get a salary. You can improve it by fighting many battles, tests or finishing some quests. I is difficult to stay at low level by avoiding fights and get a huge salary (decreases with no battles / too less fighting). While I am at it I give you some more advice. You get an item at graduation and should safe before you open it! Leveling up and linking abilities are critical as described above and I advice staying at a low level. Read a FAQ for missable content as some GF are missable. Use spells for linking that you do not use. Also you can increase the summoning damage by button pressing (Many overlooked this learnable feature). Back to the game. The graphics have improved drastically from the prequel and the soundtrack is great. I like the intro but must say that the âEyes on meâ song gets repetitive after a while. I will also warn you about the protagonist. He is somehow socially awkward and you will often be annoyed by his behavior. However I enjoy his and Rinoas story;-). Overall this is a great game that hits more than it misses. I can argue that for everything it did well it added also something bad. Not the best Final Fantasy and not the worst. Liked many ideas that were never used again in follow up games. Try it if you like but be warned.. Good ideas just poorly executed, great ost, decent cast with little development outside squall but the gameplay and story is lacking with a tedious equipment system using magic and even more time consuming is drawing from enemies. The story gets ridiculous by disk 2 and has plot holes. The main villain's backstory and motives behind her goals are also unknown.. Game of the year for 1999. Outstanding graphics and set pieces. Best soundtrack for the final fantasy series up to the psone era. Tons of locales and bosses. Love Squall.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I was too disinterested in the fighting mechanics to learn them enough. Eventually I learned that I should have been using the draw spell more. The card game was what kept me going for so long. But when I realized I missed an opportunity to get a legendary or rare card, I lost motivation to continue. There should be a card game only mode, where you can advance the story just by winning card games. then I'd give this game a 10.. Its hard to be a Final Fantasy game right after Final Fantasy 7. But 8 with all its weirdness and flawed junction system is still incredibly interesting rpg that stands on its own. Together with 9, these three are always a joy to boot, full of content and clever ideas.. Starts too slow. Junction system was a confusing mess. And even when understood, it was not nearly as fun as FF7's materia system, FF9's abilities system, or FF6's job system. And seriously: only 6 playable characters this time? Too few. And none really that interesting. Even if it was not sandwiched between two great games 7 and 9, FF8 would still come end up at the bottom of my trash.. Better than FF7 for me. It was a huge graphical leap and characters actually looked like real people which adds to the immersion unlike the LEGO figures from FF7. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. The eighth main instalment in the long running RPG series, Final Fantasy VIII follows a group of young mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time. Often compared unfavourably to Final Fantasy VII, which many would still consider the best in the series, this is a fantastic game in its own right. Anyone that isnât a fan of these old school JRPGs will still be put off by the usual random encounters but with itâs deep combat, epic story, endless secrets to discover and (what were at the time) fantastic graphics this remains one of the best in the genre to this day.. Most epic story in a videogame ever with a superb soundtrack to match. I played it some 19 yrs ago during Christmas holidays. This game pulled me into its world like no other before or after. Loved every moment.. Final Fantasy VIII is a great game ! Not as much as the previous one tough.. Square Enix recently announced Final Fantasy 8 Remastered. Good news, now new generations will have an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the most boring video game ever created on planet Earth. Aside from being a JRPG which is automatically puts score into 1-3 range, FF8 introduced a brand new Junction System, a revolutionary mechanic, that completely removed equipment system (goodbye exploration), made the game ridiculously imbalanced (easy), and introduced idiotic spell grinding. I could forgive failed attempt to bring something new to the table but the story (which is usually a strong suit of FFs) just make me say no. The most insipid, unnatural, unbelievable, unrelatable romance I have ever seen spiced with regular Japanese theme of friendship realized in the most generic way possible narrated through tremendous amount of âcutscenesâ you cannot skip. Indeed, if you suffer from insomnia FF8 is the game just for you: the amount of content that can easily put a player into deep slumber is tremendous.. My real rating is 9.5 This is one of my top final fantasy games. Unlike most players, I actually enjoyed the battle system A LOT. It looks bad and confusing at first, but once you understand how it works, it can become very fun and addictive, you even start looking forward to battles. The story is excellent, I really enjoyed it. The one thing that lowered the score for me (it could easily have been a 10) was the fact that the character development was a little bit lacking. The characters seem a little bit superficial sometimes, but nothing to cry over, really.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game was awesome back in the day, wish they would remake it with modern graphics and all vary entertaining I loved the story, the music, and for the day the graphics were really nice, and some of it even holds up today, mainly the cut-scenes, but I have fond memories of this game.. Not sure this one didn't do it for me, didn't care for the game very much back in the day, I did't care for the story or characters, but everything else was real decent, I can't give this one my seal of approval but most people enjoyed the game, and that's fine, I'm glad they did because they went on to make FF9, and I luv that game so much.. The first Final Fantasy i played. Together with VII and X they are the best games in the series atleast in my opinion. The Story is great. The graphics were revolutionary for the standards of 1999. The battle system is a bit complex and its probably the reason why not everyone likes this game as much as for example VII or X. But this game has so many things that compensates it. Like the minigame Trible Triad for example. If you are a Rpg fan this game is a must have in your collection.. This game has a great start and middle. The soundtrack, animations and expansive world that you can explore plus the triple triad card game makes this game and experience to be had, but is a shame that is has to be in company of a clunky story and weird drawing magic system.. Final Fantasy VIII had a lot to live up to when it came out. It came out of VIIâs path since VII is arguably the best in the series, in my opinion, how can it even stand up to it? It does that quite fine. The story is a bit of a mess. The first two discs are actually fantastic. Once the second disc ends, it goes from a rather realistic war story to something downright weird. This is Square weâre talking about so thatâs to be expected but the twists in the third disc are downright bizarre. Theyâre legitimate twists I wouldâve never seen coming. There are good twists and bad twists with this game and unfortunately, after the second Disc, theyâre worse than good. The game's ending will leave you confused and itâs not a bad ending, not at all but since the tone of the game changed so much after Disc 2, it keeps up with the overall oddness of the plot. What one thing the game does well is the characters. I enjoyed them. Theyâre an interesting bunch and while the protagonist seems brooding just to be broody he does improve. The development is some of the best Iâve seen in the series and they all are worthwhile. I loved the cast. The villains are also very good. Theyâre no Kefka, Caius, Kuja, Sin or Sephiroth but they gave the player motivation. The music is one of the best OSTâs of the series. Itâs really good. The sound effects are very well done as well. The gameplay, thatâs an interesting topic. Some loved it. Some hated it. Some like myself felt it had good and bad points. The gameplay focuses more on drawing magic from the enemies. There are of course other ways to get it, including refining items from a card mini-game but drawing is the easiest I found. This can lead you to spend 10 minutes in a battle getting your stock to 100 to increase your power level. Leveling doesnât really matter at all and enemies level with you. I found a good technique is to instead, combine a mix of refining with drawing a few spells here and there. It can be a huge pain if you want it to but it also gives the player flexibility. This system has drawbacks. Itâs tutorial after tutorial and coming from the excellent Esper and Materia systems before it makes it less than ideal. Itâs not the worst in the series but it is executed badly and couldâve been explained more. Also, the magic cap at drawing is pretty low. If it wouldâve been increased the more you leveled, it wouldâve made it more accessible. While I liked VII and IX more itâs not a bad RPG or a Final Fantasy game. It wonât be for everyone but if youâre open to trying something new, something more modern and that takes risks with its gameplay and story, give it a shot. Youâll probably find a lot to enjoy.. This game is amazing and I love it to bits and is a worthy successor to FF 7. Legendary game, play it, this game changed my life for good, all I have for this game is LOVE.. The junction system is masterpiece i love it! The only bad thing about this game is the poor character writing most of the characters don't have enough screen time, it's only Squall and Rinoa. it has the final dungeon of all FF series.. (N) i like the concept of GF but It is rare that you are the only one who looks for them and finds only squall and d witches have a good design I dont like dat enemies hav infinite magic infinite enemies takes away realism too easy u cant skip summons cutscenes wixth its make d batles anoying(even in his time) nd d summons make a ridiculous damage as in all FFs contradictions nd lame quests (+) step counter every 100 hours change the color of time gunblade absurd and cool at the same time music ,art, color palette limits are more interactive. I recognize that my favorite Final Fantasy's are from the VII, VIII, IX and X, but among t","the cast in this epic are the most endearing and fully realized characters that you may ever have the pleasure of coming across . the story is rather generic imo, it has some nice moments but is very 90s and dramatic at times . the card game is incredibly fun and the combat is quirky and has some great game-breaking options ."
367.NBA 2K12,"The last time I watched an entire professional basketball game was during the Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Malone/Stockton era. The last time I owned a basketball video game was NBA Jam for my Super Nintendo. Simply put, I'm just a baseball/football guy. Last week, however, my brother brought home this game and wanted to play a few games. I obliged, and quite surprisingly was **** in from the opening tip-off of that first game. Though I can't comment on the ""frills"" of this game (career mode, practice, etc.) as I will never use them, I have now played dozens of exhibitions against friends and have immensely enjoyed the experience. The biggest reason? The control scheme is very well designed (the key structure of any successful sports video game franchise). The controls are simple enough for beginners, yet ""deep"" enough for the seasoned vet to perfect his/her game. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised by this game and foresee more hours of fun with it in the future. Wheres 2K Sports have fallen way behind the curve in their baseball franchise, they are the ""industry leader"" in this NBA fare and I hope they continue into the future. Even if you aren't a ""baller"" you can still have fun with this one.. Nba 2k12 manages to prove that not only it can improve upon its predecessor, but it shows that this is the best version of basketball simulation to date. The presentation is improved significantly from 2k11, as I would sometimes mistake it for a real game on Tuesday night. The players animate better, and I found the controls easier to come into wit the new shot stick mechanic. What I remember most though, it the new My Player mode, which easily trumps 2k11's version. All in all, 2k12 proves that anyone can enjoy basketball. (probably not).. Decent basketball game. Playing as ""the Greats!"" is really fun. But the A.I... The A.I..... Is so stupid. UNLESS you're playing against the A.I, and the difficulty is above Pro. In MyPlayer (and in normal games a bit) there is a MAJOR balancing issue. If you have the game on All-Star, i feel like it only turns up the skill of the opposing team, NOT your teammates. ""But brobeans, they did that because then YOU have to lead the team."" Ok, i sorta understand that, but when you start out with a FRICKN 60 OVERALL YOU CANNOT LEAD YOUR TEAM!!!!!!! And because you start out with a low overall, it's fun to move up each game, as you get to watch him progress. But in 2k12.. When there are terrible, and i mean AWFUL balancing issues, that's REALLY HARD to do. I don't ""Hate Decent basketball game. Playing as ""the Greats!"" is really fun. But the A.I... The A.I..... Is so stupid. UNLESS you're playing against the A.I, and the difficulty is above Pro. In MyPlayer (and in normal games a bit) there is a MAJOR balancing issue. If you have the game on All-Star, i feel like it only turns up the skill of the opposing team, NOT your teammates. ""But brobeans, they did that because then YOU have to lead the team."" Ok, i sorta understand that, but when you start out with a FRICKN 60 OVERALL YOU CANNOT LEAD YOUR TEAM!!!!!!! And because you start out with a low overall, it's fun to move up each game, as you get to watch him progress. But in 2k12.. When there are terrible, and i mean AWFUL balancing issues, that's REALLY HARD to do. I don't ""Hate the game"". As i said, it is fun playing as the greats. But because of the MyTeam/MyPlayer ****, it really takes away from the game, and adds frustration to you. Now for my rating, i really am trying to be optimistic about the score, with giving it a 7/10. The graphics are good, atleast, compared to past games, the animations are alright, not to much changed, the only change from 2k11 animations to 2k12 animations is the fact that in 2k12 when they move it isn't as stiff. I do not recommend this game, when theirs other, better 2K games out there (2k13, 2k11, etc), i just hope that this is will all be fixed for the later 2k games. That is all! I must go now... *swoosh*. It is overall a good game, I just feel NBA 2k12 is missing something and just is not as good as NBA 2k11. There are some improvements as compared to the previous installment but I just did not enjoy this as much as 2k11. That aside though, 2k12 is still a great game. This game is really good for a couple reasons: 1) the character animations are fantastic and so is the presentation of the game 2) Teams play differently and you can recognize it 3) Playing games throughout history and learning from it is lots of fun 4) Players have unique skill sets and playing in the post is entertaining. This game also has some real issues to work out: 1) Momentum in the game is really overpowering. If your opponent has hit a few shots in a row you will NOT make an open jumper, lay-up, etc. If your quarter starts and your down 8-0 its gonna get worse. 2) Players generally miss open shots if you shoot too early in the shot clock; your punished for uptempo style 3) In Association mode, computer GM's make awful trades and sign free agents that make little sense. Teams will overstack with 3 starting point guards and pay not attention to their power forward. One team in particular had Kyrie Irving, drafted a top 5 point guard, and then signed Chris Paul in free agency.... Needless to say after a few years the league gets pretty whacky. 4) Drafting is a crapshoot. Unless you have a top 3 pick dont even bother. The system is shallow in that an overhyped prospect doesn't bust and you never find diamonds in the rough in later rounds. You also have no sense of your prospects game so the first couple years is a trial and error of shots, drives, and fails. The Graphics, Presentation, and general gameplay alone makes this game a 9.5 The flawed Association mode and now dead Online mode makes this game a 5 I'll go 7 in the middle.. Do you enjoy constantly missing layups? How about watching the league's best sharpshooters go completely cold and lose the ability to hit wide open three point shots? Would you like to see your defensive efforts end up all for naught as the computer makes all sorts of contested shots and layups at will? Then this is the game for you! Let's start off with something positive, shall we? 2k12 has great gameplay flow. The normal ups and downs in real NBA basketball games take place in every game you play; no team stays hot forever. From here, though, everything goes downhill. First off, we might as well start with the most annoying flaw in NBA 2k12: missing layups. In my association mode, Roy Hibbert consistently bricks layups and gets blocked by point guards, for example, Monta Ellis. I don't care how passive he is in real life, he's 7'2"". If it's difficult to make a layup with someone that tall, you can only imagine the frustration trying to make layups with your point guard. While the cpu easily runs past anyone you have defending the paint to make a flawless, uncontested layup (regardless of your generous use of the Y button), you have to deal with getting hacked, not going to the free throw line, and missing layups. Secondly, the large stretches in the game where you suddenly find your best shooters forgot how to shoot the basketball. While every team gets cold now and then, it can get quite ridiculous in 2k. I really don't know who has fun when their collective team of sharpshooters(for me, Jrue Holiday, Nicolas Batum, James harden, Josh Smith) seemingly lose any shooting skill they ever had. Thirdly, the player A.I. I think we can all agree that your team's player A.I. in 2k11 was completely stupid. While it is slightly better in 2k12, you will realize very quickly how much smarter the cpu players play than your own. For instance, when playing against a team that, say, has Dirk Nowitzki and Andrea Bargnani in the game(Yes, this is from my own experience once again). These are two big men you do not find in the paint very often. Yet, if you try to slash your way to the basket, or box out on the cpu's miss, you'll find these guys run to the paint quicker than Usain Bolt. In comparison, you will find that your boneheaded big men will follow players such as Jason Maxiell all the way out to the 3-point line and stand there without any thought as to who may be slashing into the paint. They do not find their way back there on misses, either, as you find your guards fighting for the rebounds with the other team's bigs quite often(Jrue Holiday and James Harden lead me team in rebounds many times that I play. Should I reiterate that Roy Hibbert is 7'2""?). Even with all the moments I find to be furious at this freaking game, though, I still find myself addicted to it. Because, when at its best or, to put more truthfully, when the cpu decides to give you an illusion of fair play I do find myself enjoying the game. To keep a game close based on both teams making legitimate shots, and not on one team making any contested shot they want while you have to work the ball around to find someone wide open every time, is fun. To have your team on a roll and firing on all cylinders is very rewarding. To create your own super team and make them a powerful franchise brings a feeling you can't find with any other game. So, if you love basketball like me, and can't contain yourself, welcome to Clank City. If you know what's good for you, then you should probably play something that is actually fun. Chao!. Great and awesome game with wonderful features. My favorite one is the updates on trades and actual games in the season. A usual good game part of the 2k series.. The best sports game out there. Its better than Madden and I really don't know if its better than FIFA but NBA 2K12 improves on everything 2K11 does and does it even better. 2K is now the king of basketball games.. This game is really good if you like sports and if you don't. The graphics need a little work though. And the price is a little high. You should really get this game. I don't care how.. Outstanding job by 2k, great updated graphics, new 2k share is awesome, great menu, great gameplay, great commentary, and all of the above. One of the best sports games ive ever played.. This game is horrible when playing with friends. It trys to be more realistic, but it ends up setting up instances that make no sense. People glitch to the basket. Baskets are made but not counted. The home team somehow always has an advantage. This game is 20x more frustrating at just not as fun as the last.. I bought this game for PC and have played the Xbox360 version, both platforms played pretty much the same, HORRIBLE. To state that NBA 2k11 was a little better is an understatement. This game has so many flaws compared to their '11 predecessor I don't know where to begin. I mainly play My Player, beginning with that I'll say that stats mean absolutely nothing, Speed, Shooting stats, feels like my guy is running on ice on the court. And shot selection? I've taken wide open mid-range and 3pt shots with A to A+ and have consistently missed, throughout an entire game, for multiple games, and I have 99 consistency!!! I'll just wrap this up by stating that I bought this on Steam for $14.99US, and I think I paid too much, get NBA 2k11 if you are on the fence on this one. Most of the reviews online, with the exception of Youtube, seem extremely contrived or made up. Blaming the lockout for poor sales due to improper roster build or lack of rookies doesn't make up for extremely poor execution of gameplay and piss poor mechanics. You've been warned.... This game is fun if your not playing against the AI because thats when it falls apart,the opposing team makes damn near every shot and you dont. But when your playing against a real person its really fun and hard to put down because its more even.. Horrible game glitches in game play and even at log in. I have to log in every time I start the game up for online play. 2k would never do anything to update and fix these glitches, just like the fact that this game hasn't changed at all from the last one besides Jordan's pose on the cover. Slow glitchy play throughout game. The computer is really annoying and cheats to win at the end of the game. I don't understand how anyone would enjoy that. Please bring back NBA Live so smoooooth. Oh and you would have to take a class to understand how to do moves in 2k. I can't believe Jordan would put his name on this. I give them a 3 for an unfinished product. I'll never buy a 2k product again.. I play the NBA 2K series every year, I usually love the new games right away but I had a harder time falling in love with this game. That could be due to the lockout and not having the updated rosters, but even after all that was settled, it still took me a while. I guess I was used to certain things that made the game a bit easier to play. The fact that there was a button to use the hopstep made things easier for me, as well as having the pick and roll in the playbook also made the game easier. They certainly made the AI (not Allen Iverson) a lot smarter, much better on the defensive end. The games biggest flaw is having players hit open shots 100% of the time. It doesn't make sense, if you watch NBA games, you clearly see that because the player is wide open, doesn't mean he is going to knock down the shot all the time. Another thing I didn't like was player tendencies. For example, Tyson Chandler doesn't take jump shots. He's a low post guy. Why is it that i've seen him take more jump shots than down low hooks and lay ups? On the positive side, My Player mode is tremendous, I love what they've done with it, as well as the Creating a Legend mode. Both of those modes alone will consume a lot of time and are extremely worth it. Also, I love the NBAs greatest mode, being able to play as the legends and have it look like you're watching them from back in the day is awesome. I wish other sports games would take after NBA 2K12 in that sense.. Beside fifa, 2k12 is leading the way for sports games. The thing I like most about nba 2k12 is that it takes a lot of practice to actually get decent. So in the end you really do know who is better at the game and who needs practice.. Best NBA game ever made for you basketball SIMULATION style players, and still great for casual gamers as well. The graphics are truly adjusted from 2k11, the players look more realistic (facial textures especially), as well as the physics engine and collision detection markedly being improved to a point where the game sometimes flows like a real NBA game. On my 27"" 120hz 1080p LCD-TV on broadcast camera the game almost looks photorealistic next to a live NBA game on a 50'' TV. The gameplay is quite improved. No more cheesing non-stop; you have to actually play smart basketball rather than isolate, crossover, spin and dunk at the rim. They've really adjusted the passing in the game, much needed from 2k11's ""passes and alley-oops are 99% successful"", and while it's tough to begin (post passing is tough) it makes for a much more realistic experience. Good passers like Kidd or Nash still dish it out like stars, but no longer does a mediocre forward never throw it away. It's a great change that almost requires you to slow the pace down of the game. My Player has been improved with more goals, better interviews, a better draft process (1 game, interviews from teams and draft). Start rated around a 60 (2k11 you were a 40... bench players in NBA2k'any-year are always 50-60 ratings, so it makes sense. Player attributes as well as tendencies, and earn your paycheck to pay for a camp or team dinner or buy a dunk package of a certain player. Also ""Play Next Key Game"" is a great addition that helps it flow better. With the added ""Hall of Fame"" progress, there are goals to play more than a year or two and My Player has been improved drastically. The old rosters are great as well. There are 15 Classic challenges ranging from Wilt's Lakers and Pistol Pete's rookie season Hawks to the 01-02 Kings (Webber, Peja) with tons of teams in between (like 5 Bulls teams; 96-97 Lakers w/young Kobe), classic 90's Blazers, Magic w/PennyShaq, Utah, Houston, and so on. Of each 15 classics, a star player is the logo, with explanation; ex: John Stockton leads the 97-98 Jazz playoff game over the Lakers. Each time you can win one of these challenges you unlock the teams (team played as and against). I love this, as I've gotten all the teams, 30 (but multiple Bulls), so I created an Association with 20 classic teams and the best 10 teams in the NBA currently (with some stars added to 10 teams in league). Great fun! So many game modes, even Practice is great, as well as ""Training Camp"" which shows off the new controls and amazing POST MOVES. They have revamped it to where defense is key, but having an inside post-game is key as well, giving you individual and unique moves in the post, with a large array. The game is played flawlessly when played correctly. Online versus games are solid and not bad in terms of lag. Players are ok, some are cheesers (harder to cheese now though, I beat most with charges and slowing it up), but overall solid versus. But after that I don't understand what 2k was thinking. 2k11's best mode was CREWS, being able to add friends to a team/crew you created and playing others in ranked games 5 on 5. They've completely taken out crewmode, which allowed you to use your My Player you have created over time... which seems the whole point. Hell, can't even use your Player online AT ALL, not even a pickup game. As for the pickup games online, they are mediocre at best. The lag is quite bad, the matchmaking is weak, the amount of disconnects is huge, and you can't use your my player. Get some friends together and start a team up and hope you're put on the same team is your best bet.... stats kept are quite bad because of the servers. 2k please FIX your servers for next year and add crews. This game is nearly flawless but as an offline game. Deserves a 10/10 but the online matchmaking is weak and there are NO CREWS and My Player is improved, yet you can never use him online in a game with others.. The look of the game is great, they definitely did their homework on presentation. Now with that being said, if you can stand a game that plays robotic (to the point where your players feel like they are lagging online, but you are playing an offline game), an online league that you can't control, multiplayer vs mode (2 on 2, 3 on 3.. etc.) that you can't change between players, doesnt have a blacktop online mode, takes 5 minutes to synchronize the rosters and save your game data every so often when you are playing, and restricted online gameplay. Then this game is for you. If you are like me and you wish for a more smooth flowing game, with more control of the product you own. You will email and plead to EA to get back into the NBA market.. Awesome, But really doesn't do much more than 2k11, I realize this a sports game so that comes with the territory, I personally hardly notice a difference from 11 to 12. I don't think its worthy of all the praise heaped upon it. Multiplayer is Lagged out to the Max also, which should have been fixed from last year. If you like Ball, you will enjoy this, especially if you haven't played a basketball game in years. It is the NBA Live Killer after all.. this is a good game. they just need to fix the in player mode. it freezes way to much! also thought that they would fix the lag issue online. same graphics as 2k11, which were pretty good. just dont like the freezing issues. not worth 60 bucks right now but if they fixed those issues it would definitely be worth the money. To say this game does everything right would be an understatement. It improves on NBA2K 11 in every single way. Best basketball game of all time. Until next year.. Just amazing. 2K Sports did it again delivering an NBA game in for the long haul. The new interface is easier to move around and the new character design is great. The new physics for the game took a while for me to get used to but it delivered an even playing field for all teams. Being able to play as all the greatest players who has set foot on a basketball court made me rethink about MJ being the best Basketball player of all time. Plus the old TV effects are perfect. Not distracting but still feels like your playing a game in the 1960's. This game is worth a buy for all NBA fans but i discourage buying it now since the NBA is in lockout and there are no roster updates etc. But hell, its still great and i think its worth every penny.. Being a die-hard nba 2k fan (i own and have played every 2k since 2k3) I have to say for the all GREAT and amazing strides 2k11 made last year (on top of finally killing off the terrible nba live series) this game took the madden approach this year in my opinion but the one thing that I know has hurt the way the game plays this year is the lack of an NBA season and no living roster updates because those are basically the glitch patches that games like WoW see. The most surprising as well as upsetting thing to me this year is the lack of decent player ratings this year. So your telling me that the nba's players as a whole average around below adequate while there are about 4-8 superstars and the second coming of jesus is Lebron James? Its just entirely not fair to anyone that plays against the heat just about, lebron is unstoppable and faster than Rajon Rondo with an unstoppable midrange jumper. The worst thing about the game this year is all it takes is one of the NBA's super elite allstars and your set you don't even need 4 other people on the floor because they will dunk, and shoot over 5 guys whenever you want. The 2k series in my opinion needs to make a return to strong team-based play and not focusing on one unstoppable all-star (i put up 59 points with lebron in a half with 8 minute quarters and 40+ with KD in a half as well). Its impossible to go to the basket with anyone under 6""7 because just about everything gets blocked now its as if nba players don't know what a high arching layup is or a teardrop even some of the most elusive drivers in the nba today (tony parker, rajon rondo among others) cant get to the basket for nothing and pumpfaking before going up with those guys is a deathwish as well under the basket. The pure midrange scorers are also irrelevant now as well (paul pierce, kobe bryant) because getting to the basket after a good pumpfake or their trademark turnarounds aren't a quarter as effective as they really are. Also the last issue I have with the game is the TERRIBLE teammate A.I. it feels like im playing 5th grade basketball all they do is stand there and stare and sometimes cut and the passing is at a 5th grade level as well at times while the A.I. just ballhawks more than ever like its psychic, players throw the ball directly into teammates and opponents backs or they make a terrible chest pass when a bounce pass or a wrap around pass is a much better choice. I thought these were NBA players not 5th and 6th graders playing aau for the first time. But the game also made some positive stride like the redesign of the shotstick is so intuitive now but its all for one on one scoring and even though thats what the nba is all about now the games physics just aren't at a level where it can accurately mimic the speed and precision of the real players yet and when you attempt to fall back on good ball rotation and shot selection its impossible to get an open shot because no one moves and there arent even any off ball screens unless you call a play and the lane just clutters when you go to the basket and if your not lebron or KD or josh smith or anyone else with like a 99 dunk and 99 layup and 99 shoot in traffic your going to get your shot blocked or thrown at the bottom of the rim more times than your even going to get a decent attempt at the rim (not even a make). Its still a very solid title and the lack of an nba season this year hurts the balancing of teams and players but there still is no reason the game should have taken some of the slides backwards it did this year. And 2k has to realize that nba teams, college teams, highschool teams, and AAU teams dont just run set plays everytime down the floor they run offenses with certain rotation schemes, with about 5-8 set plays and a couple a quick hitters for coming down the floor when 2k realizes this and stops feeding into how the average fan sees basketball and starts to really model the game after the way it is really played at the top competetive level thats when we will see a perfect basketball simulation until then I always hold hope for next year.. Don't buy this game. this game cheats as hell, last game I did I lost for actual cpu cheating. In the 3rd quarter, most of the shots (unguarded) were missed by my team, and the other team recovered and won the game hitting incredible shots (not mentioning the unrealistic mass of turnovers I always get in every single game). I will re-sell this **** out. I'm creating a 3pt specialized pg, I've been able to make it a very good player even in rookie season because I get good scores every game. But it frustrates you with stupid and unrealistic ingame glitches that make you almost throw away the pad. Only one word: crap 5/10. Its a fun game but its just a carbon with some new features and those new features have ruined a lot of the fun in the game for me and many other gamer's.. Thd best sports game i have ever played! I am not even that big a fan of basketball, I bought mostly because of the legend teams. This game is nothing short of amazing. Bfrom the graphics, to the calling of the game.....nothing else comes close.. The lockout does not hold this title back. 2K improved on their NBA franchise in every way this year, from details like getting every player's tattoos true to life, to the big picture like post-move mechanics, overall presentation, and general smoothness of play, nothing, and I mean NOTHING is worse than 2K11. Given that NBA 2K11 was the greatest sports game ever created during its reign, there's no reason to deny this iteration the mantle.. This game sets the standard for all other sports titles. I only wish this exact development team could make a football title. They know how to bring TV to sports games.. this is the best basketball game i have ever played. the myplayer mode is alot of fun and the number of historic teams and players means hours of fun.. This game made my life change (I'm being sarcastic). The game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a basketball game. The graphics are extremely accurate and the gameplay feels amazing. Enough said. Go get this game NOW!!!. This game gets everything right, other than online multiplayer. That part of it is sloppy, laggy, unintuitive, and just generally needs work. Also, in my player mode your character will talk as if he is African American, no matter what.. The NBA 2k series has come a long way since the first but lately it has been lacking something new. Right off the bat looking at the visuals I wasn't impressed they looked exactly like those of 2k11 nothing new there. Going on to the My Player experience it has improved even more than the previous two versions which is what was expected but I have to say it exceed my expectations. Now for the basketball experience the game excels like it should but some things are still missing. After playing it I notice that 2k games goes with a premium and standard lay out (like how Polyphony did with their cars in Gran Turismo) for player although they don't say it you can notice it and what I mean by it is the difference between the star in the NBA and the players who aren't stars. When you are using some like Kobe Bryant or Dirk Nowitski every thing is correct for these players such as their jumpers and their signature layups ext. But when using a non superstar 2k games has a number of generic moves and will give a player the one that looks the closest to theirs which takes away from the realism. But overall it is still a great game but I only wish some other things where added to the game such as having the correct voices for the PA announcers for the correct court and having a variety of commentators like Reggie Miller or Jeff Van Gundy. So I'm giving it an 8.5 its a great game but some bigger improvements can be made to it.. Most definitely the best sports game I have ever played. The ONE, single problem is the lack of quality 2K servers. Game-after-game their servers have underperformed. Anyways, I recommend this to anyone who plays sports video games.. Horrible, and I love 2K11. Sold this within a week. Glitches galore and removed My Crew (ironically because of glitches that ""ruined"" the mode). Glitches didn't stop them from removing most of the other modes.. After last year's version i could not wait to get my hands on 2K12. i had no doubts that even though I did not write a letter that 2K would have focus groups, research committees, etc. look in to exactly what was great about the game and what needed to be improved. It's very frustrating as a longtime gamer to constantly see the most OBVIOUS flaws in games and not be able to get it changed. It seems to me the main improvement was making the game prettier and they succeeded. It LOOKS unbelievable but at the end of the day a true gamer wants the game to FEEL unbelievable. I'll skip to my biggest beef before this gets too long. ONLINE PLAY! How can this year's version actually be worse than last year's? The servers are so slow. Getting in to a game is terrible. Stat tracking is terrible. Quitters continue to get in to games with me even though I will sit thru an entire team-up game without ever getting the ball just because i don't quit. i will play defense, crash the boards, etc. Of course that is only if I actually get in to a game. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put a little money in to improving the online experience. Team-Up in hoops is better to me than team deathmatch in halo, cod, etc. because i'm a huge sports fan and hoops is the one sport where teaming up can actually work but not if it's done only halfway by the developer. Last year it was so close but so frustrating because my friends and I could never get in to a game together or if we did our opponents all quit immediately because their friends didn't get in, etc. I was soooo sure this was the year it was going to be smooth and a blast!!! not the case. sadly it's just as frustrating. i still give this game an 8 but it's a low 8 because I had expecations of this being a perfect 10.. Perfection,amazement just downright fun.I just got done playing multiple games online and it was like I was controlling a real game on the **** offline let me get started by saying that I don't want to get into everything because everything is perfect.I can't find one thing wrong with this title.I mean come on the commentary is better then any game I have ever watched in the past on TV.I played basketball for several years and this is the first time that I feel like I'm 15 years younger and I'm playing **** me just say this,after playing this game put in NBA Live 10,09,NBA 2k9.2K10.There obsolete,that's how good this **** has done a good job with there hockey and soccer,Sony has done an amazing job with there Baseball but nothing and I mean nothing can compare with the brilliance of this game.. This game is great. First off, I want to say that this is the best NBA 2K game yet. All that you loved from last years masterpiece 2K11 is now enhanced in this. I'll keep my review short. Presentation/Graphics The presentation is awesome. The intros are a neat touch and give that TV feel. You won't get the same intro all the time. Different lineup screens also are nice. The graphics are also good. In my opinion the faces are good. Not all are accurate but it is a step up from last year. Kobe Bryant doesn't look like an alien anymore and Andrew Bynum looks like...Andrew Bynum. There are some faces here and there but the all look better than 2K11's ","""nba 2k12"" proves that anyone can enjoy basketball . the controls are simple enough for beginners, yet ""deep"" enough for the seasoned vet . the presentation is improved significantly from 2k11, as i would sometimes mistake it for a real game ."
368.Beetle Adventure Racing,"I don't really a 90s fan, but the game was quite good tbh, but the problem is the tracks being too long but it's too fast to finish the game just only up to 2 hours of walkthrough.. A halfway house between motorsport driving games like Ridge Racer and Kart-style racing with power ups and secret short cuts. More a pleasant Sunday afternoon drive than edge-of-the-seat thrill ride, but certainly one of the better racing games on the N64.. This game is a masterpiece for its time. Like the name says, it is an adventure. Plenty of hidden secrets and paths/shortcuts, offering risk/time rewards. The circuits have long laps, riddled with creative, interesting and interactive content. This is an amazing game to try and beat your own best score or compete with friends. I like how you can spin in mid-air, and that the last lap has a different path for the finish line. I kind of wish there would be a remake or sequel with online high score and races. The only downside is the low variety of cars and maps, but they make up with all the creativity and enchanting world. I highly recommend this game!","this game is a masterpiece for its time . plenty of hidden secrets and paths/shortcuts, offering risk/time rewards . the circuits have long laps, riddled with creative, interesting and interactive content ."
369.Command & Conquer: Red Alert,"Another fantastic strategy game I understand the hype of the franchise it holds merit deserves a positive review. One of the games that established tha basics for the RTS genre. Big game full of fun. This was so much fun. One of the best RTS ever. The graphics are nice, the mechanics are on point. What else do you want?. Almost perfect game with a perfect soundtrack. For me the sequel Red Alert takes 10/10!. The nostalgic feeling I get form thinking about this RTS trend setter for so many games. Made me start getting into the genre I will never leave. Just epic.. Red Alert was my favorite game as a child. I spent hundreds of hours playing the campaign, skirmish missions and multiplayer on 56k internet. Revisiting was a big nostalgia trip for me and also interesting to see how it compares to the original Command & Conquer after all these years. Letâs start with the music. Hell March is one of the best video game songs ever, if not the best. The entire soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece, puts you in mood and is a great fit for the fast-paced gameplay of Red Alert. The story is a cheesy alternative history. Einstein invented a time machine and made sure Adolf **** doesnât come to the world stage. This, however, makes Stalin rise as the absolute power in WWII. There are unforgettable characters from Tanya to Nadia, and more importantly Kane (I had erased from my memory that Kane appears in Red Alert. Without spoiling anything, let me just say it was a pleasant surprise). The cinematics have always been a strength of Command & Conquer series and Red Alert doesnât disappoint. I especially enjoyed the ones with Tanya. Gameplay is enhanced in some ways. The two factions (Allies and Soviet) are more distinct from each other in comparison to GDI and NOD of C&C. There are many units which are exclusive to a faction. While Soviet appear to be impenetrable with their Tesla Coil and Mammoth Tank, Allies have the naval artillery Cruiser which are the most powerful firepower of the entire game, as long as you have access to water. There are some serious AI issues in the campaign. You will often see your harvesters or submarines getting stuck. This one I remember from the original game. But there are also problems with the enemy AI, where the enemy stops responding to you efficiently as soon as you destroy some harvesters or power plants. I am not sure if this comes from the original game or if it is a problem with the remaster. In most aspects, Red Alert is better than its prequel Command & Conquer. It offers more options for strategy with the wider range of units. But in terms of offering a good campaign challenge in medium difficulty, Red Alert pales in comparison to C&C. The enemy in C&C is smarter. Again, this may be an issue with the remaster but not the original game. I am not sure. 9.5/10. Game is Good , But I don't like it. , Become I confused this gameplay , It doing I frustrated and I don't like it , But you may like games Become It's best game for you but not me.. The funniest and best RTS in the history of computer games! For 1996, it was a breakthrough, nothing like this had ever happened before!. I liked this one mostly for its style and setting, but its the same game as the original, with new paint, music score and balance nuances.. Same as C&C previous game with different setting. Story is great - for each side different. Easily can be played to this date :). Despite this game being over 20 years old, no RTS has surpassed this games greatness. Starcraft and Xcom were great but sorry Boi, you're no Red Alert. In this game you must be able to withstand infantry, tanks, planes, ships, Tesla and the dreaded engineer rush but if you keep your cool, keep your Dr Pepper close and have your Jacks Pizza cooking you should be alright. I have played many years of RA and have been ranked number 1 on Westwood Chat. I was also highly ranked in Team matches with my life partner Bfb in Kali. I destroyed people in regular or money maps. The only time I would have trouble would be from the terrifying engineer rush. Still to this day I have nightmares of a transport ship pulling up to my base in A Path Beyond only to see my APV and Sm Power Plant in enemy hands, and than before I know it a barracks is made with gunners slowly coming **** can still be hard for me to talk about. Honesty, this is the greatest real time strategy ever created and I think about it hourly if not more. In Denmark (where I am from) people come up to me and say ""Hey Nike1(my RA Gamer Tag) please tell me a great Red Alert story. Most people want to hear about when I out ""Q""ed 14 heavy tanks with 5 light tanks and a Tanya but I prefer to talk about my exploits on TEN(Total Entertainment Network) There I wrote the book on money game strategy and believe that I could that I could team with any run of the mill Tom, **** or Harry and take on any top team today, but hey, maybe that is me just getting nostalgic about my glory days, but its hard to forget because in Denmark, if you were a C&C legend you're basically a celebrity. I remember once our national paper, the Weekendavisen, did a top ten of the most searched celebrities on Google and I, Nike1, was number 7 right ahead of Lebron James so at least there is that. Anyway, you all should play Red Alert or even C&C the original. It is truly a great game if you're an RTS fan.. It's not that I really liked that game, but I tried it not at its time and didn't played for a long time, so can be more subjectively to graphic and game-play levels. In general I remember that it was very good classic RTS for many people with interesting story, so I decided not to brake rating to that game, so it will be average.. Although set in a different time period very similar gameplay to the first command and conquer. Story is just ok.. classic rts that i still play it sometimes even now in 2019 and for years to come sadly the game stopped at red alert 3. Mission **** first English sentence I learned from video **** also, this is the game that symbolize my **** other games can take its place... Even though this review is not coming from a strategy type of player, this is a 10. The only strategy game I ever completed in full. Back at the time it was an amazing game not only because of the campaign mission development, but also because of the very entertaining local multiplayer it offered. Had a great time with this game back in the Pentium PC days.. A sequel to Command & Conquer which added many special units and reshuffled the factions balance. The missions were more varied, and the hilarious presentation of the war-crazy Stalin on Kane's place was much welcome. Since recently the game was made freeware (!), and you can download and play it for free, in multiplayer. There are always open games available, on average I spend 1-2 minutes waiting in the lobby. Fans have made sure that it works on any monitor size, and on my 1920x1080 monitor the huge overview of the battlefield is simply amazing. RA is somewhat unbalanced, with the Soviets appearing superior in almost all types of units (infantly, vehicles, airplanes, defense towers) to the Allies, at least for novice players. Just google for ""Red Alert 1 Online"" to grab a free version.. Real Time Strategy, son! Is no joke! This was not as revolutionary as many other titles of the same year, yet it took Command and Conquer to all new levels, with improvements in almost every area. And although i like both games, i prefer Red Alert to C&C. Tesla Coils, son! Whaaaaa!!! :D zzzzzAP!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An absolute classic that I still play sometimes even today. This game improves upon Command and Conquer in almost every possible way. The campaign missions are great, the music is superb and the differences between the 2 sides is good enough to create a vastly experience based on the side you chose. The game's cut scenes are also great and the acting (especially of Stalin makes for a good laugh. Even after all these years, there are still players to be found online for multiplayer matches courtesy of CNC Net. The game is also free to download now so if you haven't played it, downloading it is a must! Recommended!. To be honest I preferred Red Alert to Command & Conquer. Better story, units are more fun and varied, and overall gameplay is just more entertaining. Overall: The Red Alert universe, in my opinion, is far more entertaining. It is more or less the same as Command & Conquer, just better.. A real epic classic with two great tense and thrilling campaigns and an excellent story lines C&C Red Alert is the best RTS for both the PC and PS1 during the 90's. Mission **** first English sentence I learned from video **** also, this is the game that symbolize my **** other games can take its place... This game took what was great about the first C&C and made it better. The gameplay is fairly similar, but it adds some new dimensions such as mines, naval units, and multiple super-weapons. I personally liked the addition of more air units--the original C&C had only 2 per side--which allow for quick responses to enemy action. I found the story and characters to be less compelling than the first C&C, but good nonetheless, and the alternate-history WWII makes for a cool alternate story in the C&C universe.. Managed to life up to its high expectations even if it played in a kind of different universe from C&C1. Singleplayer campaign, soundtrack and general gameplay were very good. Multiplayer not so much.. Westwood's best RTS game and still the best C&C game to date. The music, sounds, characters and gameplay are all great hits to this awesome war game, but some unbalanced and AI issues remain.. One of the better games from back in the day. Very interesting concept, and sometimes truly challenging to play. Definitely had a lot of fun playing it. Really enjoyed the cheesy intro videos for every chapter! Defs a great way to spend your time!","the soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece, puts you in mood and is a great fit for the fast-paced gameplay of Red Alert . the two factions (allies and Soviet) are more distinct from each other in comparison to GDI and NOD of C&C . there are some serious AI issues in the campaign ."
37.Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,"My all time favorite game. I just love Vice City so much Big open world cool 80's atmosphere and beautiful songs. 10/10. One of the greatest video games ever made. This is hands down one of the most ahead of the time game. Pure nostalgia and classic. Wish devs made more games like this these days.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. GTA Vice City is a masterpiece of gaming, that improved on GTA 3 in every aspect.. Just an absolute masterpiece, i dont have anything more to say about this game just that if you haven't played it **** IT!!! no regret in it i assure you. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this is the captain america the winter soldier of open world games. goated soundtrack btw.. Not my best GTA, such an average. Maybe too small town and for no reason too long âstoryâ (second part of the game is boring asf). Were some great memorable missions, nothing more.. I lost my mind when i first play it as child. Legendary game. 10/10 gameplay 10/10 graphics 10/10 story 10/10 environments. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such a good game. deserved a proper remake instead of that definitive edition trash. I have an undeniable love for this part, the vibes of the 80s, the map, the radios a banger!. This game is absolutely amazing. Vice City has very good graphics. The PS2 version is better than the PC version.. This PS2 classic expands and improves upon GTA III in every way. More than just an update, it truly captures the look and feel of 80's American pop culture. The massive pop/rock soundtrack is perhaps the best ever compiled for a video game. ""Vice City"" pulls much inspiration from ""Scarface"" and ""Miami Vice"". And the late Ray Liotta gives a performance that pays homage to his own ""Goodfellas"" character. Overall, this is a masterpiece. I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. Miami Vice meets Scarface, & I'm here for it!! Larger terrain, more mechanics & additional dynamics, & even more entertaining characters. This was a fantastic way to follow up such a great predecessor.. I think GTA truly finds itself with this game. GTA 2 is a good game in its own way. GTA 3 makes a revolutionary start, but it's a bit weak. But Vice City puts it above all of these. The story is good. Especially the characters are more diverse and fun. Missions are good. It is easier than GTA 3 in most aspects, but some missions can be harder than GTA 3. The deficiencies in the physics engine in GTA 3 are better in this game. The map is more understandable. There is more to do in the game. Overall, a good sequel. After GTA3. Totally iconic. And like GTA3, radio is my favorite thing in this series.. This game was my childhood. Rockstar ""rocked"" it and knocked every other wannabe open world game out of the park.. Amazing, 5th best gta for me .. My high-school roommate's favorite game. Dumb fun, great artstyle. I've started it several times, it didn't really capture my attention.. The Best Game of All Time. One of the best and most classic GTA's. I grew up with this game, and it will always have a special place in my heart.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Tommy Vercetti. Vice City took everything Rockstar established in III and took it to the next level. This game is built on the groundwork of III and very much looks and plays like its predecessor, only this time everything is much more refined. The shooting is tighter and the driving is more responsive. There is also much more to do in Vice City. The story is much improved and has an all star cast. From Ray Liotta to Gary Busey, the cast is top notch from top top bottom. Can't forget about the killer soundtrack also. This game is GTAIII in steroids but is still held back by its clunkiness. And for me, there's something so simplistic and charming about GTAIII that I probably would give the slight edge to that game in terms of which one I like more. But make no mistake about it, this is a game to be reckoned with at the highest level. Official Score- 9.3/10. It's a small but cool game. It's really cool, isn't it? but he can`t swim.. From all the GTA's, this one has the atmosphere and style i like the most. Good old times.. look , the story and the characters are so good or you can say one of the best stories in the gta , but the gameplay i feel like it's the same from gta 3 , And it's like they didn't think about new one just copy paste , and the big problem is ""Why Tommy can't swim ?"". Follow up to GTA III that irons out all of the ****, improves the graphics and adds an iconic soundtrack. Bettered only by its own sequel GTA: San Andreas.. Gotta be my favorite setting of any GTA game. Felt like you actually lived the life in the Mafia during the 1980's. Incredible game all around.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Its an EPIC game. I like the gameplay and the visuals were fantastic. I would like to play again in future. This game is great. The atmosphere of Miami is amazing and a great setting for a grand theft auto game. It is amazing how they made this masterpiece in less than a year. Almost everything about gta III is way better in this game. The gun play on console is surprisingly good and whoever thinks this game is hard must be fresh out the womb. And donât even get me started on the soundtrack. Also whoever says the graphics are bad are spoiled. The game was made in one year, was released in 2002, and was released on the ps2 give them a break.Anyway great game is a definite must play. Not as good as San Andreas, but still a great game. Love the setting of Vice City, the music is great, gameplay is good, and Tommy is a pretty good character. RIP Ray Liotta. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 10. Scarface + 80s music and aesthetics = best game ever. Best game ever - a plot that is only and excuse for the action = a great, great game, but a 9/10.. what a g game what a game, will allways remain in my heart super duper puaaaaahh. the controls are so bad and atrocious, mechanics are poor hard to get around, and on top of that too much motion blurr, its blinding to my eyes playing it. gunplay and aiming is horrible The only saving grace is the open world , characters and dialogue. GTAV IS miles better miles better. A More colorful and improved version of the previous installment with a better story and gameplay.. I highly enjoyed this game, its overflowing with atmosphere and just really cool **** and the soundtrack is one of the best out of all the GTA games.. but there's this weird inconsistent difficulty that is the root cause of why I've never beat this game even after the hundreds of attempts I've made over the years... the 80's were cool and so is this game so i'm giving it an 8 :D jiusvdfgbjhueradbgvjhuersdnhvi. I really don't understand people who give it a low rating because the graphics are ""BAD"" - wtf bro? the game is from 2002, what do you expect?. THIS GAME **** I don't know why rockstar created this **** This has a bad open world,where you have limited freedom.there is nothing but just **** story was very bad and why the **** does everyone likes Tommy this much. He's pretty **** do they like this shirt thing . Those who think vice city is the best.dude get some **** San Andreas is far more better than this . I'd want to play a game which has a **** aiming system. Third installment of GTA that I finished. Good story, good vibes. It's another options to play some nostalgic game beside GTA: SA. Rated M for Strong Violence,Blood,Sexual Content,Drug Use and Language. Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the fifth installment in the Grand Theft Auto series of video games.I did not play Grand Theft Auto when the series started going big in 2001 with the release of Grand Theft Auto 3.I got Vice City for Christmas last year and I instantly loved the **** controls take a little bit getting used to but after that the game is pure fun.This game is definitely not as good as San Andreas but unlike San Andreas this game does not have extremely hard missions that are a pain in the butt to **** graphics in Vice City are a bit better than the ones in San Andreas **** game is about a criminal released from prison named Tommy Vercetti who during the game takes over Vice City with the help of his **** does various missions from flying a toy helicopter with bombs into a building to dropping **** to murdering **** plot is sort of like Scarface.There are actually two parts to the **** first part is about Tommy Vercetti trying to find out who took his money and drugs during the drug deal gone wrong while Lance tries to find out who killed his **** second part is about Tommy getting people to pay protection money,buying assets like clubs and company's and worrying about his former boss Sonny.This game is fairly short.Despite all the missions you have to do I beat the game in three days(the third time I played **** game takes place in 1986 so there are a bunch of popular 80s singers singing famous 80's songs on the radio stations.There are many good cars and weapons in the game and even if you have played San Andreas you should like this game. 10/10. Its the second GTA game ive played. And actually my favourite also. I would say its better than GTA 5 imo. I had or have so much fun with it. Never going to regret buying it. It has nice gameplay and shooting. It has a really understandable and interesting story.. My favorite GTA game and a main reason for their success. We really have to mention the fantastic soundtrack. A really good source of knowledge for a young guy like me back then.. GTA Vice City Def Ed on PS5 Game Completed : Dec 12, 2021 Playtime : 15 hours among the GTA series, this game is in a pulgatory. What it means is that it did not age well. The GTA 3 aged well specially if you play it in its definitive edition which makes it worth replaying. Vice City on the other hand, is just inferior from newer games providing zero nostalgia except of course from its positive aspects i will discuss a little later. Its phasing is not good and its story is lazy overall It is not fun to play it today. Positives What only stands out from this game is obvious. its soundtrack and its 80's theme. Negatives.

Vice City is my personal favourite out of the GTA franchise and one of my favourite games ever made it has the best radio stations too. And it's great that we have Mafia film actors voicing the characters and the story is really good it's easily 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The most charming game I've ever played, high quality game with a lot of care about details. My favorite video game of all time next to San Andreas I bought this game over a decade ago. The best GTA game ever made and the best GTA character ever Tommy Vercetti. The music is amazing, the gameplay is awesome, great cars, lots of weapons and a pretty big city to explore.. My first gta game and it's crazy i was so excited to play it, i remember driving a vespa around the city while crashing all the pedestrians haha. A game with a great atmosphere, memorable characters, an intriguing plot and just a classic that is definitely worth passing! The disadvantages are mostly related either to age, or tolerable.. Anybody who says this game is good by any means is just looking at it through rose tinted glasses the game is downright annoying and aged very poorly the controls absolute garbage on any platform cops just there to be annoying oh you wanna drive impossible with a 4 or higher wanted level because you'll constantly be rammed by 100s of police, way to many timed missions with way to short of time, isnt very smart so they throw hundreds of enemies at you all you have to do is run in circles and they can't hit you, the story really doesn't hold up well no matter what way you look at it and whoever says otherwise as i've said once is looking at it through rose tinted glasses this game may have. een decent at the time to children but this game is just full of pure bs they made the ai for ""good characters"" morons that just get in your way so you are getting shot because they won't f*ckin move they slowly walk to your car with 10 cops and then get in but as soon as you try to drive off the cops pull that moron out and you instantly get busted which is unrealistic just because a moron with a gun aims a gun at you doesnt mean you have to comply You could steal a car and look away for 2 seconds cop randomly spawns and oh busted. The audio quality is terrible even for the time, cars are literally feathers or tiny little pebbles the moment you hop in and a cop barely going 20 mph sends you flying and you try driving off and annother cop sends you flying until you flip over and have to run but the moron in the car with you just runs into the car instead of running away from the car causing them to die because rockstar are a bunch of morons who couldn't code in smarter ai. Honestly f*ck rockstar they were a bunch of morons then and still are now. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE GOOD REVIEWS BECAUSE AS I'VE SAID TWICE THEY ARE JUST LOOKING THROUGH THEM ROSE TINTED GLASSES THIS GAME IS UTTERLY ****. From that time when people were allowed to make jokes and games were focused on being fun.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rockstar was surpassed again in no time. Now with a more worked character, story, gameplay, driving and a new city in the 80s, reminiscent of the best action movies of the time. The setting of the game is incredible, hopefully gta vi looks like vice city as the rumors sound. What can be said of GTA Vice City about 18 years after its release? Not much about gameplay, art style or story that hasn't been said. I guess the best that can I can say is that this game was a staple of my delevopement as a gamer in my teenage years and up to my thirties remains as a reference that I wouldn't mind too much replaying. At least a bit, because, yes, it's undeniable that those graphics got outdated pretty fast.. worst example of how not to make games - zero support, blocking user accounts, bugs in the game many years after the premiere. Just an amazing game... You all know that) Ps2 is enough powerful to play it). This masterpiece game is a memorable and fascinating game for lovers of classic 80s and Miami. OVERALL - 98% Gameplay - 7/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 10/10 Game Length - 9/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 10/10 Sound Effects - 7/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Replay Value - 9/10 My favourite GTA game. The music and styling of this game is matched only by Tony Hawkes 2/3. The world and characters feel like something straight out of Scarface (but I actually like this much more). I want a remake!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best GTA games ever released and was one of the best exclusives for PS2 at the time. Vice City was an instant classic among fans of the series and newcomers alike. This was my first entry into the series and all I can say is that I love this game with a passion. Now, I have bought the PS4 version and the gameplay hasn't aged well but besides that every single time I jump into Vice City I get excited about the music on the radio, the time period, the great voice acting, and all the cheat codes Rockstar implemented years ago. The missions are great (except the mini helicopter one but I'll let it slide), consistent, enjoyable, funny and it never loses a beat. Characters are fleshed out, taking inspiration from Scarface, Miami Vice, even Carlito's Way. The world is stylish, vivid, filled with atmosphere, and amazing detail for the time it came out. Also going back to the music, This game has the best soundtrack of any game ever, period. I can assure you that I am not the only one that has that opinion about this game. It is fantastic, it fits the world, setting and blends it all together to make one of the best games ever made. I love this game!. It will show the best of GTA, the atmosphere of Miami is very well devoted, a very good story, interesting missions. I hope GTA VI will be in Vice City. GTA Vice City is my 2nd favorite game in the franchise right behind San Andres. I loved being able to buy and run business and earn extra income in game and the music was top notch for a game based on the 80's.. I just recently played VC on my PS4. Back in the day when VC first came out (2002). I would've give this game at least a 9/10, but now I feel that it has aged a little, but it's still a fun game to experience.. Grand Theft Auto Vice City is a beautiful throwback to the 1980âs and somehow I am comfortable to say that the nostalgia from the 80âs turned out to be the very best gaming experiences of my life.. My rating: Sound 9/10 Graphic* 9/10 Gameplay 8/10 Replay value 8/10 Story 8/10 Total 8/10** * Graphic rating has to be contextualized for the year of the release. ** Total is a weighted average rounded up where the weight for every element is: Sound 1 Graphic 2 Gameplay 3 Replay Value 1 Story 3. Inspired by Brian de PalmaÂ´s Scarface, the Rockstar guys give it to us a great sandbox with incredible story. Fly trough Vice City itÂ´s an incredible sensation. One of the greatest ps2 games and probably the best GTA in history.. Really good gta. Hard to tell wich is better, if this one or san andreas. Anyways, 100% recommended.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best GTA ever made. It has the best soundtrack, ambience and history of all GTA, the 80's are unbeatable and I hope to see Vice City in a remake or in a future GTA in the 80's.. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City could easily be seen as GTA III with a fresh coat of paint. The game isn't even branded as GTA IV, a title which was given to a later game in the series. Before anyone writes this game off as some sort of standalone expansion or spinoff, however, they need to understand how incredible this game really is. Vice City's gameplay is essentially unchanged from GTA III, but the setting is Vice City, a fictional city based on Miami, which is much more lively, fun, and colorful. You play as Tommy Vercetti (voiced by Ray Liotta), a recently escaped criminal that ends up on the wrong end of a drug deal gone bad. Your goal is essential to seek vengeance against the ones who wronged you, but the plot comes second to the overall theme and flavor of the game. The Scarface-inspired world of Vice City has more character than almost any game I've played. You'll be hurtling down streets at fast speeds in stolen motorcycles, watching the neon glow of the buildings around you zip by as extremely catchy 80s synth pop plays. The soundtrack is absolutely terrific this time around, and it makes the experience so much better. It's hard to point out what's so much better this time around other than the experience as a whole. Improvements include the aforementioned motorcycles/scooters (which are insanely fast and incredibly satisfying to drive), characters that are actually interesting and funny (straight out of classic gangster films), a variety of houses you can purchase to use as save points, and a city that is much more immersive and alive. Additionally, most missions are satisfyingly accomplished by using Vice City's playground of items and vehicles. Need to take out a certain target? You can seek out a rocket launcher or some grenades to help, but you can also choose to find a sturdy vehicle to ram your way through. Perhaps you'll just opt for a helicopter to deplete the enemy forces by air. The number of options here makes the game incredibly fun and replayable. Very few games have the flair and attitude of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Exploring this new world is an absolute blast, and even when sticking to the not-exactly-groundbreaking missions, the cinematic touches and well-placed, cheesy references will put a smile on your face and keep you in the game.. A grate game over all, beautiful setting and music, a main character very likeable, a story that is simple but interesting. For a ps2 game is amazing, my only complain is the driving didn`t age well but other than that this is a incredible game a true masterpiece.. The most beautiful personality and the most beautiful city and the most beautiful game of rock star I love you. Just like a hot chick who is relaxing on the edge of the 80's Miami beach with her feet lined with sea waves, invites to swim and as soon as you realize it is a small piece of scarface, psyco, and shining in one place.. GTA Vice CIty is one of the best PS2 games, almost as good as GTA San Andreas and with better music in my opinion. Also more colorful! Driving around in a car listening to the radio was never more fun!. It is the game of my childhood and my favourite game off course. The best GTA Game ever!. An absolute masterpiece. My favorite GTA of all time. They nail the 80's in Miami.. GTA's 3rd generation is a videogame's world wonderful. Almost every open-world video-game took classes with Rockstar way making games. Player is immerse in everything inside the game as he/her were part of the game. Background, characters, gameplay, fun, missions and everything else. If GTA San Andreas is so ambitious and bountiful, it because it's a consequence of GTA Vice City. Glamorous and soft Miami's parody in 80's background, contrasting with crime and violence, let the game even more interesting than its predecessor, because Liberty City already has a dark atmosphere. Still nowadays, only graphics are dated, and even so it doesn't spoil the experience. It's a incredible game as in its time as more than fifteen years after.. This is my favorite GTA out of all of the 3D era games and possibly the best out of all the series. An incredible time capsule of the 1980s. This is one of the greatest video games ever made. The soundtrack IS the greatest licensed soundtrack in video game history. The graphics, environment and aesthetic are a perfect reflection of the time and look much smoother and nicer than GTA 3 apart from some glitching and corruption. The gameplay is significantly improved and has much more environment interactability than GTA 3 until San Andreas came out. A lot of tributes to eighties films and tv shows like Scarface, Carlito's Way, Reservoir Dogs and Miami Vice. Fantastic satire of 1980s American and international pop culture. Fantastic voice acting from Ray Liotta, Robert Davi, Burt Reynolds, Luis Guzman, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Gary Busey, Danny Dyer, Lawrence Taylor, Jenna Jameson, Deborah Harry and Dennis Hopper. Extremely well done and an impeccable cast. I think the its best cast in the series. You can spend hours on finding collectibles, doing rampages, stunt jumps, RC races, vehicle side missions and asset takeover missions. The story is superb. It's a tribute to Scarface done to perfection. You can tell that Rockstar put months of effort into creating a beloved masterpiece. Overall I give this game a perfect 10. People must play Vice City. The only flaw that comes to mind is that it can be very difficult at times but can be easily overlooked by playing it for so long. It's a game that will never be matched and will never age.. This 80's themed follow-up to GTA III is one of the greatest sequels of all time. Highly stylized and nostalgic, it improved and expanded upon the formula of its predecessor. It also still features the greatest licensed soundtrack ever composed for a video game. Cinematically, Vice City's biggest influences are ""Scarface"" and ""Miami Vice"". The decision to cast Ray Liotta (""Goodfellas"") in the lead role was brilliant. In fact, the game features several characters voiced by Hollywood veteran actors. It's the ""JFK"" of video games! Of course, this being a ""Grand Theft Auto"" title, it is very much an adult satire. The game is comical, but was highly controversial at the time of release. Overall, GTA: Vice City is a brighter, bigger and better sequel to GTA III. I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. What can I say about GTA Vice City that hasn't already been said; this game is one of the best of the series hands down. From its Scarface style story, to its instant classic design and controls, this is what GTA on the PS2 is all about. It might have a story line that is on the short side, especially compared to today's standards, but there is so much to do outside of the story, that you could drop an entire day on this game and not even touch the story at all. Of course, a pinnacle of all GTA games since 3 have been their amazing soundtracks and talk radio segments. You could honestly just pause the game, and put the music or talk radio on and be happy. On the voice acting front, Rockstar tends not to use a lot of big time actors anymore in the newer games, but this game is full of talent and it **** voice acting is really good and while some of the lines come off as a bit cheesy, it fits the time period and is quite entertaining. Now you can't talk about a GTA game without talking about the cars and combat aspects. The cars handle all differently which is great, and they have been designed well, both in sound and visually. The combat is pretty much the same as GTA 3. There is no free aiming except for a few of the guns, but the controls are easy to get used to and switching targets is an easy task. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite games of all time and is one of the greatest games on the PS2.. For its time, this was groundbreaking. But with hindsight, San Andreas and GTA 5 do the same thing, but better.. Absolute classic! So much fun fun time spent on my Xbox Original with this game back in the day. When writing this, I haven't properly played it since 2005-06, probably. I remember the first time I tried it out at a friends house. Mind blown! I had to get it. But I couldn't afford a next gen (back then) at the time. So I had to wait a few years. And oh boy, was it worth the wait! Spent so many hours. And it was a real challenge too for a 14 year old. Only ever managed to finish it the once. It has aged a bit, however. The graphics are very off. And the story is a bit unoriginal when you think about it (drawing huge inspiration from 80's cult media such as Scarface and Miami Vice). All in all a fantastic game and probably the best of it's era. In 2017 it does not have the same appeal, however. Although it is very playable. Especially from a nostalgic perspective.. Better than GTA San Andreas .. If GTA 3 revolutionized the idea what an open world story based game could be..... GTA Vice City showed us what a open world story based game should be. I can sum this game up by saying it felt like I was playing through a well voice acted, slightly over the top, extremely entertaining 1980's mafia movie and that's because I kind of was. GTA Vice City is really all about the story from start to finish. The in game mechanics are really just tools you use to work your way to next chapter of the story and even those do not disappoint. Drive, shooting and moving are all functional even by today's standards and certainly do not take away from the enjoyment of the ride the story puts you on. There are so many different types of weapons and vehicles to choose from and the adjustable radio has so many great songs and funny talk shows to choose from. There is so much depth to the characters and their stories which is supported by great voice acting that rivals or exceeds a lot of the garbage we see in today's games. You find yourself getting attached to a lot of these characters due to some great character development and want to learn more and more about them. There is no shortage side missions and mini missions to keep you entertained between story missions if you want to do them and I really loved the business portfolio system that gave you even more missions to perform and allows you to generate an income. It genuinely feels like a mob game should in the GTA context. The story to me is what puts this game over the top. From beginning to end you just want to see what is going to happen next and I was never disappointed at any point. I have played and beaten this game more times then any other since I started playing games when I was a kid. So far in my video game playing experience (20 years) GTA Vice City is by far my favorite game of all time and is currently the only game I have ever given a perfect score for. GTA Vice City has been replicated by many but will never be bested. One of a kind. 10/10 Exceptional. Vice City follows GTA 3 and adds some nice new features to the series. The ability to purchase property and the inclusion of motorbikes were a much welcome addition to the series. Another home run from Rockstar.. It does not have too many problems to play it,and it is just like watching a movie!And a great 80s crime film. so go buy this game before you regret.Also,it is a Best Plot in the gaming history ever.. This game is much better than GTA III by like a million miles. Game play and story line is top notch and mechanics is just as good. I really have nothing else to say about this game except it is a masterpiece. 10/10.. Without a doubt the best grand theft auto game released so far. I've had hours of fun exploring the city and doing the side-missions. The story is interesting, even dough its by no means original.. this game is absolutely brilliant because the characters like lance will be Tommy friend at the start helping him out with fighting out crime and drug deals. the last mission is where lance betrays Tommy in the last mission because his boss asks him for money at the start he was sending the drug package to someone overall i recommend you get this game it awesome.. GTA: Vice City was such a vast improvement over GTA3. It captured the south FL Miami vibe very well, but with a 80's twist (and beats). It's of smaller scale than GTA: SA and even GTA3, but Vice City has it's own personality that sets it apart from the other entries. You will love the Scarface references (If you've seen the movie)!. Do you love movies like Scarface, Carlito's Way and tv shows like Miami Vice? Then you are gonna love this game! Grand Theft Auto Vice City is a great improvement over it's predecessor GTA III, not so much in gameplay but in more detailed graphics, more humor and a great soundtrack. Many will agree that this game has the best music (and possibly also graphics) from all GTA games on the PS2. As others have said before me,","""Vice City"" is one of the most ahead of the time games ever made . the massive pop/rock soundtrack is perhaps the best ever compiled for a video game . the late Ray Liotta gives a performance that pays homage to his own ""Goodfellas"" character ."
370.Kentucky Route Zero - Act IV,"These episodes are just nonsense. I waited so long for ACT 5 to come out, but I couldn't tell you anything that's happened thinking back in 1-4 barely and I have no desire to play 1-4 again, nor 5 in isolation. It's not a good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A stunning, melancholy work of art. Probably the most understated act so far, Act IV is rather slow-paced and more text-heavy than other acts, so you really need to buy into and appreciate the KRZ mythology; if you didn't like previous acts this one will definitely not win you over. However, if you're already in love with the world of the game, you'll love exploring the settings (there are some beautiful ones here) and learning more about the characters and their backgrounds. This act is also designed to be replayed at least once, as you have to make choices that affect which scenes you end up playing (i.e. whether to stay on the boat or get off at various stops). Kentucky Route Zero continues to be possibly the most profound and beautiful games I've ever played.. Nice minimalistic art style but my god is this game boring. I relatively liked episodes 1-3, even though there was too much flow walking, obtuse puzzles, and just stuff that was too weird. This episode was just mind numbingly boring. The set and music is good, but the gameplay is unexciting.. I don't review games but this game deserves it.This has been the most amazing game experience i've ever **** David Fincher made a game this would be it.","if you didn't like previous acts this one will definitely not win you over . the set and music is good, but the gameplay is unexciting . this has been the most amazing game experience i've ever had ."
371.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone,"Way overrated, vibe is cool but quests are just too stretched and bosses not fun. Honestly I liked Blood and Whine better than Hearts of Stone. But this is still a great expansion.. The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone is the first expansion released in the fall of 2015 for the action RPG superstar game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. You can play Hearts of Stone after you beat the main game, or even during it. It might be a good idea to do the latter, because it does take place in a new region of the main map. The story of the DLC is not directly related to the main story, but it still fits well into the narrative. This time the devs have taken a step out of the classic Witcher lore and made a story with clear Faustian elements. It is fantastically dark and morally ambivalent and gray. I think that this gamble has paid off, because it really fits the world of Witcher perfectly. Gaunter OâDimm, the big man himself, is superbly written and voice acted and becomes one of the most memorable game villains (although strictly speaking, some may actually consider him to be not a villain at all). Olgierd von Everec is a clearly very troubled man and as you uncover his past, you will probably grow to like him less and less. Another well written character. The main story of the expansion is great, very enjoyable, with distinctively changing moods (consider the wedding, the von Everec manor, the heist etc.). Other than that, you can explore the new portions of the map, mostly dealing with the remnants of the Order of the Flaming Rose (another great callback to previous Witcher games) or monsters. Not much new in terms of equipment, monsters etc. However, you get a chance for a very nice one-time romance with Shani (to me, it barely even constitutes cheating, in case you are in a relationship with one of the witches). The whole wedding feast is just so memorable and atmospheric. Bravo. It took me about 15 hours to go through the whole expansion. Obviously, no microtransactions and no SJW. Fantastic story-oriented DLC for The Witcher 3, it is definitely worth the money. This is how you expand your game. Final Verdict: 95 %. Even though short and incredible little chapter added to the witcher game. Not a part of it lacking in character, art and story. Very much enjoyed the new characters the atmosphere it gives in certain areas you have to explore.. This expansion, oh my... I remember finishing the witcher 3, and I loved it and by the end I didnt want to be done with it, I missed it, missed the characters, missed the atmosphere, so It thought lets give the expansions a try, i wanna have some stuff to do in the game but I didnt expect a game company to make such a thoughtful and full experience just out of a dlc. This game introduces one of the most interesting antagonist in a video game story, the plot is very interesting, and deep, and so many questions are raised between good and wrong, somewhere in between and sometimes neither. And I love Shani as a character. this is one of the best relatively small-size DLC in history! and it has a relatively good ending!. Thought it was the right expansion for The Witcher 3. The story is a little less compelling than blood and wine, but still very good.. Great expansion, whose central motif is one sophisticated **** Best dlc in gaming history. ""Hearts of Stone"" is an extraordinary DLC that elevates The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to unparalleled heights. The narrative is one of the finest I've ever encountered in any fiction. The characters are crafted with remarkable depth and authenticity, making every interaction unforgettable. Each mission is a masterclass, seamlessly blending excitement and challenge. This expansion is nothing short of breathtaking, enhancing an already magnificent game. For me, it solidifies The Witcher 3's status as the greatest game ever made.. best dlc of all time. the story is just incredible taking you to new places and situations that are intense. Great Quests with a lot of love and effort. Also the characters are perfectly written: very convincing. Sometimes I was even very proud to be polish because of what CD Project created here.. This, along with Elden Ring, Red Dead Redemption 2, the last Zelda games and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are the best open worlders ever made. Period.. Brilliant game! It's so amazing playing this game! So cool, graphics is sooooo cooooool!. Incredible storyline and fun quests. It ads few content and new mechanics. Not enough lenght for a DLC if you focus on the main story, but if the game wasnt enough for you, give this new content a try.. If only I could rate it higher.... Absolutely marvelous addon. Worth every single grosz (penny) you spend on it. Gaunter o'Dim is just the best NPC in whole gaming.. Score: 9/10 The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone DLC delivers an exceptional experience with its captivating narrative and memorable characters. However, its brilliance is somewhat hindered by its comparatively short length when compared to the expansive scope of Blood and Wine.. This game is LEGENDARY! One of the best games of all time. The story, music, characters, the world, it's all so good! The developers poured so much of their love and passion into this and it absolutely shows. Don't hesitate, play this absolute masterpiece!. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. This is good dlc. I got enjoy when i was playing it. Especially boss fights and game atmosphere were great.. This is a peak of Witcher expierience. I didnt know that untill i finished the whole game and I thought about the game after some time.. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. The best addition to the main game. I like a lot Olgierd character - he represents the true Polish nobleman. Hearts of Stone pulled the fastest bait and switch Iâve ever seen. After taking a contract and fulfilling it, Geralt is taken prisoner by men from Ofier and put on a boat. When you crash you might think youâve made it to this new country, well my friend, I can tell you, nope youâre just off the shore of Novigrad. Back to gloom and annoying crowds, because this whole DLC takes place in Novigrad, Oxenfurt and its surrounding area. The thing that really got me was how this âadventureâ really felt like it was cut from the original game only to be sold separately. After all, how many times can characters mention Radovid and all the kingly things heâs doing, hours and hours after heâs been dead? The best parts of this DLC were the wedding, which was just hilarious, and the Von Everec estate which was a superb mystery and investigation (something the base game was sorely missing). I could have happily ended it on that estate mission because boy was the ending quest just a letdown. The main villain was clearly never fleshed out, what he was was never outright answered and the good ending clearly slapped on, as though the creators thought you would never have done that optional mission and would obviously just get the bad ending. If you wish to play it, do this at the recommended level 35 while in the base game. Youâll definitely want to end on the high note that is Blood and Wine.. Both DLCs for The Witcher 3 are great. It includes new upgrades to your weapons and an expansion of the map. But, without a doubt, the best feature about this DLC is its story, dark and intriguing.. Not a bad story .. Great :). well if we look at this dlc as something other to this game, something new, then we got big dissapoitement its the same ol novigrad, same old witcher. if look at this dlc like it some aditional thing to main plot, to main game then its good, but personaly me dont look at DLCs like it something aidditional, for me it have to be smth new. + large open game world in which there is something to be found in every corner, every stone is worth turning over + a story that is gripping from the first to the last minute + Graphically really worth seeing + The soundtrack gives you a feeling and an unforgettable memory + every single side quest is actually a little story + Choices have an impact on history, even if it seems insignificant to you, it can have a major impact and change the course of history The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone offers you a gripping sequel full of secrets to be discovered. Clear buy recommendation.. don't mix politics and games, how do you treat us the way we treat you, now I know what kind of company you are and how you deal with players, I will never buy your games again. Canât stress this enough, the worst game in existence, please do not waste your life on this garbage.. Hearts of Stone is spectacular, it might be the inferior expansion of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt but it's amazing nonetheless. I was seriously intrigued by the story, it's very fascinating! In some ways even better than the main game's story. I really liked the new characters aswell, Gaunter O'Dimm is easily one of the most entertaining characters in the game, and Olgierd Von Everec is fantastic. There are some new boss fights which are quite challenging, especially in comparison to the disappointingly simple boss fights of the main game. And lastly, the setting is very interesting and unique, I absolutely love it. The only issue I can find is that it's relatively short and lacks content. Unfortunately it's barely 10 hours long and there's no replay-ability. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. its really great dlc to the game like the story is amazing, side quests are also great, recommend it. Hearts of Stone is one of those rare cases where the expansion is better than the main game. My gameplay criticisms to the Witcher 3 still apply to the DLC. Where it differs is that Hearts of Stone has such beautiful story and the game focuses on its strengths. You wonât find unnecessary fetch quests here. All quests contribute to the gameâs narrative, story and character development. Hearts of Stone takes you to a short but very memorable journey. PS: The game features a spectacular song (aka Master Mirrorâs song). It gave me the creeps and reminded me a particular level from Sanitarium (1998).. 8/10 ï¸ - Very good (after completing the DLC) The main storyline itself is only good. A predictable storyline, and I can't like one of the most important characters. Side quests and what's around the main plot, it's a revelation. We have the opportunity to meet the characters from The Witcher 1, which is a really nice experience. Many hours of great fun. SHORZZ / The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone: In this Dlc, we see a new empire and the undisputed Gaunter O'dimm, the strongest in the witcher world, again in this Dlc. The music and atmosphere are very successful. HoS, which has quality and enjoyable tasks in itself, is definitely worth your time.. A DLC with about 20 hours worth of content including new main quests and side quests. New runewright upgrades, new armours + weapons for only 10$ if not less right now :) Gaunter O'Dimm is one of the best characters in all games and the soundtrack is just magnificent Totally recommend it!. When we talk about the best game in history, this game is true masterpiece and has no weaknesses. As someone who found the main quest of the Witcher 3 to be good if not a bit disappointing, I can guarantee you that Hearts of Stone is my number 1 Witcher universe expansion pack. The writing and story is absolutely top notch and far superior to the main story. It is short but compelling and truly memorable. Iris von Everec is Waifu of the Year and Master of Mirrors wins Most Terrifying Best Friend of the Year award. For the low asking price or free if you get the GoTY version, you get an unforgettable experience that will be a gold standard in story-driven RPGs for decades to come.. Interesting characters and questline. Really charming DLC: great content, amazing and interesting hours of walkthroug. Jesus Christ it is awesome, the story is so good that it could be a movie or a book. Game: 9/10 Story: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 Graphics: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Stability: 9/10 Great game!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very cool DLC that has all the features of the original game with a cool storyline, and a lot of new interesting bosses and equipment but the side quests are not so good as it was in original game. CD Projekt Red's DLC policies are one of the best in the industry. It's very cheap and very, very well-made. The story of Master Mirror is better than the main quest line in some cases.. Stone me, but I liked the HEARTS OF STONE DLC better than the base game and the BLOOD & WINE DLC. It had the better, more impactful story and most memorable characters. A more light-hearted sub-plot takes Geralt to a wedding with an old friend of his before embarking on a Faustian tale of gloom and doom. Unlike most RPG quests, these are well woven into the story and sometimes the side quests are even better written and designed than the main quests. That is especially true for the base game. I don't give 10 ratings - since there is no perfect game - so this is my highest rating a 9.. Comparing to the Blood and Wine DLC, this one is a little bit bland. Still a great addition though.. I love the setting of this expansion, it's very interesting. The story is great, the new characters are fantastic and the boss fights are challenging but it lacks side content, making it the inferior expansion. Still, it's worth playing, a great addition to the game.. One of the loveliest dlc (and overall) stories especially near the end of it.. Compared to the main story It's absolutely nuts, It doubles down on great characters and the story of the Olgierd family It's incredible, all around more than ten hours worth the little money you pay for It.. DLC worth buying like the main game, lot of content, good story, good characters and story feels refreshing. Great DLC, new areas, enemies and story, a must have for anyone who liked the original witcher 3.. Gaunter o Dimm is such an interesting character with Olgierd. You will love this.. An amazing DLC that adds a lengthy story filled with interesting characters and quests. Just an incredible story. If you've enjoyed the base game, you'll love this. If you're wondering whether to get both - absolutely do, and make sure to get Blood and Wine as well.. Whereas I think Blood and Wine is a bit above HoS, I give this a 10 just because of the characters Olgierd von Everec and Gaunter O'Dimm. Also, possibly the best quest in the game + expansions. You'll know which one when you play it. Play this.. The main game and the DLC Blood and Wine are absolute masterpieces. This, however, disappointed me a bit. Not that it was bad, it was just not as good. Main game is a 10 while this is an 8. Still recommended.. More Witcher in Witcher game :) Great story, new quests and items to collect - must have for every owner of base game.. Fantastic DLC. 10 hours of new main story content, for only 10â¬! The boss battles in the DLC are also much better than the ones from the main game. The new enchanting feature is also pretty neat, however, the DLC could've used some more side quests, but it's still a great DLC that's totally worth your money.. It took me longer to finish it then a few AAA Games, 80-90 rated Games... This Dlc proves that there is a few additional content wich are worth buying.. This is perhaps one of my favorite expansions to a game I have ever played. It may not add much in terms of world size, but that isn't what this DLC is about. Instead, it delivers an excellent story of tragedy, with some of the best characters and quests in the entire game.. Another masterfully crafted piece of Witcher story by CDPR with lots of surprises.. Main evaluation criteria: -Story: 10 -Atmosphere: 10 -Characters: 10 -Graphics and design: 10 -Gameplay: 8 -Sound and Music: 10 -Bugs: 9 -Interface: 10 -Completeness of the world: 10 Ðdditional evaluation criteria (Do not really affect the assessment): -Freedom of choice: 9 -Coop in Story mode: 0 -Multiplayer: 0 -Mods and the ability to change the game: 8 Scores from 1 to 10, the higher the better. Great story line with a wonderful character design,New contents are good but not enough for me. 8.3 Great. Just finished the main game, i thought wow, this was great. And then this DLC manages even to top it. With their focus more on the main story, they really managed to make me be as excited as the first hours of playing the game after 100 hours played. So many unique boss fights. I loved Gaunter o'Dim and Olgierd. His backstory was great and the worlds you go to for certain quests are also with so much detail created. Just amazing.. The perfect expansion for the perfect game. It feels like this DLC is even more detailed than the base game (which may be a logical thing since it is smaller). Now every banding camp has its own story with a journal explaining it (the game does make fun of it at some point). The main story is great. Full of climax that will give you chills. There is love, a curse, a mysterious creepy enemy and there is even a heist story. That's how you do a DLC.. ""The Hearts of Stone"" is the first DLC for The Witcher 3 that came out in 5 months after the game did and was a ""sip"" of fresh content. The story narrates us about the history of Olgierd von Everek and his family. He is a Raubritter (baron-rogue), his origins lead us to the character of Polish legends Pan Twardowsky, a man who outsmarted the devil with his weapon - contract. Btw, European analogue of Pan Twardowsky is Johann Faust. Despite all this I have to say that after the premier of the second DLC ""Blood and Wine"" the fascinating composition doesn't look that interesting. Anyway, 10/10. The quality is simply stunning, top notch. In comparison to other greedy companies DLC politics, like Ubisoft FarCry and Assassins Creed, this is how a DLC should look like.. Hearts of Stone brings phenomenal story and characters. The Man of Glass, the haunted mansion (the scariest quest in the entire Witcher series for me so far), the village wedding (the funniest quest in the entire Witcher series, I couldn't stop laughing), heist mission, challenging boss battles and more. Great DLC.. A masterpiece, like the base game. ""Scenes from a marriage"" in the most engaging and suggestive gameplay I've ever had in 20 years. Great plot, great dialogues, great cinematics, great voice acting.. Story of expansion is more interesting than story of original game. But original story was perfect. I have no words to express it. Amazing. As for me, this is the best part of Witcher.. On par with the excellent main game, with great characters, if you liked the main game get it!. After the unpopular view i had about many aspects of the base Witcher 3 game, i didn't expect this to be as good as it was. CD Project absolutely delivered in this one, and got a lot better in pacing and the narrative itself is more vivid (use of better and more varied camera fixes which makes it more dynamic) Characters itself are excellent and fleshed out, and the storyline is original and makes really good use of the choice-making. I consider this DLC a 9, one of the best i played. A huge, exciting and atmospheric expansion to the best game of the year! Music design, monsters, quests and a new amazing story. All this in ""Hearts of Stone""!. It has a pretty bad start but everything that happens later is great. I didn't expect this kind of package from small 10 hour expansion. It carries all the advantages of main game, especially strong story with hard and impactful choices, both more intensive than in main game, some choices are really hard and emotional. HoS also improves upon some things, with the biggest difference in combat, especially boss fights that are now much more challenging and exciting than in a base game. It also adds a bit more variety to gameplay. Very good, this is something you think about days or even weeks after finishing the game.. Despite all of its sometimes tiresome puzzles and poorly implemented new features, Hearts of Stone is one of the best expansion packs the gaming world has seen in recent years.. Witcher 3 Hearts of Stone is expansion that is worth more than most of today's games. It has best story and characters of any game i have played even better than base game and better than Blood and Wine.. Story 10 Combat 8 World 9 Music 9 characters 10 Bosses 8 Hours 12 Perfect DLC. CD Project red created a wonderful story with amazing and interesting characters. The map got a bit bigger and a new forging system are included in the DLC. For its very cheap price and lots of content I have to say that this is one of the best DLCs out there.. (almost) Everything a DLC should have: New mechanics added to enchant weapons. New sidequests, new NPC to talk to. A good story with great characters and enemies. If you liked the Witcher 3 you should play Hearts of Stone.. Great expansion for one of the best games ever made. It has a fascinating story in my opinion, and i really enjoyed the main antagonist of the expansion and all the quests. Easily worth the price, it is a no brainer.. The best addition in 2015 is unambiguous. Very intereseny story about a devil and Geralt. Characters are perfectly registered, it is better than in an original game. Have considerably expanded the Novigrad's map. Have returned Shani from the first part that certainly has only added color of DLC. Well and in general addition is much more dramatic than the original, an ending too excellent, it should be passed twice.. Witcher 3 is a fantastic game - in my eyes, the best RPG published until 2015. Hearts of Stone is a mildly interesting interactive movie. During many of the movie sequences, where you move ten steps to get to the next movie, you cannot even save.. Mind blowing, an amazing expantion from the best game in the history! Thats how you make Quality but this gives you even quantity which is crazy. CD Project Red really cares about how they make their games. They take really good care of it just like an artist cares about its painting. No need to tell you how this expantion is other than its possibly even better than the main game which already was almost too perfect.. The Witcher 3's first expansion is a bit less deep as compared to the main story but possesses a greater amount of humor and a better feel of adventure. Hearts of Stone is truly what you can call a DLC -- hooking me again in the game, tending to my wounds after the peculiar wave of sadness that comes when you finish a game as good as The Witcher 3.. This was a great adventure. Very enjoyable. Incredibly fun boss fights. A great extension to the main game. Adds approximately 15 more hours of game play. If you own the Witcher 3 this is a must have.. This games plus its expansions are easily one of the best games ever. There are problems, bugs and not finished things, but graphics, music, story, atmosphere.... everything about this game is amazing. spent 60$ on the game plus expansions (steam sale), for about 160 hours of great gameplay. 10/10 would recommend.. It is a very good DLC, with a very good story and development of new characters. However, the ending is a bit disappointing. No final boss fight, only running around trying to find a reflection was kinda boring (and with that damn time limit). This is how a DLC should be. Worth your money. A good lengthy story and some new items and features. Feels wish all other RPG were followed up with expansions like this.. If you liked the characters of Witcher 3, which I did, this expansion is terrific. Its shorter than the base game, and set in one of the same areas (though it expanded nicely upon a little traveled part of the map). But it is also more condensed. Basically its more awesome in a smaller box. There are some side quests, but not a lot. There are new monsters and bosses which cause you to re-think battle tactics. There is a new enchanter merchant who can introduce some quality of life improvements. More significantly the main 4 quests are up there with the best quests in the base game, and thats 70% of the expansion right there. The characters are fully fleshed out 3 dimensional beings, despite only one of them appearing in the books. It is fun at times, dark at times and tragic at times. Every quest has a purpose. No fetch runs or pointless collections here. And the environment.... There is a house. Once you see it in the game world, once in someones impressionist painting of it, and once in some sort of nightmare place. The contrast between these impressions of the same place are nothing short of masterful. Far better than one could expect from a new space that would be more of the same. Compared to other DLC out there Hearts of Stone is a bargain and well worth it. I'd go so far as to say ""best expansion ever"" but I'll have to play blood and wine first to see if that's true.. As a gamer dinosaur, i remember the time when we didn't have DLCs and we actually had ""expansion packs"". Back then, games were released as complete packages, and later developers made ""expansion packs"" that really enhanced and extended the original game, and added tons of playtime on top of it. This is an old school expansion. Not a DLC. It adds a new storyline, and tons of stuff and characters. Don't miss it!. Five Word Review: Side quest feel but worthwhile. Favorite Thing: An enjoyable story and a good romp. Least Favorite Thing: No gear progression, I wanted something new! Playtime: ~ 14h Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: It's worth your time.. The expansion ""Hearts of Stone"" is splendid in all ways. Great storyline, new gameplay, nice soundtrack, etc. If you are a fan of The Witcher or liked the original game, you should definitely play it since it will be extremely fascinating.. The writing is absolutely superb and there's easily enough content here to justify the price tag. A must-have for fans of the main game, no doubt about that.. Wow! One of the best DLC ever!!. Incredible interesting characters (Olgierd and Gaunter o'Dim), really interesting and creative missions and really good the end of the story. Full of references to Polish literature, amazing music. I really recommend!. Contrary to CDPR's definition, this DLC isn't really an expansion, as it's essentially only one long quest and a couple of side quests. Yes, I know, there's the runewright, new armor and weapons and stuff like that, but they are all pretty minor things overall. The runewright especially is a bit disappointing. That said, boy is it a good DLC. The main quest is excellent and O'Dimm is a perfect villain. I really enjoyed the mysterious atmosphere. The side quests are also great. Although there is one part of the main quest that's a bit dull and I wasn't satisfied with the ending, in the end I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it thoroughly. For 10â¬ this is absolutely a must buy.. Excellent expansion, If you want to finish it off completely it will take a mere 13-14 hrs(you have to be perfect), the combat well felt like Witcher 2, was challenging in comparison to the one's witcher 3 boasted of, overall it's a great DLC and will be worth every penny, this is how a dlc is supposed to be when not a standalone dlc!. Great expansion pack with great story. It starts kind of slow, and I was initially disappointed when it started with a mission to kill some monster in the sewers, but then the story quickly starts taking unexpected turns, and builds up to become a really great storyline on par with the best storylines of the original game (such as the Bloody Baron storyline). Overall, a great expansion.. The most awarded game of all time and well deserved. Without a doubt The Witcher 3 is the best game I have ever played. My only wish is that I could forget everything about this game just so I could have that feeling of playing through it for the first time again.. ""Hearts of Stone"" is even better than ""The Witcher 3"" itself. It improves the game in every way (e. g. boss battles), especially the main story line of the dlc is better than the one of ""Wild Hunt"". ""Hearts of Stone"" is the best dlc I have ever played!. They improved upon the one thing that was pretty bad in Witcher 3 and that was the easy boss battles. The story in this expansion is stellar and it is graciously accepted as a longtime Witcher fan.. Wow, a dlc that is actually worth the money you pay for. You don't see a lot of those these days. CDPR did a fantastic job of crafting a solid dlc. There are tons of npcs to meet, new armors and weapons to craft and upgrade, new quests to invest your time on, and new part of the map to explore. The dlc's plot is not connected to the main game, which allows players to start whenever they want. The only reason I'm giving 9 instead of 10 is because of how the new area to explore looks the same as the rest of the map.. This much better than original game. 10/10 What can i say else? Main story very intersting, not a lot of quests, but they realy interesting. I can recommend this expantion to everyone. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Probably one of the best games I ever played in my life (and i'm 37). The story and flow is amazing. This is an amazing piece of art . I recommend it to everyone.. Hands down the best PC game I've ever played made even better by this expansion. I'd go as far as saying this 10-15 hours of gameplay alone is better than 95% of games out there and thats without the main story. Anyone that hasn't played this is missing out on a piece of creative genius.. Such an amazing add-on. In fact, this was the best DLC since Half Life Opposing Force. Very funny and strong. Really fun to play and story is strong. DonÂ´t hasitate to download and play it.. I think Witcher 3 is probably one of the game that I really become attached to the main characters and the supporting characters. so this is one game that I am really sad to see it end. I will take time to slowly play it over again in the future. The overall gameplay is good and the cut scenes are just the right amount and in the right moments. Inside the cut scenes characters act and look like real actors. Their facial expression and movements are so real. At times I feel like I am living inside a story with the main characters. So if you ever want to act out a movie instead of watching one, this is the game to play.. A great example of what DLC should be. It adds a new crafting system to the game and expands the world a bit. The real treat, however, is the story. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the antagonist is one of the most interesting I've encountered in a video game, ever. I really enjoyed the 10 hours I put into and I think it's well worth the $15 it cost.. It is not a simple DLC but a complex, rich parallel storyline! Great music. Story well told. I played it before the end of the main quest, and the intrigue is partially linked with some events in the game. Maybe if it wasn't detached into a separate DLC the integration could be better. However, it's 10/10 because is the best DLC I've seen so far.. Epic story with tons of extra hours of gameplay. Devs advertised it as ~10hrs and i got about ~30hrs going slow. Very good value. Adds tons of new areas and the story of it is top-tier. Get this dlc already.. Genre - Open Worlded Fantasy RPG I have played through the Witcher 1 and 2 until the end of both. Recently I read all the English translated books by Andrzej Sapkowski (a hero and they are highly recommended). I have already ploughed 80+ hours into this game by doing many exploration, sub and main quests. I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out). The monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a seas","the witcher 3: Hearts of Stone is the first expansion released in the fall of 2015 . the story of the expansion is not directly related to the main story, but it still fits well into the narrative . the main story of the expansion is great, very enjoyable ."
372.Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,"Ugnaught was so good I **** a little upon seeing him in the multiplayer version. I want to harbour a child with him and I am a male but all dreams are possible. I would die just to carry his holy offspring and maybe salivate on his leathery feet. So good!. Jedi Outcast's lightsaber combat, force powers, and story immerse you in a galaxy far, far away. A classic Star Wars game loved by fans.. the down-to-earth gunplay, vast level design, strong force powers and precise lightsaber combat complement the best star wars story ever made.. Not a great game, the goods out way the bads even if itâs a classic. Itâs too dark, the level design is to maze like and can confuse players and is clunky when it comes to gun play. The lightsaber combat is amazing especially since it includes dismemberment of models and the multiplayer is fun and so is the cast. But itâs a platformer and first person shooter to the core which it is terrible within those parameters.. Although the story was shallow, the gameplay was very entertaining. You can feel nostalgic. It is a game you must play. I wish today's lightsabers war was like in this game.. Kyle Katarn as a protagonist is really interesting character. We can see how his personality change and follow with him until he can face main antagonist Desann. I return to this game at least once a year :) There are few missions in various parts of galaxy. We will met different well known characters from Star Wars universe on our way. Besides of lightsaber, which will be our ""best friend"" to slay stormtroopers, there are also plenty of weapons to use. But to be honest, lightsaber is the main weapon, you will keep for 90% time of the game :P Last but not least are forces. Kyle during his adventure upgrade his force abilities and become stronger, faster and more deadly to the enemies. The weak spot of the game is the fact, that Kyle maximase his powers on the last levels.. So when you are really over powered the game just end. It's a pity that there aren't more levels where can play with whole set of forces... This game is genuinely amazing. It's short enough to stay good through entire playthrough, has good dialogues, decent plot and diverse locations. Personally I've found combat system a little easy to my liking, and the amount of time you need to uncover a way to proceed through a level is typically ""just right"" in my opinion.. This was the second game i played from then star wars franchise. I remember how much i loved this game. Trully a masterpiece. THis game is amazing, one of the best Star Wars games ever if you love star wars you must play this. The story is amazing and characters are also great!!!. You can be a Jedi, use your super powers and your light saber to restore order in the galaxy. This alone guarantees a blue thumb, and I can tell you it feels so cool to be a Jedi in this game. I still have a few things to point out. First, the scenario is full of cliches and not totally coherent with the story of the saga (how the hell should you get Jedi powers from a sanctuary by diving into its big beam...). Second, pretty much like for the previous episodes (Dark Forces 1 and 2), the level design can sometimes be incredibly frustrating because you simply have no clue where to go. You go around, again and again, until you finally notice this explosive barrel outside your reach in the middle of nowhere, that you need to explode to go further in the level. I faced this situation several times, and it can be quite infuriating not to find the exit after inspecting every single detail of the map multiple times in a row. I would also add, although it's not a bad thing per se, that a large part of the weapons could be removed. I personally spent around 95% of my time with the light saber not caring about the rest. I am a Jedi, why the hell would I bother with anything else ? Besides this few points, if like me you sometimes dream to master the Force, this game is for you.. Played this game again after a long time and I have to say it has aged well and I still had a lot of fun playing it.. I will keep this short and sweet if you like any of the classic Star Wars game by Lucas Arts like Dark Forces this game is for you. Fun combat and great voice acting this is perfect for any STAR WARS fan before... well... EA before the dark times.... Before the Empire.... Combines fun, action packed gameplay with an interesting story. Great mechanics for lightsaber combat.. The game of my childhood and my first PC game when i was a kid. Played it countless times and hours and still do to this day!. One of the best Star Wars games ever made. In my opinion, it has the most authentic SW atmosphere among any other games (even KOTOR, which I truly love). Not to mention great, diverse levels, fantastic lightsaber and force power mechanics. I miss the times when developers have been making their games with such dedication. Hail to the LucasArts!. Its still an all around great game. The graphics were great to look at back in the day and they aged ok. The single player campaign is a very enjoyable experience. The multiplayer is one of the best I've played. Being a person that loves lists, and especially making my own, I could not resist but make a JK's (my initials are fitting) Top 10 PC Games of All Time list. On this list, at number 2 sat: JK II: Jedi Outcast. Why you ask? The answer is simple and straightforward; obscure and even malicious to an extent. Shi**in bricks while playing this game might be called an understatement. The graphics, animation, sound and music, all flamboyant material. A top notch grade. That doesn't make a game go on the top 10 list however. We would have hundreds upon hundreds of top games if that were the case. Here comes the kicker: Its the gameplay. When I tried the Force Unleashed; a spasm ran through my body, intensifying to a strong belch; it was nigh impossible to contain the gushing flow of half digested bodily fluids about to break free from my belly. At last I contained it. Why did I experience this spasm? Due to simple mechanics: a click of the button made my character make a somersault and slash the enemy straight in the face. *vomit now loading* Not here; in JK: you are the sword (or the saber rather). Every move Kyle executes is based on your input. You can of course click as if you are playing Cookie Clicker, but it would only amount to your immediate death. You had to learn the saber, and learn to fight like a Jedi. Rant ended. To this day I vividly remember: the family all moved to the living room to watch some movie, I was in the room with the monitor, smashing it hard. For 3 hours I was in sweet oblivion, fighting Tavion! What a fight that was! Till this day, one of the strongest gaming experiences in my life. For that fight alone, and for those sweet, unforgettable 3 hours this game get's a 10 and a ticket to the Hall of Fame. May the Force flow through you!. Excellent followup to Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight. A good continuation of the Kyle Katarn story with some graphical improvements, added features to lightsaber battling, and an intriguing storyline (love the cameos).. A star wars game anyone can enjoy. A story about revenge and redemption, with a fun gameplay. The level designs are diverse and fun and has one of the best difficulty systems.. One of the very best (Star Wars) games ever made, ever. Skip it's successor 'Jedi Academy', it has inferior leveldesign. This game has it all: complex leveldesign, the sense of exploration, hard secrets, intense gameplay and fighting, the Star Wars-universe, hours and hours of fun.... 11/10 The graphics werenÂ´t incredible for the year but... with some mods thats no Problem. This game on the Pc is a masterpiece, and the Multiplayer sistem is Brutal. iÂ´ve spend more than 800 Hours on the Multiplayer, Its poor PVP. The story was fine, would be so great if they could make a movie out of this game. Still fun to play in 2015, but as a game from the 2002 must say that Jedi knight II Jedi Outcast ist the best Starwars game ever created,. My favorite Star Wars title to this day. The combat is fast, complex, challenging, and fun. The light saber mechanics can be a little wonky at first, but it just takes a little getting used to. The level design is intricate and expansive, but sometimes can make you feel lost as the path forward is not always obvious. This game does not hold your hand and can be very difficult, especially if you choose to simply rush into everything. It's best to save often, as the level designers love to leave sneaky tricks such as trip bombs, rooms full of snipers or grenadiers, and first timer traps. What, did you think being a Jedi mercenary was going to be easy? Boss fights can be a real bear, as the the main villain and his number two will fling your bantha-herding butt around like a rag doll if you let them. I highly recommend using the dismemberment cheat (it's not really a cheat so much as a hidden setting, as it affects you as well). This will make the saber combat much more fulfilling when you win a fight, as well as sobering when you lose one (there's been many a time that some sith sent my head bouncing down a flight of stairs because I grew overconfident). I also recommend keeping a dedicated save file for the level with the huge hangar, as with the appropriate cheats you can spawn hordes of enemy sith for a massive saber battle (Be aware that spawning too many can cause the game to crash, but that's usually more than 50). Want to see Luke fight Desann? Spawn some with cheats and pop some popcorn! Be prepared to sweep up Luke's chopped up bits, though, because he's a bit of a weenie. Anyway, this game will leave you with great memories if you can forgive its little flaws and aging graphics. Despite its problems, I give this game a 10/10 because I still feel compelled to play it, even though its been 13 years since its release. You will probably never find a game that will make you feel more like a real Jedi than Jedi Outcast.. You know what? This game is **** I don't even want to choose more polite worda, this is **** Not because of combat system, graphics or something, no, it was actually good, but what KILLS this game is level design. That's it. Level design is so bad, it crushes all the good things in Jedi Outcast.. This is an example **** that has not aged all that well. I'm sure that when it came out in 2002 that it was solid and lots of fun. These days, the mechanics are pretty aged. I didn't like the way that the crosshairs on the guns would shift based on where they thought I wanted to shoot. The lightsaber mechanics are miles ahead of where they were in Jedi Knight, but I was a bit intimidated by the complexity of the moves. I couldn't quite figure out how to get my lightsaber to swing the way I wanted it to. I also found the storyline to be very straight forward and not too interesting. The character animations and voice acting were pretty bad by modern standards as well. I found the levels to be a little too nitpicky, similar to Jedi Knight. Too often, you find yourself backtracking and trying to find switches that you overlooked. When the action gets going in a straightforward manner, the game is at its best. When you're annoyed because you don't know what the game wants you to do is when the game struggles.. The game is decent despite its age, but suffers from difficulty peaks. The level design, complex, is a bit too confusing and an automap would have been helpful.Jedi Academy fixed those flaws providing a much more intuitive level design and a fairer difficulty.. Jedi Outcast was the first game that made players feel like they were in the Star Wars universe. Every music cue, sound effect, texture, object and character feel like they were pulled directly out of the film. The levels are sprawling, beautiful and immersive, making you feel like you are truly running around one of the sets from the movies. But what makes this game truly extraordinary is the gameplay. Never before and never since has there been a more elegant, nuanced and satisfying lightsaber mechanic in a Star Wars game. The force power system is also vastly improved here and the thrill of tossing around stormtroopers like rag dolls with the flick of a mouse never grows old. A truly epic adventure that I have installed on every computer I've owned since it was released.. I love the first Jedi Knight to death, so this was bound to be a disappointment for me, but it was actually surprisingly still pretty good, not as good as the first and the Mysteries of the Sith, but still pretty strong Star Wars FPS experience. 8/10. Simply Amazing. Overall storyline is good with great voice animation, graphics are excellent (considering it was made in 2002) and the combined use of ranged weapons, a lightsaber and the force make combat very interesting and varied. Simple things such as being able to cut off the arms of stormtroopers with your lightsaber and changing your style of lightsaber attack make the game so good. I've played the game for about 12 years and still haven't got bored or tired of it! Certainly a game I'll remember for a long time. If you don't have it then why are you reading this? It's only Â£7 on steam!!!!! :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.].

Many reviewers like to get a âfeelâ for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no âhalfâ or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a âfeature quotaâ. Games that excel in both areas of a section donât receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the âwildcardâ section.

This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. One of my favorites... ive always loved the gameplay the lightsaber choreography is probably one of the best...when you experience a lightsaber duel you feel like your having a duel and not just slicing the npc till one of you **** the difficulty ill be honest its not an easy game at all you will die alot but fortunatly you can save anytime anywhere u like and trust me use it as often as possible esspecially when your facing dark **** graphics well there older but very well done for the **** not gonna go much more into it just be warned this game is not for the easily frusterated it is difficult like i said but you feel like you achieved greatness once you get past that obstacle your having trouble with or beating that boss who is kicking your ass..i recommend it to anyone who is a fan of star wars or just an action adventure or sci fi fan. This game is just one heck of a fun game. I especially love the lightsaber fights. If you love Star Wars, I believe this is definitely a must-buy. But just remember, old games take patience with some of the puzzles, quite difficult at times.. Im not sure what to think of this game, when i bought it on release i liked it even if it had some frustrating elements. Such as: * The map designs are awful and you occasionally get stuck wandering about trying to find your way only to realize that you were suppose to go in a direction that doesnt make any sense at all (appearently i wasnt suppose to walk out on the lenghty bridge that looks like its leading on the right direction, instead you have to jump out of a window in a dark corner). * Enemy snipers are ridiculously accurate and fast on the trigger even on normal difficulty. * Scripted ambushes, get used to them. * Hitting enemies with laser pistols and rifles can be a tedious business. Trying to hit constantly strafing foes with laser lights that travel at the speed of small rodents gets old pretty quickly. Instead I just run in a straight line towards them holding down the fire button. Doesnt sound like an intresting gun fight at all now does it. * Grenade throwers, they are everywhere. Strangely enough often in tiny rooms. * Did i hit with my light saber or not? Maybe, who knows. The light saber fights are often just a shiny mess. So there are alot of frustrating issues with the game, but for some reason i keep getting back to it. I turn it off with a sigh but i still start it a few hours again later. So there is obviously some appeal in it, i dont know what it is though =P.. If you love Star Wars based multiplayer, then you will find the most complex Saber fight system with force powers ever in Jedi Knight 2 version 1.02. It's really important to have 1.02 because they cut the whole gameplay mechanics down in the patches. JK2 steam is patched to 1.04. So you have to downgrade it if you want to have full use of weapons such as blasters, lightsabers and of course force powers! v1.02 Gameplay: ****/watch?v=eehKizfl0UM v1.04 Gameplay: ****/PxcIa0UbB6Q Downgrade the game: ****.html How to: unpackage it in the gamedata folder of JK2, start the **** to change the version to 1.02. If you got any questions, feel free to visit: **** List why 1.03/1.04 patches ruined the game: Too high kicks, 2 times pressing of space for kicking (no combos anymore) When you are down you immediately jump up again and about 10 meters high. (no ""kick down and dfa move"" anymore) Highest saber damage you can do: 20 hp Kick damage: 4hp No doubles, triples anymore with special attacks Force powers are useless at all You can't aim with special attacks they made them stucked. You can kill only by saberthrow+kick spam or forward walking and red swing spam. Pull Kick yoyo or pull kick at all won't work anymore. Grip is useless, you can't move the contrahent by it. No doom throws with grip from long distances anymore. Movement is from SP feels like in a pudding sauce. No straight strafe jumping anymore no flying with adbs through several opponents On many servers swearing is censored and you can't kill people who pressed esc or are typing. If someone is shilding all the time, you won't be able to kill him maximal dmg attack: 20hp. No uppercut flying anymore No yellow/blue fast-paced swings with overlapped hits (you know when he cancels one swing to do the other the same time which leads to multi hits) Invisible absorb until someone uses pull/push/drain/lightning/grip No saberfreeze as a tactic, no saberbug-attack in grip as a counter attack.. Jedi Outcast is a special kind of bad: it frustrates in a multitude of ways. Gun mechanics are unwieldy with the crosshair changing position on the screen, lightsaber combat is incomprehensible and generally ends with the good ol' Kyle dying a horrible and sudden death after a long spectacle, the levels are as unintuitive as if they had been designed by the Zodiac killer, there is a mandatory stealth section that activates an arbitrary death cutscene when spotted, the lightsaber consistently failed to protect me from explosive weapons- -I'll cut this short: WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.. Jedi Outcast has its rough parts and its good parts. The story is very good, I can't really say much before spoiling anything though. The graphics are good for its time and the voice acting is great as well as some characters from the movies such as Lando which is awesome! If all that stuff is great then why did you only give it a 6 out of 10 you ask? Because it's repetitive and the puzzles are frustrating and the gun play isn't the best I've seen and the level design is bad and Kyle looks ugly. The first few levels is just guns and shooting Stormtroopers which I thought was pretty fun at first. Then after only a little while you get a lightsaber. But just because you finally get the epic lightsaber which is a blast to use it doesn't mean the game gets much better. The game makes you rage in so much ways but mostly because of the horrible puzzles which really lets the game down. The puzzles on its own takes 3 points away from me giving the game 9/10. The game has its fun moments from time to time as well as funny moments but most of it isn't very fun. Then the Multiplayer isn't amazing which took away 1 point. The Multiplayer is good but I find it to get boring after about two matches. There isn't much lightsaber customization or force power customization nor is there much game modes. You get to pick the classic Team Free For All and normal FFA as well as CTF and Duel mode. Duel mode is great, CTF isn't as fun as Duel Mode but is still fun but FFA and Team FFA get boring very quickly. You get to pick any character you want in Multiplayer which is cool and there is a lot of maps to play on but not all work very well when playing with bots. Often on maps with huge endless pits to fall down into the bots just walk off the edge. The bots are pretty smart though and are as much fun as playing with real people, unfortunately not much people play this game online any more. This game can be good at times but it has a lot of down falls that take away from me giving the game a perfect 10. I suggest getting Jedi Academy which is the game after this one because I think it is MUCH better especially on Multiplayer but I think Single-Player is much better too. I give Jedi Outcast 6/10-OK.. This was a great game when it came out, with plenty of lore, customization and a feeling for the post-trilogy Jedi scene. The depth of feeling like a Jedi has only been matched by a few other games, Kotor and Swtor and outcast namely. G4's review would be spot on if this were a new release, but compared to many games that came out around the time this one did... definitely worthy of at least an 80% Check your calendars boys this was released in September 2003 almost ten years of gaming advancements and I still want to replay this game.. This is one of my favorite games of all time. The Multiplayer mode was intense. I remember wasting many hours a day dueling sith-spit on Bespin Streets. The Single Player levels has a striking resemblance to Dark Forces 2 in terms of design, length and difficulty. Simply one of the best games released to PC.. The best Star Wars game, period. Also, if you play on the older version 1.02 rather than the newest version 1.04 that removed a lot of features, this game requires a tremendous amount of skill. One of the all-time top skill-based games that I have played.. Jedi Outcast is an all-around great game. While the single player campaign is certainly enjoyable, the light saber battles in multi-player are what really sets this game apart from the rest. Include a generous assortment of force powers to the mix and this is one incredibly entertaining classic. You can't call yourself a Star Wars fan if you don't own this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best game in my list, very fun, old, has almost everything u could possibly want in a game, has sp and mp. has custom maps, skins, mods, servers, styles, and add ons u can get for free, lasting gameplay-9 fun-10 style-9 upgradability-10 ur own stuff all the way. For me, it was a low budget version of Star Wars Battlefront, with appalling graphics, hundreds of glitches and confusing gameplay. It was excrutiatingly boring and I was disappointed with the whole layout of the game.. An FPS with the story and voice acting of an RPG. If you played and liked Dark Forces 2, you'll love this game. If you played Jedi Academy.. meh, not so sure you will like it. In my opinion, It's a game that achieves in every way excepted. The fights never get old. The thrills some cutscene can bring matches with Dark Forces 2 and the films. Level design and puzzles are milestones.. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game. The technical side is ok, apart from the physics, which are irritating when it comes to the thermal detonators (seldom can you see such an unrealistic bounce, even in games using the same engine). Graphically, the game is very decent, taking into account when it was made, but one has to admit that the quake 3 engine has ages very gracefully. Having written that the game is one of the most frustrating ones I've played in a long while. You start out with about 4 hours of boring, repetitive missions, puzzles which are often irritating due to their difficulty. The level design also leaves a bit to be desired, though its not very bad. The weapons are very nice, though the aiming system is less than acceptable (at least for me). On the whole, I tried to give this game a chance to grow on me, but it did not succeed. I actually enjoy Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, with its dated engine, poor graphics, etc _much_ more than this one.","the lightsaber combat is amazing especially since it includes dismemberment of models and the multiplayer is fun and so is the cast . although the story was shallow, the gameplay was very entertaining. you can feel nostalgic ."
373.Wipeout HD Fury,"Truly one of the best anti gravity racers ever made, with many track layouts that challenges you in different ways, ships that have different playstyles and game modes that focus on different game mechanics. It is easy to learn, but hard to master, and that becomes evident as you play on the campaign, with each part getting harder and harder, being also really evident on the zone mode, that truly pushes you to the limits and requires you to have almost perfect reflexes on higher levels. Definetly one of the best racing games I've ever played. Don't know why but I prefer ps2 titles better. I see that it's just HD version of PURE and PULSE (with same gameplay as PULSE, not PURE) but something doesn't feel right.. I was never a Wipeout fan but when I got round to giving HD & Fury a run for their money I couldn't help but have my mouth agape and smiling consistently through my experience. The visual effects are mind boggling, this is easily the best looking game I have ever played. The frame rate stays at a smooth 60FPS and the action is fast paced yet never becomes too hectic. The multiplayer is fun but a novelty at best, singleplayer is where Wipeout HD's loyalties lie and where the fun ensues.. Wipeout HD Fury has great graphics, moves like lightning and offers a solid sci-fi racing experience. It also allows you to import a custom soundtrack, which is always a plus. Despite it's thrilling nature, however, the campaign isn't set up in a very compelling way. There just isn't enough in the way of rewards to motivate you into playing obsessively. Still, if you're in the market for a futuristic racer, Wipeout HD Fury is undoubtedly top of it's class.. More game modes, more tracks, definitely worth expanding your Wipeout HD experience with Fury. The new vehicles are alright, too. The additional stats rebalance some of the rides, so there's that to look forward to.. WipEout HD was awesome, this expansion is awesome too. I don't know, but this is great game to play. Although I still don't really know how to control the ship's manuevers, but it was like when I played Sonic Riders and SR: Zero Gravity with my brother. the gameplay is basically on futuristic tracks. So it's cool!! This is definitely one of the best PSN games ever!!!. Not that I don't like the game, but they're are adds, like full on commercials before each race. I paid for it too, they're no excuse for adds in a paid game. DIsgraceful. Great game and the immersion is better in 3D. The sense of depth makes it a bit easier to navigate the courses at high speed but it still takes some time to master. The 3D patch/update is free - you've gotta love that! The only catch: it's maxed at 720p (Sony's 3D requirement for high frame rates) but if it worked at a high frame rate at 1080p I'd like to see it. With Sony granting an exception for GT5 with 1080p 3D let's hope they relax the rules a bit for other games (quality permitting).. For me, Wipeout HD Fury is the best PS3 exclusive. Wipeout games consistently strive to deliver the same things, and Wipeout HD Fury succeeds with them all: clean, crisp and colourful visuals; tight, responsive controls; challenging courses and varied modes of play; great soundtrack and effects; and speed. Plus, it has an online mode which in my experience so far has never suffered from lag. Extra marks go to the feature that allows you to create your own soundtrack from any playlists stored on your PS3. This can really add to the intensity and enjoyment and helps to make Wipeout HD YOUR game. Even without the Fury expansion (although there's really no reason to only purchase the original version given that both are available on a single disc version), it's a cracking game.. This a is a quality racer and a such a low price an absolute bargain both HD and FURY campaigns which is more than enough for players to get the hang of WOHD and when your done with single player theres a nice variety of online modes to keep you busy. Online up to 8 players can compete in races with or without weapons, eliminator mode for obliterating one another with the ability to flip and go in the opposite direction of other pilots for tactical effect, zone battle which leaves the open choice of boosting to further reach the zone target and moving a much greater speed or shields to regenerate shields lost from impact as well as temporary shielding from all damage. For the graphics fans among you you'll pleased to know that the game displays in 1080p at 60fps not bad for those with fancy tvs and even better with a 3D tv to boot!. Wipeout HD Fury is the best version of Wipeout ever. I've been playing since the first version on the PSOne and this is how I dreamed the game to be in the future. Wipeout HD is amazing, but somehow it lacks some fury in it. The graphics are fast, but a bit dull, and so were the ship models. Fury has changed all this adding the dark twist this wonderful game needed. Not to mention all the ship upgrades, new circuits, new game modes and new music. Simply a must for any wipeout fan.","the visual effects are mind boggling, this is easily the best looking game . multiplayer is fun but a novelty at best, singleplayer is where the fun ensues . despite its thrilling nature, the campaign isn't set up in a compelling way ."
374.Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack,"fantastic sequel for the era it came it define a generation for it's universe, with epic music too. Great extra maps the only reason it gets an 8 is because they should have been included in the game at release. This game had a hellish development (look into it if interested) so Bungie had to cut a lot of material and use it in 3 or make a map pack like this. You have to also remember when this came out Xbox Live was very young (like 2 years old) and it was not as popular as it is today. Partly because internet was still very slow for most people.",the only reason it gets an 8 is because they should have been included in the game at release . partly because internet was still very slow for most people when this came out .
375.Borderlands 2,"my **** character got corrupted **** you randy fix your **** game!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best looter shooter i have played. Its a perfect sequel doubling down on everything, expanding, and improving its systems. Story is solid, handsome jack is a really fun villain and a lot of the characters here are memorable enough, with fun facts, like tina and her lazy eye. The main problem is the lack of acknowledgement of the vault hunter a lot of times when you do something they take the credit, especially in the ending even tho you are really fundamental to everything you are seen as a mere tool, that is also a 4 man army. Gameplay is incredible, sound design isnt the best but aside from that it has really good atributes, incredible gunplay, gun variety and design, that makes you play the game in various aproaches along with lots of enviroments, snow, hills, deserts and wastelands with varying color palette and ageless art style of sobel. Good enemy variety robots, bandits, psychos each with its own unique enemies, goliaths, constructors, drones and badasses, my only gripe is that you might be fighting robots most of the time (main campaign). Soundtrack isnt really memorable there is a couple good ones but nothing that stands out. Classes are really good, varied with a lot of potential and playstyles and techniques to learn. DLC is really good (except hammerlock one). Tons of easter eggs to games movies comics and books. And not only as cheap as 10$ it has a lot of replay value and lot of content. Farming is mostly optional but rewarding AF and satisfactory too. And there is some unintentional techniques that enhances the game like rocket jumping. Some issues are incredibly unbalanced endgame where you really need to know the game to survive, and limits a lot your build potential and makes raid bosses something almost impossible without glitching or cheesing. Characters sometimes can be so broken they are boring. A lot of weapons are unusuable in UVHM. Conection issues from time to time. Lacks a lot of qol stuff that is in 3. A lot of side missions feel unrewarding. Vehicles could be better. Shops and slot machines are interesting but needs better rewards or better probability (shops feel a lot better in TPS). Altough humor is pretty nice a lot of times there is cringe and toilet jokes.. this is a perfection of the borderlands 1 formula the gameplay is even better It doesn't have character building issues because the trees are so much better balanced every character is very fun to play with and doesn't feel super constricting to one play style and it has the best loot system I have ever seen as well the 360 version is very well optimized for playing with poor Wi-Fi this game has so much flavor and so much heart in it it's unbelievable, just an amazing game something that I would recommend playing through but I will warn the final boss is a little bit of a pushover. BL2 is a super fun looter shooter. It also features one of the best written video game villains ever.. Borderlands 2 is a chaotic experience filled with all kinds of humor that keeps you more engaged as you play more.. Absolute bomb! A must play! I devoured everything from this game. Grab a friend and reek some havoc!. major QoL gameplay improvements over BL1. Has the best story in the series, and better pacing than BL3, but the gunplay is not satisfying as BL1 or BL3. It's good as a standalone first-time intro to the series, very immersive and arguably the best multiplayer experience too.. The game starts good and with a little bit of funny humor, after that it takes too long to kill with short amount of ammo too much enemies, then repeating, you have to start from places where you already went, you get lost and you lose yourself, the map in this game helps in the beginning but in the middle of the game it's nearly impossible to find your right destination because the places are too huge. I hope that games like this will not be produced again because i already played 10 years before this game came out excellent games like Zelda Ocarina of time that were worth to play.. Good game but completing the game for 3 times to get all levels and content is not for me. A product of it's time, but in it's time it was like nothing else. Too much time played in smelly basements next too friends to rate it as poorly as its held up.. The reason why I gave this a seven is because I really wasnât in to the borderlands games this game was really just not for me. Really fun game! Handsome Jack was a funny character and the story was nice.. Borderlands 2, while a solid entry in the series, didn't quite capture my heart the way the first game did. It seemed like the weapon generation system was a bit less refined, resulting in weapons that felt of lower quality and with less attention to detail. Additionally, I remember that the inventory menu was somewhat more complicated compared to the first game, which made item management less straightforward.However, the standout feature of this game is undoubtedly the antagonist, Handsome Jack. He is a villain who's both wicked and incredibly charismatic, adding depth and intrigue to the storyline. Despite my reservations about certain changes, the presence of Handsome Jack and his dynamic character brought a unique and enjoyable element to the game.. Amazing FPS loot game that contains endless fun. Krieg is my baby :3. If I gave ChatGPT a prompt to generate the most average FPS in existence, it would probably be this. Nothing remarkable, no stakes or real purpose, just shooting up funny bad guys with pretty cool graphics. Probably won't keep your attention too much, but it can be fun.. Best part of the series. The look is beautiful, the story hilarious and the gameplay nearly perfect. Overall rating: 9.1.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While undeniably possessing the strongest levels of writing and characterization among any game in the mainline series, I would humbly argue that BL2 has some of the least engaging mechanics and gameplay. If you play this game, it will likely be Handsome Jack (as well as some of the other characters) that keeps you hooked. However, this is not to say that the gameplay on offer is not strong - much of what was on offer in BL1 is still here, but some of its novelty is lost, and I personally saw the removal of some of the more niche RPG mechanics (such as levelling up proficiencies with specific gun types) as a negative. Most people see BL2 as the best game in the franchise, and while I may not personally agree with this opinion, the game is still a great one that 100% deserves to stand alongside the other games in the series, especially due to its strong narrative.. This is the greatest video game of all time. Handsome Jack is the greatest villain in video game history only rivaled by Vaas.. Good game. Various quests and good jokes. My only problem with this franchise overall is that characters only have one skill and your progression is only through guns and passives. I dont have any reason to replay the game with another class, because in the end, its just shoot with your weapon and sometimes use your ability.. Amazing game, every inch of this game is covered in bloody fun from beginning to end. The enemies and bosses combined with the loot grinding never gets old and feels so satisfying when you get an insanely fun drop that changes the way you do combat in the game. The loot in this game is ridiculously diverse and allows so much re-playability along with the six different and unique vault hunters you can use, not to mention being able to switch any weapon from one character to another you have. The story and characters are all done perfectly with a plethora of different takes from comedy to adventure to mystery to suspense to emotional loss to badassery and so much more. The unique world and all its designs give it a less dungeon feel and make it seem all most like an open world. Honestly this game has everything a looter shooter lover could ever want, it sits at number 2 on my list for best games ever played.. It was an amazing improvement from the first part! Also, all the DLC were totally worth it, amazing main and side stories. I really enjoyed hating Handsome Jack. An improvement over the original. This is one of those bigger and better sequels. A must-play for fans of cooperative shooters. It ranks up with Dishonored and Far Cry 3 as one of 2009's best action games. I would rate Borderlands 2 with a 9 out of 10.. Everything the first one had to offer but better! Great story with one of the protagonist (the character I actually chose in part 1), being the leader now.. This game is way better than the first borderlands, It funnier, smother, and looks **** awesome this is easily one of my newest Favorite games of all time, defiantly worth buying ^wrote this in 2012^ I love Borderlands 2. It's just incredibly fun. When purchased borderlands 2 I would have been playing hours and hours of Halo 3 and Reach with my childhood friend. We then started just playing this for hours and hours. Going through every quest, playing through all the side quests. WE WOULD SPEND HOURS in this game world. Getting to love the characters, the setting. I really need to go back after finishing Borderlands 3 and just enjoy the game again. Been way too long.. aside from the last single player dlc that released for this game it is the only thing saving the game from absolute mediocrity. the humor can be compared to that unfunny friend who thinks they are the wittiest person in the room rather they are merely being tolerated because their circle of friends is much too kind and they are not honest enough to tell them that their jokes are not funny and their presence is intolerable and awkward. the gore is also a sever downgrade from the first one, e.g there is just no crunch when you perforate the various unfriendly denizens of Pandora, it just does not have the same punch the first borderlands did. also the kooky characters that were added were not funny and only ever cringe worthy in the worst possible way, e.g tiny Tina the quirkiest , quirkster of quirksville also Antony birch is a poor writer. just to back up my review i have played all dlc as well as playing through the game twice as well as playing the (supposedly deemed PC master race version that adds nothing of value). This is probably the best Borderlands so far, I vae completed this game like 5 times, it is just too fun. Borderlands 2 is my favorite game of all time. I love absolutely everything about it, even all the bugs.. This is one of the best games i have ever played. They still support it, and the first year we got 4 great DLC Expansions followed by the 2nd year getting 4 more DLC Expansions even though they were much shorter. They also had 2 level upgrades and the 2nd one allowed you to run the gauntlet to unlock OP8 which made it ever funner. 10.0 without a doubt and i hope Borderlands 3 will be even better. The only negative thing to this game is if your after certain things farming can be a quick or long process depending on what your exactly after, but with 6 character classes and 4 player coop its still one of my favorites to date.. A huge improvement on the already amazing first game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is dare I say perfect, the animation and graphics are great. There's more bosses, more guns, more places and tons of more content in general. The game is fun, exciting and hilarious. What more could you ask for. Rating - 98%. This is one of my best video games of all time. It like a upgraded version of the first game but way better. We can unlock skins, not take fall damage, you can move when you're down, get stronger weapons, and the map to this game is much better than the first. You have this cool memorable villain and recognize characters from the previous game and it's basically gun porn of video games. This game actually feels like a true Action Adventure Open World FPS role-playing game.. Simply attractive game! looking at my playing hours so far could tell its awesomeness! graphic : 8 sound : 8 story : 7 (crazy and silly) gameplay : 10 ( its an endless fun). Borderlands 2 does EVERYTHING better than its predecessor!! The game itself is a post apocalyptic/space western RPG game blended with a FPS shooter. Honestly, if you like games like Diablo and Call of Duty, you'll REALLY enjoy this game. Best of all, its funny, flashy and best of all, has LOTS of guns!! It's main feature is the campaign and doesn't have competitive multiplayer, BUT it does have 4 player co-op which gets more difficult and rewarding when you have more players in your team. (max 4) Along with it's DLC, this game will last you a good month with regular game play. (Possibly more with multiple playthroughs) There are 4 different UNIQUE and two optional DLC ones. Each with their own powers, skill tree, personalities and play-style. It's only drawbacks is traveling when you first start and moving to fast travel locations. On-foot movement is sluggish and make the game boring when you've revisited or explored an area mutliple times. Also, a few of the quests can get repetitive, but getting loot makes it rewarding enough to balance the repetition. OVERALL: Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game and blends a lot of good ideas in an entertaining experience single player or with friends!!. The first question people will likely ask is, ""Does this game live up to BL1 and DLC?"" and that answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" The second question, ""Is it better than BL1?"" and the answer is ""**** the most part."" So what's improved? Better gun mechanics (sound and feel), more humor, more frequent boss and sub-boss battles, easier to get a co-op game going and see who's online playing, character skill trees are improved, friends can select quests in co-op games rather than having to tell the ""party leader"" to do it, the new enemies are well designed, you can now dismember baddies, you can now tag items in your inventory as ""trash"" or ""favorite"" so you remember what to sell next time at the vending machine, you can now directly trade with people, you automatically pick up money and ammo (but thankfully not loot) and combat is more organic (enemies take cover, flank you, dodge attacks). So what's the negatives? The new menus are clunky and difficult to parse, missions still consist of mostly ""shoot that"" or ""find this,"" driving mechanics are about the same (though thankfully you don't take damage from hitting enemies as much), level design can be really confusing at times even with the new HUD mini map and sometimes there's simply too much dialogue happening simultaneously. For example if you're playing co-op the first big town you get to is a total cluster as multiple characters are introducing themselves cutting off the others dialogue. I find myself saying, ""what is going on?"" much more regularly during this game than BL1. That said, these are only minor complaints and the additions far outweigh the handful of small issues. In short, if you loved the first BL stop reading this review and go pick up the sequel!.. Borderlands 2 is a game like no other. I am possibly the biggest fan of customization within a game that has ever lived and this game offers just that. From the millions of different weapons to skill trees to Badass Points and more, this game allows you to play the way YOU want to play. Along with the amazing amount of variety in player customization, there is also a tremendous amount of variety in the enemies and settings you encounter. The landscapes are beautifully done and the amount of places you travel is simply astonishing. I have played through this game 3 times so far and still love every minute of it. I have yet to find a game (besides Borderlands 1) that can compare. If you enjoyed playing Borderlands 1 or are simply looking for a game that offers endless amounts of replay value derived from its sensational amount of customization (or if you love loot!!!), look no further. TRY THIS GAME. :). It takes long time and many shots to kill enemy, sometimes forever. I have to go back to place I went. I get lost. I sometimes don't know what to do. I hate the annoying animals. Horrible game.. Incredibly fun game, and one of my favorites. A huge improvement over the first game, **** one. Some of the most satisfying gunplay in any first person shooter, and the variety of the randomized guns that you can find dropped by enemies, in vending machines, chests, and random piles of rubbish gives the game an addictive quality. The writing is great (although, admittedly, the humor can be sort of hit-and-miss at times) and the presentation is very slick looking, offering a more pleasing aesthetic than its predecessor while maintaining the same general look. Tons of fun both single-player and co-op.. Diablo with guns, but not with the randomly generated environments. Unlimited loot and the guns are just awesome. It's great to find that ONE gun that's just perfect. This is a must play with all the DLCs. With split screen is a must play. THIS GAME ROCKS. This is my favorite game to date. The environments had a lot of replayability, the boss battles were memorable, and the loot was 2nd to none. Played this game and all of its DLC. The DLC overall was good, but the 2nd DLC was lacking. My only complaint is that more people do not own this game, so there aren't as many match making lobbies as there should be.. What isn't to like about this game? Lots of areas to explore, infinite gun possibilities, great A.I., and awesome 4 player coop. The graphics on Xbox 360 look pretty good and the frame-rate seems stable.. I don't know how this game got so popular i just started and i keep dieing nonstop to level 3 enemy's. So far it is very frustrating. no way to change difficulty in game probably have to start a new one or hack the game.. While Borderlands may been known for it's wacky (and brilliant) world, Borderland's 2 also does shooting and Role Playing so well that it feels like a true adventure.. This is how every sequel should be. 2009's Borderlands proved that originality isn't dead just yet by splicing two videogaming staples together, the RPG and the FPS. The end result was an absorbing adventure which especially shone in co-op with friends. Borderlands 2 quite simply ditches everything from the first game that didn't work while retaining everything that did and cranking it up to 61. How do I love Borderlands 2? Let me count the ways. Firstly, apart obviously from its predecessor, the game is unlike anything else out there. It blows my mind that no other company has even attempted to rip off the Borderlands formula in the past four years. Next, looting. I love to collect loot. I'm obsessive compulsive about finding a gun with a tenth of a second faster reload time, or with 1 extra bullet in the clip, or a shield with a couple of thousand extra damage in its nova, or a class mod with slightly quicker health regen. Only in special games would you care about such things, but Borderlands 2 makes you care. In this respect the game shares much in common with #9 on my list. Every time I levelled up I was rushing to the skill trees to see what exciting new unique abilities I could upgrade my character with. The depth of customisation by the end-game is immense, with the right investments you can really configure some staggeringly powerful builds. The game is still being strongly-supported with new characters and campaign DLCs almost a year after its release, with more recently announced to be incoming. But one element really steals the show - the characters. Seen through the eyes of a brand new batch of vault hunters, the playable cast of the first game, who feature in the second as NPCs, take on an elevated sense of majesty. Claptrap is back and is as tragic and loveable as ever. In addition, Scooter, Moxxi, Dr. Zed and crew are joined by a host of other new Pandora residents, the writing for most of whom is stellar. Tiny Tina just makes the entire game. The icing on the cake is one of the best bad guys to grace the medium - Handsome Jack, equal parts stand-up comedian and evil genius. You will love him one minute and hate him the next, you will laugh and you will cry. It's wonderful to experience the whole thing online with your friends, coming up with strategies to survive some of the trickier situations (especially on Ultimate Vault Hunter mode), sharing out loot depending on which class everyone is playing, and just enjoying the unfolding story together. We danced and ate pizza with Claptrap. We played chicken in Ellie's car crusher. We hunted rare varkids in the Caustic Caverns and we helped Tina get revenge on Fleshstick. Best tea party ever.. A mix between a role playing game and a first person shooter. How could that turn out? Fortunately, it turned out pretty awesome. I haven't played the first game but I know about it's ending. The game starts with the vault from the first game containing an element called eridium in it, and an evil bad guy organization called the Hyperion corporation is using the eridium to advance technology and tame the savage alien world known as Pandora. The leader handsome jack wants to find a vault that has an unknown power in it called the warrior. Four new vault hunters come to Pandora on a train looking for the same vault, but handsome jack leaves a surprise for them and blows up the train. The vault hunters are lead to safety by a female AI known as angel and a robot known as Claptrap. They join a resistance group and try to stop Handsome jack and get to the vault first. There are some very unexpected twists and most of the characters are memorable. Handsome jack is a very **** villain, and I like that because most video game villains these days have no personality. And claptrap is hilarious and my all time favorite robot now. (Sorry r2-d2) The gameplay is superb. At the beginning you choose one of the four vault hunters as your character. There's the commando, siren, gunzerker, and assassin. Each one has their own unique abilities and skill trees to upgrade. You have the world of pandora to explore, and fast travel anywhere in it. It's very diverse, there's a snowy place, desert, acid caves, mountains, a city, and a it's absolutely huge and you can drive around it also. There are story missions and side missions, and you'll need to do missions to level up your character, because the enemies get pretty tough. There really are a gazillion guns, and you will rarely come across the same gun twice. Some have elemental effects such as fire or electricity. The enemies range from measly little bandits to gigantic worms with tentacles. The enemies are challenging and have there own weaknesses. You also earn badass tokens for completing challenges, and badass tokens permanently upgrade stats such as maximum health or melee damage across all four characters. The graphics in this game are plain awesome, when standing atop a mountain or tower you can see so much of pandora around you. The cel shaded art style fits well with this game and makes it more colorful and fits along with the humorous tone. The sound is great, at times this cool futuristic action music play, and all the guns sound different and distinct. The voice acting is convincing, and there are a lot of funny moments and stupid jokes thrown in there to make you laugh. So, do you like RPGs? Then buy it. Like open world games? Buy it. First person shooters? BUY IT!!! This game exceeded my expectations and gave me more than what I asked for. My only real complaint is that it can be cheap sometimes and kill you out of knowhere. And navigation can be slightly annoying, but those are just nitpicks. For 20 bucks, your getting 200-250 hours worth of game time , so this is definitely something you should get.. this is one of the best games of this generation uniuque conicept until destiny bascally stole its ideas funny characters like claptrap and borderlands 2 is one of the best and most uniuqe game of last gen. Loot gathering gone even more insane, Borderlands 2 adds way more variety to the shields, grenades, class mods, and elements. The storyline has been greatly improved and the skill trees are even more mental. I loved playing through the game, the first time. 2K has unfortunately ruined this games second play through (True Vault hunter mode) if you are choosing to go it alone. The difficulty ramp up is manageable in the general areas, but the boss fights are no longer any sort of fun. 2K, this game has lost the replay-ability that made the first one of my favourite games. In spite of all the upgrades, this franchise has taken a step back for me. A great game that if you have lots of friends who can play, enjoy. If you like to go it alone, not quite as good as the first.. Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game to play with friends. Collecting loot is as fun as ever, and the story is hilarious the whole time. It is just as good, if not better, than it's predecessor.. I was having fun for the first two levels then after that, the enemies started to become WAY TO OP!!!! I spent two hours trying to save the bird for a claptrap upgrade. I get spawn killed every time, I can't believe that I wasted $20 on crap that boring. The weapons were ok but way to weak. The is the most unbalanced game I've ever played, It's so stupid how I face level 20s while still a 15. It sounds little but it is a HUGE gap! It should be that the enemies are THE EXACT level as you for a good balance. This game deserves more than 0 but it's made by 2k which they are corrupted. The only thing I find entertaining out of this game is jack.. I've sunk around 800 hours over 2 years into BL2. I just finished off all of the dlc and have finally had my fill. This is a game designed to be replayed over and over and provides so much gameplay/shooting for the price it.. Borderlands 2 is a game that will make you laugh while you enjoy exploring the world around you. I play the game again and again and I always find something new or funny that i didn't find before. Also has one of the best villains that you love to hate in a long time. The only reason Borderlands 2 gets a 9 and not a 10 is because when in multiplayer the loot is not separate to each player but shared making getting one of the BAZILLION new guns hard when not playing with a friend. Never the less, this is a great game I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun enjoyable time.. This game will always be my favorite because of how good the 4 player co-op is. If you want a game were you can sit back have a couple of laughs and play with some friends this is the perfect game. The characters, witty dialog, map, guns, loot, and gameplay are just some of the things that make this game great. It takes everything from the original and makes it better like all sequels should and it make you want to play more. The best way to experience this game is with some friends. Definitely the best game to come out in 2012 and i cant wait for borderlands the pre-sequel .. This game is great !! first one was good and it's just better !! exploration, missions, fu**** sick guns, insane shooting action, cool graphics, funny characters, etc. buy it if you dont have it can't wait for the next one. I have put almost 300 hours into this game. It is really one of the most re-playable experiences I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The story is much better than the first, and the characters seem much more relatable and ""real"". On top of that, the game is hilarious. All the classes serve a specific role and are mostly pretty balanced and fun to play. However, there are a few minor annoyances that prevent the game from a perfect score. However, there have always been a few problems with this game that stem directly from the gameplay. First of all, about 15-20% of the weapons are completely useless. Not even considering rarity. All of the shotguns **** except for legendaries and one type that improves accuracy as you shoot (like Moxxi's Heartbreaker). 99% of the needle guns are useless. The sledge ball guns are awful. Meanwhile, find a plasma caster of the same level and rarity, and you can literally **** everything with little to no effort. The weapons are horribly unbalanced sometimes. The Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is also annoying to play. It isn't hard as much as it feels cheap. You can get downed, barely get a revival off of a nearby enemy, but only to get taken down to 5% of your health immediately and go down again. It is very frustrating and really only feels cheap instead of challenging. I have always felt that the second-wind system could be improved much more than it is. (Also, waiting a full half minute to respawn compared to the original is annoying) The baddass rank system **** as well. It basically maxes out at +10% to all your stats, which requires at least a couple hundred hours of playing. 10% to all your stats isn't really anything. Turning it off is honestly negligible. The old weapon proficiency system was much better and rewarding. The game has a low framerate too, in places such as Murderlin's temple I would go below twenties. That is shameful on a 360. And not being able to redeem gold keys without xbox live gold? That's **** stupid. Regardless, the game is awesome and everyone who likes shooters and RPG's should play this one.. Just became a memeber and just want to say borderlands 2 goty year edition Is awsome and amazing having so much fun playing with family and friends If you havent played it what you watin for enjoy. BL is hands down my all time favorite series (I love the cel-shaded visual style and the mashing of FPS+RPG). BL2's storyline is much more engaging than **** second installment has even more humor than the first, with more quirky characters. I'm playing as Maya, the siren. The skill trees in BL2 have more to choose from than BL1 and they even added skin/head color/style choices for your character. The maps for different areas of Pandora spread out more than BL1, so there are even more creatures and bandits to score loot from. The side missions are just as humorous and aid in gaining experience. Without the side missions, it gets a little tough to run through the main story line as a single player. Luckily my bf can easily join my game and help me out if I don't feel like spending some time leveling up with side missions. I haven't completed the entire game with Maya, but I do plan to play all 4 main characters. That's how awesome this game is. I can't get enough.. Borderlands 1, with better skills, better skill trees, more guns, and violence. This is the epitome of a the FPS RPG hybrid genre, For those Call of Duty players interested in this title, don't be expecting a fast trigger finger to be all you need. Plotting out your skills, your class mod, not to mention taking the right weapons into battle, all make the difference in what takes place. Plenty of side quests and DLC to keep you playing for days.. Borderlands 2 is a strange game, unlike any others. The graphics, combat and voice acting are a beautiful combo. The graphics are the main feature that separates Borderlands 2 for others, they are cartoonish and it works so well. There is literally no end to the amount of guns in Borderlands 2, and most guns are elemental, meaning you can light your enemies on fire, melt them with corrosive damage, electrocute them, and so much more. The voice acting is probably the strangest thing, although there is no direct curse words in here, there are so many vulgar references, funny for adults and older teens, but probably not a good thing for youngins. Definitely a great game, no doubt.. First person shooter, levelling up system, bosses, classes, loot- Diablo with guns. Pros: Funny story. Imaginative. Great enimies. Great cell shaded graphics. Highly addictive. Fun multiplayer with SPLITSCREEN. Amazing levelling tree","gameplay is incredible, sound design isnt the best but aside from that it has really good atributes . classes are really good, varied with a lot of potential and playstyles and techniques to learn . characters sometimes can be so broken they are boring ."
376.Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable,"Some people will think that this game is obsolete now with p3r, but i dont think so. If you have a psp/vita/switch laying around, the visual novel/grinding duo in this game is some of the best portable experiences you will have, while it is not flashy by modern standarts, this game still holds up with incredible music, fun gameplay and a heartwarming story.. Poignant, complicated... Tough. 'P3' has the courage and eloquence to question existence, and then find healing in a world of hurt. It is by design that a game surrounded of ""death,"" is in truth a tactful thematic piece on the acceptance of life's ultimate ""outcome."" Persona 3 is an unapologetically comprehensive meditation on what it means to hope, live, and love.. Go buy the game. Itâs a great game. I am a huge fan of Persona 3 but this is the worst way to play it FeMC is mid but fun ig. Persona 3 Portable on the PSP is a handheld gem that seamlessly blends the rhythms of daily life with the pulse-pounding beats of supernatural RPG action. As a gaming aficionado, this Persona installment brings a unique flavor to the portable console, making it a must-play for enthusiasts of immersive storytelling and strategic gameplay. In the daytime, you're not just a student â you're navigating the intricate maze of high school life, making choices that ripple through both mundane and mystical realms. It's a refreshing twist on life simulation, injecting purpose into your daily decisions. When the moon takes its place in the night sky, you descend into Tartarus, a mysterious tower teeming with shadows. The turn-based combat and Persona system transform this into a tactical ballet. Fusing and summoning Personas not only deepens the strategic aspect but also adds a layer of personalization to your spectral allies. The narrative unfolds with a hypnotic allure, exploring profound themes of life and death. The atmospheric music and visuals create an immersive world, pulling you into the emotional whirlwind of the game. It's storytelling that transcends the screen. Protagonist Variety: Choose your path â whether as the established male lead or the newly introduced female protagonist, offering a fresh lens through which to experience the narrative. It's a subtle touch that enriches the replayability and caters to diverse player preferences. The PSP transforms this epic journey into a portable escapade. Carry the weight of the Midnight Hour in your pocket, letting you dive into the Persona universe whenever the gaming mood strikes. The portability doesn't dilute the experience; if anything, it amplifies the allure. In essence, Persona 3 Portable is a portable powerhouse. It encapsulates the spirit of daily life, supernatural intrigue, and strategic RPG elements, all seamlessly woven into a captivating tapestry. If you're a fan of deep narratives, tactical combat, and the allure of the supernatural, consider this Persona adventure a handheld treasure for your PSP.. Persona 3 Portable is easily one of the greatest rpg games I've ever played, and i can play it on the go with my playstation portable-which is great. HOWEVER there is no answer included. How can you have the journey without the answer? Well my answer is a 1/10. The best game for Android ever! This game is a slam dunk combination of two of the most popular genres of games on Android, RPG and visual novel. It can even run on my PlayStation Portable or my Motorola Xoom! What this game offers are two campaigns with Social Links, some are amazing, and some are terrible. It also offers nighttime gameplay where you go through parts of one dungeon and fight Shadows. Great soundtrack, good gameplay mechanics, and a good story. Although lacking some elements of Persona 3 FES like the 3D visuals, The Answer (not exactly sad to see it gone though), and the FMV cutscenes (although some were kind of redone in-engine, but character models were kind of scaled back), this is still the best version of this game, as combat was improved (as AI-controlled party members are no longer mandatory), and the game overall feels faster for some reason. My only real problem is that the visuals honestly kind of ****. Not that big of a problem when playing on the PlayStation Portable, but when playing on one old computer I have, it becomes kind of distracting.. Tartarus gets repetitive for sure, but character-wise and plot-wise, this was easily the best one in persona franchise. my fav game on the psp and my fav persona game, the dark vibes it giives with its story and characters is unforgettable. This fixed my primary criticism of P3 FES: awful party member AI. It is unfortunate that it also basically turned all non-anime cutscenes into dating sim style cutscenes, but honestly I can deal with that. I'm also not really that concerned about removing the walking around the city parts.. The game its way too long, characters are mediocre and the anime narrative doesn't help. You have to grind a 200 floor boring dungeon but even with that this is the superior version, i still have my problems with the game but you can get along with it.. The game that changed Persona forever. To be completely honest, for me this is the weakest game of the modern Persona games, and the biggest reason why is because the pacing of the story is absolutely terrible, nothing happens for like 70% of the game, I am not kidding, but even then what makes the story ultimately worth it is the phenomenal ending and the themes it touches. The characters are the best part of the campaign in my opinion, they are very likeable and they grew on me as I progressed through the story. The gameplay is actually pretty great, it's typical turn based combat with some additional clever mechanics that were later improved in the newer games. This was the first Persona game that added the social simulator aspect, which is a little bit toned down here, but I always loved exploring the world and meeting new characters, making bonds with other people and interacting with the side content, this is what makes Persona unique and interesting. What I didn't really enjoy is Tartarus, think of it like this, there are hundreds of empty levels where you do the same thing over and over again, just fight Shadows until you reach the end, it's incredibly repetitive and straight up boring, the entire gameplay loop literally made me drop the game multiple times, and the boss fights are straight up bad... which is a shame because there's definitely some wasted potential. As for the music, it's really good, at first I wasn't a fan of the Rap part but after listening to the entire soundtrack, I didn't mind it anymore, it's a solid soundtrack overall and it has some beautiful songs. I enjoyed this game a lot, there are some things about it that are outdated for sure, but it's still a fun experience, it's the game that made the Persona series popular, it reinvented the wheel and it succeeded in doing so, but for me it just didn't hit as much as Persona 4 and Persona 5 did. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. I would say it sticks with the PSP version. Since the remastered has bad AI upscale and compressed audio. But you do lose the cut scene where the age is much more darker . And you can social link all the members as femc is great in my eyes.. Persona 3 portable was a masterpiece. Its a perfect mix of high school life and literally killing demons at night. Its story is pretty surprising for a jrpg and the music WAS STRAIGHT UP AGIDYNE (heh.) The combat was fun and a little easy compared to megaten but combined with the story and characters its just, mwah. Love this game, wish we could have gotten a full remake but still the story is really good and i love the characters. Gameplay at the end could feel a little tiring, but overall fun time.. so good cant wait for pc port. just 2 weeks left my bros and hoes eyooooooo. Persona **** the go. Considering that fact, I gave FES a 9/10 but gave this a 6/10. Why is that? Well, this game is severely lacking in presentation. The entire game is now in visual novel format. While that style can be engaging, I enjoy my fair share of Danganronpa, it simply is not the same as the 3D cutscenes on PS2. This game is also notably easier due to ability to manually control party members. While that is not inherently a bad thing, bosses have not been adjusted any amount with this fact. This makes the game much, much easier, to what I believe to be the games detriment. The Female main character also sometimes overrides what the original game wanted to say in regards to themes (example being one character not dying if you complete their social link, which disregards the whole scene and next month of in game time). However, at this games core is Persona 3. Even with these flaws, it is still an alright game. Unfortunately, this is the version that PC users will get in 2023 instead of FES.. Brilliant game. Lot of simply amazing stories to remember. Lot of unique characters with beautiful bonds. Story is very engaging and quite unique. Although the gameplay could be really boring especially fighting after 30 hours of gameplay. If you are tired of fighting i highly recommend you to use cheats and 1 hit every enemy because the story is worth playing to the end. Brilliant game, absolutely worth playing.. Persona 3 Portable is the third persona game I've played and i think it's great but there things I don't like about this portable version. But to start with the good things p3p has some of the most iconic moments storywise and gameplay wise in the entire series. The main cast of characters are the most fleshed out they've ever been in the series so far and they aren't nearly as one note as future characters in the series. But where the game has low points is the vn like visuals that the port brings, weaker social links, and a more bland verson of p4's rpg gameplay. Now granted most of these issues are a result of just being inferior versions of much better systems in the future games but it still can't be excused. Overall, p3p is a great game and i'm honestly hoping for a remake one day.. My first persona game, finished this game 2 times, both Male mc and Female mc. Hope they remake this game.. Persona 3 Portable might be the 3rd rerelease of the vanilla P3, but it has new content that would justify buying it for the 3rd time. Although the downgrade is sad, it is understandable. But it is with its own pros. It has updated gameplay mechanics seen in Pwrsona 4 Golden.Best RPG on the PSP, hands down!. **** **** opening is fkin **** combat system is far superior than that of the ps 2 **** story is captivating.This game is so good that i spent all of my time playing it instead of prepairing for my highschool entrance **** glad to say that im proud to say that i failed getting into my dream highschool,for i was to play this masterpiece. Great gameplay, fantastic atmosphere & exceptional visual thematics, perfect soundtrack, gripping storyline, a complete novel experience with few flaws, I'd recommend this game to anyone, even if you've played the PS2 version(s). I will say that this game would be an 10/10 if the gameplay wasn't so repetitive, but the plot and characters are incredible, and I assure that you will cry in some part of this great story. the game is incredible in every way, music, graphics, innovative RPG gameplay, story and much more even though it is a scaled down version of the PS2 game. for me the only defect was that it was a little too easy to change, it could end up becoming a little repetitive over time. If you are a person who enjoys or gets along with RPGs ... I recommend playing in the hard mode. Other than that ... Persona 3 can be a great experience for the person who wants to enter the world of Role Playing Games with the best possible content or wants to experience another great adventure. This is my first Persona game and my god... This game was a whole new experience for me. I'm kind of new to the JRPG genre so I was a little hesitant to play this in the first place but I can only say positive things about it. One of my favorite games of all time.. Best PSP game ever. I started playing Persona by the last entry at ps4 (persona 5) and I really enjoyed the game. I had a PSP for over 10 years or so and totally forgot about this game. Never really gave it a chance until now: and I gotta say: itâs awesome. Wish I tried before. I had something about 100h into this and I really miss it. Nice game. 10 out 10 for sure.. Persona 3 Portable is my favorite game in the PlayStation Portable and I can say that with all of my heart. I played this game right after finishing Persona 4 Golden and I set my expectations really high for this game. I am glad to say that it delivered really well. I found myself addicted again. The game gives you a dark narrative unlike the newer games, since this was the first installment in the franchise to have the social links and the slice of life elements making the game feel a little like the mainline series, Shin Megami Tensei. It surprises me how the gameplay still holds up really well even in this day and age, the combat is inferior to the newer installments in the franchise but it still never gets tedious and was always fun. The soundtrack in this game boozes a chilly feeling that will give you goosebumps, this was also the first time that Atlus decided to make songs as most of their background music and battle themes. I also love every character in this game especially the main ones, I really like how some of the characters had a persona before you making it feel like the new strong member rather than being than the leader right away. I also played the Female Character in the New Game+ and I was really blown away. The new soundtrack that changes the theme and the dark vibe to a cheerful vibe that the game has is absolutely amazing. I really like the number of details they added to this new option of character, while not being canon. The Female Character also has a new circle of friends a new set of romance options. Playing as the Female Protagonist doesn't feel like just changing the gender of the character but it feels like playing as another person as it both male and female protagonists feels and acts different. After replaying the game after many years, I would say that it never disappoints. Not a single bit.. This is the old masterpiece This Game have 3 emotion Sad happy,desprate 10/10 game. Persona 3 portable is just Persona 3 FES but game-play wise better, you can control your party members, and you can play as a female protagonist, the story for persona 3 is very strong, not as strong as Shin Megami Tensei Digital Devil Saga or Persona 2 but still very strong, my only complaint is that when you get to a high social link with a female you are forced to be there boyfriend, so you ether date every girl but have powerful persona's or max out one and not the others. the only reason for not give 10/10 is because in the final levels of the game, the repetitive gameplay is tiring, aside that, this game is a art piece, is stand behind of the original ps2 but this port is not bad at all, for newcomers is the perfect entrance in j-rpg games. the story and in special the music is something you can remember in the instant you hearit don't matter how many years pass.. Its not **** a VÄ°SUAL **** did you do this to game.Otherwise it had good story.. At least the best of the original game, yes, it has disadvantages, but still as a portable game, it is great. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best RPG 's I have ever played, while the battle system at the time wasn't the best (Specially the companions AI) they fixed it on other versions like Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable. The strong point of the game is the narrative and the daily life simulator part of the game play, with memorable characters and a combination of mechanics between battle and school life. The battle system is nice and the boss battles are hard if you don't plan your strategy well but it's a great adventure overall.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best version of 3 persons for me. Fixed that you can not control the party members. A lot of dialogue. The ability to influence the characters. much more than in a classic game. A single hero girl was added (I know about Maya and Aigis, but they are already created characters who already had a character, and itâs difficult to pour into their role, because they are faceless heroes like the rest of the characters) The movement is slightly fixed, even if itâs because of this, itâs also in 2D (I was lost several times in the classic version). Great extra soundtracks. In general, this is my favorite part, and I hope for Golden, it is ported to the PC along with the fes for it.. P3P is a great improvement to P3F and the portability adds great value to this version. One of the finest JRPGs on the system for sure. The game looks beautiful on the PSP and the lack of cutscenes isn't really that much of a deal to me. And I can actually control my characters in this version!!! That alone puts the PS2 version in a corner. Having both male and female MC adds a lot of replay value. There are great social links on both routes and the soundtrack is just as good as in the original version. Persona games just feel better on the go and I would love a remaster or remake on the Switch. That would be great. Overall this is a great experience but could still be better with a reworked Tartarus, some improvements to certain social links but it's still a great game.. How I rate games: Game-play, Music/Sound, Graphics & Visuals, Story/World-building, and Characters each get 0-2 points adding up to a score /10. 0 is non-existent or bad, 1 is average or N/A, and 2 is better than average. Game-play: 2 While the game-play has aged, it is still absolutely playable and was leagues above the rest at the time of release. It was also a huge improvement over Persona 2 and 1. Music/Sound: 2 While the voice acting is shaky, there is a huge library of music and most of it is very nice. Graphics & Visuals: 1 This version is a point and click most of the time with lowered quality graphics so that it could be on a portable system. So while many graphics are poor it was for a perfectly respectable reason and they could have been much worse. Story/World-building: 2 Of all the persona games, this one has the most fleshed out and consistent story. Characters: 2 This is the cast is the one that finds the balance between interesting and realistic, which is something the other persona games have each struggled with. While some of them are 'love 'em or hate 'em', they do have good motivations for what they do. TOTAL: 9/10. This persona game is my favourite out of the persona series and honestly I think this is the best version of the game. The graphics were honestly outdated even when the game was new, with square, clunky models that most games havenât used since the 90âs. The soundtrack however is probably my favourite video game soundtrack with everything from bouncy pop to powerful emotional orchestra numbers. The battle system isnât super complex and pretty clean, if you are familiar with PokÃ©mon or other turn based battle you will pick it up very fast. It should be noted that it is a huge step up from the previous persona 2 and was a genuine and successful attempt to make the game better. However, it may come across as outdated to modern players. This version in particular has the option to play as a girl with different interaction, giving this version the best replay value. While the plot does have issues such as the game being so dark at times it is overbearing and villains that get very little development, is probably the best of the series with the strongest cast. Buy, rent, watch an LP, or skip? Buy if you can or beg Atlus to remake this game on a modern console.. One of the best JRPGs in my opinion. The great characters, the dark atmosphere, and the unusual themes and morals of death really set this one apart. While it gets a little too melodramatic at time and has some silly aspects that seem out of place like a knife wielding dog, storywise this is one of Atlusâs best works. I prefer the portable version of the game because I generally feel like the addition of the female protagonist doubles the games replay value.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great RPG for the PSP and alright as a port. If you got no interest for the persona series however...this isn't the game to change your mind. But if you do, you'd be doing yourself a favor by playing this little gem.. My favourite game on the PSP, i am a great fan SMT series in Russia. This series steal my heart.. the best version of p3 because is playable, unlike the ps2 one. but still mantains its flaws. u can fix the gameplay but not the bad flow of the story and character development. Before at all i rate a 10 to equilibrate the game to his original rating, thanks to the Nintendo haters. In words my rating is 8. Positves, being portable,great graphics and a sweet protaginist. Negatives, looks like a visual novel, The answer chapter was missed.. Persona 3 is a great RPG by all means, and easy the best way to enter the Persona franchise. Its my favorite Persona game ever, but it has some issues and quality of life problems. Anyways, for me P3 is the most deep experience inside the franchise, and it talks about some heavy and dark themes, which we can correlate. (in some parts) The game dynamicÂ´s about life and death is great, and this game was the kickoff for Atlus to reach out success as we know her now, with Persona 5 kicking the bucket, and Shin Megami Tensei 5 in the horizon. buuut... As i mentioned, P3 have some problems. The plot and overall theme is great, but the game play doesnt save the show. The dungeon crawling system is very repetitive, and many player will struggle to like Tartarus as a dungeon. But, i really like the melancholic and lonely feel that permeates this placeÂ´s atmosphere, and every time i hear its theme, i canÂ´t do anything but remember my lonely spring nights playing it while i still was applying for my college admission exams. The point is: P3 its a great game, but its not perfect and aged kinda bad. But for me, this game have a tremendous amount of feelings involved. Either way, i have to be fair and give it a 7/10 for its problems. But donÂ´t let it scare you away! Persona 3 its the best start possible for Persona, and even for SMT. I canÂ´t recommend it enough.. My very first persona game. Introduced me to the franchise, it has some flaws but will always have a place in my heart.. One of the best game in the world. Perfect plot, amazing characters very nice gameplay... I really love it. It felt like I had played a small portion of the original game. No good scenes, no anime videos, some OST's are gone as well. Gameplay is repetitive, going to Tartarus over and over again felt like a chore. I chose this version because of a female protagonist and I slightly regretting it.. Despite the large number of cuts compared to the PS2 version, the game turned out to be more than good. Very high-quality processing of all known JRPG for portable console. Persona 3 Portable is a fantastic game. It is a port of the original PS2 game. I would say that it is one of the foremost games of both the RPG and simulation genres. It has a charmingly unique art style, great but simple game mechanics as well as it's own distinct style. It has a fitting soundtrack, with several memorable pieces, and one of the most balanced difficulty curves in any game I've played. However, the dungeon sections of the game get repetitive after a while, and they require minimal strategy compared to many other RPGs, though the designs of the dungeons are quite imaginative. The pros vastly outweigh the cons, though, and in the end, P3P was one of the most unique and memorable gaming experiences I have had.. I expected something better for all of the hype this really average franchise gets. All characters were boring anime archetypes with no flavor of their own. The story was an extremely generic premise that flows in the typical Japanese way of story telling like Light Novels. Tartarus, the main gameplay feature was fun at first but as you progress in the tower, it becomes more and more tedious by the second. In the end, I forced myself to complete the game. Bosses have a terrible gameplay design, for example the ones under the Millitary base, you have to kill the 2 bosses in the exact same turn or the one that wasn't killed will revive the other one ON FULL HP. No, they don't warn you about that, they never tell you about it until the first revive happens. One of the bosses even relies COMPLETELY ON LUCK. That's bad game design. He uses a move that spawns a roulette in front of you and you spin it and stop it. Whether you damage him for some small amount or he 2-3 shots you, that's up to luck. Whether you get debuffed or he gets debuffed, that's up to you.. Oh, did I say that there' s another boss fighting besides that guy? Yeah, 2 enemies at the same time. Not only you have to rely on luck but you also must simultaniously fend off that other guy who has an attack that can one shot you if you have an Ice based Persona. or leave you barely alive on about 30 hp if you don't. The whole game is riddled with badly designed bosses and the pacing of the story is bad. A story sequence happens and you're left with a whole month of free time before the next one. Either you grind which is boring, or do Social Links, which are just unfleshed dialogues that get the other characters attached to you. The characters seem to start loving you way too quickly. You go and say hi and you already got a girlfriend... (It's an over exaggerated example, chill.) One good thing about P3P is that there is at least fast travel and no pointless walking.. From the very first scene I was hooked and couldn't get it out of my mind for 100 hours. Better story and characters than 4, though a bit darker and a lot sadder. Great experience overall.. I was both excited and scared when this game got announced: I'm a HUGE fan of the persona series, with persona 3 being my most favorite rpg, and of course the hype got me and I was literally counting the days for its release. The things I heard the most were the obvious female protagonist and some other innovations, which I don't remember, but I was anyway gonna buy even if it was the same exact game for the ps2. But I can clearly say, this is one of the best rpgs on the psp, if not THE best: the game not only is an improved version of the ps2 version, it also adds a ""new"" storyline with the female counterpart, meaning that the 2 stories, even if the same, are also different at the same time. The game is also very long (I finished in about 60-70 hours, 80+ with the secondary tasks and the additional fusions) which really strikes out considering that most of the rpgs on portable consoles aren't very long (unless you do the additonal **** course). The combat is also very improved, basically taking the best parts from persona 4 (the possibility to control your members, for instance) and still remains one of the strong points of the game, together with the story. My only BIG complains are mostly 2: 1) the game has a very simplified interface outside the dungeon, meaning that you will NEVER control your character outside the dungeon, but only a cursor. I know that they did this in order to make more space for the game and luckily you will still see your characters during the dungeon exploration, and I'm ok with that, but it's going to take a while to get used to it. Luckily the navigation works perfectly: you can move easily anywhere by pressing the Square button (taken from persona 4) and the cursor is quite precise and works good. Overall, it's fine, just too bad that you'll basically never see your character(s) outside the dungeon, especially when there are a lot of costumes to unlock, Also, because of this, most of the cutscenes got cut as well. 2) NO FES! If this game had also Fes (the second part of the game, called ""The Answer"",that roughly lasts about 30 hours), this would be perfect, but unfortunely we only have few things from Fes (the possibility to choose different Stewards, some extra scenes, new persona, etc). Again, probably the lack of space made them cut the additional scenario, or else it would be perfect in all ways. And really, that's about it: the game is the same as the original, with a different interface, but with 2 very well detailed campaigns that aren't necessarily the same: they basically tell the same story with 2 different perspectives and, actually, it really encourages you play twice, doubling the hours and the ways to play the actual game. I personally recommend to try it out if you want a good rpg for your psp (it's a dungeon crawler RPG, the ideal for portable consoles) and even if there are some flaws (it can be slow if you don't install the game into your memory card) it still remains one of the best rpgs on the psp. Must try at all costsThis is the best ""PSP"" game i have ever played in my life.I think it is better than G.T.A. SERIES kingdom hearts .I hope you will also play the game as it is awesome .I hope they will release persona 4 golden in ""PSP"".. While the lack of control of your character in the world(you control a dot which you move around and click on people to talk to them) is slightly killing the great atmosphere that P3FES had, everything else is roughly the same or slightly better. Much better gameplay(which is still simplistic crap), better overall control(easier to move from room to room, lots of user-friendly buttons), and the new female protagonist adds several new social links and makes the whole game enjoyable all over again, if you can deal with the awkwardness that comes with playing as a female who actually expresses her feminity at all times. That's for the PSP speciality version. But as a whole, Persona 3 on PS2 or PSP is just about the best JRPG I have played in my entire life. It goes in a list of ""best games ever"" with Super Metroid or Final Fantasy VI. The greatest success of this game is without a doubt its tone and atmosphere. Persona 3 is dark. I mean really dark. It's a story of human tragedy, loss, sadness, regret, heroism, teenage life in its best sense(the learning about life sense), deep personal problems with relationships or self-image, impending doom, abandonment, deadly sickness, social violence and of course, rejecting the very desire to live further. It's a game where the characters make the most deep part of the game, as each of them is very well designed, but they all really come together as a wonderfully cohesive world, none of them ever breaking the dark and realistic tone of the game, except President Tanaka, who is over-the-top to the max, but is as enjoyable as it gets. The tone is excellently served by everything in the game, the music, the visual art style(which is kinda **** sometimes), the characters, the story, the themes, everything in this game just screams sadness, depth and a profound love for the less side of life and human society. By itself, the tone makes this one of the best games ever. But the characters are the second most awesome part of it. From the best (Mitsuru, Akinari Kamiki, Tanaka, Shinjiro Aragaki, Aigis, Ryoji) to the least interesting (Mamoru, Kenji), there isn't a single bad apple or even a mediocre one. The least deep or most one-note characters still feel like complete and well-rounded imitations of real-life people. The social links all provide a new insight in life from a different personality, and there is no part of the social link planning that I dislike simply because no matter how much of a hassle it is to plan for all of that, the whole game is such an enjoyment for me that I never dislike the idea of planning for hours if I have to. I want al","the visual novel/grinding duo in this game is some of the best portable experiences you will have . the narrative unfolds with a hypnotic allure, exploring profound themes of life and death . the atmospheric music and visuals create an immersive world, pulling you into the emotional whirlwind of life and death ."
377.Neon White,"Neon White is quite possibly the single most replayable game of all time. The movement is absolutely fantastic, the skips and new strategies you can take to improve your time is addicting. I genuinely cannot recommend this game enough to anybody. Unfortunately, the dialog really is a massive downside for me. It completely takes me out of the admittedly pretty decent story. It doesn't hurt the game that much, since the game clearly isn't focused on the story.. Such an Perfect Game! (except for the story, it's kinda cringe) The plattforming and shooting feels so satisfying and the grasp for making a new Personal Best is enormous. The soundtrack from Machine Girl fits great while you slay down some demons. It's very unique and fun!. its definitely a unique and fun experience, but it didnât fully manage to pull me in. the way it combines speedrun, platforming, and shooter mechanics is impressive. however, the weapon usage and level design felt a bit underwhelming. the story were mid, but the corny dialogues were surprisingly funny.. This has some of the most satisfying gameplay I've had the fortune of trying out. I usually don't like to speedrun, but this game really makes it fun. It's a hybrid puzzle platformer shooter that goes FAST and has card elements. It's extremely exciting to improve your times every run and find new routes. The soundtrack by Machine Girl is also phenomenal and complements the gameplay well. The art is nice and the story is decent imo, the writing is a bit cheesy but it's part of the fun and doesn't detract at all for me. I only wish there was a level editor so I could play endless levels!. This is one of the best games ever. It'svery frenetic. I had been plaing a lot and all the times it's so good.. Game is decent, music is good, but the story is very awful and cheesy. Not for me.. Good part, good music and unique mechanics, with good dialogue and addictive gameplay. nothing like it, dont let the weird story and characters from playing this game its a gem one of the best games ive ever played 10/10. The story is mid and incredibly off-putting, but I aced every level anyway because the gameplay is just that good.. besto game, i like it so much. i enjoy every single second playing this game.. First the game seems to be easy, but later on the levels and mechanics get more and more complex. Just so addictive. love it <3. Amazing speedrun shooter. Very fluid, clean and snappy. Pure pleasure running and re-running the levels to get that feeling of perfection. Music is very good and helps to stay ""in the zone"". You can ignore the story, especially if you hate anime. However, it's so light-hearted that it kinda helps to unwind between missions of pure concentration. Perfect side grade to Ghostrunner.. Many people miss-interpret this game. Donât let the dialogue fool you. Those cringy anime references? Totally intentional and honestly, they add to the charm. The characters are **** amazing if you look at it this way. Itâs self-aware, self-deprecating humor. The game is in on the joke. And letâs not forget the gameplay. Completely addictive. Parkour and gunplay thatâs as smooth as butter with so many great variations. This game had me hooked from the start, getting the fastest time possible on a stage became so addicting. Neon White is a wild ride youâve gotta experience.. Neon White may be one of my favorite games of all time. I really enjoyed the incredibly fast paced movement, unique abilities to the game that culminated into an absolute masterpiece. The core speedrunning factor is so fun and I really and truly loved playing through the game. The story is an interesting case, it has many corny parts but still, the idea of it makes sense on paper. I won't say any spoilers, but some parts that should be more emotional, really just don't amount to the emotional connection being lost as displayed in other top tier games. The story overall is kinda lackluster, but I still rate the game so highly because the gameplay is so fun. Overall I really enjoyed this game! You better go get the game, because I just know it'll leave you hooked for quite a while. 10/10 No Drama.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's fun but a bit one dimensional. Also I lost patience with the harder stuff. I am too old for it probably. It's a fun action shooter/puzzle game which is not quite like anything I have seen before. The characters are kind of funny ish but also kind of cringe. I am not sure if they are meant to be a joke or sincerely written. Story seems slight but has some interesting bits. Worth the tenner I spent. Most underrated game Ä± ever played. Story is boring, side character are bad, mechanics are a disagrece. Map desing is awful and making a single mistake means you have to play the level all over again. I can't believe some people are calling this the ""BEST INDIE GAME"" its just normal game with garbage content.. Really good level design. Fantastic gameplay that begs you to chase those best times and leaderboards. Also enjoyed the characters and story a lot.. Neon White has some of the best gameplay out of an indie game in recent times, but it also features some of the most god-awful writing I've ever seen. The levels are exhilarating and challenge you to always find a better, more optimal way to solve them, while staying short and straight to the point which helps pace the game effectively. On the other hand, the characters you interact with are obnoxious and quite frankly embarrassing to listen to. With better (or at least not straight up annoying) writing & characters, this could've easily gotten a 9, but the gameplay alone is worth the purchase & playtime.. A lovely concept. Reactive shooter, puzzle, card game all into one. Gameplay truly stands out, and the devs have done a good job polishing the game. Its a smooth ride through and trough. Only criticism I have is for the story and characters. Somewhat of a dumpster fire. You want to 100% it because of how fun the core gameplay loop is but the interactions you get are so shallow and boring. Voice actors did an okay job, but you can only do so much with such a cringey and inconsistent plot. While the core premise was ok, I wish they spent a bit more time refining the world as well. Returning to main hub could be a blast like it was with Hades!. A great game with, frankly, unbearable dialogue.. This game makes any First person platformer look lame. Buy It now!!. One of my favorite games ever: it is very fun game, the story is okay but the gameplay is completely wonderful. You can play it the whole day and won't get bored. wonderful game.. Awesome game, cant say much. Scenario is also very good some people doesn't like it, but they are just stupid gay-american. Neon White is a masterpiece. It expertly paces itself between the dopamine rush it grants from completing a level with better and better times, to easing up and exploring each level looking for the collectible hidden within, before finally letting you cool off by chatting with the cast of goofy and fun characters. It is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that caused me to range from having a small smile creep into my focused expression to a big goofy smile with genuine laughter at the dialogue and characters. To heap more praise onto this title it is highly accessible to those not the best with FPS titles, has amazing music, and perfect visual clarity. I am terrible at aiming due to my lack of experience with FPS titles but I was able to land the shots I needed to while speeding through the level to get the ""Ace"" timing on all of them (I also never got frustrated with the level where I hate most games that score your performance/speed or puts them on a leaderboard.) Part of this was just due to it being crystal clear what you need to shoot at, what you need to ground pound/dash through, and what one needs to avoid. Lastly, I would be doing the title a disservice if I didn't compliment the sounds of the title whether it be the music that perfectly matches the atmosphere of each level and never gets tiring or repetitive, or how the voice cast that did a perfect job of bringing the script to life. Neon White is my 2022 title of the year for what I will argue are good reasons and I give it a hearty recommendation to anyone where even just 1 aspect of the title piques your interest.. Absolutely amazing and addicting gameplay. The story and characters are a little too anime, but it doesn't take away from the experience too much. Great Stuff.. the game is beautiful, fast, skillful, stylish, with perky music and a surprisingly not bad plot, but my nerve cells are not restored and the game practically does not forgive mistakes, which is a small minus. One of the best games I have ever played, everything it tries works out perfectly. There aren't a lot of mechanics but what this game tries it PULLS OFF. There is zero bloat in the entire game and everything is just incredible. The gameplay is buttery smooth and flows incredibly alongside the near-perfect level design. The art style is gorgeous and the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard in a videogame. The story is hit or miss because I do understand it won't be for everyone but I absolutely loved it, the characters, the banter the dialogue, and just the general story itself were really great in my opinion. An absolute masterpiece and I see this as someone who doesn't really like speedrunning.. This is the most best video game of all time nothing will ever top this ever. Everyone should play this as soon as they possibly can. Speed, accuracy, precision, big guns, and **** anime clichÃ©s are everything Neon White is about. Neon White is a level based speedrunning game where the goal is to kill all the demons and get to the end of the level. This is done with the gun cards which are found throughout the level. Each gun card has a special ability that can be used when the gun is discarded. While beating each level is important, there is a time based scoring system for each level. There are different medals based on the completion time of the level, and you need a certain amount of gold medals in order to progress the story. This makes it so you may have to replay levels in order to get a better time. While many levels have an obvious set path on how you should beat the level, there are many tips and shortcuts you learn throughout playing Neon White that will help improve your times. The game even has a shortcut hint feature which can guide you to a shortcut in order to help you get the best time possible. The story is just an average anime with your basic anime characters. The story and characters really only hinder the game from being an all time great. But the gameplay feels so fluid and being able to figure out the shortcuts then be able to actually perform it is amazing. After a session of playing Neon White my hands might be hurting as in some parts I would be putting in way more different inputs than I would any other game. Overall great game and one of my favorites of the year.. The best speedrun game for those who don't like speedrun games. Excellent pace of gameplay and a good combination of genres.. Generally an overrated game but the soundtrack by Machine Girl is absolutely banging (almost worth the game in itself). It does however become repetitive after a while because the game never lets it unfold totally. The gameplay is weirdly addictive and intuitively fluent in a way that most speedrunners can only dream of. Not a speedrunner kind of gamer, but this game has unlocked the magic behind it somehow. Worst is the story and the acting; a horrible cringey visual novel style voiced over by actors that clearly have no idea what a normal human conversation sounds like and can be skipped without loosing any valuable gameplay knowledge. It's too bad - If some decent animators, actors and script-writers could have assisted in forming the story, the premise of the game along with some traditional animation sequences could have lifted it to another level.. Neon White is a first person platformer/speedrunning/FPS game. You play as the epooymous Neon White, a sinner who has been brought to Heaven along with a bunch of other sinners to kill demons for ten days. Whichever of these sinners â called Neons â gets the highest rank at the end of the ten days gets to stay in Heaven, while the rest are cast back out once more. Neon White has lost his memories, but other sinners who knew him in life â Yellow, Red, and Violet â are all also competing to stay in Heaven as well, and may be taking advantage of his lack of memories for their own ends. Over the course of the game, you uncover what is really going on, your relationship to the other neons, befriend some angels, and gather gifts during levels to give to people back in the home base to level up your friendship levels, unlocking conversations, additional secret levels, collectibles for your room, and eventually memories of your interactions with them in life. Overall, the plot aspect of the game is not particularly good â it is very anime (despite not being made in Japan) and the characters are fairly simple and archetypal, and donât really feel much like they were assassins in live (with the exception of Violet) as they ostensibly were. My favorite character was Mikey, an angel who looks like a cat with a cigar and a hard-bitten voice. But thatâs not really what youâre here for. The plot is mostly just an excuse for the action, and the core gameplay of this game is quite good. The gameâs central premise is that you need to beat the levels as fast as possible for medals. Traversing these levels, you have the standard running and jumping, but you also get guns â these can be shot to kill demons or interact with some environmental objects, or can be discarded to give you a traversal power, like jumping, air-dashing, a mid-air rocket, a grappling hook, or a ground slam. Each weapon corresponds to a different secondary power, and there are six weapons in all in the game. Most of these weapons canât break barricades with their normal shots, so you usually have to use the damaging traversal powers to break them down or bypass them. You have to kill every demon in most of the levels, so when you are trying to find a more efficient route, you need to be able to kill all the enemies even if you are cutting off big chunks of the levels in terms of traversal. This leads to an interesting core gameplay loop of going into a level, learning its layout, then mastering it, figuring out what routes you can take to save time and how to kill demons that are âoff routeâ without going near them. It works really well, and the game has a fast pace and solid level variety, finding a good number of ways to show off the gameâs mechanics and create interesting platforming experiences. The game gives out four ranks of medal at the end of each level â bronze, silver, gold, and ace â and thereâs a fifth, hidden red rank that is not needed for 100%ing the game. Acing the levels takes some doing, but isnât prohibitively difficult; getting those red medals, however, is a very difficult challenge indeed. The game also has built-in level rush modes which you unlock when you beat all the levels in the game, with internal leaderboards that both show how well your friends did on them, as well as how well you rank globally. The game also has a hidden gift in almost every level, which you can collect to give to characters; some of these require you to notice them in unusual places, while many are difficult to reach and require you to use your resources cleverly and efficiently to get to them. All of this combines to create a quite solid gameplay experience. If you like the idea of speedrunning, this game has fun with the idea, and the movement of the character through the levels is a lot of fun. All in all, Iâd recommend this game to more mechanics-focused players who enjoy speedrunning/beat the clock, but people who are more story/narrative focused are likely to be disappointed.. Pros: + addictive gameplay + level design + gun variety + bite-sized levels + good amount of content + great presentation + distinct art style Cons: - poor music variety - some rocket launchers stages are not good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A fast-paced game with nothing new on the menu. I don't like thedesigns of the characters, the scenarios are all more or less the same, and the plot... well, let's say that it is plain and too simple. In one word? Meh.. Just play it! Top contender for Indie of the Year. I advise everyone without exception. not poggers. it was a overall okay game with cool gameplay story was one of the stories of all time. Fun speedrunning fps puzzle game. not much else to say other than that it's a fun concept that's executed well. I also like the dialogue but that's just because I love stupid things and the dialogue is super cringy but in a sweet endearing way if you know what I mean.. Most fun game I've ever played, and that says a lot. Story is decent as well. neon white is fast and addicting. story is ok, nice manga-style drawings here and there + voice over. the soundtrack is really nice! but the gameplay is the heart of this game: an addicting rush of speed with cards, crazy gameplay idea.. One of the most exciting indie games I've played this year, the game is focused on tight FPS platforming with guns that can be discarded to give you a particular boost: double jump, forward boost, directional boost. These mechanics are polished almost to perfection making you look for the fastest way through a level whilst mowing down all the demons as fast as possible. The gameplay is intense, and you find yourself looking after the next shortcut or perfecting your mechanical skills, but unfortunately the only thing to balance this level of intensity is poorly written dialogue between characters and meaningless rewards for collectibles. If the dialogue was better, and the characters were better written out this could have easily been a masterpiece, but unfortunately the lack of contrast to an exciting and demanding gameplay is non existent and it hurts the overall experience.. Great example of the speedrun game, made by the fans of speedrunning. Not exactly my type of game, but what it does it does right.... bruh this site want to put to much words just imagine i said something cool guys , anyway this game is good .-. Is 10/10 too high of a score? No, no it's not. Best game I've played in years. The gameplay is great, the music is great, the style is great even the self-aware cringe writing is great, though I'm sure some people will see that as a negative. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't have fun in this game. It is addicting trying to get the best time and going back to find out how to reach the gifts. This is thanks to how well the game handled the card uses and the environment for traversal. There's no other feeling like finding a shortcut in a level that shaves off a few seconds. This game for sure won't be for everyone. It's for freaks like they said in their marketing, so if you're not a freak.... Well, I'm sorry for your loss. The story is interesting enough, nothing amazing but still entertaining and offers a nice break form the gameplay. The characters are super stereotypical, but... in a good way? Don't really know how to explain it, but it works. Just don't take the story too seriously, because it sure doesn't take itself seriously. It's just not a story driven game, the story is there to give you a break form the speedrunning and entertain you which is nice. I should warn you though, the writing may be too much for someone weaker than I, so go ahead and skip the cutscenes if you want but make sure you give the characters gifts. It'll unlock some fun levels.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Neon White is really a good game, it learns little by little its mechanics to in the end chain them in fast and well mastered levels for me the only problem is the story which intervenes every five levels and which can sometimes seem useless And I prefer not to talk about the golden tickets you get after all 10 levels. Ben shoots out fresh ideas after freash ideas. Can't wait to see his future games. From Donut County to this? And both games being that good? What are the odds?. Incredibly fast-paced and fun. The gunplay is satisfying and the story is engaging and interesting. Highly recommend!. I don't like all these speedrunning things, you know. But this game... Oh.. It made me fall in love with it. The best thing I could spend my time on is playing this masterpiece!. pretty fun ass game I cant believe they got john cena for it. its like csgo surfing but with cowboy beep bop. Wow I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. How is this aggressively mediocre game getting such high scores? The writing (as others have stated) is absolute garbage, there isn't really even any ANIMATION during the cut scenes, which also go on for like 10x longer than they warrant. The music is OK but doesn't change between entire levels so you're listening to the same track on repeat for like 30-40 minutes sometimes depending on how many times you have to retry a mission. The graphics would be fine for a 2003 game. The speed running / card swapping aspect is cool but not nearly cool enough to make this anywhere near a 10/10. I'm truly baffled by all the praise. Did I download an old unfinished version somehow??. One of the best games I've played this year. Easy to understand, hard to master. Great soundtrack and addictive gameplay.. Simple straight forward fast paced fun but not much to do, also i didn't like the environment, setting and concept. So incredibly fun to speedrun the levels. If you love fast paced action involved with timing of jumps/abilities then get this. I had immense fun playing Neon White and it was a flawless experience from beginning to end. Everything from the gameplay, level design and dialogue just clicked for me. The only reason this game doesn't get a 10/10 is because I would have loved a bit more interactivity in the overworld (maybe a system like Danganronpa 3 had?) and I know for a fact that I will never start this game from the beginning again, since I don't see any replay value except for completing the level rushes or improving some level times to beat friends. If you liked Mirrors Edge and/or Titanfall 2, then this game is for you! Ben Espasito did it again!. God games can be so lifeless nowadays, its so refreshing to play a game as creative and fun to play as Neon White. Highly Recommended.. Neon White deserves ample praise for its gameplay and a lifetime of utter embarrassment for its story and dialogue. Whoever wrote this . . . should feel shame.. While the dialogue can at times be a bit unbearable (mostly with neon red and violet), the world building, the soundtrack and definitely the gameplay make up for it. It sort of created an itch for me that only this game ( and ghost runner kinda) can scratch. Without a doubt worth picking up.. Neon White is a game you'll love if you're all about the gameplay, because in that department it offers fast paced platforming & decision making to culminate in a constantly rewarding & enjoyable gameplay loop of running through a level, checking your time, replaying said level to collect gifts for other characters & then replaying it again & again & again to shave those precious few extra seconds off the clock. Neon White not only encourages improvement with tight level design & easy to grasp mechanics, it makes you feel like a badass every time you get an ace trophy after dominating a stage, & it does not get old. On the other hand, If you play games for the story then unfortunately all Neon White has to offer are a mixed bag of vocal performances, stiff & sometimes cringeworthy dialogue & a story that doesn't exactly break new ground in any way. The writing style in this game reminds me of the Danganronpa series, but not for any of the positive aspects Danganronpa may have. All in all, if you enjoy the dopamine rush of effortlessly clearing a stage that you've come to know like the back of your hand in an experience a la Doom Eternal, then Neon White will leave you more than satisfied. The game sits at a fairly affordable indie price point of $31.99 CAD & will provide you plenty of bang for your buck if you don't want to splurge on a full price AAA title.. Easily the best game to come out this year, bar none. Great action platformer, tons of high octane fun, great soundtrack, great and very fitting graphics style, a wealth of content in the main ""story"" and a surprising amount of side-story content. The game is also very skill based, there's very little RNG here (mostly confined to accuracy spread of some weapons). It's a lot of fun, especially if you like to challenge yourself for the best times on levels - game is honestly closest to Trackmania in terms of its base philosophy, and it delivers on all fronts a fun experience, enjoyable for a casual player and even better for anyone looking to test their abilities.. incredible gameplay fast and quick not to frustrating and the game make you want to do the level again and again to have the best time possible. the story is good but you can be spoil if you give to much gift at the begining of the game. A cool speedrunning game where its mostly about reflex and thinking on your feet, you dont need to memorize the maps or cards to get aces. The story has a Shin Megami anime style and its like Hades where it just serves as a breather between missions, i didnt care much for it.. The most fun and fast game i've played all year no stress chill game where you break your own PR and feel like you've acomplished something every time you play it with a great story behind it and great voice acting. I think this game hits a very specific niche of people. Do you like speedrunning games and trying to achieve the best time possible? Do you like FPS games or games in general with a focus on movement (Apex, Titanfall, Mirrors Edge)? Fan of anime or visual novels? If so, this is the game for you. I have never left a review on this site, but I see this game isn't getting much traction and in my opinion this is the second best game of the year so far, very close behind Elden Ring. Improving my times by milliseconds and climbing the global/friends leaderboards is extremely fun. Also, the music rocks. I'd give it a go.. outstanding game, don't sleep on it. It does everything right and knows exactly what game it wants to be.. What a great game! I love speedrunners like Ghostrunner, Cyber Hook and a bit of Mirror's Edge. But Neon White just brings another trick to the rush of running as fast as possible, a system with ""cards/weapons"" that will help you finishing each level by learning the level itself and understanding how much faster is it possible to beat it. I rushed through the story (reason below) and didn't finish any side quests. The text is a bit cringe, but the voice acting helps a lot. The story is interesting but nothing much from it, just different. The gameplay is the best in this. Great re-playability value!!. A great game, there have not been such indie games for a long time that would be so catchy with their story, gameplay and atmosphere, I advise Quake fans to play, but I agree with the person who wrote that voice actors are terrible, unfortunately this is the case. This game is really, really fun. Loved how much it challenged me. The characters are really funny. The gameplay is super creative and makes you feel like a gifted ninja. The only down side is the character progression and story, the dialogues unlocked feels really empty and shallow.. Found this hidden gem during Steam demo event and have been excited about it ever since. Finally, it's here. Best game of 2022 so far.. The game is so fast quick and great love the story of being a demon angel hybrid, not a huge fan of card gameplay but neon white does it in a way where itâs not terrible so itâs just the best game ever. This game has been a surprise for me. I bought it on a whim and it's just been super addictive. I thought the story would be total **** but it's been enticing enough. Definitely recommend for anyone who kind of enjoys time trials similar to Trials the sidescroll bike game. Though it's in the form of an FPS it scratches that itch for me.. Neon White is a mix of great gameplay, mediocre story, and really, really poor performances. It's not entirely on the voice actors - the script is pretty lifeless and there appears to have been very little (if any) direction given to tie the performances together (or to secure a second line reading when the first completely whiffed). The story is kind of filler but not necessarily in a bad way; it's just that none of the beats come across clearly or strongly. Every performance sounds like a miscast person reading the script for the very first time. The worst performance rests with the protagonist, who sounds like a middle-aged man trying and failing to portray a young adult. Again, great gameplay, but the story and characters are an unavoidable significant part of the game. Think of the worst anime dub you've ever heard. Get ready for that.. FOR FREAKS, BY FREAKS! This game is one of the most fun games i have ever played. Its just plain and simply fun. Amazing soundtrack as well",the dialogue really takes me out of the admittedly pretty decent story . the plattforming and shooting feels so satisfying . the soundtrack from Machine Girl fits great while you slay down some demons .
378.Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition,"I love this game the atmosphere surrounding you with the music blasting in my ear gives me this sense of freedom that I can't seem to find anywhere else. The story is dark which I love. The combat could use some work though it feels a little bland and emotionless.. A boring, overly tedious, and generally underused battlesystem ruins an otherwise good story. The battle system tries so hard to be ""MMO but single player!"" and forgot to make the party AI more competent than a bag of kittens taking on a tsunami. Specifically it took the typical ""rogue"" class and built an entire combat system around it. Where you stand matters, and you'll usually have multiple moves requiring you stand to the side or behind an enemy. They're doing this too, and the AI pathfinding is truly a miracle in incompetence. You could set most longer battles to yakety sax, watching you and the enemies dance around each other. Idk if your party members even try to position correctly; you usually can't tell what's going on in combat bc the screen will become cluttered (esp at the end when you're fighting several tall or large enemies). You can call out dynamic party commands such as ""focus on my target"" or ""walk to me"". With that I have exhausted all AI combat customizations. You can't dictate what HP level the healer should use her spells (...well, bullets) and therefore often ends up on cool down sooner than she should. You can choose who to control before battle but are locked in during: if you want to police the heals, expect combat efficiency to drop drastically. Most of the characters are useless in general, since you're usually going to have no choice but to use up two of three slots for a tank and a heal. It's usually easier and better to just let Shulk take up that third slot. There are two tanks but really only one healer for most of the game. There's also a gemcrafting side thing where your weapons and armor have slots for them. Most of the game this is useless and once it's necessary, you're drowning in useless crystals and one or two of the one you actually need. Again, the story IS good. But the combat feels like a dudebro who binges WoW and Mountain Dew created a combat system after a week with no sleep. And amphetamine. There's a silver lining though: I just saved some money in not having to buy either sequel. So there's that!. The most RPG, RPG i have ever played. The story ****, characters ****, and as a whole the game is boring. If you are a hardcore weeb, you'll enjoy this game, if you are a normal person you probably won't. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Please delete this review. I accidentally rated it and I can't delete it because there is no such option on the site.. ""XB1 outshines XB2 in both gameplay and storyline. Of course, the whole XB series is awesome; playing it feels like being in an MMORPG all by yourself."". Play Xenoblade Chronicles, you really are missing something otherwise, definitive edition just added what was missing without taking away any of the charm of the original.. One of the best JRPGS I have ever played. Everything about this game is top notch,. Personally one of the greatest JRPGâs that I have ever played. The story is immaculate, the characters are all but amazing and relatable, the world is vast and brimmed with life. The soundtrack is superb, I would always be humming along whether Iâm exploring or fighting enemies. The gameplay is unique and has some issues, but as long as you take your time and learn the mechanics, you will be alright. I highly recommend it!. ""Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition"" is an absolute gem that manages to blend an epic narrative with a deeply engaging gameplay experience. As someone who appreciates a good story, I found myself quickly drawn into the world of Bionis and Mechonis, where the inhabitants live on the bodies of two colossal titans. The game's world-building is nothing short of spectacular, with vast landscapes that are as beautiful as they are **** of the standout features for me was the combat system. Itâs a real-time, action-based system that requires both strategy and quick reflexes. You control the main character, Shulk, and can switch between other party members, each with unique abilities. The ability to see and alter the future through Shulkâs visions adds a compelling twist, making battles more dynamic and **** characters are another highlight. Each one is well-developed and adds depth to the story. Shulkâs journey, driven by revenge and discovery, is captivating, and the relationships between the characters feel genuine and impactful. The voice acting, particularly the British cast, brings an additional layer of charm and authenticity to the narrative.Graphically, the Definitive Edition is a significant improvement over the original Wii release. The updated visuals are stunning, with more detailed character models and environments. The re-orchestrated soundtrack is also a treat, enhancing the emotional weight of key moments.However, the game isnât without its flaws. The user interface can feel a bit cluttered, and managing quests sometimes becomes overwhelming due to the sheer number of them. Additionally, the pacing can be slow at times, with certain segments feeling a bit drawn out.Despite these minor issues, ""Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition"" is an incredible experience. Itâs a game that offers a perfect blend of exploration, story, and combat. Whether youâre a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, this definitive edition is a must-play. Itâs a testament to the enduring appeal of the Xenoblade series and a reminder of how powerful and moving video game storytelling can be.. One of the best RPG's to have released in the last 10 years. Being on switch, you can literally play for 10 minutes and put it in sleep mode. What other 100+ hour RPG is this convenient?. That's a really great game! Started it twice and who might have thought it's so deep, intriguing and interesting! The soundtrak is amazing. At first I hate the combat system. But after 40 hour played, I started to love it. Story nice Characters design are leak of favourable, except Melia The Big World Map is so fantasy and fantastic! But no riding is still an issue.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is amazing. i can't even describe how enjoyable and expansive it is ! can't wait to play the other 2, but i will take my time with this one. amazing!. Fantastic story tied with some good combat, side missions are very boring and monotonous because they always follow the same principle pretty much, go there, kill enemies, pick up their loot, come back, go there, pick up an item. But other than that, fantastic. Will update review after completing Future Connected: Alright I finished it after a little over 10 hours I think and it's nothing special, just more XC1 which isn't a bad thing, doesn't make it better or worse imo, the Ponspectors were awesome tho.. Xenoblade chronicles appeared to be a promising game. I was excited to play this, and have played many other JRPG. However, despite the interesting story I could not get myself to like the MMO style combat, and for me this gives the game a significant negative. I wouldnât recommend this to my friends, the game is outdated, clunky, slow to start and features a poor combat system.. Felt boring compared to later entries maybe playing this first would have made it better. The Original Xenoblade especially DE is a modern classic, mastering so many elements of an RPG and making its mark. What blows me away in DE is the realization of its fantasy world, you can literally see parts/ areas on the titans and go to them as you progress with such a clear sense of progression/ story and is amazing to just see. Monolith are masters at world design. The characters are fun and good with a bit less depth than sequel games, Shulk is a great protagonist with range, Melia is greatly developed, Dunban is a great mentor, and many others add to the game. The adventure, exploration and story is gripping from the start and keeps unfolding in great ways, with good bosses, progression, twists and moments. The combat while older is a good fusion where the enemies must be reacted to and you execute different setups and combos without being overly complex. The music is phenomenal, along with atmosphere and cool lore/ enemies. Every moment area and decision leads to an excellent game, shooting for the moon of RPGS and landing among the stars. They even added a ton of content to the game in an epilogue that is amazing and well executed. What an excellent RPG.. This is a game that blew my mind. I playedsome good RPGs in my life, but his one was really something. I changedmy style of battle many timss, and every time, I was shocked by the new style I was performing. The visuals are stunning and the story is incredible.. it was fun I guess felt very unproductive. this game takes around 75 hours to beat a lot of it grinding on weaker monsters so you can be strong enough to beat the other enemies, (no real skill needed). Was really excited and bought this game after reading the reviews. However it's average at best, the combat is very tedious and the gameplay is not really fun, the story seems ok. After about 8 hours I will have to pass. It's by no means a bad game, but not worth my time.. I had heard many raving things about Xeonoblade so was enthusiastic about giving it a go. While I think the story is interesting the rest is victim to hype and rabid fanboys/girls. In an RPG there are two things you absolutely have to get right; the story and gameplay loop. The first is solid, not the best, but it gets the job done. The second is where things really fall apart there is nothing engaging or interesting about the game basically playing itself for you while you occasionally hit a button at the right time and because of this I found the game a laborious bore to play. The good news is that locations are pretty interesting and most enemies at least aren't too damage spongey but there is too much grind in the game - and thats coming from an RPG veteran of games like Final Fantasy VI to XV, Shining Resonance Refrain, Trials of Mana, etc.. Just finished Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition on Switch. It was a nice RPG, originally came out on Wii but this is the first I played it. Took 52 hrs to finish.. GOOD STORYTELLING , nice combat system. Love them all , happy playing till the end ,good job!. Itâs amazing, story is everything in this game, and story is All it needs.. It was a good game, but with a final battle, I was not able to win. So I did abandon it. Otherwise this game would habe been an 8, but so with this final battle just a 5.. A classic that I enjoyed playing again with a lot improved. I liked the new music and ease of life improvement to the UI. The game has aged a little but is still one of my favorite games of all time.. I like unique combat system and fantastic OSTs. Characterization is not that great since only a handful of characters are memorable to me. Besides, some plot points were questionable. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the game to some extent.. About time I got to this! Iâm in the minority of having finished Xenoblade 2 before ever touching the first game & time has only made me look back more fondly on 2 despite dragging it a little in my review. But I can safely say I have a lot of the same love for Xenoblade 1, as well as some of the same complaints. What I really love about this series is the story & thatâs no different here. The story absolutely HOOKED me from beginning to end & makes me wish I got into the original on the Wii back in the day (although the type of gamer I was in 2012 is a completely different person than I am now so who knows if I wouldâve clicked with it at all) But this is one of those absolutely essential story experiences that should be seen by anybody with a Switch, though I still have a higher place in my heart for 2âs story above 1âs. The soundtrack is absolutely PHENOMENAL to nobodyâs surprise, most of it has been remastered for the Definitive Edition so I had no prior attachment to original tracks, but no duds that I can think of. The game is also beautiful at times for a Switch game with a Wii game as a skeleton. That sounds backhanded, but anything I play after Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 will pale in comparison. The environments are huge & something to admire, as long as you donât look too closely. I also mostly prefer the combat of 1 compared to 2âs slower more health sponge combat, thereâs 1 glaring issue with it that Iâll get to later but I really loved how battles went so quickly, even most boss fights, compared to some of the absolute slogs of 2âs fights. The Future Connected epilogue was good, I really liked the open & more laid back feeling of the journey, but the way it was hyped up by some I was expecting a bit more, even though Iâm certain weâll be getting more answers during Xenoblade 3! :) What didnât I like? To start, a big nitpick would have to be the jankiness of the non-cutscene dialogue animations. I get this game & the original didnât have the biggest budgets in the world, but for a 10 year remaster I feel like things couldâve been touched up better with how good the rest of the game looks & runs. It was an issue in 2 as well, I hope 3 alleviates this because itâs distracting. Something that was beyond annoying was the vision mechanic in battle when using Shulk, who I used for 95% of the game as my main just like I did with Rex in 2. Canât rely on the AI to do the life-saving moves in a pinch after all, but the vision mechanic is designed to help you avoid a deadly attack or debuff. But if your party is low on health & within knockout range, the vision mechanic will keep activating until you have enough health back. This was a problem for me in harder battles of course (the game really wasnât hard aside from some roadblocks) because the pacing of battles is CONSTANTLY grinding to a halt to watch a death animation over & over again, basically leaving me begging for whoever to take the deadly hit so the vision would end & I could get back to actually playing the damn game to avoid the vision. BEYOND grateful they ditched this mechanic in every game afterwards, even Future Connected ditched it & its included in this bundle LOL. Story reasons my ass, they KNEW it was annoying & you canât convince me otherwise. I also donât like equipment systems in any type of games at all, even some of my favorite games of all time suffer from this. Spending half the play-time in menuâs reading stat changes with CONSTANTLY dropping equipment & items isnât fun & never will be. I remember staring at all the charts in both 1 & 2 while asking myself âDo I have to fill all this crap out? Why canât I auto assign this stuff?â. Doesnât appeal to me at all Iâm sorry. The last thing I didnât like was the sudden spike in difficulty in the later chapters, but some of these late game fights were total BS imo. Especially the final boss, who shredded me on my first attempts. Itâs not like I was level 65 going into it either, I was mid-70âs steamrolling 95% of the game without needing to grind once when I got to the finale. It was so frustrating that I debated giving up on it & just watching the rest on YouTube. I hate grindy experiences that the JRPG genre is known for, so for it to sneak in here in the 11th hour with it never having been an issue beforehand really rubbed me the wrong way. I swallowed my pride, acknowledged that Iâll never get the time back wasted on grinding & did it for a few more levels before going to test the waters to see if I could beat it with an extra 4 levels added on. And I beat the game on my first try after that lol. All in all, I really love Xenoblade despite me constantly clashing with some of itâs systems & trappings. Xenoblade 3 is easily one of my most anticipated games of the last few years at this point, so letâs hope it ties a neat bow on top of one of my absolute favorite storylines in gaming history.. Solid RPG I completed at work on my downtime. This game falls just short of being special. I was at a point in the game when I thought the game was about to end, and just the story went on another 10 hours. Plenty to do in this one. None of the NPCs are memorable. Shulk, on the other hand, is a good character that Iâm glad was represented in Smash.. The Definitive Edition is a improvement over the original. The graphics have been completely overhauled, and the game now looks absolutely stunning. The framerate is also much smoother, making the combat feel even more fluid.. A beautiful remake for a great game, this version have beautiful character models that fix the rather ugly (although understandable, given the 3DS capabilities). As the original, the game has an amazing story and a great soundtrack. It can get very grindy sometimes, but this versions has some quality of life upgrades that make the gaming experience better.. Absolute masterpiece. Seeing the characters I'm more of an anime style is really fitting. And the soundtrack is top tier. Mostly everything about this game is on point. Only knock I really have is the combat menu. Though you can up you combat the way that you like, picking moves can sometimes be a pain in the butt, especially when the action picks up.. Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition is a beautiful remaster of a classic JRPG with a sprawling story, memorable characters, and epic combat. It's a must-play for fans of the genre.. Truly live up to its name as ""Definitive Edition"", they took a perfect game and improve it even more. The beginning of everything. This is a very beautiful videogame, the environments, the areas you can explore, and all the different biomes are genuinely breathtaking. Exploring feels nice, there are random errands and side quests scattered through the world, it's almost something like an Open World. I liked the characters, it's rare for a JRPG to have many characters and make them all likeable, but Xenoblade Chronicles managed to do that and I didn't expect it. Every character plays differently, and there's a lot of customization, like changing outfits or even weapons, swapping and leveling up abilities, and progressing the skill-tree. As for the combat, in the beginning it felt fresh but it did get quite repetitive later on, I do like it but it's not anything special, it's enjoyable for the most part and there's some depth to it, and some cool mechanics. Also the music is great, the soundtrack is memorable and it's varied with beautiful overworld exploration songs and some pretty iconic battle themes. This is genuinely a very solid game, it reminded me of some old school JRPGs, and for its time it was probably one of the biggest. When I started playing it, I wasn't really blown away, the pacing is slow and it takes a while for the story to pick up, but the last few chapters are honestly impressive, by the end it really got better and better, there are so many plot twists and interesting ideas, and the pay-off is worth it. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. It's very hard for me to give any game a perfect 10/10, simply because there will always be flaws, but the good in this game is simply too good to deserve anything less.. Long, deep and interesting jrpg. Story is great but there is allways a conflict betwen the hurry the plot imposes and doing hundreds of silly secondary missions and collecting shiny things everywhere. The combat system is funny and original, I've never get tired of It. There are extreme peaks of difficulty that fells very unfair, you must grind at the very beggining and all the thousands of secondary missions becomes mandatory.. Xenoblade Chronicles - Definitive Edition for the Nintendo Switch is a remastered version of the critically acclaimed RPG that originally released on the Nintendo Wii. With updated visuals, improved gameplay mechanics, and additional content, this Definitive Edition breathes new life into an already captivating adventure. Visuals. Having never finished the original on Wii, I was determined to beat it when I got my Switch and it did not disappoint! Such an amazing story and game, the visuals are stunning! Only a few things kept it from that 10 rating but that's just nit picking it is a MUST play. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition arrived at the perfect time for me. While everyone else was playing Animal Crossing during pandemic lockdown, I was just not finding anything new that clicked during that awful time. I had previously tried playing the original XC on the Wii and Nintendo 3DS, but found the controls of the former and the visuals of the latter to be too off-putting. XC:DE fixes all the flaws of the first two versions and then goes a thousand miles further, making for an outstanding and unforgettable experience. The battle system takes some getting used to, but after getting past that initial hurdle, I found myself quickly enamored with the characters and their plights. The voice acting is generally good, though repetitive in battles, and the story wound up being one of my favorites in any game I've ever played. I can't recommend this game enough for RPG fans. It looks great, plays great, and packs some emotional wallops along with a few twists in the plot. The music is excellent and I still listen to the soundtrack from time to time. The new post-game content is fine, but nothing too special.. My third favorite game of all time but thatâs only because Xenoblade 2 and 3 were just that good.. I am okay with the new graphics and the new musical arrangements. They introduced a lot of QoL upgrades. The music , the story , the atmosphere , the combat all amazing. It's incredible how good this game is. This is how an adventure feels. It is also the first jrpg I recommend the english voice cast over the japanese one. Forget everything you may have heard about this franchise from a youtuber and try this one. Do yourself a favor if you like Rpgs and JRPGS. I discover Xenoseries with this XC, and it was a fantastic journey ! With a very good gameplay, the history and the lore are very well used.. One of the best games of the WII generation brought back with a bang. The developer didn't just overhaul the interface in combat, but every single menu, screen or function, the collection screen, empathic dialogues and especially the affinity chart, is now much clearer. My only negative note about this version is that it has some small censorships compared to the original and all versions including the JP version have this change. An immense and content-rich JRPG.. Xenoblade Chronicles is one of the best stories available in any video game about courage, friendship, and the power held within everyone, delivered by fantastic characters and a living world. FULL REVIEW: There are many times where Action RPGs are well worth their near-sixty-hour tenure, whether through gameplay or storytelling. Luckily, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition offers a balance of both while revamping the graphical quality of a Wii game. As of writing this review, Xenoblade has three mainline titles and one spinoff title, with each iteration offering varying levels of success, gameplay, and stories. With Xenoblade Chronicles, players start in Colony 9, a town located on Bionis. Shulk, Reyn, and Fiora are good friends with one another, with Dunban offering the trio guidance, especially since heâs Fioraâs brother. Dunban also wielded the Monado, a mythical sword created by Zanza to combat the raging hatred towards Bionis and its people by the Mechons from Mechonis. The power struggle persists throughout Shulk and his partyâs adventure, kickstarted by Shulk seeking revenge for Fioraâs death at the hands of Metal Face. The game perfectly broadens the scope of whatâs at stake during Shulkâs journey by adding Sharla, a medic from Colony 6 in search of her brother, Melia, the daughter of the High Entia Emperor, and Riki, the chosen legendary Heropon of Frontier Village. Together, the party deals with emotional highs and lows. Those emotions reach the player in inspiring ways thanks to each characterâs goals and backgrounds, which are given great detail due to the main storyline and heart-to-heart exchanges. Players notice the party dynamic grow and strengthen, ultimately expressed through their compassion and comradery. The gameplay also adds depth to the already stunning storyline. Players travel around Bionis and Mechonis, revealing the gameâs massive world derived from a low-powered console in 2010. Biome diversity and collectibles only heighten the experience, giving way to often unique enemies to fight in the open world. The combat isnât my thing, but the game offers a few different modes depending on the playerâs skill behind a controller. Combining two or more charactersâ move sets is satisfying, especially when players divvy high amounts of damage to enemies. The game also lets players rejoin boss battles if their party members perish before defeating them, making boss battles better streamlined than many other titles. Unfortunately, Xenoblade Chronicles includes a few imperfections. While the story remains conventional for most of the playthrough, the endgame route is unexpected. Regardless of if itâs a playerâs first Action RPG, the gameâs finale is a bit extreme but is still entertaining to experience. With it being an Action RPG, it also comes with a 60-hour playtime. It will take players a while to finish the game before realizing Definitive Edition includes a postgame, adding more hours to the title. However, the game maintains satisfaction despite its playtime, becoming a title for those wanting an introduction to the Action RPG genre. This game is not perfect, but it is very close to it, and I am glad I got to join Shulk and his friends on such an awe-inspiring journey.. Excellent game like what I expect from the series but I like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 a bit more.. XB1 is the best among XB1 to XB3. If there were some changes made to the combat system, I believe XB1 could attract even more players. The game has a great story, music, and cutscenes. Additionally, I'm very pleased with the plot of the DLC.. one of the best JRPG ever made. great story and really good mechanic on the gameplay. i really love how story affected the gameplay.. An amazing world with one of the best stories in a video game though some characters feel like they are not needed in the story towards the end.. Amazing game. Story is absolutely captivating - maybe less at the beginning, but it builds up slowly your interest - very interesting characters and finally beautiful landscape that makes you stop 20 seconds just to admire the view. Gameplay can be slow and a bit boring, but it is an excellent game in overall.. It was already one of my favourite games ever on the Wii and the improvements of this version make it even better! Great Story, great pace and game mechanics still actual. It is a pity that the ""Future Connected"" is quite weak in terms of story and mechanics... a real new chapter linking to the other XBs (this is the main reason I gave only 9/10). Additional small note: after playing XB3, Chain Attacks feel a little simple and without the WoW effect. Some amazing unique fantasy landscapes that big fantasy fans will not want to miss. Fun auto based combat. Cool enemies that sadly repeat in new areas alot. Some bosses you need to grind for, with the last boss being one you will most likely need to turn ""casual mode"" on for, even if you have a solid team that has gotten you easily though the whole game up the that point [and no they do not let you teleport away to grind for that one]. Half the writing is good, half is extraordinarily cheesy bad anime/ 80's kids cartoon level writing. Lots of plot twists. 8 overall.. Great video game, definitely worth playing. The story involves and is full of twists and turns. The combat system sometimes shows its weaknesses, but it is still a child of the Wii era.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is amazing. Better graphics, better soundtrack and a cool expansion, it's not my favourite Xeno game, but who doesnÂ´t love Shulk and the bunch?. Xenoblade 1 DE is a masterpiece there is nothing else that needs to be said this game is almost perfect just play it and stop reading this review A True Modern JRPG classic. What can we say, the remake of the best JRPG ever made, made it even more enjoyable. My dream came true when this game was announced for switch. The music updates and extra content truly make this the definitive edition. This is the reason why I am crazy about this series. The game is very excellent and exciting in all aspects. The music is even more fascinating. It can be said that it is one of the best rpgs. I look forward to the new works in the future. Xc1 is a great game. It can be said that one of my favorite rpgs is excellent in all aspects. I miss the time I stayed up to play this game in the past. I recommend all rpg fans try it.. I finally understand the hype and why the fans pressured Nintendo to release this game in the west on the Wii back in the day. Awesome world-building, great relatable characters, jaw-dropping visuals, a beautiful soundtrack, and excellent gameplay. The definitive edition on the switch is the best version of this game.. Really a fantastic JRPG. Memorable characters, beautiful environments, fantastic music, and one of the best stories of any videogame I've played. The combat system is complex, but still understandable and the foresight mechanic is just brilliant. It doubles the combat system as a puzzle system, figuring out the best ways to redirect and prevent deadly attacks and setting up for high tension close calls. The game does have flaws though, half the quests are basic ""kill x monsters"" or ""fetch x items"" quests, which are boring and pad out the game unnecessarily. The quest tracking system is bad and you can easily get lost. The autorun system is not great and it's really frustrating how limited you are in increasing your walking speed. Despite these flaws, I'd still say this is a top quality game on the switch and if you like longer RPGs there is no reason not to buy. I will say though, that the future connected portion of the game is disappointingly shallow and needed much more work than it got. There are some fun moments there, but it simply does not deliver on the expectations a premise like it provides. 80-100 hour game. Absolutely fantastic story that pulls you right in. Had no issue with needing to grind levels game is very tight and consistent throughout. One of the best games on the switch.. Good plot, but the game play is terrible compared to xc2. The combat requires just scrolling through abilities and spamming them. The game forces you to complete side quests and mindlessly grind enemies even if you just want to play main quest it will throw you into impossible battles. Not worth the money, just play the second part and read the plot in the wiki. First half of the game was really enjoyable and I think it would have gotten a solid 8/10 from me. But the last few chapters are so damn annoying, I couldnât do it. The story is written like a 5 year old kid did it; everytime someone may die, something magic happens and everybody is saved. Literally EVERY SINGLE TIME. The narrators sound like they want to give voice for a kids cartoon show. Completely overdone and over dramatic voice acting. Everything apart from the combat and the world design is getting more cringey by the second. And as the sudden âbetrayersâ come up (what a plot twist, LOL), I had to put the game out. If you are under 10 years old, you might like it though.. One of my absolute favourites. I love this game. Great character deaign, overwhelmingly size and beautiful storyline.. Wow! A masterpiece giant between masterpiece games! Love a million times this game! Everything is perfect ","a boring, overly tedious, and generally underused battlesystem ruins an otherwise good story . the combat feels like a dude taking on a tsunami . the story IS good, but the combat feels like a dude taking on a tsunami ."
379.Call of Duty 2,"Good follow up to the previous Call of Duty. For a launch title in 2005, the graphics and gameplay feel nice considering the game is now 20 years old almost. If youâve been playing newer call of duty games like myself, you may have an adjustment period dealing with the slow feeling movement.. Brought a sense of spectacle and action to the new-at-the-time Xbox 360. Looked and moved great.. Call of Duty 2 improves everything the first did, and greatly improved its visuals to help sell Xbox 360 systems.. I remember how hard it was to beat it in the hardest difficulty. It took me weeks.. While probably good for it's time this game is quickly showing it's age when stacked up against newer games. The fragmented story and respawning enemies turn what should have been an exhilarating interactive trip through history into a chore.. Call of Duty 2 improves upon the first game in many ways. For starters the game looks much better and for a 360 launch title it still doesn't look to bad especially for its time. This one got rid of randomly changing between different fronts from the first game and instead just focus on each front for a few missions instead which makes it much less jarring to play through. The characters and story are still fairly shallow with no memorable characters except maybe Price but that's just because he shares the same name with a Price in Modern Warfare. I decided to play on veteran for this game just because all the achievements are just beat levels on veteran but I will say this COD game is surprisingly balanced even on the harder difficulty with only a few levels that felt way to hard where houses were felt like clown cars filled with respawning enemies. COD is a solid WW 2 shooter of its time but it still does feel a bit stiff to play at times with low weapon variety and a generic plot. Also the ending just kinda happens like the last level didn't even feel like the last level it just kinda ends. Not my favorite Call of Duty game but by no means is it a bad one.. For a game of its era the graphics were good and the combat was great. The only drawback for me was the weak story and poorly designed NPC's. It has non-stop actions and it's a fantastic WW2 game!. One of the best Call of Duty games ever made and just a great interpretation of WWII. This game makes you feel like a part of that time in history and gives a glimpse of what war was like. A very good game, a very good shooter, and the 2nd best WWII game second only to Call of Duty: World at War.. Some of the best call of duty games ever made! So happy Call of Duty 2 was full Xbox 360 and pc exclusive. Such a superior wwii story mode and amazing locations too. Honestly it's better than what Call of Duty is now. The amount of times the AI in story mode saved my behind is nothing compared to the dumb ones in the newer games. I said what I said.. Call of Duty 2 is a great sequel. In 2005, she simply had no competitors. You should also consider porting the game to Xbox 360. It was 2 part of COD that allowed the series to switch to consoles and also change the game industry. Classic genre worth recommending to everyone.. Good shooter that was in every major store as the 360 was being promoted for sale.. I've played almost every Call of Duty game, and this is still one I hold in high regards to this day.. One of the best call of duty game in the franchise and it so amazing dat it's a launch title. The only way the game Fields old is the checkpoint system field clunky sometimes but it only in some very few missions. The AI is very dynamic which makes it still one of the bunny game to play single player. This game seems very one dimensional on its surface. Just a WW2 shooter with a campaign based on history with a multiplayer mode. But it's way more than that! This game is excellent and playing it is so entertaining as i play as a Russian, a Brit, and an American. The diversity of the countries and theatre make the game less monotonous so it lasts longer. The story is amazing and even though the graphics aren't as stellar as they are nowadays (it was 2005 geez) the amazing missions make up for it. I am immersed in the gameplay and it keeps me entertained for hours. On top of that the score is amazing. The soundtrack is really good and the composer Graeme Revell deserves an award for it. This game is stellar. 10/10. It was a wonderful game for the time. Not sure if it needs to be played in 2020, but surely it was one of the fundamental shooters ever.. Growing up I used to be all about Medal of Honor, in particularly Frontline which came out in 2002. Then Call of Duty came out and I played it but never finished it for some reason. But then this sequel came out and BOY did this win me over and leave the Medal of Honor franchise behind. Not only are the graphics amazing (that still hold up pretty good today) but the campaign levels from each faction are great. You play as the Russians, British, and Americans and all of them have stand out levels. My only complaint would be that the Russian segments were a tad bit too long and the US segment was a tad bit too short. I can see why they did what they did because well we've always play as the US but I wanted to at least play as them a bit more than the other factions. Other than that minor complaint, a phenomenal game that might be my favorite World War II shooter as of date.. One of the best in the series, right behind BO1+2, COD 4 AND MW2. Health regen system for fast paced gameplay, basic multiplayer, great campaign and beefy gunplay. This game is deserving **** must play sticker. Graphics have aged well too. Although sadly it offers little reason for modern COD players to play as it doesn't link with any of the golden age COD's and has a very basic multiplayer.. Call of Duty 2 is a good enough package. It boasts solid gunplay, an immersive campaign that simulates you in the second world war effortlessly, but has a lackluster multiplayer mode. Even though this game must have been incredible back in 2005, in 2017 it just fails to hold up to our standards. Evident with the cheesy sound design, bad graphics, and corny voice acting, and the bad multiplayer, Call of Duty 2 is definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. But still remains a decent game.. This is honestly one of the good cod games. While I haven't played the multiplayer, the single player is the best part of the game, which great mission design and fun missions.. Call of Duty II is exactly as advertised: a straightforward World War II adventure where you play soldiers in some of the major battlefields of the war: Stalingrad, the north Africa campaign and the European front. In each case, you are a regular grunt seeing and participating at the ground level. On the plus side, the game does a good job of recreating the fronts and the kind of fighting the soldiers would have experienced. The game smartly uses the loading screens to provide brief historical notes to give the various sections context. The gameplay is fast and exciting but the game smartly pulls back from glorifying it too much, emphasizing instead the danger and chaos of frontline combat. On the minus side, the game uses regenerating health and continually respawning enemies. It seriously detracts from the realism when the player can get shot in the head without dying and then heal completely by hiding behind a tree for a few seconds. Having endless waves of the exact same enemies appear until you move on to the next point on the compass doesn't help either. The game's other feature is that the player controls Allied different soldiers in different fronts. It is a nice mechanic that allows for a panoramic view of the war but it also makes the game less immersive. Rather than play the same character throughout the game, you Quantum Leap from one to another, never staying with one long enough to feel really invested in their efforts. So, overall a good game, entertaining and respectful towards history, but not great either.. This Xbox 360 launch title really blew my mind. The game felt so real and it really **** you in. It also presented a challenge at its hardest game mode, unlike any shooter I was used to at the time. This was the new benchmark in the FPS genre and GOTY for Xbox 360 in 2005.. We should never forget that at the roots, Call of Duty was one of (the ?) best FPS about World War 2, the second episode of the franchise is still a living proof of how great they recreated this awful, yet epic conflict in a remarkable game with three different campaign offering more than 10 hours of gameplay (if only the modern episodes could take it in example). Obviously aged hasn't be kind to the game and all the visual aspects feel outdated (which is pretty normal 10 years after) at the time they were great, but the audio of the game is still awesome and when playing in veteran (one false step and you're dead), you hear dozens of bullets, explosions, and germans shouting all around you, you're kind of afraid and make the game very engagin. We also have a great IA especially for your allies (it's not often in FPS than you don't feel like your teammates are just waiting for you to do all the job) and big scale combats with a lot of characters at the screen. Technically this game was fabulous for 2005. The only main default of the game is the abuse of infinite respawn enemies in certain areas, I'm strongly against this in FPS (except of course when you're objective is to hold a position for a certain amount of time), too bad because the rest of the level design is near perfection. In conclusion even 10 years after the game is still a reference for the FPS genre, and if you like shooters and don't care too much about visuals I strongly advised this game (you'll find it for almost nothing in the market) you won't be disappointed.. This game is the best Call of Duty of all time. It's especially well done for the time it came out. It really paints a picture in your head of what the brutal, intense World War II was like. It has stunning visuals, stunning gameplay, and overall wonderful graphics. If your'e a Gamer Score hound like me, pick this game up, but be warnedâ¦ This game has the hardest veteran campaign in the whole franchise, but poses a great fun challenge. You will pull your hair out, and yell at your TV at some point believe me.. This game was fun in all, but a little boring at times. Play all of the other Call Of Duty's before this PROS -Nice Gameplay CONS -Poor Graphics -Hard gameplay -weak story. Don't get me wrong, this is a fairly good game. It's not quite what I understand the later CoD games are (the first 2 are the only ones I've played), in terms of a cinematic presentation. However, what it does, it does well: provides a very solid and enjoyable, albeit derivative, campaign of running various linear missions during World War II. The graphics are fairly good, though some textures are a little low res. However, it's a fairly fun game, and though there's not too much variety, it's fun nonetheless.. If you've already played the first game, then you know what to expect with this game. First off, the campaign once features 3 playable factions, Marines, UK, and Soviet Union. Also, unlike the first one, you no longer have a health bar, your health regenerates instead, making a little bit easier than the first. Overall, a great campaign. The mulitplayer on the other hand is pretty much the same as the first, except your teammates can't kill you and there is one less mode then the first. But the game runs at a consistent 60 FPS, and has major improvement and much better graphics than the first. Overall, superb game, 9.5/10.. This game has stood the test of time, I still think back to the Normandy beach landing and making my way through the trenches 8 years on. This was truly the last great Call of Duty with an immersive single player campaign. The Normandy beach landing was COD at it's best and is the best setting to show off there skills of an action packed scene of bullets and explosions, this was gaming's Saving Private Ryan. If your after a great WWII game this is the best and most memorable I have played.. The sequel in the series Call Of Duty is far better than my expectations. With 3 separate campaigns (Russian, British and American) and over 30 missions in total, outstanding variety of weapons for you to select, and enemy AIs being a lot more brilliant fighting with strategies, I' sure you certainly will not be disappointed.. Call of Duty 2 is a very addictive game, if you like these WW2 weapons more than all those modern high-tech stuff this game is great, The rifle only servers in the multiplayer can keep you going for ages. I've been playing this game since 2005 and have played over 4000 hours now.. A 2006 FPS that still looks and sounds beautiful in 2013? That's enough to describe how awesome the second installment of the Call of Duty saga was, and still is. Vasiliiiiiii!!!!. Awe-inspiring visuals and sound, brilliantly high-octane gameplay, and a beautiful sense of simplicity highlight ""Call Of Duty 2,"" Infinity Ward's perfect farewell to the WWII shooter genre.. Meh, single player was alright. Its multiplayer is probably the 2nd best in terms of CoD games so far, hillariously. It only lacks the multiplayer rpg features of cod4.. The second greatest COD ever made the story was good the guns were good the maps were fun it was a great game but there was no sprinting and the game gets a tad clunky at times. I've wanted this game since 2007 but now that I've finally got round to playing 7 years after its release, I can confirm that it is a great game. It comes as no surprise that it was once the most played game on Xbox LIVE. Controls are solid, sensitivity options are good, iron sights have perfect balance between zoom and field of view. Guns are satisfying and have nice weighty recoil. Graphics are better than World at War in terms of facial detail and environments and lighting. Multiplayer is very simple because you just pick the weapons available to your team. Very balanced between bolt actions, rifles and SMGs. Headshots are insta-kill too. This game also has 4 player split-screen and system link for LAN parties. The campaign is long but fairly decent. It lacks the immersion and movie-like feel of CoD4 or MW2, but for the time I can imagine it was solid. The 13 achievements totalling 1000G can all be gotten by completing the campaign on Veteran difficulty, which again is not too hard but not easy like MW2 and MW3. Checkpoints are frequent enough to help you too. However, the game can save at awkward points leading to your death over and over so you have to bear that in mind before running in. Smoke often leads to frame rate drops, and is frequently used in the campaign, but given that it runs at a smooth 60 FPS it's not too much of an issue. Overall a great game which really set down the foundations for the most revolutionary shooter of this generation;- Call of Duty 4.. Still the best Second World War first person shooter I have ever played! Unfortunately, although the graphics in Call of Duty 3 were superficially better, it was glitchy and the game play was not as good.. This game is really really really really good. I think this is good and excellent graphics. But the bad thing is that the price is too low. It needs to get higher. Because it is better than the oh so famous and stupid MW3. Thank you for your time.. As one of the early Xbox 360 games, Call of Duty 2 was alot of fun and had nice graphics. COD2 is probably one of my most favorite WW2 based games of all times and it is alot of fun, shooter fans def. check it out.. Cod 2 is one of the best Cod's ever made. Campaign is just fantastic. Multiplayer is good to. Just a great Cod. Campaign 9/10 Multiplayer 8/10 Cod 2 8.9/10. For a FPS that was made in 2005 this holds up extremely well, the campaign is epic and one of the best in the series, and the graphics look great for a game that came out in 2005, and the sound design is still top notch and fantastic, and if you've played a recent Call of Duty game you'll have no problem playing this as the controls are identical, the only thing different from this and newer Call of Duty games is that there isn't a sprint option and there isn't a knife but you do have a riffle butt so melee attacks aren't a one hit kill, and you will still be able to find a multiplayer match every now and then, and the multiplayer is still fun but flawed, I like the fact that you can change classes in the middle of a match which is cool, but the fact that you can change teams in the middle of a match so if your team is losing you can just jump on the others is a huge flaw, but obviously you'll just play a newer Call of Duty for your multiplayer fix, but it's still cool to play a match or two just to see how far it's come from then, the best part about this is the fantastic campaign which is action packed and will keep you coming back, honestly I have to say I loved this and that it's the best World War 2 FPS I've ever played, and this is a must play for Call of Duty, World War 2, or FPS fans, or just people who like to play fantastic games, I highly recommend.. For a game that is like six years old, this i what is Call of Duty in one hundred percent . Adrenaline and non stop action is what you expect. The single player is enough to satisfy every one, in fact even better than all the short campaigns of the latest entries. Have a problem with Multiplayer? don't complain because is as addictive as ever.. The First great Shooter for the Xbox 360? You bet your whole 120 million dollar mansion it is. Not only that, but out of all the games in the Call Of Duty Franchise, this is the best. No, that's underestimating it. It is the ULTIMATE Call Of Duty Game to have. It is Infinity Ward's Masterpiece. Call of Duty 2, best played on the 360, is a testament to the modern day First Person Shooter. Unlike the original Call Of Duty, Call Of Duty 2 takes us to places in the war more epic and diverse than the Original. Normandy, the greatest and most gruesome battle of the War, is portrayed in CoD2. North Africa is portrayed in CoD2. Moscow is portrayed in CoD2. Stalingrad is portrayed in CoD2. It is an amazing experience. Not only that, but multiplayer is kick-ass awesome aswell. Very rrare in the Call Of Duty series a GREAT CAMPAIGN and GREAT MULTIPLAYER. Only two other in the Call Of Duty titles achieve this. Well done, Infinity Ward!. This is my favorite shooter ever. Great play and feel. Perfects controls. Completely balanced. Good graphics for it's time. THIS is the game that started the COD franchise. Single player was definitely fun and made me feel like I was in a war. It was excitement and full of emotion. Multiplayer was the best multiplayer experience I've ever had on a game. No BS perks and killstreaks like the newer CODs. Just a man and his gun. (And a grenade or launcher or to).. Apparently these people don't realize that this is a pretty early xbox 360 game. It is a very solid shooter with solid graphics and gameplay. The missions are fun and it keeps you busy after you beat the campaign with a solid multiplayer mode.",call of duty 2 is a great follow up to the 2005 launch title . the graphics and gameplay feel nice considering the game is now 20 years old almost . it's a solid WW2 shooter of its era but it still feels a bit stiff to play at times .
38.LittleBigPlanet,"For me the game was creative and entertaining for many hours. One of my favourite games for the PS3.. I have a lot of nostalgia playing the story mode of this game, which has some well crafted levels. But the story mode wasn't why my young self was excited to play this game back in 2008. I always liked creating things as a child. I loved making my own Transformers out of Legos, using Bionicle sets to make my own characters, and even dabbled with the MUCH more obscure but similar Xevos toys to do the same (doubt anyone remembers those), when not gluing random objects together to look like ""Xenosaga"" monsters. Point is, I used to love making things, and was so obsessed with creation that I even attempted to make boss bottles in ""Tony Hawk's Underground""'s 'Create a Skate Park' mode on PS2, which frankly was desperate (I didn't play a lot of PC games back then). When this came out on more advanced hardware with things like an elaborate physics engine and everything, I was DEAD excited to get to crafting the levels of my dreams. Unfortunately, either this game was incompatible with my brand of creativity, or just an unbelievably broken mess. I don't ever hear people talk about this at all, but the game is so broken and unreliable, especially in regards to its physics engine, that I just could never make any level I wanted to make. Granted, I wasn't particularly interested in making traditional side-scrolling levels in the vein of this game, which is a very generic but serviceable side scroller, as displayed in its perfectly okay story mode. I wanted to make scrolling shooter levels, or levels that let you drive vehicles. But contrary to the message of the game, any attempt to go outside of its boundaries had me in absolute tears (I actually cried at least once when I couldn't get a level to work) because all the bolts you'd use to put parts together kept breaking, all the pistons you'd use to have moving platforms would keep breaking, and absolutely NOTHING would ever come together the way I wanted, leaving just the story mode, community levels, and the other major lingering problem which is how inherently lifeless the game is at its heart. You play as the now iconic Sackboy, who, frankly, controls like ****. They're way too fragile, barely have any capacity to manipulate the world in any way, and just don't feel satisfying to play as at all. On top of that, unless you play with other players, there's only one Sackboy that exists in the entire world, with everything else, including other characters, having to be made out of other artificial objects that don't interact with the world the same way you do. The ""Metal Gear Solid"" DLC mitigates some problems by giving you a paint gun, allowing you to shoot things, but it still never really felt like I could ever craft my own creations as opposed to forcibly working within the games honestly very rigid confines. I honestly deeply HATE this game for betraying what I wanted out of it, and for how poorly it executed the one thing it had to do, as I felt gaslit into thinking that my creative vision wasn't compatible with perhaps one of the first games that promised to allow me to express it. Thankfully, the sequel fixed the problems with how broken it is, but only because its newly added features (like turning objects indestructible) pretty much acted as failsafes for game assets that constantly kept breaking in this one. Again, I had nostalgia playing the story mode at least, but that wasn't good enough.. Its if not, one of the best games I've ever played. Whenever i see a sandbox game i always think about LBP. The original LBP just sticks out as the best and the best platformer there is. The nostalgia it holds for me is tremendous.. This game would be my favourite if it wasnt for LittleBigPlanet 2. Why did you shutdown the servers Mm? P.S. I would do anything just to add the servers back.... This game should deserve a remaster itâs one of the best game Iâve ever played in my life. If you played this game in 2008-2010 it is not easy to forget the nostalgic feeling this game will make you feel. This game can change **** only according to its time but even now. It offers almost unlimited freedom to play with your friends and family. Its a 10/10 game for me.. Frustrating, but a really fun platformer. Extremely wholesome and fun. This took me a few days to beat but it didn't matter, even when I was losing my mind trying to beat a level I was still having a good time. The game is just so wholesome and fun that it's hard to get mad at.. This little game is really simple but really fun, especially if you play with a friend! Its physics makes a lot of big games take a beating and it even has DLC from other games like Motorstorm and Killzone. little big planet is so good i would rather bang my own mom than live in a universe where this wasnt greenlit, this game was so amazing and impactfull to my childhood especially due to how i always loved modes of creative expression. minecraft, garrysmod, people playground, and of course LBP are my favorite games for a reason, plus this game's artsyle is phenomenal, and the change in art direction is one of the few complaints i have for LBP2, overall great game but the servers being dead basically killst 2/3rds of the games premise. I really love this game because of the way how it improves the classical 2d platformer mode. I also think we need games like that nowaday.. A 10/10 family/friends/solo game this game is truly the full package you can justbuy the console and just play this there are so many community creations so many people you can play this game for hours and hours and never get bored such a master piece in the gaminghistory will never be forgotten definitely a G.O.A.T game. this game changed my life forever, it was my first playstation3 game and it will always be my favourite. the game and mechanics where easy to understand and made sense to me when i first got it. the story was also well thought out and it was actually understandable. One of the most creative games of all time. This game has pretty good story and lots of things in multiplayer. Sadly it is only playable on LTP3 but when it was still playable on this it was one of the best things. Players were so creative and our little sackboy became so iconic for Playstation.. I recommended this good story and two player and good day. One of the best PS3 games. The first game in the series is a well-made start. It's levels are very great, the create mode is very fun, and the servers are... down. But that's ok! THe story is still amazing, and that's what counts Media Molecule.. Having played this game in 2023, I think it is still a fun and interesting game. For me, the opportunity to play together on one screen is valuable. It was fun.. Quality platforming with the ability to create custom content. And locally, it is just fun.. This game is byfar one of the best PS3 games i've ever played. Anyone who wrote a negative review is objectively wrong and you shouldn't listen to them because they are just man children who crap on any great game. I still play this game to this day because of how amazing it is!. The G.O.A.T of games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This game brings memories back. I am not a competetive gamer and mainly play casual and me and my sister would spend hours just building random levels than made no sense. I never tried to finish the game beacuse I was young and it was hard. I didn't care and still look upon this game very fondly. You just build weird stuff.. I absolutely loved the levels but found it dull after finishing them. The fact that multiplayer is needed to get 100% completion on some levels is absurd. I play games usually alone and offline so this made it hard to enjoy the game to it's fullest. The map creation is an amazing concept and theres a lot you can do but theres really no use in using it. I get that you can publish them but if you play offline then it's a useless feature. This game was MENT to be able to play offline and online yet once you finish the story mode you're forced into online. Summary: This game is enjoyable if you plan to play it online. If played offline it can get dull fast.. I honestly cannot describe how great this game is. This little platformer for the PS3 is truly one of the most innovative video games ever created, even 15 years after its release. The sequels are great too, but this game in particular has a handmade aesthetic that the other games lack. Everything created by the developers in the story mode can easily be replicated by yourself in the create mode of the game. Speaking of create mode, LBP lets you make your own levels and you can publish them online. Although the servers have been shut down, efforts to make custom servers have started, allowing you to experience the online aspect of the game. This game is truly like no other, and will be remembered as one of the greatest PlayStation games for years to come.. I don't know how the hell this game has a mixed rating. It's one of the best Playstation games ever created. So charming. So creative. Fun in its purest form! I'm never not happy when I play this game and this series.. Very nice game for the ps3. Authors had idea how to make an interesting game. Very original graphic. LittleBigPlanet is an overall great game. Here are 3 things I thought were done really well. 1. It has fun and simple gameplay, easy enough for a 5 year old. 2. It has one of the most unique idea of any game on the PS3. Making levels was only done on PC at the time. 3. Comparing other create modes, LittleBigPlanet has one of the best create modes, only beat by it's sequels. However, I have 3 critiques. 1. The single player ****. It's 3 hours and has no plot. 2. It often can be difficult to find good levels among the some of the garbage. 3. The create mode can be very complicated. It can be really difficult to use some of the more complicated tools.. Fantastic platformer and a must play of the PS3. Tons of fun and couch co-op is great. A true classic.. One of the few good couch co op games at the time. Really deep customization. Honestly some of the most fun you can have with a kids game, its got a whole load of content to it, so many creative puzzles and the iconic sackboy we all love and miss dearly. Please reboot this series I miss it. For me the game was creative and entertaining for many hours. One of my favourite games for the PS3.. (9.5/10) - A classic Playstation game that encourages creativity in every aspect. Unbelievably great soundtrack too.. Media Molecule impresses with its debut appearance on the PlayStation 3. LBP is a great example of what creativity can bring you.. this is the best game ever made. The graphics were nothing special but still very good. every single second of this game was amazing. this is THE best game i've ever played in my entire life. God, the player review on this game is not deserving. Arguably the BEST game Iâve ever played. And Iâve played hundreds. Itâs original, nostalgic, upbeat, and has one of the best original soundtracks out there, with very catchy music that I study to, to this day even. The player base is/was also very welcoming and awesome to play with ( of course there will be outliers here ) but it was one of the few games that I enjoyed playing with other people, complete strangers, with. This game deserves far more credit than it got, being a genre defining game that was amazing even YEARS after its release. I just hope that the memory of this game is remembered and the old players and friends Iâve made pray that MM reopens the servers. However unlikely. This game is a 10/10 all day long.. Awesome, special game, good music, good style, simple story, good community, it's perfect. Definitely a must play if you have a ps3, the best game on the platform I dare say, huge recommendation for Adults and Kids alike!. Very enjoyable and entertaining i see nothing wrong with this game. And you can create whatever you want. The absolute pinnacle of my childhood. This game awoke so much love and creativity within me as a kid, and has stuck with me as a marvel of what videos games can be.. Buy this game. Do it. It may be the most fun game Iâve ever had the chance to play in the last decade. Playing LittleBigPlanet is doing yourself a favor, trust me.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 7 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 7 Music: 7 Story: 8 Total: 7.33. An amazing game, i managed to play this game on my ps3 and it was extremely good, but, when i was like 8 or something, i rejected it, now i regret doing that, so, i highly recommend this game if you want to play it for the first time or to experience nostalgia!. This game was a mainline 2D Mario game combined with Mario Maker a whole decade before Nintendo thought to do it themselves.. An actual masterpiece, the icon himself Sackboy makes his debut in one of the greatest PlayStation exclusives out there. The story: masterpiece. The gameplay: masterpiece. The game-modes: masterpiece.. A creative and inspiring journey through all the world. A truly masterpiece and one of the best games ever made.. There are no words to describe how much of a masterpiece this game is, especially for its time.. Nice little game. Big amount of creativity. Sequels are much better, though.. It was the first game i've ever played, the game is a masterpiece. The story, the gameplay, the character, the online scene. Everything is perfect about the game. This game was pretty neat! I got it for free when that hack on the Playstation server happened. I'm not the biggest fan of ""create your own level"" games because I have no creativity lol. Hence Why my score isn't higher. LittleBigPlanet is very big fun! The presentation of this game is cute and addresses both young and mature players. You play around with cool physics in a lively world full of puzzles and secrets. The multilayer improves the value of this game enormously. Beautiful!. Had a great time with this game. Loved the music. Story mode could have been way better I think.. I enjoyed playing this game with my nephew. It's such a jolly time and also a very good creation tool mode to boot. The costumes were good too.. A fun platformer for the whole family. Interesting levels, funny characters. Lots of fun.. This is an excellent platformer, lots of fun and very kid friendly. The visuals are cute and engaging, the gameplay is challenging without being abusive or offering too steep a learning curve. The level designer allows you to customize your own levels and that creates immense content from other gamers who created and shared those levels. Overall, excellent game.. I'm surprised to see that the user score is so low. It's the last great platformer, the first great PS3 exclusive, and one of the greatest games of all time. This game did have some very awkward controls that needed getting used to. The greater community is remarkably active in 2020 with 150-400 players online at most times.. Visually, LittleBigPlanet looks great. It introduces âSackboyâ, a cute character Sony tried very hard to turn it into a Playstation 3 mascot. Also, you can create your own levels and share with the rest of the world, which was somewhat valuable at a time where Super Mario Maker didnât exist. Every other thing about LittleBigPlanet is terrible. Never have I seen a platformer with such clunky controls and dull gameplay to receive so much praise. With a 95 metacritic score, LittleBigPlanet will be always be sufficient to prove that the majority of mainstream video game critics are corporate sellouts. LittleBigPlanet is objectively bad and I am glad we donât have to rely on so called âgame criticsâ anymore to make our purchasing decisions.. There's nothing else for me to say, but this IS the most underrated game on the PS3. The graphics, while not too complicated, are creative and beautiful. The levels are spontaneous and weird, and is a complete trip to play through. It has an immersive soundtrack, which will have your head bopping throughout. Also, I love the in-depth level creator, which you can expand your creative horizons. Finally, the only thing holding this game back is its slippery controls, but they are tolerable. Overall, this game is a must-have!. The first ever Little Big Planet is a testament that creativity in video games is a blessing. This game is so creative with its level design and the level editor, you can make anything from shark survivals platform levels and boss levels the possibilities are endless. This game also has an incredible story mode with unique level design and interesting looking visuals. The customization in this game is fantastic, from your sackboy to the way you design your levels. The soundtrack of the game is so memorable and amazing absolutely outstanding coming from this kind of game. Sadly the online is alright sometimes it works and sometimes decides not to work. Little Big Planet is a creative masterpiece with an okay online but with an incredible design. (Amazing 4/5) Your Missing Out!. A very fun level maker style game with a really fun adventure platformer in it. Iâd say the sequels improve on the formula and there are certainly some more accessible level creators *cough cough* mario maker, but this is a fun game. Oh my god, this is such a good game. It's abundantly obvious that the developers of this game actually cared about it and had an actual passion for it. There is just so freakin much to do. You can customize your own sack character in so many ways. The creativity is off the roof. The levels designs are also very creative. There are a wide variety of things to do. And the online modes are amazing. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of user-created stages to play. And if for some god forsaken reason you run out of levels to play, you can create your own. The possibilities are truly endless. In short, LittleBigPlanet is astronomically amazing. One of the best PS3 games of all time.. This Game in my honest opinion is the best Platformer on the PS3 and it is most definitely an essential exclusive. You play the sack boy, an all customisable, emotive, friendly little creature that you can design yourself to suite your own personality. it is essentially a simple 2d platformer with puzzles, challenge sections, mini games and boss battles, The colourful worlds you visit, the soundtrack and controls are all excellent, Media Molecule equivocally nailed it.. The Game is also playable with 4 friends offline and online where creators from around the world can connect and share thier own designs in the level building mode, anyone with an ounce of imagination can create thousands of fun, creative levels to play with friends or strangers. Excluding all these extra modes and mini games i would give this game a 9.5/10 due to how good the story mode is on its own merit. Kids can play it, Adults can play it, literally anyone can play this game and i assure you you will love it. if you own a PS3 you must buy this game.. hi well unlike others I never grew up with this game the 1st on I play was little big planet karting and I only got this game in late 2017 after I started playing 2 and 3 two back in 2014 and while do think its a does not derive the bust rated LBP game on this site I will say its good yes i think you will be butter with lbp2 or 3 its still a good game however the part about LBP that make these games special, the community is very bad well yes back in 2008-2012 it was decent now its all just like **** clickbait games expect less cringy *cough* ""trends"" it all just a bunch of copied levels all with the same overused levels. overall if you can deal with the lack of original the community levels go for it but if you are looking for a butter game as in community get lbp2 or 3. Itâs an outstanding game, a true masterpiece and the reason I had bought a PS3! It offers a unique experience to the player and the chance to free your creativeness by making levels by yourself. Literally, although I am filled with nostalgia, the game was the best of its time and definitely stood out of its competitors. You can even give it a try to date and find active players in the servers, even though the game was made 10 years ago!. It's a fun game sure but I got bored after a couple hours. Tried multiplayer but the boredom quickly returned.. Definitely one of the most iconic franchise for the play station and a masterpiece. I will never forget all the joy and memories playing with friend. It's been 10 years since its release and its still fun and full of creativity. I really hope MM and Sony revive this franchise in the future #save littlebigplanet.. Way more limited than its sequel, but the game is still a blast and will always have a special place in my heart.. A fun game with a cute art style, let down by floaty controls and repetitive gameplay. Improved upon with the two sequels.. My favourite game EVER! This game is true masterpiece! The story mode is very dynamic and fun, the 'creation mode' is well-worked, the online mode is just perfect, the graphics are marvelous and that's the only game that makes me to keep my PS3, because I like Nintendo. You won't regret by playing this game. It made me very happy and I want to cry when I think how incredible was that! The game is just perfect - 100/100. Media Molecule didn't any mistake with the game. Sackboy is my favourite character, surpassing Pikmin and Yoshi!. Honestly back in the days when i got this game day one, it was sooo much fun and honestly a big breath of fresh air. I loved it and played it sooo much thanks to the great multiplayer and online.. Honestly, as someone who really loved the sequel, I wasn't a huge fan of this one. This is probably due to playing the second one first and being spoiled by how good it was, but it's still hard for me to return to this game. The Create Mode, while good for it's time, I never use because everything is better in the sequels (seriously, using Create Mode with out the ""hide"" feature is like missing a limb). As for the levels, some are good, a select few are bad, most are just okay. None of the characters and locations really stand out in a positive way. Except for The Wilderness. I love almost everything about that place, and it's the one thing I replay this game for. As for getting all prizes, I still haven't done it. Completing certain levels without dying are hard enough, especially when explosives are involved (looking at you, Boom Town), but challenges requiring multiple challenges are just cruel. There are only a few that require more than two players, but I still only own 2 controllers, and I have to rely on online play to complete them.. This game is wonderful. I got it together with the PS3. So much fun to create your own levels. I don't know how often I played the ""race"" on the big skateboard.. This is the most innovative, most creative game that just doesnât seem to go anywhere. There is âStoryâ mode, but I felt like there really was no storyline except for venturing to different areas of - you guessed it - Little Big Planet. At least with the Mario games, youâve got to rescue Princess Peach. Here, you have little ventures once youâve traveled to the area, but no larger, overall story. The whole collecting of stickers and costumes is a little nerdsome - although I do have to admit I gave my Sackboy a Snidely Whiplash mustache and Teddy Roosevelt teeth. The game is too laid back - with no central major boss, no goal in site. It's emphasis is on gameplay, not story. I found myself smiling at parts, swearing at others. The whole concept behind collecting the cutesy little stickers and being able to dress your sackboy in various attire seemed like a big waste of some ideas and time, and I really couldn't wait to complete the game, with it's oh-so happy-happy-joy-joy Sesame Street ending, and disappointing conclusion. But I guess that's what I should have expected from a game without a real beginning or explanation on what is happening.. I have not yet played another LittleBigPlanet game after this one, though I have a memory of it. When it was first released, it was a total innovation in terms of gameplay and online possibilities. Offline mode is good enough, and poses a nice challenge if you want to get all the collectibles and beat it without dying. However, it is the online mode that offers almost infinite possibilities of creating and playing others' levels. I remember playing really good levels made by other users. It does have some minor technical problems, but the innovation was so remarkable that it does not really matter.. Before this came out, Sony was truly lacking a quality platforming game for the PS3. But LBP is SO MUCH MORE than just jumping and smashing stuff. Its all about customizing, creating, decorating and getting the most out of what the game offers. My daughter, whom is 4 even loves playing it! (with the help of dad, of course) Which makes this a pretty simple game to pick up and play. With that said, if you've never played it and enjoy platform jumping games, you'll really have a lot of fun with this.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a pretty good game, though the sequels were better. This was the start of one of the best ""Game Maker"" game series ever. The first game lacks a few things, but if there's one thing the first LBP does better than the other games, it's more simple. There's still a lot you can do, but because there's more you can do in the sequels, they get a little more complicated to make, at least if you want to make a good level that is. LittleBigPlanet is a good game.. A great game full of creativity and colour, one of the best debut platforming games ever. The online community has created so many levels there's always something to play, but the story-line seems to lack an objective or flow.. Game: LittleBigPlanet Genre: Adventure Platformer Developer: Media Molecule/Sony System: Playstation 3 (PS3) Total Score: 82/100 Value Score: 8.2/10 â¢ Story: 7/10 â¢ Characters: 7/10 â¢ GamePlay: 9/10 â¢ Graphics: 8/10 â¢ Sound: 10/10 â¢ Music: 7/10 â¢ Length: 6/10 â¢ Replay Value: 10/10 â¢ Player Value: 8/10 Pros +Well made puzzle mechanics in platformer style of level design +Community levels with the ability to play with other players offers great amount of replay value especially with new levels popping up +Create your own levels +Ability to use stickers/decorate levels +Customize and design your character with different costume parts and colors +Great sound effects and great narrator +Challenge levels introduce mini game style levels Cons -Sometimes controls can be clunky or slow compared to other platformers which can make certain levels frustrating -Narrator only speaks in the tutorial levels -Slight lag in some aspects of the game including Single player levels. I was shocked to see the user score for this game. This is not the score it deserves. An infinite playground of innovation and fun with creative potential rivaled only by its sequel certainly deserves better. I'm not a fan of insulting opinion, but this is just wrong.. Yet again, my review for this got ruined, its an amazing game, with a great deal to do. It has fun and creative charm to it, with an excellent online mode. Not to mention a relatively good creation system.. Best level creating game of all time for sure. Whether you are playing the story, creating levels or playing other users levels it is superb. Coop is frustrating as hell but really fun at the same time especially on one of the last levels with that massive wheel that can electrocute you where me, my brother and my sister spent ages trying to beat it.. This is one of best platform game on the market.This is must buy For Everyone who loved games like super mario,rayman etc.Media Molecule make fresh innovate game for people from 7 to 77 years old.. this is the game that made me care about user ratings, one of those games where you feel the clash between user and critic reception -- the clash that even makes the more paranoid among us wonder whether all those critics have been bought out. aaaaaanyway. this is a 2d platformer, which is to say it's a mario wannabe. it was hard enough for sega to try to get its platformers to stand out way back when, but they did manage, and the first sonic games are good, different and better-looking than the mario games. where sonic differed for being fast and cool, sackboy wants to stand out for being... slow, floaty, imprecise, i guess? and OH MY GOD there's a narrator that narrates the game like a children's book, and i'm gonna try to be fair here and saying without exaggerating that about 40% of the time i spent with this game was hearing his voice talk veeery slowly while i pushed buttons to try to skip his monologues. just awful. i get it -- the game is for kids. but kids in the 80s didn't need santa claus narrating video games in order to have fun, and they still don't.. Little Big Planet is like nothing I've ever played before, which is a good thing. It has unique and charming level design, and it can even get challenging near the end, It can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. There's four player co-op so that makes it even better, and theirs over 1 million online user generated levels, which you can make. You can make your own levels and publish them online for others to play and you can customize your character, It's really a wonderful game that gives me good memories, and im sure you will say the same.. All time favourite game back in the day of the PS3, this is the only thing I miss from the Playstation. I am an XBOX ONE user now but still this game will forever be my favourite Playstation game.. Amazing game and great fun. It's simple yet can be complicated or you can make it complicated yourself. Great different themes and music choices throughout the game. I can't understand the low user score. One of the best PS3 exclusives. 10/10 (I played this back in 2009, I'm just now writing the review). As an adult gamer i do not like this game. I do not care about level creation. I pay to have that done ahead of time. I look for challenge, skill and precise control in a platform game.(howdy rayman your good stuff.) thats it champs.. Original, universally fun, and a joy to play. A breath of fresh air among brown, boring garbage. Listening to the angst-filled poutyfaces who rated this a 3 or under will get you nowhere. Playable for all ages.. Little Big Planet was a fun little game. And when i say little, I mean it, because it was very short. It took about 3 to 4 hours to finish the game. The Co-op is great, the levels are great and the soundtrack was amazing. The biggest downfall of this game is how short the game is, but it leaves you wanting more.. Innovative, charming, versatile and full of fun. LittleBigPlanet is a must have for most gamers on the Playstation, and has the potential to be one of the best games of the generation. It provides a spark that many games cannot do, and Sackboy convinces the public they are playing video games in the future.. A good PlayStation exclusive game, LittleBigPlanet captures everyone's imagination with a heartfelt storyline and fun game-play. Although the online connection for this game is appalling, there is no doubt this is a great co-operative game for the younger gaming audience. 8/10 - Ben Hazelden. You cannot find a bad thing about this game!! It's super fun, tons of laughs, lots of creativity, never get board, for all ages, the best online gaming and much much more. It is the greatest game this generation will ever play!!. It's a really cute game, that is especially fun with a friend, but the unique design made it hard for me to play. It might just be my vision, but it was really difficult distinguishing what was in the foreground, and the background. Something about the design made depth in the game very confusing. I would recommend playing this game on a screen that ","for me the game was creative and entertaining for many hours . but the story mode wasn't why my young self was excited to play this game back in 2008 . the game is so broken and unreliable, especially in regards to its physics engine, that i could never make any level I wanted to make ."
380.Burnout Revenge,"IF you prefer something less realistic sim racing and more arcade pure fun racing, this game is for you. This follow-up to ""Burnout 3"" is just as exhilarating. It features a darker look, slicker vehicles, more takedowns and a harder rocking soundtrack. The track designs have also been upgraded with alternate routes and shortcuts. However, gameplay is less innovative and the new addition of ""Traffic Checking"" makes things too easy. While ""Revenge"" is basically an updated ""Burnout 3"", it still ranks up with the greatest racers ever made. I would rate this with a 9.1 out of 10.. This game was so fun and incredible for it's XBOX hardware.. Played Burnout 3 before playing Revenge and considered the best arcade racing game experience EVER. I was very amazed when Burnout Revenge not only managed to keep that great formula but to also improve on it. If Burnout 3 is a 10/10 for me this is a 11/10. A shame I can't actually give it that rating here. Absolutely recommend it, very fun. Also I love the soundtrack","if you prefer something less realistic and more arcade pure fun racing, this game is for you . ""Revenge"" is basically an updated ""Burnout 3"" but still ranks up with the greatest racers ever made ."
381.Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King,"Imaging making the game not dead easy like DQXI, with not just lovely character, but sexy characters, without modern censorship and without modern bash on sex appeal or fan service. Now add funny moments that are actually funny and finally add the sense of adventure that old JRPGs used to have. That sum what DQVIII do well. You actually die in this game and dying have consequences, dead character can only be revive on save points (till you get the magic to revive, but that's like 20h into the game and it's a 50/50 magic) and getting wipe out take half of your money. I would not say this is a hard game, it's not, but is not completely easy. The look is a 10 out of 10 for a PS2 game, the jump from DQ7 is HUGE, the biggest in all the series. Toriyama's character design is beautiful, even for NPCs. Jessica gets a lot of fan service costumes and details, I'm always grateful for that, because is something modern mainstream games are not allow to have anymore. For me the weakest part of the design are the monsters, i can't get used to the goofy monsters of DQ games. Scenarios and overall world looks awesome. The world is very open and the sense of ""going in an adventure"" is very strong, there's no waypoint or HUD message saying where to go all the time. The story is super simple and classic, clichÃ©, i would say. Alchemy and Monster Arena do a decent job to add some variety to the formula. My main complain is how painfully SLOW everything is... No skip, nothing have skip here. Saving takes take like 10 unnecessary question and/or menu movement, same with item movements, menu navigation, everything. Random encounters makes exploration feel slow too, I feel for PS2 era we should already have real monsters on the map.Also, this game is grindy, unfortunately, the main and almost only way the game knows to add difficulty is raising levels, farming is almost mandatory. There's very little place for skill or tactic in this game, gameplay is super straight foward, plain for RPG standards. Status-effect, buffs/nerfs, elemental rock-paper-scissor... pretty much all is negated in most important battles, they feel useless to be honest. So if you want a comfy adventure and you have the necessary patience, i recommend this game, its one of those works where you can clearly see it was made with love. In my opinion this is the right game to get into the Dragon Quest series.. Dragon Quest 8 starts off slow, and steady, and while that may drive some players off, if you stick with it, DQ8 will win your heart with its endearing characters, and large than life story. 8 still contains much of the same tropes of the Dragon Quest series it is a part of, but this proves to be much more **** element to the series, then a tiring one.. This is absolutely, without doubts, the worst game I've ever played in 31 years of my life. I've been into gaming since I was 2 years old. I played DQ1, DQ11, all the FF saga, blue dragon, all Fire Emblem entries from the SNES onwards. After 20 hours of playing, NOTHING happened. I closed the game just when the monster arena and the Chateau Felix appeared to be inserting SOMETHING into the game. This is a pure cashgrab with diluted story, gameplay and without doubts one of the worst in terms of characterization of each individuality. There is no surprise, characters are just tropes into a game, there is literally zero motivation to play the main quest, the gameplay is insanely simple and straightforward, just rushing towards the highest DPS with little to no strategy regarding statuses or anything worth mentioning. Monsters design is TERRIBLE, wtf are two peppers on a stick doing? I spent 20 hours waiting for the game to get better, only to see mechanics that should've been there from the start diluted just to make this **** insanely long, uninspired, boring and ultimately a nostalgia trip for even more boring people. HORRIBLE.. I played this game all the time when I was younger. It's got a great story, a good soundtrack, fun characters, and it's simply just really fun to play. There's very few actual flaws that I can think of, and even if there were, this game is just so good that the flaws don't matter in the long run. Highly recommend.. This is one of the only games that gave me a true sense of adventure. I'd argue that the random encounters actually enhanced that, because traversing the overworld wasnt just something that cost time, it cost resources. It almost became a survival game where you had to make sure you were stocked up before leaving a town. That was an experience I never experienced before or since. It was great. In general the game's world is amazing and so adventurous. The characters are pretty goofy, and the art style is adorable, and that gives the game a very wonderful feel to it. The combat is also significantly superior to that of Final Fantasy. Characters have limited resources to use in battle, and the game is legitimately challenging. That said, you can unfortunately just grind your way through everything. There also isn't too much depth to either its characters or its story. Thats not quite what its going for, but its what keeps it from being a masterpiece for me.. One of the best RPG's ever and one of the best DQ games for sure. A switch remake would be so amazing.. Characters and the story is good. Combat feels like an DQ game combat should. There is grinding LIKE IT SHOULD... Overall I would give it 7... BEST VIDEO GAME OST EVEERR!! Every theme is amazing! With just the music I give this game 8/10!. 15 years later this game still holds up. Story, adventuring, levelling up all still great experiences. Good for playing on sick days off.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue: GOOD.. One of the best RPG games I've played as I was young. I've beaten the game 100%. Finished all secret dungeons etc. Wish to play this game again on the PS4 with more content for the arena with full party and not for your monsters which you can catch only.. One of the best aclaimed JRPG'S for the PS2, features an absorving story full of diverse caracters with good caracter development. It has it few share of plot twists, and many comedic relief moments. The gameplay is good enough but it's class system is clearly unbalanced and putting too many points on the wrong class, will get annoying, especially because there is no way of relocating skill points. The length of the game is long (When i played this game as a Kid lasted me for a whole year) even though it has few side quests and your main way of progressing is farm a few levels between each quest and its post game content its amazing and should be a must in all JRPG'S.. My accurate score is 9.8 and not 10 because you can always improve but it's more close to 10 than 9. i think this game is amazing, Best RPG game i ever played. Excellent Music Very long and fun game interesting plot Great characters Unique Visual Style Highly recommended for anyone that is looking for a great RPG game.. Undoubtedly the greatest game ever made, so under appreciated, everyone needs to clock this game at least once, even the 3DS port is fantastic.. Easily the best PS2 era RPG. They need to make a PS4 remaster of this game so bad.. A good lengthy story but mediocre gameplay. I think that Dragon Quest 8 will appeal to a very specific group of people. It does a few things really well but it feels like a game out of the past. That can either be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. Personally I enjoyed the story but I found the gameplay to be very boring and repetitive. I love long RPGs and this game is certainly that. The main quest is very long and there are lots of secrets. The problem that I have is when you get late in the game pretty much the only way to level up is by hunting metal slimes and they are extremely boring to fight against. Another problem I have is that there are very few combat abilities. Even late in the game I was still using basic attacks. Compared to games like Tales or Symphonia, Final Fantasy X, and Shadow Hearts: Covenant, all games that came out before, the battle system in Dragon Quest 8 feels extremely basic and boring. Outside of combat the gameplay is nothing special. There aren't really any puzzles to solve and exploration is hindered by annoying random encounters. The crafting system is quite good though and can be very rewarding as it gets you many of the best weapons in the game. The monster area was also a highlight. The story is probably the best part about the game although it is fairly simple compared to most Final Fantasy games but it is full of fun interactions. I was interested enough that I always wanted to know what would happen next and it is a very long story. The characters are quirky and enjoyable enough to watch although they aren't particularly deep. The protagonist is silent but the game does a great job of making him appealing by having Yangus communicate for him. Their relationship is surprisingly quite fun to watch and is an interesting way to present a silent hero. The visual design is clean and cartoony, it looks good enough but there are many older games that look better. The visuals fit the game fine and have aged pretty well but it is average looking for the most part. Sound design is quite good, the soundtrack is orchestrated and has some really appealing songs. The voice acting is a mixed bag, most of the accents sound pretty unnatural but for its time I think the voice work is pretty decent and the game gives you the option to disable it so it deserves some credit for that. The environments also have really nice atmospheric sound effects that create a sense of immersion. Overall, I think Dragon Quest 8 is good but it is held back by repetitive somewhat boring gameplay. Nothing about the combat stands out as exceptional when compared to other RPGs. The story is enjoyable with a lot to offer but it isn't as deep or complex as it could have been. The characters are quirky and mostly likable but they lacked the depth that I would have liked to see in such a lengthy Quest. It has a big world with lots of locations to explore but many of the areas look very similar and exploration gets repetitive. If you really like old school RPGs this game is probably great for you if not it is not likely to win you over to the genre. I give Dragon Quest 8 - 71% Gameplay â 5 Story â 8 World - 7 Characters â 7 Visual Style â 6 Sound Design â 8 Uniqueness/Ideas â 7 Length/Amount of Content â 9 Immersion â 7 X-Factor - 7. Great story, great graphic, great music and nice classic combat system. Probably best jRPG ever produced. PS. PS2 version have best music, which is a big part of playing emotions in that title.. I can talk all day about this beautiful masterpiece. Everything is perfect! The story, the gameplay, the world etc. If you like turn based combat (like me) or can endure it, then this is a must buy. Buy it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is one of the most beautiful games you can find on PS2. The graphics, voice acting and characters are all amazing. The story is great but, IMO, weaker than in DQ4/5/7. The reason why I gave it only 9 lies in DQ series overall tendency to stay loyal to its roots in some parts of the gameplay. Random battles and saving in churches are slowing down the game's pace and become really annoying by the middle of the game. Nevertheless, the game is really fun to play, especially if you are DQ fan.. If you have this game you know that you have in your hands one of the greatest rpgs for ps2. The graphics are really good. It's like living in an anime serie. The plot is also good and I higly recommend to continue the optional part of the game at the ending if you want more information about of the story of the main character. It has some funny moments that lack in FFX and FFXII. The soundrack is also excellent; I would give it a 10. This game is long and like a lot of rpgs games there are moments that can be repetitive because of the battle system but specially if want to raise the level of your team. It's 2016 but I really enjoyed this game. It took me 100 hours but it was worthwhile.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Giant luscious world to roam around in. Memorable locations to visit. Lovable character artwork by Akira Toriyama... Painfully slow story development... Every fight nearly K.O.s your entire party, takes 10 minutes to win and then requires a trip all the way back into town to heal at the inn and save at the church... heal at the inn, save at the church... heal at the inn... There should have been vehicles available (and early on too). Dragons and Pegasi to fly around on. Horses and lions and/or other creatures to tame, train, level-up and ride on. Build vehicles, piece by piece from gathered material in your alchemy pot !!! ANYTHING !!!. As a longtime Dragon Quest fan, Dragon Quest VIII still wears the crown of the best Dragon Quest game in the series. From the beginning to the end, it's a charming, imaginative experience of a role-playing game with traditional turn-based gameplay mechanics, beautiful open-world environments, memorable music and a unique, interesting cast of characters. With the series' recent return to PlayStation, I can only hope that Dragon Quest XI will be just as amazing.. Great game, different from modern versions of RPGs. Not for everyone, the cheesy british voices may not be for everyone, but IMO adds charm to this amazing game. I've read some negative reviews, most of them saying that its to diffcult and unfair, while I admit that leveling up can be a bit frustrating it does't overshadow most of the gorgeous masterpiece that is this game. this is no final fantasy, this game's hard if you are underlevel, but not impossible, not having save points inside dungeons, well this is an ""old school"" rpg, not final fantasy or any of the new ones that has a save point every new screen, you need to think your battles and know when its okay to fight and when you have to flee, Pros: Tons of secrets, quick learning curve, hints to make better weapons, side quests, mini games, MONSTER ARENA, lovable characters, 60+ hours worth. No wonder DQ series is so loved in Japan. Cons: excesive grinding, until you learn zing theres no cheap way to revive a fallen comrade,. To give a basic review of how great this game is I have over 1000 hours of game time including 2 complete play throughs. This RPG ticks all the boxes for the perfect game in it's genre.. Great game! One of the games i look foward to play again - would love to see HD remake on PS Vita. When playing this game You can almost feel the atmosphere of great adventure in the air + i loved concept of collecting monsters to add them to Your team. And the alchemy was also fun. Only true flaw for me was the idea of silent main character. I sold my PS2 and now this is the one game that I soo miss.. This and Odins Sphere. Graphics 9/10 Sound 9/10 Gameplay 9/10 Verdict: It doesnt get full 10, because it hasnt got that good story, it makes You fight silly thing like slimes, but its really so damn fun and You get to appreciate this title after You finish it and when You think of this game You feel that You miss that something what You had when You played it... This game currently holds the title for the ultimate and maybe even the pinnacle of your Dragon warrior (sorry can't help myself) experience. There is no better DQ game in the world today, due to the smashing heart break of DQX and the fun but somewhat just short of the mark DQ9 I recommend playing this game last **** will be left saddene by the fact that you have no where else to go. A true **** ever possible way.. This is the game of my childhood. It is far to amazing for words. Expansive world, amazing characters, and the soundtrack is just breath taking! I have sunk so many hours into this game and I have never regretted it. If you enjoy JRPG's, this is one of the best to play.. The best Dragon Quest ever made. An ageless masterpiece, probably the best RPG for PS2. It's a gorgeous cel-shaded open world, nearly a decade later it still looks luscious and vibrant. My only complaints are that only a select few armours appear wearable when the character equips them, also the NPCs just run around in circles instead of having daily schedules. The day/night cycle is beautiful aesthetically & it influences NPCs and monsters. You can collect monsters for your monster team, which reminds me very much of PokÃ©mon games. A ton of content, exquisite polish, unbelievable that this is a PS2 game, truly squeezed each drop out of the system's capabilities.. This is a world that for 100+ hours will **** you in and won't let go until you're done. Beautiful graphics, extraordinary soundtrack, supreme dialogue and characters and some uber-cult-epic side-quests that it's certain that you will never forget. If you're a fan of classic JRPGs, level-grinding, Akira Toriyama, Piccolo or OUTSTANDING games, then enjoy the journey and never look back.. Deceptively simple in appearance, (an old-school RPG for old-school's sake) Dragon Quest is an unforgiving beast. There are save points only in towns, throws random battles around like confetti and demands that the player grind a level or two before moving from one quest location to the next. Can be cruelly unfair, frustrating, and annoying, but also rewarding.. My best Game of ALL TIME, if anyone ever ask me which game I like the most and my answer is THIS. Story 10/10, Gameplay 10/10, music 12/10, graphic 10/10.. Dragon Quest VIII has a traditional turn based battle system, an orchestral soundtrackm and good voice acting (Yangus). But most of all i like the world in which DQ VIII takes place.. this game just reminded me of how much we pc gamers need good jrpgs, i owned this game on my ps2 and it looks gorgeous now in HD,emulated. the story is great its probably the way lunar the silver star would look like if it was released in 3d ,a complete fun and involving story, great and varied enviroments , its really good! and the psyche up is so cool , the fights and battle system never gets boring, so fun , recommended 1000%. Its a shame that not enough people know about this game, because it is simply phenomenal. I get nostalgic just thinking about it *sniff, but I will try to stomach it while I get through this review. Dragon quest 8 is a very traditional rpg that uses turn-based combat. WAIT ! Before you automatically write this game off as another boring old traditional RPG keep reading this review. DQ8's combat system always keeps things fresh, funny, and exciting. You'll have fun level grinding in order to accomplish various tasks and earn money for better weapons. Now as far as the story **** Great! That's all Im gonna say because I don't wan to spoil anything. The music is also excellent in this game and really sets the tone for the adventure your about to embark on. All I can say is that if you haven't played this game before than you need to do it now because its too good to miss!. My favorite RPG ever. Perfectly made, structured.....everything! You know how you play several games and switch them in and out as your mood strikes you? This is the ONLY game EVER that once I stuck it in I never took it out until the end. I never wanted to play anything else but this for weeks. There is a lot of battles but that's what the Holy Water is for to keep those pesky monsters away when your really just trying to find something. It's got everything you couldever want in there...like Ragu: ""It's in there!"". This game is FANTASTIC! I really wish Metacritic had a 0-100 rating scale, since I don't give out perfect scores, but this game deserves a 97. I have been a fan ever since I beat the original Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior) on NES when I was a kid. I then beat 2 and 3, and forgot about the series until now. I'd heard good things about this game, but I had no idea what I was in for when I picked it up. The graphics (for the PS2) and music are utterly astounding. The characters fit in the game, and can be quite hilarious at times. Everything in this game is highly polished, and as good as it possibly can be. I beat this game over the course of a few weeks, and it wasn't until I was finished that I realized I put in over 80 hours on this game. Some games take a long time, and you really notice it. THIS game, however, takes a long time, and you're none the wiser. Isn't that exactly what we want in video games? Brand new worlds so immersive that we forget about ours?. Dragon quest 8 is an ambitious game, Audio/video is incredible, but the gameplay... It feels like it's a game from the early 90's with modern graphic. You can save only in churches, and I mean, only! This means that you have to explore whole dungeons, and the more you go forward the more you are afraid to die and do it all over again. This would have not been an issue if combat was faster paced, instead we can spend lots of minutes for the lesser battles, and the reward is... well few money and who-knows-how-much exp. Yes because if you want to know how close you are to leveling, you have to go back to a church and ask to a priest. when I wanted to grind I had to take pen and paper and calculate the exp after every battle. Not exactly user friendly.. Having been a HUGE fan of DQ since the very early 90's, I can say that this is the absolute pinacle of the jrpg. It is a semi-slow grind-fest, but if you're into jrpg's that's probably what you like anyway. A twelve year old obsessed with Skyrim (which is great btw) may find this game terribly boring and unrewarding, and that's okay. This game,despite the cel-shaded graphics was not made for them. It is an homage to DQ's fans, and a spectacular one!. This game was my childhood. Between me, my brother and a close friend we logged about 300hrs into this game. I only wish the ps3 would remake this game so I could have no life all over again.. Great, GREAT RPG. While Dragon Quest VIII does not re-invent the wheel, it definitely has perfected it. It just gets so much right, and it's no surprise considering the creators behind it. The combat is consistently challenging with some awesome boss fights that will really challenge your RPG skills. You absolutely have to pay attention, which is refreshing for an RPG. The story is simple yet wonderfully told with some touching moments throughout. The graphics, while simple, are carefully crafted with heavy attention to detail. Every room, enemy, and scene is crafted with care. The game is also huge. Lots of secrets, lots to see, lots to do, and a long story to play through. It will take you 60 hours easily to finish the main quest. My only criticism is that the skill system is quite vague. While I enjoy the surprise of finding out that next ability, you never know how many points you need for the next ability or what you're going to get. It really makes planning your party out a bit more arbitrary than I'd prefer. So it's always a shot in the dark when you choose to go with swords versus scythes, but a minor gripe to be sure, when the combat and game play is so expertly done and consistently entertaining. I'm currently doing my second play through and I'm having as much fun as I had the first time through. A true sign of a wonderfully crafted RPG. It's just plain FUN.. Tedious, lame story line, obvious expectations from people you need stuff from ie you have to go out of your way to get a lame item. Unlike the final fantasy series with a balanced level up period, dq8 presses for long level up time or be owned by our nasty sea ocean monsters. The dialogue seems to be read out, majority characters lack emotion in their voice and lack personality. game gets unfairly difficult in a short distance in certain areas which calls for a night at the inn. **** lvl up is wanted you have to prepare yourself almost a few days of playing ( if you are playing 8 hours a day) to start gaining levels at a good pace due to the building of items that can give you some hope of not starting at a save point again or losing your gold. I dont think anybody would want to spend a day just leveling up. it gets really really boring. Some items are almost completey unused by the hero since he got its effects built in his spell list... lame! Resurrecting a character is more %&$% $&^# rather than a phew. The battle system was abit different with funny monsters and a few unique status effects which i liked. The area design and layout of towns and the surrounding nature was good to look at. Other than that not much positives. just another rpg with the same turn based system. Its nowhere near close to even ffx nor as gripping but it does manage to keep you interested.... that is if you dont get pissed at the level up time you spend then its ok. Not a complete fail and worth the buy at a bargain price.. Dragon Quest VIII looks great, feels refreshing, and isn't just another anime-influenced turn-based RPG. Pros: Fantastic graphics; colorful visuals; variety of characters and secrets. Cons: The storyline is a hit-or-miss; a tad bit long of a quest for some gamers.. This game is a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","the look is a 10 out of 10 for a PS2 game . the weakest part of the design are the monsters . gameplay is super straight foward, plain for RPG standards ."
382.Metroid: Zero Mission,"Short, sweet Metroid goodness. Zero Mission does a really good job of making sure you don't feel lost. Sure sometimes you have to do some screen searching, but once you have an idea of what the game wants you to look for you'll start knowing where to bomb or shoot to get where you need to go. Also helps that this game is pretty linear, you can always tell the few screens you should be searching on. Hell I haven't played this game in years, got hard stuck multiple times and still beat it in under 3 hours. Great atmosphere, great visual and audio design for the console it came out on. Overall just a good time, it's a classic for a reason.. I really like this game, itâs a great game, but itâs just too darn easy. I beat the whole thing in maybe 4 hours and I only died a few times. I think this is a great introduction to the Metroid series for new fans, but as an experienced player it leaves more to be desired.. A great experience that could've spared an objective marker or two. I understood Zero Mission to be the even-handed response to Fusion's most infamous aspect: Linearity. As it turns out, Zero Mission is just about as straight-forward as Fusion, save for a dialog box explicitly telling you where to run. I have no problem with linearity in a Metroid game, and in fact, I welcome it as a breezy counterpart to something like Super Metroid. My issue with Zero Mission is its difficulty, or lack thereof. Never did I fear for my life, and the spare moments of genuine challenge are immediately deflated once you realize you saved 30 seconds before you died. There are difficult rooms with crazy tight platforming, difficult enemy placements, etc., but I have no reason to actually worry when there's no real punishment. All that aside, one of the best-looking games in the series. Great colors, and a fake-out of an ending I genuinely did not see coming. When I initially killed Mother Brain, I didn't realize there's a whole other section to the game that completely flips the script on you. I was a little annoyed at first. Once I saw I was about to enter a whole stealth section when I thought I was done, I was just like, ""Man, **** this ****, I'm doing this later."" But it offered a completely fresh gameplay experience that I was happy to play once I got around to it. I can't believe I didn't know about it before, but it made for a welcome surprise.. I didn't enjoy this as much as the other games I played. Parts of it felt too easy (Ridley) and some felt really confusing. I also find this game less good just because of how it makes me feel sick playing.. My first metroid game, this is a beautiful remake of metroid 1 in the style of metroid fusion, also the new ending was super cool. It could be a perfect 2D-Metroid, with a great accessability to beginners who wants to get into the Metroid Series. Everything we like in a 2D-Metroid is here. A cool and interesting leveldesign, which keeps you motivated to explore, the possibility to experiment with sequence breaks. A nice and challenging bossfight against Kraid. Everything is fine and fits together perfectly, the only nitpicky critique I would have, is that the fight against Ridley is surprisingly easy. However there are two fatal issues this game has which prevents it, from being a masterpiece. First the bossfight against Motherbrain is really bad and frustrating. You only have two little plattforms where you can stand over the lava and there are projectiles everywhere. You will fall of into the lava and get a heavy amount of damage. Motherbrain itsself fires a beam at you to and when she charges her beam she is invulnerable at this time, so you can't damage her. If you finally did it, the classic escape sequence follows and then the by far worst part of the game begins. The Zero Suit Stealth mission at the end is terrible and the definition of unnecessary. It feels like, the developers had added a part of a completly different game. It doesn't fits into this game and in consequence is, that your experience with this game ends on a bitter note.. Best metroid to date. I wish they make a remake of this. With today's graphics. And a new planet.. Another near-perfect Metroid game for the GBA. This and Fusion are the pinnacle of the series and even better than the 3D incarnations that followed.. Not bad but not as good as I was expecting. Good gameplay & aesthetics. Medium quality music. Poor story. Good amount of gear/improvements. After a while the game just feels as a hidden block finder. That you expend more time hitting the walls and floors instead of the enemies is not a good indicator to me. The second half of the game changes completely, from an exploration game to a rush trying to avoid infinite spawning mobs. The end boss of that zone being the most annoying thing ever seen. Forcing you to stay in a single slot while 5/6 enemies are shooting you and cannot avoid them in any way. This sudden change on the gameplay breaks the game coherence. The acceleration tricks and jumps are also super annoying and now worth the time you need to dedicate to get a boost item.. Excellent and fast-paced remake, holds up really well even today. Stuffed to the brim with secret collectibles and shortcuts.. A perfect remake for Metroid 1. This is definitely how a remake should look like. The music is strong, the Bosses are way better and the biggest good point is the controls are so good in this Game. I really love the Powergrip and the morphball bomb jumps in this Game. The graphics are also very good but i donât really like the Backgrounds in the Game. There definitely other Metroid Games with better Backgrounds but this is actually the only big point of criticism. A wonderful Remake!. I absolutely loved this game. It was challenging yet fun, and really enjoyed my time with it. Can't recommend it enough. Love this remake of the original and when you beat it you unlock the original on the same cart. Love when Nintendo goes above and beyond.. Wonderful adventure with sense of triimph in it. I love this game. Precious masterpiece.. The best game for the Game Boy Advance and one of the best remakes of all time.. A great game. It's fun and the sense of progression is very satisfactory. And there are even a touching moment near the end that let you smiling like an idiot.. A great remake that reimagines the original game without the strict limitations of the NES. Additional powerups, structure, and controls bring the remake closer to the standards set by Super Metroid, while the additional content in the game provides additional lore and increases the playtime of the game. If you are a completionist, getting all of the end screens can be quite hard and annoying.. Metroid Zero Mission is a spectacular remake in GBA, respecting the original NES game with designs and atmosphere unforgettable. ideal for lovers of platforms and metroidvanias. Contains spectacular bosses and others not so much. Great Music.. Between Super Metroid, Fusion and Zero Mission you will find the absolute best Metroidvania games, can't go wrong with either one.. This can be a cool and very frustrating game. If you don't want to be super frustrated with puzzles don't play this. One time it sent me to a point in a new area, and after unlocking the map for that area I still had no clue how to get there. So, I thought i needed a new item or something and re-explored the whole game for nothing, as you had to find a secret to progress. The world has some really cool design and some creative surprises, and is overall well designed and very well paced. The final boss is one of the most poorly designed things in a videogame, and they say it is much improved from the original NES version. You are just constantly getting knocked off of 2 small bricks by 4 turrets as you try to fight the boss. It just seems like something someone made to piss a sibling off as much as possible. Skip this game, I am now wary to trust Metroid fans.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. At that time, if you wanna make 100% achievement, you have to use all six roommates intelligence.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played it for the first time in 2021, absolutely loved it. Fantastic atmosphere meets superb level design!. A true masterpiece. One of the best games ever made. Everything about this game is perfect.. As the first Metroid game in the story, it's a brilliant way to introduce the series! After playing this game, it has really made me into a Metroid fan and I can really see the beauty of the series. The exploration is really great and feels really open. You can sequence break in this game and use some items out of order. The boss fights are quite good but some of them are pretty simple. The music is top-notch and includes modern remixes of classic Metroid songs. And the gameplay is fine too. This is the perfect Metroid game to play if you want to get into the series.. I started and over this game at last week (just before beat Metroid Dread) and this game is foward his time! All stuff of this game is awesome....smootly gameplay, beauty graphics, nice sounds and envirorment. Zero Mission is a remake for the first Metroid (1986).. I went from having never played a Metroid game to becoming the biggest Metroid fan ever. I cannot express how much I love this game. Very often with most games I will play for a few hours and stop playing out of being tired of the game and need some time away from it. NOT WITH THIS GAME. I literally needed to tell myself that I had to take a break even though I genuinely believe I could play through the whole game from start to finish in one sitting purely because of how much fun it is. The snappy controls, goosebump-inducing music, visually-striking enemies, and incredibly tangible sense of place in the game's world is everything I wanted it to be and more. If you have never played a Metroid game (or just a good 2D exploration game) and are interested in the idea of being a badass space bounty hunter that blasts tons of evil aliens with some interesting twists and turns in the story, this game will satisfy that desire and then some.. First off, it's not as good as Super Metroid or Fusion. The game was short and the bosses were few. The first part was not very good. I didn't like the level design. I know it's a remake of the first game but they could have done better. Motherbrain was frustrating. I was going to give less points just because of the first part, but the second part of the game was very good, I liked seeing something different. And towards the end, the game began to satisfy. It was nice.. Pros: + great pacing + great controls + great secret placement + amazing ending + incredible environmental storytelling Cons: - can be too bright - could use more tunes - maybe too short. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A remake done right. Imagine the original iconic setting of Metroid's Zebes but updated for modern-day controls and crafted with the style and atmosphere of Super Metroid - add in a thrilling and unexpected epilogue along with a welcome expansion of series lore and Samus' origins and you get one of the best games in a franchise already full of greats, and likely one of the greatest Gameboy Advance games ever made.. An excellent entry in the Metroid series, Zero Mission reworks and modernizes the original NES title. Exploration is far less confusing, which leads to a more acceptable level of difficulty than the original game. It adds in elements introduced later in the series, such as save rooms, which prove to immensely improve the experience. Visuals and sound are top notch, the different environments are all distinct and are very well designed. I have no major complaints with this title, it's quite digestible and would be a great place to enter the series for newcomers.. One of the best Metroidvanias I've ever tried. It is the best game, in my opinion, to start with Metroid if you've never tried a Metroid game. It makes the og metroid shine with an excellent post-game. Definitely recommended. Uno de los mejores metroidvanias que he probado. Es el mejor juego, en mi opiniÃ³n, para empezar con Metroid si nunca has probado algun juego de Metroid. Hace brillar al Metroid original de 1986 con su excelente post-game. Definitivamente recomendado.. Great gameplay bosses music and cutscenes.Easily one of the best 2D platformers ever.. a true masterpiece for the advance, grab it and enjoy old school metroid goodness. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An amazing game. One of the best metroidvania ever made. The graphics and sound are amazing even for today standards. This game is way more open and less linear than fusio, however there are less bosses and are a bit easier overall. Nontheless a must-play. Metroid for the NES was a game that was incredibly immersive, dark, moody and innovative for its time, but very quickly time revealed its limitations and dated mechanics. It made the original a prime target for a full-blown remake, one that would adopt the modern sensibilities of games like Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. That's exactly what Zero Mission is. It's basically this hybrid of the best elements from both of those games to make the definitive Metroid 1 experience. The most obvious upgrade would be in its presentation as it uses the same stellar engine from Metroid Fusion. The sprite quality and animations are superb, the color pallet is vibrant, and each of the environments now have a distinct look to them, making it far easier to discern where you are (and that's not even counting the solid map feature introduced in SM). While the GBA soundcard was never the greatest, there are still some great remixes of classic music and original ambient pieces that build on the isolating, dangerous atmosphere the game tries to convey. Not to mention some really great, crunchy sound effects that make it so satisfying to lay waste to the dangerous inhabitants of Planet Zebes. The game also sprinkles in a few cutscenes and even offers an exclusive new area that adds additional content to the Metroid 1 experience. Speaking of which, core gameplay is easily the best change made to the game. Samus controls just as fluidly as she did in Metroid Fusion, able to shoot in multiple directions and have more control over her jumps. Despite the smaller screen size the game is still able to give you a good enough look at your surroundings, ensuring that you aren't ambushed off-screen. As mentioned previously the game also carries over the map system from previous titles, making for much smoother exploration compared to the original. Map system also gives you a general idea of what your next major destination will be, but how you get there is up to you to figure out. It's not nearly as linear as a game like Metroid Fusion, but still gives you a good enough idea on where to go next while offering the same great sense of exploration from Super Metroid. You'll be collecting a variety of power ups which you'll use to explore deeper into the planet, some even coming from later games. Half the fun of Metroid games comes from just that feeling of discovery. The game is incredibly short for a Metroid title, too, which may be a detriment for some but makes it perfect for being a handheld experience. If there are any complaints to be levied against this game it would be that the it's pretty easy and the new exclusive area isn't too much fun to go through, but that's really minor in the grand scheme of things. Between the two GBA Metroid titles, this is easily my favorite one. Metroid Fusion is excellent, and I love that game for different reasons, but when it comes to a pure Metroid experience, Zero Mission scratches that itch a bit more. It's obviously a must for Metroid fans and those that are into the Metroid-Vania style of gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Metroid: Zero Mission"" was a great video game, with good colors in the graphics and a story that gives rise to one of the greatest heroines of video games, Samus Aran, its degrees of difficulty and handling of the character make the game very interesting and its history is just as great, a video game that opens a whole universe.. Great game ! The graphism and the music are awesome for a GBA game, the gameplay is absolutely perfect, the story is cool and the game design is really clever !. Great recreation of the original Metroid. It's quite short but is very much enjoyable all throughout, with smooth controls and lovely visuals.. I absolutely loved this game. This beautiful remake of Samus' first journey was filled with so much subtle lore that I loved experiencing firsthand. The gameplay mechanics have been perfectly preserved throughout the years and I didn't experience a single frustration while playing, only a challenge and a drive to always do better. I'm actually glad I played Samus Returns first so it gave me a chance to become a good Metroid player and take this game on.. I've completed this game on the Wii U a few weeks ago...what a nice game!!! I personally liked Fusion more as it was more linear which I prefer, but this one is also a gem!. Zero Mission is a remake of classic Metroid for NES and it is best Metroid game to start with the series. Short and easy, but still very fun and looks and sounds great on little gba screen.. Sorry, Zero Sammy, but you'll never compare to your Justin Bailey sister. Your hair isn't even neon green for chrissake! Oh. And this game features security cameras which can detect the smallest pixel of your toe hanging below a ledge. Yay for realism in a game about destroying space pirates and geega holtz.. A good game that introduced some new ideas to the formula. The Zero Suit Samus segment was a little underwhelming for me. Pretty much your typical Metroid game, just revamping the original title. That being said Super Metroid is way better, and I would consider Samus Returns better as well for the 3DS.. Yet again a 2d Metroid scoring high. As per usal gameplay is quite compelling and also offers a good story the only issue is the game feels too easy but has a difficulty spike at the end.. Awesome game! One of my favourite childhood games. There is not much to say, it game mechanics are nearly perfect and it's awesome 2D ""retro"" style graphics will lead you to one of the best GBA game experiences.. So happy to see this classic hit the eShop, and even happier that Fusion's annoying computer is absent here -- this plays a lot more like Super Metroid, with the same eerie atmosphere, tricky puzzles and tight gameplay. Love it!. I've owned this game for years having bought it because it received such good reviews even though i've never been a big metroid fan (don't know why it's just never really appealed to me). I've never really found the impetus to stick with it though, I'd play for 10 minutes and just lose interest. The other day I was leafing through my GBA games and decided to give it one more go. OH MY GOD I have been missing out for Sooooo long. This game is excellent. It really grew on me. It's combination of 2D platforming and puzzling is up there with the best of them. My only complaint having played it for 4 hours is that I've completed it. I wish it were longer but i am going to play it again on a harder level and try and find all the items so there is replay value.. My favorite 2D platformer of all time, Metroid Zero Mission is a must have for those who love the GBA. It's an updated remake of the original with lots of content. Blowing stuff up has never been so much fun.. The best handheld Metroid game and is pretty much the perfect version of the original Metroid. The visuals are great, the soundtrack is memorable and the gameplay has been refined from Super Metroid and that is never a bad thing. One of the best handheld platformers out there and i do find it better than Metroid Fusion. A flaw is that if you have played the original Metroid, this game will not have nearly the same impact and you can pretty much get the secrets and breeze through the whole game no problem. I highly recommend this game to anyone.. Metroid: Zero Mission is the 2nd Metroid game on the GBA and a remake of the original Metroid on the NES with enhanced features and more modern controls. Story: The story follows a bounty hunter called Samus Aran on her journey to the space pirate base on Zebes, Samus is trying to destroy the stolen Metroids, as her mission takes her deeper into the base she faces tougher enemies and various bosses who now became legendary in the gaming community... There's also new bonus content after finishing the main story, in which you get shot down and captured trying to escape planet Zebes, this has you sneaking trough the pirates ship looking for your Power Suit and facing off against a familiar foe... Gameplay: The game takes place in a large open world divided by doors and elevators, you are given a clue on your map on where you have to go next, usually to get there you'll need to find an appropriate power-up to continue towards your destination. You control Samus Aran, who can shoot, jump and roll into a ball, later on you'll upgrade your Power Suit and your weaponry gaining new abilities and skills which you'll need to progress into new area's, the game involves a lot of backtracking as each time you gain a new upgrade, you might be able to find new areas in places where you've already been, containing even more upgrades. You should always check your surroundings aswell as there are dozens of secret places to discover, usually containing more goodies. Controls: The controls are very tight and responsive, you can shoot (later hold the shoot button for a powered up version), Jump or go into a ball by pressing down twice, you can also shoot diagonally now by holding the L-trigger which should make things easier then on NES and activate special weapons by holding the R-trigger. Graphics: The graphics where spot on for me, it's all in 2D, but everything is bright and colorful and the new special effects look nice. The game is divided into area's which each has their own distinct style, the enemies grow tougher aswell as the game progresses and it shows in their design. Music: The music is superb, there's not track I dislike, they are excellent remakes (or enhanced versions) of the originals and stay very true to them, the song played in the background usually suits the area you are in pretty wel. Positives: + Gameplay is amazing! + Backtracking, looking for secrets, always something new to discover! + The music is absolutely amazing and true to the original. + The art style suits the game well. + New Content! Negatives: - It is quite short. - Hardly any explanation when a new power is gained. (While not needed for me and many others, this might be offsetting for inexperienced or new players) Conclusion: Metroid: Zero Mission is a perfectly enhanced remake of the original Metroid and any fan should have played this, the gameplay is solid, the music is epic and the Metroid universe is as awesome as ever.... Metroid Zero Mission is a game that truly shows how gaming has evolved. The game is a remake of the original Metroid with all of the added features of today's hardware. This game changed everything that could be changed while still maintaing the fundamentals of the original. The story is the same as the original, Samus Aran must go to planet Zebes to defeat the Mother Brain. Story doesn't play that huge of a role in this game, or the whole series for that matter. The gameplay is the same as the original, explore the various areas of Zebes to find power ups to allow you to access the rest of the planet. However, Zero Mission adds more features that the original could not have. Everything from new power ups such as the speed booster, to the simple ability to shoot diagonally. The most significant change is the fact that power ups now stack up. For example, the wave beam and the ice beam can now be used at the same time. However the game has also changed the graphics, the boss battles and there is now a whole new area to explore. The graphics and soundtrack are updated to make use of modern hardware. The boss battles between Kraid, Ridley, and Mother Brain are much more difficult, there are also new bosses. The new area is accessible after you have destroyed the Mother Brain. In this area, Samus has lost her power suit for most of the area and must use stealth to sneak past enemies. As a whole, this game is an extreme improvement of the original and it only has one fault, it's difficulty. Zero Mission is one of, if not the easiest Metroid game. However, this game is also the most accessible Metroid game to newcomers and I can easily recommend this game to people who want to start their Metroid adventure.. The graphics of Metroid: Zero Mission stands on its own and reminds me of the graphics of the Super Metroid. Everything in the game from the controls to the music are classic. It's a must have for Game Boy advance owners who are Metroid fans.. One of the best games I have ever played, the design, the battles, the power-ups, the music, and the amount of fun you have playing this game earn Metroid Zero Mission a solid 10.. A true masterpiece of 2D gaming. For me, this is the best Metroid game in existance. The balance and refinement of the gameplay is at it's zenith for the series. It just cannot be improved upon. The difficulty, the sense of exploration with just the right amount of guidence, the controls, the graphics.... Perfect!","""zero mission"" is a great introduction to the Metroid series for new fans . it's a great game, but as an experienced player it leaves more to be desired . it's a great experience that could've spared an objective marker or two ."
383.The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D,"I would definitely recommend the N64 version over this, although it definitely does suffice if it is your only way of playing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Be warned, they didn't only artistry ruin the game, the movement of the deku is awful, now you need a running start off lily pads to make it to the next one, and attacking doesn't accelerate you, this is shameful.. it's neither better nor worse than Ocarina of Time. it's just one of best games i played not only in 2024, it's one of the best games i played ever. Similar to Ocarina of Time 3D, It fixes the item management hassles of the N64, although the art direction seems notably different from the original, and the Physics engine was changed notably from the N64, leading to some platforming becoming harder. Although i prefer ocarina of time, this is a really good game as well, i liked the time mechanic, it makes you think of strategies to do things faster, i also liked the creepy atmosphere. Nice game!. While I feel like this game was more playable than the original, it really felt like a game made from embarrassment over what the original game had done. The difficulty was massively scaled back in all of the wrong ways, and a lot more mechanics were messed up. Not to mention, the entire vibe is thrown off by the new color and lighting! The masks, which were the best part of the first game, were made a lot clunkier and slower. While they wouldn't have ruined the experience outright, when coupled with the level design, we can see that the abilities were not taken into serious consideration. I also did not enjoy the changes to a lot of the bosses. They now box your character into dealing with them in one way only. The only boss change I enjoyed was Twinmold, but even that boss had a pretty confusing last phase. While they did change and streamline a lot of the annoyances with the original, they also messed up what actually would have worked, which could probably be attributed to a lack of understanding of the source material. Despite all the strange changes and missed opportunities, I did actually come out of the game with a slightly more positive experience since the entire package was more playable to me, but I can't help but wish for another remake that combines the best of the N64 and the 3DS versions.. Upgrade to an already good game! Still has some issues but overall I think it's the best version of MM. Literally just everything Shaifrillas said, but in 3D Also Majora = Resentment. The best Zelda game out there, everyone should have played this, so stop reading and go out there and buy this masterpiece of fiction.. I have played both The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D and I can safely say that The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D is the best way to play Majora's Mask. This game takes what Majora's Mask had and polishes it so well! I would highly recommend this game or this version of Majora's Mask over its N64 counterpart. I will admit as far as aesthetics go the original Majora's Mask has it better but as far as superior controls and graphics, yeah, Majora's Mask 3D takes it. Very amazing remake overall!. This is one of my favorite Zelda games, and I have very fond memories of it. The only thing I dislike about the remake is some of changes, like kow slow Zora swimming is, and swimming fast takes magic. The bosses having the eye weak points are alright, but I think Goht's is the most annoying, at least to me, since you have to take your mask off, shoot your bow.then put the mask back on, and do it again. But overall one of my favorite Zeldas.. Incredible port for a incredible game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Suffers the same as the OoT 3D remake. Too bright and colorful . Also areas of this were changed compared to the original like zora swiming and the 3rd dungeon boss fight. Play the original.. They did a pretty good job at hitbox / bug fixing, and the speedrun is still kinda interesting, in my opinion I just think that they made the game a bit to easy. But it can be good in a certain way cause that means that more players can give it a try.. The greatest game ever made the closest thing to a masterpiece thatâs ever been created better than ocarina in almost every way only thing bringing this game down the tiniest bit is the dungeons but theyâre the least best part of the greatest game ever. From a personal perspective, this is the best Zelda game in the series. It has great amount of content, a deep and dark lore, great dungeon design and overall great world design & the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. My first experience with Majoras Mask. It was very good and is a 10/10 but after I got to play the original, I completely fell in love with the controls, Graphics and overall feel. Thats why Iâm rating the 3D version: 9/10. this is my favorite game of all time period. I love everything about this game I cant think of anything that I didnt like.. This is a great game that gives a challenging, speedrun-esque vibe. The aspect of three days to do anything you need to do in that run is an amazing feature that, although frustrating at some times, brings some personality to the game itself. With gyroscopic controls you can perform shooting challenges, shoot down enemies, and the like. I would highly recommend this game. 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even though this game may be quite stressful due to the time mechanic (which was not really favorable for me, because I like to take my time enjoying the game and progressing), I think it makes up for that in terms of concept, art style, and soundtrack. Ocarina of Time meets Silent Hill kinda vibe. My personal feelings aside, Majora's mask is a work of art and I hope others can appreciate it better than I did.. good game, a lot of advantages passed from the previous part, but this part has a problem with additional tasks. they are not obvious. some tasks can be completed in 1 time, and some in several days. I didnât always relate the information received to a specific quest and thought that this was part of another quest, and until you try to pass several times and quit and further along the passage, you will realize that you did not have enough mask to complete this part of the task. in general, the whole game both paints and spoils additional tasks. One of the best games in history of gaming. Better than OoT by my opinion. Dark story and creepy vibe is what makes this game so unique than the other games from the series. As for the dungeons and every other aspect is just amazing like every other Zelda game.. One of the best Games i ever play and i love it so much I donât unterstand the People who donât like this amazing Game. This zelda is amazing with better graphics and better gameplay like ocarina of time is impeccable. This is one of my favourite remakes of all time. It takes the original and improves everything about it while also retaining the fantastic things that made majora special in the first place.. Incredible dark atmosphere, incredibly innovative. Amazing music, amazing lore. A remake of the best video game of all time.. The 3 day time limit is insanely fun. it forces you to plan ahead, and the only time i ever needed to reset in a dungeon was right before twinmold. other than snowpeak, the dungeons were all incredibly fun, but the bosses weren't great. The kicker is the story and sidequests, these just plain perfect. You cant help everyone before the moon crashes down, and doing some things will activate others. Resetting time allows this game to have my favorite sidequest system ever, as some things directly lead to others. it also made me cry.... A faithful port of the original with graphics and menus improved. The map on the bottom is very helpful as well.. My favourite Zelda of what I've played, it really is a fantastic game. And I say this when I used to dislike it because of the time mechanic.. Very good remake, while there were some small annoying things that weren't in the original version, this version is still what I call the best version, mainly because of the completion aspect, if you like completing games, this game is amazing, the updated bomber's notebook makes this game extremely satisfying to complete, and a lot of the sidequests have been made nicer because of the updated Song of Double Time and Save system, overall amazing game if you like to complete games, otherwise it's not absolutely amazing but still a very good game.. While much of the charm of the original game is still present, it baffles me as to why the control schemes for the transformation masks were changed (which needlessly slows down both southern swamp and great bay), and as to why the bosses were changed to be more in line with the ""hit the glowing eye"" fights of other Zelda games. In addition, many of the sequences of the game were made to be much easier, even segments like the Captain Keeta chase which were already easy. You'd be better off picking up the original game.. My favorite Zelda game, however, only the n64 version, in this version they changed the game too much, all the bosses in the game are MUCH easier, with a strange eye (?) That makes it very easy to find out how to defeat him, in the n64 version I loved all the bosses, but in this version they disappointed me, besides having made the gameplay like Zora a lot worse, seriously, if you want to play Majoras Mask, play the original n64 version.. An awful version of a fantastic game. MM3D suffers a myriad of issues that ruin much of the fun of the original, including gimping the fun movement of half of the characters, ruining one of only four dungeons, ruining boss fights by either making them insanely tedious or braindead easy, moving the location of key items and making them easily missable, adding new bugs, etc. While it makes some QoL improvements as well, there are too many broken parts of the game for it to be considered anything but the worst version of the game and an insult to the original. If you want to play Majora's Mask, do not play this own.. For fans of the Nintendo 64 classic, this remaster is likely to invoke one of two responses: Some will approve of the quality-of-life changes, like improved quest tracking and modernized camera controls (via New 3DS or Circle Pad Pro). Others may take issue with changes to certain mechanics, or the complete overhaul of the original game's memorable boss fights. Yet for new players, or those willing overlook the divisive adjustments, this may be the definitive way to experience one of the most unusual and experimental early Zelda games. It's certainly not for everyone, but patient players willing to look past the quirks of Majora's Mask and embrace its dark fantasy will find one of the most polished and unique games of its era.. This game is one of the best games I have ever played. It may have nerfed the zora and deku mechanics but it overall the same game that came out on the N64 but with a new coat of paint. This game still to this day is one of my favorite games.. I picked up this game on release, played it for a while, felt the zora swimming, then cried. This is majoras mask, and while i love this game and i have an overall good time with the remake, i just hate the small things they changed, like the bosses and the zora swimming. if you are going to play this version, please just play the N64 version. if you absolutely MUST play this version, Use progect restoration. While this remake isnt awful, and its certaintly more accessible, a lot of this games character is sanded off, so sadly i need to dock a few points..

Majora's Mask 3D is a great remake, remaining faithful to the original in most ways. Link's Zora swimming is much worse in this version though. One of the darkest and most creative stories in the Zelda franchise, and definitely a must-play. This is my preferred version of the game.. Overall, the game is masterfully well-done. This is a must play for anyone that grew up with the game, or is barely playing it for the first time. the dark tone is a departure for most Zelda games, making this one a different experience.. It is a good sequel to ocarina of time, i think you ill enjoy it if you like scary and creepy stuff.. it's majoras mask but better, and on the 3Ds. majoras mask was always better than ocarina of time. Never got the hype for this ****'s just confusing and has not aged well at all. I will just write a short and provisional review as I feel like Majora's Mask deserves a second chance. The concept is so unique and there is high replay value so I will rewrite this review one day if I change my mind about it. I did enjoy the story a lot but there were problems. The game became very repetitive and some puzzles were very frustrating but overall still a very good play.. The Legend of Zelda: May the Majora's Mask 3D be released as a Nintendo Switch, too. That's how fun and well-made the game is. It is also a very dark and scary game. So it's even more fun!. Not at all a bad remake. I know it's pretty easy to say otherwise, but I do think that this is a pretty alright game. While the original game is of course a whole lot better and more played than this remake, This 3D remake does improve a lot of visuals, as you may expect from this remake, especially since this came out 15 years after it's predecessor. The game for me does kinda drop after the second half. A lot of the really good mechanics from the original game were removed and made the game a bit more harder and a bit less fun. Although I am not very sure if it was intended in any way, or what. Overall, this is a pretty solid remake, although the original will still be played a whole lot more by me.. The idea of a real-time limit quest may sound good on paper, but the Legend of Zelda franchise is about exploring and adventuring, doing it while looking at the clock is extremely unpleasant.. A good remake of one of the best and my favorite TLoZ game of all time. Controls felt a bit harder, than necessary. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a must have for the 3ds, along with OOT 3D. I never played this game until this year and I am a huge Zelda fan, Iâve been living under a rock for 20 years. This game is flipping amazing, and would have given a 10 if it was a little longer. This is a big improvement over the N64 version, especially with the save system. I love the four dungeons, they are each creative in their own respects, and I actually love how you have to collect all the stray fairies to get fairy upgrades - one of my favorite aspects of the game. I didnât really get too involved in side quests, which this game has tons of, and mainly just completed the dungeons and did a few side quests just to get an extra bottle or quiver improvement. People complain about the time restraints, but as long as you play the inverted song of time you should have plenty of time to complete a dungeon or side quest. My only real gripe is I was a little turned off by having all the dungeon bosses have a giant eye to hit, which wasnât in the N64 version - just thought that was unnecessary, but no game breaker at all. Out of all the 3D Zelda games this is definitely my third favorite behind Twilight Princess and OOT. If you have a 3ds this is worth every penny, such a great game!. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D is a magnificent remastering of one of the finest Legend of Zelda games to date. The visual overhaul, the streamlined features and other improvements make this version an even more enjoyable and accessible experience than the original N64 release. Minor flaws seem insignificant as the superb concoction of timeless game design truly shines: the unique gameplay ideas, the dark and haunting theme and a cleverly crafted game world â aspects that made the original so great â enable this updated version to provide a near flawless experience. It's strange, perhaps, that a game in which the main premise revolves around repeatedly travelling back in time was so ahead of its time. In its enhanced form, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D defies its age and manages to stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best games on 3DS. Quite simply put, it's a masterpiece that every 3DS owner should play.. It took me some time to get used to the 3 days system but once I got used to it I learned how to appreciate every interactions even more. in this game you absolutely need to talk to people because what they say and how they act changes depending on how much time there's left in Termina.. It's the same old Majora's Mask, but nerfed on most fronts to pander to a more casual audience. Zora swimming has been all but ruined, movement over water with the Deku Scrub Mask on has been changed so you no longer carry momentum between leafs. The new save mechanic undermines the core gameplay mechanic of a 3 day cycle. Most of the bosses have been nerfed and are now almost insultingly easy to beat. I would have really liked the inclusion of a master mode or something similar, where the original Majora's Mask gameplay was intact, just given a fresh coat of paint. At it's heart this is still Majora's Mask, but a watered down experience from the original. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played and beat The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on my Nintendo 64 when it was first released. At the time, I had mixed feelings about it. I revisited the game a decade later when it came to Wii Virtual Console, and I found I didn't care to finish it a second time. I found it to be too obtuse at times, frustrating at others, and not exactly what I wanted from a Zelda game. Fast forward another five years, and along comes The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D. I eagerly picked it up on Day One, hoping to revisit a new and improved game that addressed the problems with the original. I was not disappointed. I finally found the game Eiji Aonuma fully intended to make, and I enjoyed it immensely this time around. Even if you disliked the first version, I strongly recommend MM3D to every Zelda fan.. Great game but not as much as the original which is kind of disappointing. For example, It 'fixes' some of the 'issues' with the original which made it what it was, making it more in line with the main series and taking away from it feeling like a gem, and how it feels refreshing and different to play.. Although this game isn't as good as the game it's a sequel to, it comes really close; this is proven by it's incredible game mechanics (such as the three-day time limit) and surprisingly deep and depressing story. The idea that the apocalypse is approaching and everybody is aware and reacting in drastically different ways (as in, some people are in denial and/or relaxing while others are having a mental breakdown). I recommend this game to all people who enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.. I haven't played the N64 version but I have played this one. After looking at both of them I have come to the conclusion that the 3ds remake messed some things up. I don't hate this remake but it could've been a little better.. This game is amazing!!! The story is great leaving place for speculation and dark theories. You can sympathize with the characters. The world feels real because of the 3 day cicle. I just love this game!!!. Majora's Mask has to be my favorite game to date, but I feel as though the remake could have been better. I feel that the remake is a bit too colorful considering the whole tone of the game. I personally feel that the colors take away from the gloomy vibe this game gives. I despise the changes they did to the Zora swimming for the Great Bay portion of the game. I do feel that the quality of life changes, such as the gyro controls, saving at any time, and the changes to the Song of Double Time, were very good changes. Please note that this review is more over how the remake was compared to the original. Thanks for reading! - collintheonly1. a **** version of the original that some how looks better and worse than the original. Full of changes that make the game worse than the original... not only removing all it's character but breaking many gameplay mechanics. If you want to play the only good version of Majora's Mask you need to break out your 64.. This is the WORST remake of all time. How can all these positive scores be flooding in? HOW! -The controls are completely NERFED. -The moon looks like he's had a labodomy. -The graphics look like Skyward Sword neon piss. -The bosses are all nerfed and INSULTING to your intelligence. -The entire premise of the gameplay has been gutted out due to being able to save whenever you want. one million out of ten. A remaster of one of the greatest of all time. 9.7/10. That's all. Dragging this out because the review has to be 75 characters minimum.. This game... Oh, it's so good! I've never played the original, but just this one is so good! it has perfect controls, an amazing soundtrack, a wide variety of side quests, nice feeling of accomplishment...This game just cannot be skipped if you like playing video games at all.. This game is a masterpiece of a Zelda game. I was disappointed when Breath of the Wild didn't have as great of a story as this game did. Pros: + Gameplay: The time system was well executed in both versions, but I like how it was slowed down a bit in this version. The masks, however, stayed the same and that's great! + Soundtrack: I loved each and every song in this game. Running around Termina Field while hearing a darker version of the main theme was great. + Dungeons: Amazing, well done, the best the series has. + Side Quests: While there are a number of forgettable ones or bad ones, the good ones are REALLY good. + Exploration: Not the best the series did, but still pretty great. + Bosses: Eyes and only eyes. Shoot the eye. However, the ways to stun the bosses are completely different. Cons: - Fishing: While it does the fishing mechanic in a creative way, I personally didn't find any fun in fishing in MM3D. Overall, Majora's Mask 3D is a wonderful remake that fixed the issues I had with the N64 version and more. So, therefore, Majora's Mask 3D warrants a 10/10 from me.. It's so good to have played this game again after all those years. The 3D-effect looks really nice. Definitely a dark atmosphere, which suits this game really well. The dungeons feel fresh, however the puzzles felt easier. The 'time limit' mechanic lets you plan your actions which works really well, although I feel like they could've used that in more puzzles. The new music is just as great as ever, and wearing all the masks is so much fun. All in all, another masterpiece in its own, dark way.. Not having the chance to play this game when it came out on the N64, this amazing remake finetunes this already awesome masterpiece. After 100%ing this game and consuming it i would have it as a must have if you have never played this game and have a 3ds.. Personally, this is my favorite Zelda game, the story isn't the best but its sidequests are where the real meat of this game really is, I can easily get over 15 hours in this game and have replayed it several times without it losing any of the charms I experienced on my first playthrough.. The only Zelda game i don't like. I don't understand how a fantasy game can be fun to play when you have to rush everything in order to finish it, found myself leaving the game after 5/6 hours of gameplay.. My personal favorite Zelda game with flashy new graphics & in 3D on a portable? Hell yea! Quick tip, download the 1.1 patch otherwise the game is missing certain elements that the original had. Dunno why they left them out of the release copy as the game is a lot better with them. The only thing I don't like that they changed is the Zora fast swimming now costs magic to maintain & the 3DS' control stick just isn't good when doing goron rolling. Other than that, it's the exact same game with extra details & stuff to make tracking side quests easier as well as a helpful hint system.. Nintendo did a fantastic job at transferring this great game into the remaster collection of the Zelda series. The use of the control layout on the 3DS (mainly the ""NEW"" 3DS) really makes the game comfortable to play on a smaller device. Everything is still the same as if it were on the Nintendo 64 besides the major upgrade in graphics and other minor changes. I would say it's a must buy for any RPG fan or 3DS owner.. A n64 classic well remastered adapting some mechanics to handheld games, It revives one of the best Zelda games to new generations and also can be a new challenges to old ones because have some slightly changes that can make you happy again if you like the original. A must play game. Ahhhhhh, what a breath of fresh air, not because of this game becoming real, but because everyone who thought majora's mask 3D was going to be a Wii U game now looks, ****. I FLIPPING love this game. It is soooooooooo good. Most people think that Ocarina of Time is better but i personally think that Majora's Mask Is a masterpiece, not that it doesn't share a few problems that OoT had, most noteably theres a lot of waiting in the game but it's still much better. 10/10 Nintendo keep it up!!!. One of the most overrated and overhyped Zelda games of all time. Hipster trash. This game was a Nintendo experiment to find out how little they can invest in making a new ""AAA"" game and getting away with it. On the N64 it just recycled and re-arranged all the assets of Ocarina of time, with minor additions/alterations. They didn't want to waste time making new levels, so they introduced a ton of backtracking and justified it with a ""turn back time"" gimmick. They padded a very small game to last for many boring and frustrating hours. Then called it ""innovation"". Suprisingly, it failed back then. I say suprisingly, because Nintendo fans aren't known for being smart or having good taste in games, in general. After all, if they knew any better, they wouldn't have bought a N64 in the first place, for just 2-3 good games. Still, it was so **** it failed and was forgotten. Then, as it always happens with hipsters and with the help of some manufactured hype after the Ocarina 3DS remake, somehow opinions that Majora's mask was an underrated gem surfaced. Counting on kids having never played the original back in the day, and adults having forgotten. And we got this, in the same way we got it on the N64: A recycled game from Ocarina of time 3DS. With some improvements to hide the fact that this game is a polished POS. Games like this are the equivalent of taking a turd, puting a ribbon on it, placing it on a museum and calling it ""modern art"". Hipsters should buy it 5x times in order to learn, the rest of us should play better games. Avoid.. Majora's Mask has grown a little too old. It contains amazing mechanics and dungeons but the time limit system makes it a frustrating experience. This could have been one of my favourite Zelda games of all time if they didn't try to do something different here with this useless stressful clock preventing any player from fulfilling their desire for exploration. Very disappointing.. Much like Ocarina of Time 3D, Majora's Mask on the 3DS updates and enhances the original N64 title. Even with its more saturated color palette its dark atmosphere still shines through. The game is much the same as you remember it. There are a few notable additions however. Fishing has been added as well as a Bomber's notebook. The bomber's notebook acts as a quest tracker and allows you to keep tabs on the various events that occur throughout the game and at what time. Majora's Mask is one of the harder games because of its 3 day cycle. And for that reason the bomber's notebook really does help players get an idea of where they need to go. This is simply another essential game for your 3DS.. This game look so beautiful on the 3DS, it's an amazing story and I never got tired of playing it over and over. Getting all the collectables and exploring Termina. I always loved being able to transform into other creatures. This is the darkest Zelda game ever. The Majora's Mask is just so epic, lots of people have it on stickers, stamps, tattoos, etc. A very beautiful game who makes us want it to be whole lot more playable than just 3 days. In love with this game since I was 9. The only thing I didn't like is the way they changed Zora Link way to swim, that was something I loved doing and not anymore. PS: Playing it on the New 3DS XL makes it even better to play.. A story very well made, charismatic characters, good game play, excellent soundtrack, variety of side quests, witty temples, a difficulty as well, and wonderful quests, now with better graphics and to carry everywhere.. This is my favourite game! It's excellent! The best game of Zelda series, in my opinion. I've loved it before with his N64 version, and I became very excited when Nintendo announced the remake. The power to transform in other creatures with different habilities makes this game one of the most originals of all time. and in this remake had perfedctly modified the old game to be enjoyable to more people. Worths to turn back 15 years to the past? Yes, of course!. A great game with very good graphics, it's very entertaining but also super difficult to reach the end. You have to motivate yourself a bit to finish it, but it's worth it.. Majora's Mask for the 3DS adds a lot of stuff that is both good and bad, and seeing how the original N64 games is one of my favorites of all time I thought I would give a review on my opinions on this newest one. Now Lets get the 8/10 rating out of the way first. The original N64 game is by far the best N64 game of all time in my opinion; let alone one of the greatest games of all time. It is definitely within my personal top 5 games of all time, it is a 10/10 masterpiece ****. However the amount of things they've changed in this game has done enough to bump it down to an 8/10. This game is still a fantastic game but let's go over some of the changes I feel are either unnecessary or just bad in general. One of these such changes is butting the Clocktown bank in the clock tower. This change makes it so the banks usual position in west Clocktown and places it in the south Clocktown clock tower. This change is absolutely unnecessary as all it does is change the location, it makes it slightly easier for newer players to get to as well. The next change is having the double song of time transport you to","similar to ocarina of time 3D, it fixes the item management hassles of the original . the difficulty was massively scaled back in all of the wrong ways . the only boss change I enjoyed was Twinmold, but even that boss had a confusing last phase ."
384.Sacrifice (2000),"Eurogamer's review aged like milk. Basically, the reviewer had skill issues and blamed it on the game. Truly shows the guy was a beginner, lol.. a true masterpiece, story, gameplay, graphics, humor it's all there - only a few minor caveats with bugs here and there - the ai is very simple and just tries to rush you on later levels with overwhelming force. ""Most underrated game of all time"" has been overused to death... but Sacrifice is a strong contender for the title. Of course people who played it loved it (as the ratings here shows) but it's a mostly forgotten game with no chance of an HD remake, sadly. It's such a shame because the atmosphere, music, design and *especially* the gameplay are truly unique. It mixes action RPG with RTS elements to perfection. Each solo campaigns are unique because you can choose a different god each time and gain a unique set of spells and units by the end of the game. The controls are really smart and well before its time. Having a RTS game controlled from the ground without being a complete mess is a tour-de-force. (bonus point for the death and save/loading having an actual in-game, it's part of the many clever things of this game) PLEASE PLEASE make an HD remake of that game.. Sacrifice follows a very unique approach. It mixes real-time strategy with 3D third person perspective. And this idea works out wonderful. The graphics and gameplay are nearly perfect! Clearly a must-play!. Immortal classic that should be remember. Innovative gameplay (RTS TPP), good story and interesting lore. Graphic aged badly, but it's still the game of my childhood and one of the most original strategy.. Long ago this game was released and I installed in onto my PC. Little did I know I was about to have the most memorable gaming experience of my life. I remember staying home 'sick' and playing this ALL DAY. The single player is fantastic, the story is fun, and the multiplayer was one of the first of its kind. In fact, the multiplayer exist till this day. The Steam community has kept this game alive. In a nutshell, this game was similar to a early World of Warcraft but much more streamlined and simplified. In fact, WoW didn't come out till 2 years after Sacrifice. I think WoW stole some ideas. Nonetheless, give this game a shot. Even today it holds up.. Fantastic experience working on this game and I still play it every Christmas holiday. It's one of those games that you can play again and again. i have worked on many games but I keep coming back to this one. It has everything you need from great gameplay to strategy. Admittedly the learning curve for a beginner is steep but once over that curve it's pure pleasurable gameplay.. With an impressive story, phenomenal and unique gameplay, Sacrifice is easily one of the best and most underrated games of all time. The storyline is intriguing backed up by splendid voice acting. The player can make various choices throughout the game that impact the path you're taking and the spells you'll be able to acquire. A memorable soundtrack fitting to the game backs up the fun gameplay and the scale of the spells you'll be able to perform. Massive battles, interesting Wizards and Gods to choose from, one who plays this game won't forget it easily. The Scapex Editor that comes along with the game it's also a very impressive feature that allows the player to create his own scenarios to the game. For me it's a 10/10 and I highly recommend it to anyone out there that wishes to try something new.. Most innovative game of this genre. Graphics are really nice and story is thrilling. The game offers a large variety of endings. Game mechanics are easy to understand and both soundtrack and voicing are perfect.. It is a beautiful masterpiece that any gamer can't afford to miss. It has a sad story though it is one of the least known gems in the world and was way ahead of it's time. PLAY IT! it's gaming history.. This is one of the old games i played together with ""Clive barkers"" undying. And again is a monolith and one of the few hybrid RTSRPG games that really work. The story is fantasy with a bit of a twist. Think Discworld kind of absurd humor, but with serious tone. The story in itself dont sound so great , its basicly a mage that made a deal with a demon to ""destroy his enemies"" that kind of destroyed that world, and now follows the mage over different planes wrecking havoc. But the gameplay! its immersing and clever! You steer your mage on the battlefield commanding dragons and druids , combined with excellent graphics for its days, and a soundtrack that still blows me out the window, it makes a battle , feel like a titanic clash ! The Soul Gathering system is also fun and makes for awesome multiplayer skirmishes and needs to be played to understand correctly. This is a game i recommend everyone to try, and for the low price its now selling for, you get one of the best handcrafted rpg hybrid in history, in my own humble opinion. Truly unique strategy game with it's alternative approach, beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, different gods and excellent story and voice acting. 9/10. A lot of things could be said about this overlooked gem ****, here are some of them: Innovative, imaginative, fun, funny, weird, engaging... I could go on and on. There are no bad sides to this game that I could think of. Pick it up and have some fun.. I play a lot of game, but Sacrifice is my number one. A fantastic story, beatiful music and great gameplay. In addition you have a chance to serve for god which you choose. That`s fantastic.. An excellent game with lots of innovative ideas. Great story, and a very nice touch with reloading ""this is not what actually happened"". The artwork was amazing for the time. Really one of the best games ever, and surely one of the best in the RTS genre.. A very much underdog game it got passed up by a lot of others and that truly saddened me, this game has a mix of RTS and a magical FPS system too it, you're down in the fight and controlling the units is surprisingly easy for not being above the action. The game is charmingly funny and while the story is not the most engaging thing in the world it is quite fun to play through many times over for the branching and changed story lines. Many different endings phenomenal voice acting (including Tim Curry) It is quirky fun and an overall enjoyable game and is in fact one of my favorites of all time.","""Most underrated game of all time"" has been overused to death . but it's a mostly forgotten game with no chance of an HD remake . it mixes action RPG with RTS elements to perfection ."
385.Age of Mythology,"Normally 9/10, but there is no competition in this genre. Classic RTS with Multiplayer focus, 4 Nations with 3 Heroâs give it a strategic deep.. So this review is mostly for the single-player portion of the game although I do like the general mechanics such as mythical creatures and heroes which are cool and the game is probably fun in multiplayer too. The difficulty in this game is insane, it's either a walk in the part level or absolutely insane on Titan difficulty. Also on Titan difficulty the difference between the levels is more obvious than ever, they're either too easy or way too hard and you never know at the start of the level. I'm playing the Dwarf campaign, particularly chapter 4, right now and 5 minutes into the game you're hit by 100 supply of enemy units including mythical creatures and highly upgraded infantry and you have 4 raiders and 15-20 workers. Obviously the game uses some scripts to say when they'll unleash their full power but as a player, I'm not going to review the game files or spend 2 hours trying to learn the script so to avoid being smashed in the ground and having literally no way to prevent it. On Hard diffculty on the other hand, the enemy rarely attacks and you can breeze through every level in the campaigns without any difficulty. How is there such a difference between the game giving you 5 minutes to min-max and 20 minutes? I'm definitely not wasting hours tring to trial and error every combination on the slim chance I can bug the enemy AI to follow some obscure pathing or get it stuck in a forrest somewhere. On the flip side, when the game actually gives you some leeway so you don't have to resort to bugging the AI, the campaigns on Titan difficulty are usually quite fun, they can turn a 20-30 minute mission on Hard into an actual achievement to complete the level. Some levels I had to mine every gold mine on the map to even have a chance at beating the level (Dwarf 3) and it felt competitive even when the enemy cheats a lot in resources. Generally the story is interesting, some levels are way too easy and simple, in fact most are, but the story as a whole is intriguing and I liked Arkantos' journey. You go around Europe and Africa in the pursuit of the villain and while individually the levels dont have a lot of dialogue or cinematics, when you combine the whole campaign it's quite enjoyable. I like the mythical creatures and the heroes portion plus there are so many different units and God Powers and upgrades you can choose so every level feels at least a little different. Granted, in my opinion, many units are not viable but you have enough of a choice whether you want to emphasise heavily on archers, infantry, cavalry or spam the enemy with mythical creatures so missions are quite fun to complete. So overall, if it weren't for the absolute botchery of difficulties in the game ranging from a breeze to a sweat shop shift, I'd have given the game a 9, ignoring of course that visuals, bugs and pathing are not up to modern standards but that's to be expected of a 20+ year old game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me the best age series game. Many interesting systems and units, great game.. It was the first 'real' game I ever played in my life, revisited it recently and it still holds up extremely well after nearly 23 years. Pure masterpiece. Iconic RTS. The campaign, multiplayer, level design, unit variety, and macro/micro gameplay were ahead of its time, and it still holds up as one of the best games for your money today.. Mostly AoE games are famous for their multiplayer but Age of Mythology's single-player campaign was 9/10 for me. I know we all give +1 or +2 because of the magic of nostalgia :). Very good game, fun and complex, it includes fresh concepts to previous chain economic strategy games.. One of the greatest strategy games of all time. Carried by a long and incredibly engaging single player campaign. Incredible unit variety and impactful god powers make for a lot of fun. Soundtrack is among the best ever.. One of the best strategy games ever. Game genre now sunk along with so many other games of the era, but fortunately there are people who make these games immortal. I played all the DLC, repurchased the remastered in 2014, and now... I'm waiting for the Retold remake. Let's hope it's not a pay-for-fun God save us and forgive us. I had an amazing time playing through the game. Definetely a recommendation for fans of the RTS genre!. An arthestic masterpiece. Very good gameplay and an acceptable graphics for 2002. A.O.M has an awesome story who made me to read about Greece gods. Factions and gods are really well designed and they are balanced very well. Also mythical units are wonderful. Age of mythology is one of the best strategic games of ever and it has its own brand and style in real time strategy games.. While it has (unfortunately) not received a remake, like AoE2, it still holds up pretty well. Has the best campaign in the in the series. Also the soundtrack is the goat.. One of my favorite RTS of all time, at the time it was a new concept that gave me hours and hours of fun and a game that I'm playing even now, 20 years after it's release.. A fine way to integrate those mythologies in an Age of Empires games. Very successful.. The best âAge ofâ game. It adds gods, mythological beasts / units and favor (faith) to the mix and has a remarkable story campaign based of Greek, Norse and Egyptian legends aka methodology. It is the same real time strategy concept as the other âAge ofâ games. You are gathering the resources gold, wood, food and added for this game favor (faith) to develop your kingdom. With the resources you can construct buildings, create units and research improvements. For a bigger chunk you can advance to a new age (archaic to classic to heroic to mythic age) each time unlocking new stuff. There are 3 different factions with Greeks including Atlanteans, Egyptians and Norse (Vikings). The new parts are the gods. You start with one of the main gods of the pantheon including bonuses and with each advancement you can chose between 2 different additional gods with different improvements. For example the Greek god of metalwork, blacksmiths and carpenters Hephaestus will give you benefits for weapons and armor in each age. Also each god gives you access to a one time wonder (magic). This can be a benefit like for example a charm that attracts deer to make hunting faster (and more productive), a meteor strike or a treasury with a slow but steady gold income. The higher the age the better the wonder. Of cause there are mythological units you can unlock. Greek have for example Minotaurs, Centaurs and legendary heroes, Norse have Giants, Trolls and Valkyries and Egyptians have (giant) Scarabs, Sphinxes (multitude of Sphinx), and Mummies to name a few. Each mythological improvement or unit needs favor (faith), How this is acquired is depending on the faction and is well researched. Greeks get it by sending workers to temples for praying, Egyptians by building monuments and Vikings / Norse by fighting (lesser by hunting and fishing). This alone gives variation but it ends not there as all factions have more difference. For example: While Egyptians have weaker units (until later ages) they have priests that can heal while the other factions are very limited in this. Norse have wagons that work as mobile storage houses while the others have to build appropriate buildings. Greeks have stronger units but those are more expensive and the favor gathering limits your resource gathering and available unit number. To shorten this the gameplay is excellent, balanced and enjoyable. It is a game that you will replay from time to time and a true classic. Now to the story. Like I said it is excellent and uses old legends aka methodology (I know that the time frame is wrong but I don't care as it is entertainment not accurate history or methodology). You play as Arkantos admiral and hero of Atlantis. He was on his way to retirement but a war between their independent Greek colonies and the Trojans broke out and it would be an insult to send a lesser military leader to their aid. He does not know that this Trojan war will just be a small prelude to a far bigger conflict. The story is excellent and uses a lot of elements from lore and legends. They exceeded all my expectations here as it is far more than just simply connecting missions. A lot of games in the genre fail in this regard and so I should praise this even more. Also it is really long with 32 scenario's. Those are diversified and never felt boring. Atop of this there is also a multiplayer mode and a really good editor for you to create your own scenarios. Graphically it looked really good for its time but aged a bit which I see not as a negative. Especially the introduction cinematic was truly excellent. The soundtrack is still excellent. No matter how often I replay the game it becomes never boring nor fails to deliver. Overall this is my favorite game in the franchise and probably also in the real time strategy genre. An easy recommendation and I hope they continue the franchise in the future with new games.. Easily another top RTS classic that raised my interest in mythology. The gameplay and story were simply stunning. Obviously, if you look at it today, the graphics are no up to date anymore. I am still hoping for a HD / definite treatment for this gem.. A good game, good game play, mediocre story, awful graphics. Enjoyable with friends.. Whole of my Childhood spend with this Amazing Game... Thank You Ensembleï¸ I Miss You Everyday. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While I have not played this game for quite some time, I remember playing it and having much fun. It was probably the reason I got interested in Greek mythology and fantasy settings.. Anyone who knows Age of Empires knows that the Mythology version was based on it. There was a significant improvement in the graphics. The gameplay also got a little better. However, in my opinion, this version is no better than AOE The Conquerors. I think that the medieval theme of AOE attracts me much more than AOM.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. played this a lot when i was youger. it has this ancient god flair, pretty cool. Amazing game, one of the best RTS games. Mythological elements made the sorry fun and gave a great twist to the gameplay. A cute, fun, and whimsical real time strategy which is one of the best-paced to date. The theme of the game, which is a bland masculine depiction of ancient culture and war, does not become too overbearing thanks to its cute and silly execution. Unfortunately, the arbitrary and slipshod balancing causes the game to deteriorate in complexity among high-skill match-ups, but playing the game in a multiplayer context is still a lot of fun anyway.. 9.5 - Definitely my favorite real time strategy out there. Not only is the campaign great, it features online multiplayer and since its on Steam, it has its own workshop only adding to the content of the game.. My favourite game of all time. I've been playing it since I was a child and I have never get bored of it. With a big and epic campaign, several game modes, an editor, mods and on line, this is truly an infinite game. It's graphics are not so good for today's standards, but you can always download texture packs which make the game look even more beautiful. 10/10 A never-ending masterpiece which is also my favourite video game.. One of my most played games...rarely seen such a **** there wont be any other again like Age of **** never too late to play this game if you're young and u havent tried it yet!. 10 or 100 or 1000 or millions and billions of score points..Along with the age of empires and unforgettable series that NO MATTER WHEN OR WHERE u can still **** matter if u know all about gaming or nothing about gaming u will still play it.... AMAZING! in every fooooken way. I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.. my favorite strategy game i play it for a really long time first i see this game on internet cafe i really like it then i buy it .Have great scenario i fnish it on short time and feel empty then start multiplayer and i dont even know how much time i spend in this game anyway one of a best games ever im still playing sometimes but game out of date so good bye to old legendary game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my very first games. This piece of art stand the test of time. It has given me countless hours of enjoyment with it's great story and game play. The only reason I haven't given it 10/10 it's because I have found the DLC kinda of a disapointment.. If you want to play the perfect RTS game, then Age of mythology is the real deal! I mean you really enjoy playing it many times. Graphics are amazing, Sounds are superb & easily put you in the game and the Storyline is awsome, especially for those mythology maniacs. Even if it is almost 12 years outdated, it is still enjoyable and if you have already played God of War series, you can still give this game a try & you won't regret it. Until then, enjoy playing & wish you happy new year 2015. Age of Mythology is a classic game, but I always remember it with some sadness. For it was the last of the golden age of RTS (real-time strategy) games. This is the capstone to that Era. Because it was released as the fervor for RTS was dying out, it never got the respect that it deserved. With colorful characters, great music, and fun effects such as a Minotaur knocking a soldier through the air, the game had charm, action, strategy. An exceptionally well-made game.. This game is a masterpiece it almost never gets old and its extremely fun every time i play it(i wish there was a age of mythology 2 that would be awesome). This was my one of my very few childhood gems. The campaign is well thought out and is a good guide to the games fundamentals. However what sold me was editor mode, the re-playability was endless it was literally my very own sandbox. I created kingdoms, villages, re-enacted battles could pretty much do anything! 10/10 Worth the money and your time!. Let me start off my saying that I am a huge fan of AOM, it is one of my favorite games of all time. This reboot, however, is simply pitiful. Lets start off on price point. Paying $30 for a game that is 12 years old is pretty steep, but they claim to have done some work to it so I decided what the heck, I'll get it. Bad choice. Unfortunately several important units are now broken since clearly no one bothered to test the game after they made their changes. Some missions on the campaign simply cannot be beaten without using cheats now because of broken units. As for the changes themselves, the water does look pretty. But I probably wouldn't have even noticed changed it i hadn't already known. There is absolutely NO NEW CONTENT added, it is just a rehash. I would hope they would at least do something to the horrible path finding and unit commands but apparently they could not be bothered to do that much work. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT 10/10 for the original game 1/10 for getting people to pay twice for the exact same thing. It's my favourite game, I played the campaign a lot of times and i played with my friends in LAN, I think this game has a very good meaning of strategy and fun. I really love this game. What can I really say now (with the Extended Edition) that someone didn't already know from old reviews? I'd say: I'm glad this game came back and now is upgraded a bit on Steam in terms of visuals and integration with Steam and multiplayer. Definitely the same hours of enjoyment seen it's decade old classic. + AoE2 HD was an excellent re-addition; if you loved that, you'd love this. + If you played AoM a long time ago, this will tickle your nostalgia feels in all the right places AoM will definitely please veterans and can please RTS enthusiasts. This game was extremely fun online then, I can only imagine it now on Steam! I wonder now if AoE1 will be put in HD and if AoE3 will be updated (since its already on steam). x). This is my favorite game. I cannot review it honestly because our history together, but I would sell my soul to the devil to play Age of Mythology for the rest of eternity. From its simple, beautiful aesthetics, to the balance and level of complexity of its multiplayer metagame, everything about Age of Mythology enthralls me. As a fan of the first 2 Age of Empires, I purchased the original AoM game in 2002 on not much more than a whim, but since then I have yet to find any other game that has **** up as many hours of my life. To this day it remains one of my go-to games even after the collapse of its multiplayer. I highly recommend it to any fan of Age games, or strategy games in general.. This game simply put was the best RTS I have ever played. Above all the game play is exceptional. The graphics are easy on the eyes. The music is so good you won't want to mute it.. Best. RTS. Ever. But seriously, every time I think of an amazing RTS, I think of this game. The game play is fantastic and it's just an all around fun game.. This game has a solid amount of strategy to it. Players can choose from 3 (4 with the expansion) different factions, which each have different units, powers, play styles, and overall ways to achieve victory. Missions could vary slightly more, but the game is focused on building a base, assembling units and forces, and destroying your enemy. Overall, an accurate display of an idea, and one of the perfect examples of a solid and well thought out RTS.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 8 out of 10, Fun: 9 out of 10, Controls: 8 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 8 out of 10, Length: 8 out of 10, Re-play: 6 out of 10, Value: 9 out of 10. This is by far my favorite game of all time. I spent my entire childhood playing this game. Like any other ""Age of"" game by ensemble studios and microsoft studios, there is leveling up. However, in Age of Mythology, you get god powers from leveling up throughout the ages. there are four ages to level up to, (five if you have the titans expansion) all of which you choose which Minor God you wish to worship. Worshiping and minor god provides you with new Myth Units, which you can train from your Temple, and god powers. (In the titans expansion at the 5th age you get a titan gate, which lets you build a structure that releases a titan which is basically one big super-unit, but isnt too over-powering.) Like I said above, I spent literally my whole childhood playing this game, singleplayer against bots, the campaign, both amazing experiences, and before Microsoft shut down the servers for AoM, the online community was great. During the campaign you follow an Atlantean Hero, Arkantos, who at first defends Atlantis from a bandit attack, it doesnt seem like much, but then the bandits steal the trident from the statue of Poseidon. Arkantos takes a few soldiers with him and chases after the bandits and their known leader, Kamos. You find Kamos and fight him, and defeat him, only for him to get away, but even though he gets away you take the trident back. The rest of the campaign goes into detail about Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology, and follows Arkantos as he sets out on a quest to ensure that the titan Kronos does not escape from his prison in Tartarus, by keeping all the Tartarian gates closed despite the fruitless effort of Kronos' followers. This game has quite a few plot twists, (which are for the better) and it has a very compelling story. I absolutely love this game, and I think many people who like RTS's would enjoy it as well.. When I first played this game, I went into it thinking, ""Wow, what a fresh new concept!"" This thought was brought along because I had never played AoE before. Having played both now, I'm going to hand my vote of favored game to Age Of Mythology, simply for how easy it was to pick up and start right away. The campaign was interesting, though predictable at times. The mythological integration is iffy though if you're a studier/ fan of Greek myths. Some of the things were a little iffy from that front. One of the features I enjoyed about the game was the integration of monsters. While they could be the most powerful pieces on the battlefield, they were highly vulnerable to certain units. This helped in balancing it out nicely so that even if you had an army of Minotaurs, you needed to have some archers of something of the sort to ward off any spear men from killing off your ""unstoppable horde"". A solid 9 from me, detracting 1 point only because as one user pointed out, it is not an original concept, and primarily is a reskinning of AoE. Doesn't make it bad by any means, but one must give credit where credit is due.. All about this game is great. The next step in history game play in RTS game. Very dynamic, every faction is balanced and the multi player experiences is huge,. played this game for 10 years and i have yet to see another as good rts as this one. The Best Strategy Game I ever played. First I played AOM when I was 9 years old And it was AWESOME then and it is AWESOME now. 19 years old one. The only thing I cant understand why them stopped improving game? AOM 2 AOM 3 AOM 78. Being a big fan of mythology, this game is just great, and if you add the titans expansion, well it's the icing on the cake. Maybe it's just me, but I believe this to be the best of the Age games. The graphics are good, the campaigns are very enjoyable and also re-playable, for you can do things different each time, and the random map game-play will keep you entertained for hours on end. Furthermore, if you have the patience, you can create your own maps and even add night/day cycles to them. I have nothing negative to say about this game. It's one of the best I've ever played. 10/10.. The greatest RTS game i have ever played. A great campaign that has incredible replay value, a great multiplayer mode that is fun even with CPU's, and perfect gameplay with little to no flaws. Pick this game up for probably under 15 dollars (Released in 2002) and you will love it.. I'm not a big fan of Age of series. In fact, i played only couple of them and liked them, but there wasn't something that made me keep coming back. But Age of Mythology took my attention and I love this game even today and can replay whole campaign right after Nox. Game got my attention not by it's realism or story that based on real events, hell no, this game is pure magic that kinda based on actual story, but with Cyclopses, Colossuses (is that right?) and freaking Gods. All right, first things first, story is really good, it develops slow, but when you will reach Egypt levels plot will surprise you with some cool bad-ass moments and twists. Gameplay is your basic Age of mechanic, but here you also have power of Gods, you can unlock 4 unique abilities and by gaining, you know, God's love, you can create such creatures as Giants, Trolls, Cyclopses and other cool monsters. There's 4 different cultures and each of them are actually different and unique, trust me, because of that replay value is very high. My only complain is that story is REALLY slow and you will be bored of it by the chapter 20. There are bad-ass moments, but also tons of useless and forgettable ones. Other than that, game is just about perfect.. Simply one of the best RTS games and one of the best games of all time! It is fantastic! Great graphics, perfect balance and really, really fun gameplay! It has a fun and long singleplayer campain which is rare today and an awesome multiplayer with almost no lags or errors, also the game is 99.99% free of bugs!. As as big fan of mythology, I naturally loved this game. It follows the basic Age of Empires gameplay pattern but spices it up by not just having swordsmen and catapults but also minotaurs and sphinxes, as well as a compliment of ""god powers"" which can do everything from increasing food production for a time to causing massive earthquakes. The story was pretty good for an RTS game, and I enjoyed the epic arc spanning multiple civilizations and heroes. I've played through this game several times already, and having been a couple year since the last time, I think I'm due for another play-thru soon!. Very simple and easy to understand. It's fun, and the best thing is that it's so varied in terms of the campaign's levels and maps. Greek, Egyptian and Norse each have three gods with different abilities. The gameplay is simple, fun and to add to the compelling story is the beautiful soundtrack. The levels have great variety and complement the story. It's not copy and pasting the same mission or objective over and over. I don't like the RTS genre but Age of Mythology couldn't be improved in any way or make the genre more appealing if it tried. There is a world creator which allows you to create your own levels and use all items and characters available. The skirmish mode is quick and easy to set up, and very fun to play regardless of your skill level and how you play the game. The campaign is by far the best part of this game though. Not only are the characters done well and the story being long, engaging and a varied adventure, but the level design, gameplay and of course, the excellent and fitting soundtrack come together to deliver one of the greatest gaming experiences- for 2002 anyway. I highly recommend this game even today, since graphics aren't that important in RTS, but Age of Mythology does have good lighting, but poor textures.. Amazing game for its time. Age of Mythology is easily my favorite RTS game of all time! Its so much fun, many hours have gone by because of this game and I'm happy with that. It passed the test of time and is still just as fun as it was to play 10 years ago. If your a coumpter gamer, or if you have a some what new pc (you should be able to play this game on any recent pc, not just gaming pc's), you should give this game a try, you could probly get it for real low cheap right now.. Age of Mythology is a great strategy game, but I didn't like the idea too much. Now, you are in a mythological era, really? The fact that It isn't a masterpiece is that It doesn't beat AOE series. However, It is fun, and classic. This game is made by Microsoft and Ensemble, they really did a great job. (8.1). This was my favorite game when i was kid and its still one of best games what i have. An all around great game. Really fun to play, if you enjoy RTS games you'll enjoy Age of Mythology. The game has everything an RTS should have and much more.. AMAZING! in every fooooken way. I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.I like this because it is good.. I could try to fault this game, but I can't. It's really well balanced, and thus playing it is probably the most fun I've ever had from an RTS. And then there's the sound track, which is also perfect.. This is a good solid strategy game, not as good as age of kings though. The one thing that ruined this game for me was the bastard priests who converted your units. It was rediculious, how the hell is a priest going to take over five mounted knights, i mean they really would just chop his **** head off. Worth playing. Watch out for the priests.. Another Great game by Microsoft. Its a very good RTS, but i felt it wasn't as good as AOE2. I don't Review games by comparing them to other games though, I rate them by how i felt it was and how much I enjoyed playing it. AOM has a great Campaign in it with interesting, unique levels in it that had not be seen by this time it was released. I have some trouble working the Multiplayer Stuff with it ,but other wise its a fantastic game. I would recommend getting it (but get AOE2 First : P ). Its been nearly 9 years since its release but this game never gets old. Compared to its age, graphics are awesome. Balance between civilizations and units is great. I dont think i will get bored from this game ever.. favorite game of all time, played the campaign multiple time, and LAN it with friends almost every weekend. the graphics still look amazing. 8 years later still the best looking RTS in my opinion. gameplay is perfectly balanced soundtrack is outstanding there is so much content in the game, it could last me forever. it is so good i have bought it 4 times and 3 times was for myself.. You know I was thinking about strategy games and asked which is my favorite of all time, guess what it is, Age of Mythology! It is just a great game with lots of FUN to be had. The coolest part of this game is that I can install it on a laptop and it will work great. If you have never had the opportunity to play this game you truly are missing out on one of the masterpieces of all time (in my opinion).","the difficulty in this game is insane, it's either a walk in the part level or absolutely insane on Titan difficulty . also on Titan difficulty the difference between the levels is more obvious than ever, they're either too easy or way too hard and you never know at the start of the level ."
